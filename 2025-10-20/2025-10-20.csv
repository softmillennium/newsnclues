            The Louvre museum in Paris announced it would remain closed Monday as investigations continue into Sunday's extraordinary theft of historic jewelry – and experts say the prospects of recovering the treasures are slim.
    


            In a post on X, the museum said it regretted Monday's closure, as France begins to digest the implications of the brazen heist in which robbers made off with artefacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era.
    


            The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window.
    


            Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases.
    


            The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said, with the suspects fleeing on motorcyles.
    


            Among the items taken from the Louvre was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.
    


            The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.
    


            Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.
    


            Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for.
    


            French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.
    


            “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn't been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”
    


            “The French people all feel like they've been robbed,” he added.
    


            Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World's Greatest Museum,” emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.
    


            “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.
    


            Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that she believes the jewelry has probably already been taken out of the country.
    


            “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “I think it's lost forever.”
    


            Goulet also appeared on BBC Radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”
    


            “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It's the easiest way to clean dirty money.”
    


            The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.
    


            “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don't appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”
    


Historic jewels stolen in ‘national disaster' for France: What we know about missing Louvre treasures



            Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.
    


            Sciolino, the author, was similarly downbeat.
    


            “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”
    


Jewelry heist at the Louvre is latest problem to beset France's most famous museum



            Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece's integrity.
    


            “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we're going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.
    


            The most well-known robbery at the Louvre took place in August 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa was stolen off the museum's walls by handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.
    


            It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned.
    


            A bungling police investigation then dragged on for two years before the painting was recovered in December 1913, making it the most famous artwork in the world.
    


            More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found.
    


            More recent heists at other European museums include the theft of four ancient gold artefacts from a museum in the Netherlands in January.
    


            Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.
    


Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that there was a theft from the Louvre in 1998.

            Precious artifacts snatched from Paris's Louvre Museum Sunday include an emerald necklace set among more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife and other treasures of “inestimable” value.
    


            The thieves targeted the Louvre's Apollo Gallery on the upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels. In the course of a brisk seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France's culture ministry. The thieves left on motorcycles, police said.



            One item, an ornate gold crown worn by Empress Eugénie, during her reign in the 1800s, was recovered near the scene, the ministry said.
    


            Art recovery expert Arthur Brand said the thieves stole important pieces of history in what was a “national disaster” for France.
    


            “These are the crown jewels from Napoleon, his wife and his successors. So these are the natural pride of France,” Brand told CNN. “It's a great loss.” Because the pieces are so recognizable, he said the thieves will likely dismantle them, sell the jewels and melt down the gold and silver.
    


            Here's what was stolen:
    


            This diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland; Marie-Amélie, Queen of the French; and Isabelle d'Orléans, Duchess of Guise is among the items snatched by four thieves during the 7-minute heist.



            The diadem — a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty — features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.
    


            The origins of the set are unknown, though some suggest it once belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette. While the jewelry bears no hallmarks of the most famous French jewelers of the era, it is indicative of the craftmanship of Parisian artisans of the early 19th century, the museum said. The set stayed with the Orléans family until 1985, when it was acquired by the Louvre.
    


            A wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, this ornate set was crafted by the jeweler François-Régnault Nitot includes 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.
    


            After Napoleon's empire collapsed, Marie-Louise bequeathed the original set, which also included a tiara, to a relative, and it was passed through generations of her descendants.
    


            In 1953, the set was sold to jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, after which the emeralds of the tiara were sold and later replaced with turquoise stones by an American collector. The altered tiara is now a part of the Smithsonian collection.
    


            The necklace and earrings, however, were preserved in their original form and sold to the Louvre in 2004 for a reported 3.7 million euros ($4.3 million).
    


            Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was the original owner of this diamond-encrusted brooch, which was crafted by Paul-Alfred Bapst in 1855 specially for her, according to the Louvre's website.
    


            A Spanish countess, Eugénie was Empress of the French from 1853-1870 and considered one of the most fashionable women of the time.
    


            A reliquary brooch is a brooch that holds a sacred relic, a symbol of Eugénie's Catholic faith. Comprised of 94 diamonds, the brooch includes the 17th and 18th Mazarin diamonds, which were given to King Louis XIV by former chief minister Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, according to the museum.
    


            These large stones mirror each other at the center of the brooch. Beautiful engravings of foliage and leaves decorate the back of the golden brooch, which was acquired by the Louvre in 1887.
    


            The silver, gold and diamond bow brooch originally formed the buckle of a diamond belt of 4,000 stones which was exhibited at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, before it was worn by Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre's website.
    


            Eugénie is said to have worn the belt, crafted by François Kramer, during a visit by Queen Victoria to the Palace of Versailles in August 1855, and again in June 1856 for the baptism of the Prince Imperial. Eugénie later decided to transform the belt into a brooch and had one of her own jewelers fashion it into a more elaborate standalone piece, adding cascading diamond tassels.
    


            In 1887, the brooch was purchased by jeweler Emile Schlesinger for New York socialite Caroline Astor at auction for 42,200 French francs, according to auction house Christie's.
    


            The brooch remained in the Astor family for more than a century until the Louvre bought it in 2008, returning the brooch to France. The museum paid 6.72 million euros (more than $10 million at the time) for the brooch, according to the Fondation Napoleon.



            The pearl diadem was made for Eugénie by jeweler Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier in 1853 and contains 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds, according to the Louvre.



            Thieves attempted to steal Empress Eugénie's crown, but it was found outside the Louvre, according to France's culture ministry,
    


            The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.

The record-breaking fish, caught by Krzysztof Pyra and Adrian Gontarz during a competition on Sunday, surpassed the previous world record of 285 cm, held by Italian angler Alessandro Biancardi.

The catch also establishes a new Polish record, with the previous national record measuring 261 cm.

 

According to Pyra, the struggle to reel in the massive catfish lasted over 90 minutes.

“When we finally saw it, we couldn't believe our eyes - a huge, enormous fish, a real monster,” he said. After measuring and photographing the fish, it was released back into the water.

The Rybnik reservoir is known for producing exceptionally large catfish due to warm water discharged from a nearby power plant. Pyra described the catch as proof that these creatures can reach truly extraordinary sizes.

People living in European NATO member states must brace themselves for a possible war with Russia, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) in an interview published on Sunday.

Jonson's remarks come as the EU accelerates a broad militarization drive. Brussels has cast Russia as an imminent threat, a narrative Moscow has dismissed as a political distraction from Europe's domestic crises.

“To preserve peace, we must prepare ourselves both mentally and militarily for the possibility of war,” the official said. “A change in mentality is necessary: We must switch to war mode to resolutely deter, defend, and preserve the peace.”

The push for greater defense spending aligns with calls from US President Donald Trump, who has demanded that European members buy more American weapons – including for Ukrainian use. Jonson justified such purchases, saying that Europe “simply doesn't have or cannot yet produce” the necessary systems. “Ukraine needs these assets fast,” he said. “If Europe lacks them, it's logical to procure them from the US.”

The European Commission last week unveiled a roadmap outlining its plans to expand joint arms procurement to at least 40% by 2027. The document emphasized the need to “invest more, invest together, and invest European,” citing global strategic shifts to other regions among “traditional allies.”

Moscow views the Ukraine conflict as a NATO proxy war aimed at undermining Russia's security following decades of expansion. Sweden is the bloc's newest member, while Ukraine was promised accession sometime in the future.

Rising German aviation taxes and fees will force national flag carrier Lufthansa to cut about 100 domestic flights from its forthcoming summer schedule, the company's chief executive, Carsten Spohr has said.

Government-imposed costs for airlines in Germany have roughly doubled over the past six years, he explained.

“Without a reduction in location costs, further cuts will be unavoidable,” Spohr said. “This involves around 100 domestic flights per week, which could be eliminated again next summer.”

Higher taxes and fees on economy ticket costs are accelerating a shift in the airline's passenger mix towards first, business, and premium economy cabins.

The complaints from Lufthansa echo long-standing grievances from airline executives about Germany's aviation cost base, which they argue hinders competitiveness.

Last month Lufthansa also announced plans to cut 4,000 administrative jobs by 2030, with the majority of the cuts taking place in Germany.

In the face of strikes, delayed aircraft deliveries, and underperformance at its mainline business, Lufthansa has been forced to slash its financial guidance twice in the last year and has missed medium-term margin targets set in 2021.

The German aviation industry association (BDL) has warned that the country's viability as a global hub is in crisis, citing state-imposed costs since 2019. Airlines are now avoiding Germany, BDL Chairman Jens Bischof stated in August, with the number of aircraft stationed in the country by European point-to-point carriers falling from 190 to 130.

BDL estimates that the financial burden on the industry will rise by €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) in 2025 to €4.4 billion, which will result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and €4 billion ($4.3 billion) in annual economic value.

The EU is doing everything in its power to undermine the upcoming summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. 

Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS on Monday that the bloc is carrying out “active subversive actions” ahead of the planned meeting in the Hungarian capital, Budapest.

Her comments followed a report by Spanish outlet El Pais, which said Brussels viewed the talks as “a political nightmare.” Citing diplomatic sources, the newspaper reported that the summit put the EU “in an awkward and unpleasant position” because Putin and Trump would discuss a potential settlement to the Ukraine conflict in an EU country without the bloc's participation.

Zakharova said the “aggressive Western European community” wants to “derail any peaceful aspirations” related to the conflict. “We are seeing statements, threats being made,” she added.

The Western Europeans are “obviously, doing everything to escalate the conflict” between Moscow and Kiev, the spokeswoman stressed. They have been acting this way since 2022 when they “thwarted” the peace talks between the sides in Istanbul, she added.

According to former Ukrainian head negotiator David Arakhamia, Ukraine withdrew from dialogue with Russia after then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Kiev and urged Vladimir Zelensky to keep fighting. The former UK prime minister has denied the claims.

Zakharova said sporadic statements about the need for peace coming from EU capitals and London are just “camouflage.”

“In reality, they are doing everything they can to achieve escalation. It is difficult to say if they actually understand what they are doing, given how many non-professionals there are at the helms of all these Western European countries,” she noted.

The announcement that Putin and Trump plan to meet in Budapest was made after the two leaders spoke by phone for nearly two and a half hours on Thursday.

According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the venue was proposed by Trump, with Putin “instantly supporting” the idea. The summit could take place within the next two weeks or slightly later, Peskov said.

BUDAPEST, October 20. /TASS/. The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian energy supplies by 2028 will deprive Hungary of almost all of the gas currently consumed by industry and households, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said at a meeting of the EU Energy Council, which was held in Luxembourg concurrently with the Foreign Affairs Council.

He noted that due to Ukraine's refusal to allow Russian gas transit to Europe, the only remaining pipeline supplying Hungary with fuel is TurkStream. This year, Hungary is expected to receive 8-8.5 billion cubic meters of gas through it and expects to receive a similar volume next year. ""The European Commission's proposal could make 8.5 billion cubic meters unavailable to us, while Hungary's total annual consumption is approximately 9 billion cubic meters,"" the Foreign Minister said, his remarks broadcast by M1 TV Channel.

Szijjarto warned that Brussels' initiative would deprive Hungary not only of gas but also of oil, which currently flows from Russia via the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline and from Croatian seaports via the Adriatic pipeline. If Druzhba is banned, Hungary will be dependent on a pipeline that, as tests have shown, is incapable of providing the necessary supply volumes, the minister said, referring to the Croatian route. He added that, since the outbreak of the Ukrainian conflict, the Adriatic pipeline operator has set transit tariffs five times higher than European standards.

Earlier on Monday, the EU Council approved the European Commission's proposal to ban Russian gas purchases from January 1, 2028.

""This decision includes a ban on the purchase of both pipeline and liquefied natural gas from Russia. It is to be implemented in stages, with the full ban coming into effect on January 1, 2028,"" the Council's statement says. To enter into force this decision must be approved by the European Parliament.

The document contains a provision prohibiting the conclusion of new contracts from January 1, 2026. ""Short-term contracts concluded before 17 June 2025 may continue until 17 June 2026, whereas long-term contracts may run until 1 January 2028,"" the document says.

The European Parliament is pushing for an even stricter ban, demanding a halt to all Russian gas supplies to EU countries from January 1, 2027.

Earlier, Hungary expressed its intention to seek an exemption from these requirements. The decision adopted by the EU Council stipulates that ""amendments to existing contracts will be permitted only for narrowly defined operational purposes and cannot lead to increased volumes, except for some specific flexibilities for landlocked member states affected by recent changes in supply routes.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LUGANSK, October 20. /TASS/. The Ukrainian armed forces lost 4,200 servicemen and foreign mercenaries in a week of fighting on the borders of the Lugansk People's Republic, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS.

Marochko added that, during this period, Russian forces destroyed four enemy tanks, 35 field artillery guns, 73 radio-electronic and counter-battery warfare stations, 104 munitions, fuel, and material depots, as well as nearly 400 enemy combat vehicles.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Image of hunting stand circulated by the Secret Service showed it was in a tree, near president's Mar-a-Lago estate

US politics live – latest updates

Federal agents are investigating after saying they found a hunting stand within sight of where Donald Trump typically exits Air Force One before a recent trip to West Palm Beach, Florida, by the president.

The US Secret Service said it made the discovery while conducting technological and physical security sweeps around the airport in West Palm Beach, where Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is, in advance of the president traveling there on Friday.

A statement to the news media from Anthony Guglielmi, the Secret Service spokesperson, said agents did not spot anyone near the hunting stand.

Kash Patel separately provided a statement reported by Fox News which described the hunting stand as being “elevated” and “within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone”. An image of it circulated by the Secret Service showed it was in a tree.

The Trump-appointed FBI director's statement added that his agency had “since taken the investigatory lead, flying in resources to collect all evidence from the scene and deploying our cell phone analytics capabilities”.

Guglielmi's statement said finding the hunting stand did not affect any of the president's movements. Nonetheless, in trying to determine more about it, the Secret Service was “working closely” with both the FBI and local law enforcement in the West Palm Beach area, Guglielmi's statement said.

Trump on Sunday was seen boarding Air Force One using the plane's small stairs because of what officials called “increased security measures” in the wake of the hunting stand.

The hunting stand in question was reported about a month after a state jury in Florida convicted Ryan Routh, 59, of trying to assassinate Trump on his West Palm Beach golf course two months before clinching his second presidency in the 2024 White House election.

A Secret Service agent spotted Routh with a rifle hiding in bushes as Trump's golfing party approached on 15 September 2024. The agent fired on Routh, who initially fled but was later captured driving north.

Meanwhile, on 13 July 2024, Trump narrowly survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In the earlier case, Thomas Crooks, 20, fired eight shots at Trump, with one bullet grazing his ear, officials have said. Officials said Crooks also killed one spectator while wounding two others before being shot to death by Secret Service counter-snipers.

The cases involving Routh and Crooks have often been mentioned alongside several other instances of political violence just before and during Trump's second presidency, which began in January.

The home of Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania Democratic governor, was firebombed in April, with the arsonist pleading guilty on 14 October. In June, related shootings killed Minnesota's former House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, while wounding John Hoffman – her fellow Democrat, a state senator – and his wife, Yvette.

And in September, conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was shot to death while speaking at Utah Valley University.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Guardian revealed how US veterans have been injured and arrested at protests against Ice deportations

Some of the most decorated military veterans in Congress say they are outraged after a report in the Guardian revealed US military veterans have been arrested or injured amid protests over Donald Trump's deportation campaign and his push to deploy the national guard to American cities.

“I went to war three times for this country to defend the right of Americans to say things I may not like,” said Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado and former army ranger who was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq as a platoon leader with the 82nd airborne division. “Now is the time for every American to speak out.”

Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois who received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was shot down over Iraq, said: “No one – especially those who have already sacrificed so much for this country – should ever be assaulted, detained or thrown in solitary confinement for peacefully protesting government overreach.”

The Guardian has identified eight instances in which military veterans have been prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents. Two of those individuals were arrested in late September protesting outside a Chicago-area Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility.

One, 70-year-old air force veteran Dana Briggs, was charged with assault after a video of an incident showed Ice agents advancing on the elderly veteran and knocking him over. The other, Afghanistan war veteran John Cerrone, was tackled by a group of Ice agents, another video shows. Cerrone was detained, held for nine hours in solitary confinement and charged with disorderly conduct.

The justice department says Briggs committed assault when he “made physical contact with an agent's arm while the agent attempted to extend the safety perimeter”. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said Cerrone had picked up a teargas canister fired by an Ice agent and thrown it back earlier in the day.

Duckworth countered that “the Trump administration's meritless claims justifying the need for such excessive force simply aren't supported by evidence, and even federal judges are recognizing they are not credible or ‘tethered to facts'.”

The Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee, said: “Any improper use of force by federal law enforcement against Americans, including service members and veterans, undermines our democracy and is a betrayal to our military families who sign up to risk life and limb to protect our nation.”

Republican lawmakers contacted by the Guardian declined to comment or did not respond to the Guardian's inquiries.

In Portland, video shows an agent grabbing Afghanistan war veteran Daryn Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, “You're not talking shit any more are you?” according to a Federal Tort Claims Act complaint filed by his attorney.

Herzberg, who has not been charged with a crime, was hospitalized and is seeking $150,000 in damages.

A DHS spokesperson said Herzberg, a former marine sergeant who was honorably discharged in 2012, “is well known for acts of violence outside the Ice facility” and had “used fake blood to falsify injuries”. His attorney denied the allegations.

Representative Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, said military veterans “are literally putting their lives on the line to protest”.

“We are seeing unjustifiable and excessive force at the Portland Ice facility,” said Dexter, a physician who practiced for eight years at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. She noted that on 4 October, an 84-year-old demonstrator sustained a concussion when she was rushed and knocked to the ground by federal agents during what the Oregonian newspaper described as a “peaceful protest”.

The woman's husband, also 84 and a Vietnam war veteran, was also pushed to the ground, the Oregonian reported. According to the newspaper, he was leaning on his walker and wearing his Vietnam veterans cap when federal officers pushed him.

“Free speech and peaceful protest are fundamental rights in America,” said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Few understand this better than the brave men and women who have given so much to defend these rights and freedoms for all of us. Trump's goal is to incite violence to further his authoritarian grip and quash our fundamental rights. We must all continue to speak out against his un-American power grab and stand up for one another.”

Dexter said she hoped the Trump administration would “lower the temperature” so that the issues that currently divide Americans can be debated without violence.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Bailout by Trump attempts to stabilize shaky economy under Javier Milei as he faces mounting midterms pressure

US politics live – latest updates

Argentina has formalized a currency swap agreement with the United States for up to $20bn aimed “at contributing to Argentina's economic stability”, the South American country's central bank said.

The deal is part of huge financial support from the administration of Donald Trump, a strong backer of the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, who is under pressure ahead of midterm elections on 26 October.

The peso has been fluctuating wildly ahead of the vote, disrupting the savings and spending plans of Argentinians who fear it could lose even more value in the coming weeks.

As well as the swap line, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, last week announced efforts to secure a separate $20bn facility from “private banks and sovereign wealth funds” to support Argentina's embattled economy.

Milei, once a global poster boy for budget-slashing libertarian politics, is heading into the polls diminished by his failure to stabilize the ailing peso, despite spending nearly all the Central Bank's dollar reserves to prop it up.

Inflation, which Milei had initially managed to stem after taking office in December 2023, has been rising again month-on-month.

Hosting Milei at the White House last week, Trump threatened Argentinian voters with withdrawing aid if his ally was defeated at the ballot box.

“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Hat Trick

This expression comes from cricket. When a bowler dismisses a batter, it's called “taking a wicket.” Taking three wickets in a row is a great achievement, so in the past, a bowler who achieved this was rewarded with a hat. Later, sports like hockey and soccer adopted it to mean scoring three goals in a game. Nowadays, this phrase means to achieve any three successes consecutively, not just in sports. For example,                                    



                                                                                A:  Is K-pop still popular now?
B:  Sure! The 110,000 tickets for supergroup Blackpink's two shows to be held this weekend were all snatched up within three minutes.
A:  Apart from Blackpink, what other K-pop stars are visiting?
B:  I-dle's Taiwanese member Yeh Shu-hua, King of K-pop G-Dragon, and Super Junior are all coming soon next month.
A:  Super Junior's 2009 hit “Sorry, Sorry” boosted this Korean “Hallyu” to a peak. Let's go experience SJ's magic again.
A:  韓國流行音樂還是很受歡迎嗎？   
B:  當然啦，光是天團Blackpink本週末兩場演唱會，11萬張門票3分鐘內就被秒殺！ 
A:  除了Blackpink，還有哪些韓國歌手最近會來台？   
B:  I-dle的台灣成員葉舒華、韓流天王G-Dragon權志龍、Super Junior下月也都將來台。
A:  Super Junior 2009年金曲《Sorry, Sorry》曾將「韓流」推上高峰，我們再去重溫一下SJ的魔力吧。                                     



                                                                                In today's fast-paced world, many individuals are turning to alternative lifestyles that prioritize sustainability and simplicity. Two such lifestyles are sustainable living and minimalism. They both share some common threads: living more intentionally, reducing our environmental impact, and focusing on what truly matters.
1. Sustainable Living
Sustainable living is about making choices that are environmentally friendly in every aspect of one's life. The primary goal is to minimize one's ecological footprint, conserve natural resources, and reduce waste. It might sound abstract, but in fact, it is rather easy to practice sustainable living.

Editor's note: This item has been updated with additional comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump onboard Air Force One late on Oct. 19.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""won certain property"" during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and should be expected to take Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired Oct. 19. 

The interview was taped a few days earlier, directly following his phone conversation with Putin on Oct. 16. The call came ahead of Trump's White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — talks that ended in disappointment for the Ukrainian delegation, with no promise of Tomahawk missiles. 

Prior to the call with Putin, Trump had taken a harsher tone with Russia in public comments. But in comments to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, who asked whether Putin would accept a peace deal without territorial concessions, Trump was cavalier about the loss of Ukrainian lands.

""Well, he's going to take something,"" Trump said. ""I mean, they fought and uh, he has a lot of property. I mean, you know, he's won certain property, if you say that, he's won certain property."" 

Trump made no mention of Ukraine's sovereignty or international law, taking it as a given that an invading force has a right to ""property"" it seizes through strength of arms. 

""We're the only nation that goes in and wins a war and then leaves,"" he said. ""You know like we did under President Bush in the Middle East. We go in, we blast the hell out of everybody, destroy the place, and then we leave. ... You know, it doesn't make sense. Never made sense.""

Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump echoed these sentiments on social media, writing that Ukraine and Russia should make a peace deal ""with property lines being defined by war and guts."" 

In an interview with NBC after his talks with Trump, Zelensky said he took this to mean Ukraine and Russia could freeze the war along the current line of contact, but that Kyiv is not interesting in surrendering ""additional"" territory to Putin. 

""We will give nothing to the aggressor,"" Zelensky later said in his nightly address on Oct. 19.

Russia, however, is reportedly seeking full control of Donetsk Oblast as part of a deal to end the war. 

Putin told Trump he was willing to give up parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for the entirety of Donetsk, the Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials.

The Financial Times (FT) later reported that Trump pushed Zelensky to accept these terms during their meeting. 

In a conversation that at times turned into a shouting match, Trump told Zelensky that Russia was winning the war and would destroy Ukraine if Kyiv didn't make a deal, a European official with knowledge of the meeting told FT. 

""If (Putin) wants it, he will destroy you,"" Trump reportedly told Zelensky. 

The U.S. president parroted a number of Kremlin propaganda points during the meeting, the European official claimed. Trump said Putin told him that the invasion of Ukraine was a ""special operation, not even a war."" Trump also said the Russian economy is ""doing great."" 

According to the official, Trump also grew frustrated with Ukraine's battlefield map and tossed it aside, saying he was ""sick"" of seeing these maps. 

""This red line, I don't even know where this is. I've never been there,"" Trump allegedly said. 

Reuters reported later on Oct. 19, citing its sources, that Trump suggested providing security guarantees to both warring parties, leaving the Ukrainian delegation taken aback.

Later in the evening on Oct. 20 while answering reporter questions on Air Force One, Trump denied telling Zelensky Ukraine would need to cede the Donbas in order to secure a ceasefire.

""We never discussed that. We think that what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are, the battle line... the rest is very tough to negotiate,"" Trump said.

""I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is. They can negotiate something down the line,"" Trump added.

Putin's latest proposal marks a shift from his earlier position in April, when he insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

While a small concession, it would require Ukraine to hand over territory that Russia has failed to seize after years of fighting despite significant advantages in manpower and military equipment. 

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 19 that Ukraine should not be pressured to give up its territory. 

""None of us should put pressure on Zelensky when it comes to territorial concessions,"" Tusk wrote on X. 

""We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.""

Russia's Orenburg gas processing plant was forced to halt gas intake from Kazakhstan on Oct. 19 following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry announced.

The plant, which is located in the southwestern Orenburg Oblast and is the largest of its kind in the world, was targeted in a drone strike, Ukraine's military said earlier in the day. 

Regional Governor Yevgeny Solntsev reported that a fire had broken out within a workshop of the plant, causing damage to the Gazprom-owned facility. The plant has the capacity to process upwards of 45 billion cubic metres of gas per year.

The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials.

No timeline was provided for a resumption of the plant's operations immediately following the attack.

The news comes as Kyiv continues to escalate its campaign against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

While Ukraine's military has previously target energy facilities in Orenburg Oblast — including earlier this month when it attacked the Orsknefteorgsintez oil refinery in the region — the strikes on the gas plant appear to mark the first time that the facility was targeted.

As Ukraine intensifies attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, the Russian economy has continued to suffer. Earlier this month, Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service was asked to impose maximum prices at gas stations as fuel shortages worsen across the country.

Russian oil product exports dropped by 17.1% in September compared to August, totaling 7.58 million tons, due to ongoing Ukrainian drone attacks, according to Reuters.

Russia regularly targets Ukrainian gas infrastructure and has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian cities ahead of the anticipated harsh winter.

Dodge Chargers are parked at a finished vehicle storage facility used by Stellantis in Windsor, Ont., in Oct., 2025.Dax Melmer/The Globe and Mail

On Wednesday, laid-off employees at the Stellantis plant in Brampton, Ont., received a robocall delivering bad news: they had no jobs to go back to. 

It was another stall on the road for Canada's automotive strategy, which has seen federal and provincial governments dole out mounds of cash and add regulations and protective tariffs in a floundering attempt to create more jobs and build a state-of-the-art electric vehicle industry. 

Stellantis workers weren't alone in being caught off guard that their jobs were moving to the U.S. Ottawa and Ontario were also surprised. The governments had boasted about funding Stellantis's plant upgrades, and the company had promised to produce “the electric vehicles of the future” at the Brampton factory once it finished retooling for both gas and electric Jeep Compass vehicles. 

The federal and provincial governments had also committed up to $15-billion in funding, in part contingent on production, for Stellantis's NextStar EV battery plant, a partnership with LG Energy Solutions in Windsor, Ont. Industry Minister Mélanie Joly says the agreement with Stellantis requires the company to maintain its existing Canadian footprint. 

The federal government is now threatening to sue Stellantis. The auto manufacturer says it is looking into producing a different model in Brampton, but it has given few details. 

Gary Mason: The electric vehicle industry in Canada is losing power. It's time to recharge it.

Opinion: Canada's electric vehicle strategy has failed, and there are lessons to learn

Donald Trump's automotive tariffs and his cuts to EV subsidies have created massive disruption within the sector. But the truth is, Canada's EV strategy never made much sense. 

The idea of building EVs here using Canadian minerals, creating high quality jobs and reducing emissions was appealing. Unfortunately, it was a fantasy. The attempt to create the illusion of a growing industry has required constant consumer and business subsidies, barriers to selling gas-powered vehicles, and tariffs to keep out cheap Chinese competition. 

Like a multivehicle collision, the failures in Canada's EV industry are piling up. Ottawa and Quebec pledged $2.7-billion to Swedish EV battery manufacturer Northvolt before it went bankrupt. Quebec has said its portion of the investment has been “lost.” 

Last week also brought news that the planned expansion of Ultium CAM, a plant in Bécancour, Que., that produces materials for EV batteries, wouldn't move forward. As a result, plans from Vale SA to create a nearby nickel sulphate plant were scrapped. Ottawa and Quebec had promised $300-million to support the first phase of Ultium CAM, a joint project of General Motors and South Korea's POSCO Future M.

Even if everything in Canada's EV strategy had gone according to plan, it was a costly bet. In 2022, the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that the $28.2-billion in federal and Ontario government subsidies for two electric vehicle battery plants would take 20 years to break even, rather than the five years the Liberal government had suggested.

These projects in most cases leave the intellectual property and the most valuable technical knowledge in foreign hands. Lower level jobs aren't guaranteed to Canadians either. At NextStar, union leaders reported that workers from South Korea, including electrical installers and forklift drivers, were brought in to set up the plant. 

Consumers only seem interested in buying EVs when they can get heavy subsidies. With EVs only making up around eight per cent of new sales, Prime Minister Mark Carney was forced to suspend this year's minimum sales requirement for electric vehicles. The entire policy is under review. 

Instead of doubling down on former prime minister Justin Trudeau's dubious industrial strategy, Mr. Carney and the premiers should focus on creating a more hospitable business environment.

Canada can lead EV supply chain despite trade war and murky policies, industry players say

Businesses in Canada face a heavy regulatory burden, and protectionist barriers dampen competition, stifling innovation and driving up consumer costs. Restructuring the economy so companies aren't relying on handouts and are instead forced to innovate and become more efficient is better for the economy, and cheaper for taxpayers. 

If the goal is to reduce carbon emissions, the federal government can repeal the ban on Chinese EVs, which would be more widely adopted as they sell for as little as $14,000.

Mr. Carney recently spoke to business leaders about the importance of having a competitive corporate tax system. He has an opportunity to act in the upcoming federal budget. It would make more sense than throwing even more money at Canada's stalled EV strategy.

Some Canadians will return to the U.S. this winter, but many clients who don't have U.S. property are considering other destinations such as Mexico, Costa Rica and Southern Europe.JimVallee/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Travel by Canadians to the United States has declined compared with last year, and some snowbirds are considering alternative destinations or shorter stays – particularly if they don't own U.S. property. 

But wherever snowbirds choose to escape the Canadian winter, they need to be aware of the tax and immigration rules. 

Many Canadian advisors are most familiar with U.S. legislation, which uses the “substantial presence” test to determine whether a Canadian snowbird is considered a U.S. tax resident and required to declare – and potentially pay taxes on – worldwide income in a U.S. tax return. 

The substantial presence test is met if a person has spent 31 days or more in the U.S. in the current year and 183 days or more in the past three years using the following calculation: (1 x days in U.S. in current year) + (1/3 x days in U.S. one year earlier) + (1/6 x days in U.S. two years earlier). Even partial days spent in the U.S. count toward this total.

A snowbird who meets the substantial presence test may file Form 8840 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to request an exception by demonstrating they have a closer connection to Canada and should not be considered a U.S. tax resident. Without this exception, they must report worldwide income to the IRS. However, under the Canada–U.S. Tax Treaty, they may claim foreign tax credits in Canada for U.S. taxes paid. 

Carson Hamill, associate portfolio manager with Snowbirds Wealth Management at Raymond James Ltd. in Coquitlam, B.C., says snowbirds should keep detailed logs of all their U.S. visits. 

He also notes that some states have their own taxes, so it's essential to check the rules for a client's specific destination.

A snowbird who owns a vacation home in the U.S. may be tempted to rent out the property. However, that will result in U.S.-sourced income and make it necessary to consider the IRS's income withholding rules, Mr. Hamill says.

Form W-8 BEN identifies a snowbird's “foreign status” and has the potential to reduce income withheld to rates set in the Canada–U.S. Tax Treaty. Without it, a default 30 per cent withholding rate applies to U.S.-sourced fixed, determinable, annual or periodic income, including rental income. The treaty may reduce that rate to zero if the snowbird reports the rental income on a U.S. tax return. 

Note that rental income may be taxed differently if it is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business, a claim made on Form W-8 ECI. In that case, rental income on a U.S. property will be taxed at graduated rates rather than a fixed 30 per cent when the snowbird files a U.S. tax return. 

To reconcile withheld taxes, Mr. Hamill says non-residents with U.S. income may file Form 1040-NR, while those who are considered U.S. tax residents may file Form 1040.

Mr. Hamill says several clients are thinking twice about spending their winters in the U.S. 

“Interest is growing in other warm locations, such as the Caribbean, Mexico [Cabo, especially], and Southern Europe,” he says. “Some snowbirds are also shortening their stays in the U.S. or splitting time between multiple destinations.” 

The Bahamas and Cayman Islands are popular for Canadian snowbirds looking to buy property abroad because they're “tax-free destinations,” says Michael Pereira, partner, cross-border tax, KPMG LLP and KPMG Family Office. That said, like other countries, those destinations have immigration laws that may restrict the length of stay. 

“Europe tends to be a bit more complex, both from an income tax perspective and an immigration perspective,” Mr. Pereira says. “I wouldn't say there's one particular country that necessarily allows easy entry and easy ownership of property, [and] different countries have different rules about ownership of real estate by non-residents.” 

Anna Golan-Reznick, certified financial planner with Objective Financial Partners Inc. in London, Ont., says snowbirds who own a vacation home in the U.S. are generally taking a “wait-and-see approach” and haven't yet changed their plans. 

On the other hand, she says, some clients who don't have U.S. property are considering other winter destinations, such as Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Spain and Portugal. 

“It's not only political instability,” she says, pointing to the weak Canadian dollar as another factor. Snowbirds are “trying to see where they can get better value.” 

Ms. Golan-Reznick says snowbirds should seek tailored advice to avoid accidentally becoming a tax resident of any country they're visiting.

Even though she works regularly with Canadians moving abroad and moving back home, she draws on the expertise of specialists, including cross-border tax accountants with a deep understanding of the rules, who can interpret tax treaties in the context of a particular client's situation.

The outage affected major websites and apps, such as Duolingo and Snapchat, which suffered connectivity issues after Amazon cloud services unit AWS went down. The company later said it had mostly restored service.

Amazon's cloud services unit, AWS, which provides computing power, data storage and other digital services to companies, governments and individuals, experienced an outage Monday.

The disruption caused widespread connectivity issues for major online companies around the world.

According to the internet services monitoring platform Downdetector, Amazon's own shopping website, Prime Video and Alexa all faced problems.

AWS identified the issue as a problem with a regional gateway on the US East Coast.

Hours later, it said ""underlying DNS issue has been fully mitigated,"" and added most service operations were ""succeeding normally now.""

The AWS outage was the most significant internet disruption since last year's CrowdStrike failure, which crippled tech systems in hospitals, banks and airports worldwide.

Websites and apps affected on Monday included Perplexity, Fortnite, Alexa, Snapchat, and Duolingo.

Various video streaming platforms, such as Hulu and Disney+, and the messaging app Signal were also impacted.

In Europe, several major mobile phone operators, some UK banks, WhatsApp and Tinder were affected, according to Downdetector.

The US president has accused his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro of condoning the production of drugs headed for the US. Colombia, meanwhile, has said the US violated its sovereignty and killed a fisherman.

The United States will slash funding to Colombia because the South American country's leader ""does nothing to stop"" drug production, US President Donald Trump said Sunday.

""The purpose of this drug production is the sale of massive amounts of product into the United States, causing death, destruction, and havoc,"" he said on his Truth Social platform.

He said Colombian President Gustavo Petro ""better close up"" drug operations ""or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.""

Trump called Petro an ""illegal drug leader"" on Sunday and said payments to the South American nation would cease, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said US forces had attacked a vessel associated with a Colombian rebel group.

Relations between Bogota and Washington have frayed over the last few months. In September, Trump accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war.

Then the US State Department revoked Petro's visa during his UN visit after he joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York and urged US soldiers to disobey Trump's orders.

Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, said on X on Sunday that Trump will announce ""major tariffs against the country of Colombia.""

Trump later confirmed the news while speaking to reporters, saying he will announce new tariffs on the Latin American country on Monday.

In a statement late Saturday, Petro had accused the United States of violating his nation's sovereignty and killing a fisherman.

That came after Trump had said US forces had carried out another strike as part of his controversial military clamp down against ""narcoterrorists.""

""US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,"" Colombian leader Gustavo Petro said on Saturday in a statement on X.

Petro identified the fisherman as Alejandro Carranza, adding that he had ""no ties to the drug trade"".

Carranza reportedly died in a September strike by US forces on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean, as per a video testimony of his family members, which was shared by Petro on X.

The president said that the Colombian's boat was ""adrift"" and had its distress signal up because of an engine failure.

""We await explanations from the US government,"" Petro added.

Colombia's allegations came shortly after Trump confirmed a US strike in the Caribbean on Thursday on what he called ""a drug-carrying submarine.""

""It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route."" the US president said on Truth Social on Saturday.

Trump gave no evidence for the claim, only sharing a short video clip which appeared to show a semi-submersible vessel in the water before being struck by at least one projectile.

Trump said US intelligence confirmed that the vessel was ""loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics.""

Four people were on board the vessel, two of whom died in the targeted strike.

The US military conducted a helicopter rescue of the two survivors.

The individuals, who were the first to survive such US attacks, were taken into custody.

On Saturday, Trump said the two were being repatriated to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia.

Petro confirmed that the Colombian suspect had returned and would face prosecution.

""We have received the Colombian detained on the narco submarine, we are happy he is alive and he will be processed according to the law,"" the Colombian president said in a post on X.

The strike on Thursday is reported to be the sixth US attack on ""narco"" boats off the coast of Venezuela this year.

The Trump administration says that 27 people have been killed in the strikes.

The US action has triggered concern among experts over the legality of such extrajudicial killings.

A deadly flare-up in Gaza on Sunday tested the fragile ceasefire, but both Israel and Hamas say they're still committed to it.

Here are the developments from Israel, Gaza and the Middle East on Monday, October 20:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now met with top US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner after weekend violence threatened to derail a fragile US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu met earlier today with special envoy Steve Witkoff and [US] President [Donald] Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner on the developments and updates in the region,"" Netanyahu's spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told journalists.

She added that US Vice President JD Vance and his wife were expected to visit Israel ""for a few days and will be meeting with the prime minister.""

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has dismissed US President Donald Trump's claim that American and Israeli airstrikes in June destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities, saying Trump is ""dreaming.""

""The US president proudly says they bombed and destroyed Iran's nuclear industry. Very well, keep dreaming!"" Khamenei was reported as saying by Iranian state media. ""What does it have to do with America whether Iran has nuclear facilities or not? These interventions are inappropriate, wrong and coercive.""

Khamenei also rejected Trump's renewed call for negotiations, saying: ""Trump says he is a dealmaker, but if a deal is accompanied by coercion and its outcome is predetermined, it is not a deal but rather an imposition and bullying.""

Tehran and Washington had held five rounds of indirect nuclear talks earlier this year through Oman, which broke off after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran on June 13, triggering a 12-day war. The US later joined those strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz.

While Trump told Israel's parliament last week that the facilities had been ""annihilated,"" the extent of the damage remains unclear.

The armed wing of Hamas has said it will imminently return the body of an Israeli hostage recovered a day earlier as part of its ceasefire agreement with Israel.

The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said it ""will hand over the body of an Israeli prisoner, which was exhumed yesterday in the Gaza Strip, at 8 pm Gaza time [1700 UTC]"" on Monday.

If completed, the transfer will mark the 13th deceased hostage returned by Hamas since the ceasefire began on October 10.

US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser son-in-law Jared Kushner arrived in Israel to try to push forward the truce in Gaza, a US embassy spokesperson said.

Ahead of his visit, Kushner spoke to CBS news. 

""The biggest message that we've tried to convey to the Israeli leadership now is that now that the war is over, if you want to integrate Israel with the broader Middle East, you have to find a way to help the Palestinian people thrive and do better,"" Kushner said in an interview that aired on Sunday.

He added they were looking for ""joint security and economic opportunity"" to guarantee that Israelis and Palestinians ""can live peacefully side by side in a durable way.""

US Vice President JD Vance is to visit Israel this week.

German public broadcaster ZDF said an employee of a production company it was working with was killed in a rocket attack on Sunday.

The 37-year-old engineer, as well as the eight-year-old son of another employee, were killed when the office of Palestine Media Production in southern Gaza was struck.

A third staff member was injured, and several vehicles, including a transmission van, were destroyed.

""Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, to whom we express our deepest condolences. It is unacceptable that media professionals are attacked while carrying out their work,"" ZDF Editor-in-Chief Bettina Schausten said.

The Israeli military says it is reviewing the incident.

A police ban on the Israeli Premier League's Tel Aviv football derby triggered anger from teams and political critics.

Sunday's football match between Hapoel Tel Aviv and Maccabi Tel Aviv was canceled due to ""public disorder and violent riots,"" Israel Police said.

Hapoel, however, blamed the chaos on law enforcement.

""From the preliminary discussions before the game, it seemed that the police were preparing for a war rather than a sports event,"" the club said in a statement published on social media.

""Everyone saw the harsh videos, children trampled by horses, police officers beating fans indiscriminately,"" it added.

Opposition leader Yair Lapid also seized on the incident to criticize Israel's far-right interior minister.

""To the endless list of failures of the incompetent minister Itamar Ben Gvir, tonight was added the inability to facilitate a soccer game in the State of Israel,"" Lapid posted on social media.

Maccabi Tel Aviv was less outspoken. The club's supporters were already barred from a Europa League match against Aston Villa next month in the United Kingdom after British police expressed concerns about potential protests outside the stadium.

The UK government is trying to reverse the ban, which has been criticized by Israeli ministers, the UEFA football governing body and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

US President Donald Trump said the ceasefire was still in effect after Israel launched deadly airstrikes and halted all aid to Gaza on Sunday, claiming its troops came under fire from Hamas.

""Yeah, it is,"" Trump told reporters when asked if the truce was holding.

Two Israeli soldiers were killed and dozens of Palestinians died as both sides blamed the other for violating the ceasefire.

Trump said Hamas leadership may not be involved in the violations. 

""We think maybe the leadership isn't involved in that,"" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.

""Either way ... it's going to be handled toughly but properly.""

Trump was unsure if the Israeli strikes were justified. He said, ""I'd have to get back to you on that.""

Vice President JD Vance said Sunday he may visit Israel soon, adding the administration wants to ""check on how things are going."" On the ceasefire, he noted there will be ""fits and starts.""

Humanitarian aid to Gaza was set to resume Monday, Israeli security sources told news outlets, without providing further details. Lack of access to proper nutrition and medicine has exacerbated the death toll in Gaza, which according to the Gaza Health Ministry is at least 70,000, most of them civilians.

Israel halted aid to the Palestinian territory on Sunday after accusing Hamas of violating the truce by firing on its soldiers.

It was unclear whether the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen.

Israel said last week that the crossing's reopening would depend on Hamas fulfilling its obligations under the ceasefire.

Israel says Hamas is delaying the return of hostage bodies. Hamas has released all 20 living captives and 12 of the 28 deceased. US President Trump has said that he believes Hamas is acting in good faith to try and locate the bodies of the deceased hostages.

The militant group said it needs time and technical assistance to recover the remaining bodies from beneath Gaza's rubble.

There's international pressure on both Israel and Hamas to stick to the ceasefire in Gaza, despite deadly clashes on Sunday.

The Israeli military said it hit Hamas targets across the territory after militants fired an anti-tank missile at its troops, killing two soldiers.

Local residents and health officials said at least 26 Palestinians were killed in the strikes. 

Still, both sides say they remain committed to the truce, which aims to end more than two years of war.

US President Donald Trump said the ceasefire was holding and added: ""We want to make sure it's going to be very peaceful.""","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Protesters across southern Wisconsin called out Trump's abuses, and vowed to defend democracy and human rights.

This past weekend, several large U.S. cities were the site of a second round of “No Kings” protests, held to express opposition to President Donald Trump over myriad issues — particularly his unilateral, autocratic approach to governance. While these cities had huge turnouts, protests in smaller localities had proportionally large crowds of their own, showcasing that the movement against Trump's authoritarianism is indeed growing, including in areas of the country where Trump had strong showings of support in the last presidential election. 

Over 2,600 No Kings protests, estimated to involve over 7 million people, took place in the U.S. on Saturday, including around 60 events in Wisconsin alone. Truthout Trending News Writer Chris Walker attended four such events in the southern part of the Badger State on Saturday, where he spoke with demonstrators about why they participated in the protests. Participants' last names have been retracted to preserve their anonymity. 

Thousands of demonstrators took part in No Kings rallies across communities in southern Wisconsin on Saturday, expressing opposition to the Trump administration and determination to build community in the face of growing authoritarianism.

In Monona, a suburban city of around 9,000 residents just outside the capital city of Madison, around 400 people lined one of the busiest corners of the main street of the city. Protesters held signs in opposition to President Donald Trump, took part in cross-street chanting, and encouraged vehicles to honk their car horns in support — which dozens of cars did. 

While some members of the administration and other allies of the president have tried to suggest these protests are unpatriotic, the residents here would largely disagree with that charge. Monona hosts the largest (and longest-running) annual Memorial Day parade in the entire state of Wisconsin, and its Fourth of July Festival regularly draws in crowds more than five times its population size every year.

The street corner where Saturday's demonstration took place has also been the site of a protest against the Trump administration every Tuesday for most of his second term so far. 

“One thing I hate is bullies,” said Brent, a regular at the weekly protests who was also in Monona for its No Kings protest over the weekend. “The Trump regime, they're the worst of the worst.” 

“I'm here to counteract that [bullying from Trump],” he added, “and try to bring joy to other people and get them involved.”

About a 30-minute drive south of Monona, in Stoughton, a crowd of around 500 protesters marched up and down both sides of its main street. Although the protest disrupted traffic, most who were held up by their march honked their car horns in support and gave thumbs-ups as they drove past.

Barbara, a participant in Stoughton's No Kings protest, indicated that she felt Trump was “a big, big mistake for our country,” and that it was important “to stand up for what we believe in.”

Specifically, Barbara indicated she opposed Trump's anti-immigration policies.

“I don't like the idea that he's sending ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in and taking people without any warrant, they don't get any trial or have lawyers or anything,” she said.

Craig and Laura, a married couple who had traveled to a No Kings protest in Delavan, also expressed frustration with the president's refusal to abide by constitutional norms.

Around 1,500 participants took part in this small city's No Kings protest. Located in Walworth County in the southeastern corner of the state, it is perhaps an unlikely spot for a demonstration against Trump — the county voted with 60.5 percent support for Trump in the 2024 presidential election (more than 10 points higher than the rate the president won across the state overall). Delavan is also the hometown of far right former Gov. Scott Walker.

Despite this, participants expressed outrage with the current administration's actions, especially its refusal to follow checks and balances.

“The Constitution is not being abided by. He thinks he's above it,” Laura said about Trump. “I just kind of see him as being a fake and a con.”

Craig also derided Trump's “vision” for the country, saying that he believes deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller's intended “direction” for the administration is “not best for this nation.” 

But Craig also said it was “great” to see hundreds of people from a traditionally Republican area coming out to express opposition to the president.

“I guarantee you, there are people in this group that are Republicans that have said, ‘enough is enough,'” he added.

Laura also noticed that, since the first No Kings protest they had attended in June, participation seems to have gone up. “You can see the numbers increasing,” she said, with her husband nodding in agreement. 

Later on Saturday, a much larger protest took place in Madison, the state's capital and its second-largest city. Demonstrators held signs in support of LGBTQ rights, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in the face of Israel's genocide, and affirming the right of immigrants to live in the U.S. and be afforded due process.

Speakers at the event condemned the Trump administration's attacks on the media and free press, and encouraged attendees not to give in to the temptation of complacency.

John Nichols, executive editor of The Nation, called on news media to stand steadfast against Trump, and to continue reporting the truth rather than cower to the White House's demands to be more “balanced.”

“Some media outlets have decided to go soft, and not tell the story of what's happening in America,” Nichols said. “Brothers and sisters, there are others that will keep telling the story, because we know this: Donald Trump doesn't want the full report of what is happening in America today, to the American people, because if it happened, the American people would know that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have gathered to say today, ‘No Crowns, No Kings!'” 

Rowan Attala, co-host of a local radio program called Salamat, also spoke at the rally, decrying the administration's attacks on free speech.

“We need to speak out loudest when our constitutional right to free speech is under threat. Especially when, after two years of constantly protesting and speaking up, we have what, quite honestly, may only be a lull in a genocide paid for with your tax dollars,” Attala said, referring to Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.

Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell — who recognized that his presence at the rally may get him “in trouble on Monday” — said it was important for him to be there.

The current administration's methods are overwhelming, Mitchell noted, stating that “the anxiety being built after every five-minute news cycle or tweet and breaking headline changing from one controversial and consequential issue to the next is leaving the most passionate advocate grasping for breath, with little or no time to organize.”

“I'm witnessing immigrant families living in the shadows of a nation built upon the DNA of the enslaved, the blood of the Indigenous, the sweat of the Asian community, the hands of the immigrants and the whip of injustice,” he continued.

Mitchell also warned against people sitting back or taking a break in this moment:

The temptation in this moment is to sit idle, staring at the television and scrolling on your phone, tapping at the screen, just hoping that if we keep our heads underwater long enough, the shadow will pass and normal will return to our shores. But let me be the bearer of bad news: Whatever normal was, is or could be, is not returning to us. We are not going back. The only way is for us to go forward.

At each of these protests, participants expressed a desire to build community and to organize, showcasing that those in attendance, whether at large or small No Kings gatherings, were ready to heed Mitchell's advice to “go forward.”

There may be a reason for their cautious optimism. Studies have demonstrated that, even when a small portion of people participate in protests, they are often successful at bringing about positive social change. One examination of nonviolent social movements has found that, when at least 3.5 percent of the population takes part in protests, serious political change typically results.

The cities listed above not only reached that threshold but likely exceeded them. Monona, for example, has a population of around 8,616 people — with 400 people taking part, that is equal to around 4.6 percent. Stoughton, with a population of 13,134, saw around 3.8 percent participation with its 500 participants involved. And in Madison, which has around 285,000 residents, the 15,000 or so who took part in its second No Kings protest is equal to about 5.2 percent of its population. 



Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Defense Secretary Hegseth also defended a bombing of another boat without providing evidence that it was moving drugs.

The United States carried out another deadly attack on a boat it claimed was being used by a left-wing Colombian revolutionary group to transport drugs in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump alleged without evidence that Columbia's president “is an illegal drug dealer.”

Hegseth said the strike, which took place on Friday, targeted “a vessel affiliated with Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), a designated terrorist organization.”

The ELN is Colombia's last-standing far-left guerrilla group. Founded in 1964, the group fought to liberate Colombia from longtime right-wing rule, end foreign influence — especially from the United States — and achieve social justice and equality for the poor. ELN has been accused of using proceeds from drug trafficking to fund its insurgency.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics,” Hegseth said without offering evidence. “There were three male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel during the strike — which was conducted in international waters. All three terrorists were killed and no US forces were harmed in this strike.”

“These cartels are the al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security, and poison our people,” the defense secretary added. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are — they will be hunted, and killed, just like al-Qaeda.”

On October 17th, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), a Designated Terrorist Organization, that was operating in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility.The… pic.twitter.com/1v7oR879LC

Hegseth's announcement followed a post by Trump on his Truth Social network calling leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro “an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs.”

Trump offered no evidence to back his baseless claim. The US itself has a long history of involvement in the international drug trade, from American capitalists profiting immensely from opium trafficking in the 19th century to the Central Intelligence Agency working with narcotrafficking anti-communist groups in Southeast Asia and Central America during the Cold War, helping to fuel first the heroin and later crack cocaine epidemics in the United States.

The US president further alleged that drugs have “become the biggest business in Colombia, by far, and Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long-term rip off of America.”

Trump added:

AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA. The purpose of this drug production is the sale of massive amounts of product into the United States, causing death, destruction, and havoc. Petro, a low-rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.

According to The Associated Press, Colombia received an estimated $230 million in US aid for the budget year that ended on September 30.

Trump has ordered attacks on at least seven alleged drug-running boats without providing concrete evidence to support his claims. At least 29 people have been killed in the attacks.

In a series of posts on the social media site X, Petro said that “US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” repeating claims that some victims of the US strikes, including Thursday's, were fishermen.

La lancha del pescador de Santa Marta no era del ELN,  era de una familia humilde, amante del mar y de ahí extraía sus alimentos.Qué le dice usted a esa familia, explíqueme porque usted ayudó a asesinar un humilde pescador de Santa Marta, la tierra donde murió Bolívar, y de la… https://t.co/Dd9D1aEqGK

“I respect the history, culture, and people of the USA,” Petro wrote in a subsequent post. “They are not my enemies, nor do I feel them as such. The problem is with Trump, not with the USA.”

Refuting Trump's accusation that he has “done nothing to stop” drug trafficking, Petro noted that “we have reduced the coca leaf crop growth rate to almost 0%. In past governments, there were years with nearly 100% annual growth. Today, half of the total coca leaf crop area has crops that have been abandoned for three years.”

The Trump administration said Thursday that survivors of one recent strike, a Colombian and an Ecuadorean, would be repatriated to their respective countries, possibly as a way to skirt concerns over the legality of the attacks.

On Thursday, Hegseth said that US Southern Command chief Adm. Alvin Holsey — who is overseeing the boat attacks — will step down at the end of the year. Holsey's resignation reportedly stems from concerns over the strikes.

“If Commander Alvin has resigned for refusing to be complicit in the murder of Caribbean civilians by US missiles deliberately launched against them from comfortable offices, I consider him a hero and a true officer of the armies of the Americas,” Petro said in response to the news. “I said in New York, on one of its streets, that I asked the officers of the US military forces not to aim their weapons at humanity.”

The Trump administration revoked Petro's US visa following his speech.

“I believe that Commander Alvin has proven himself to be a man of worth by refusing to aim his weapons at humanity. Perhaps Commander Alvin does not know it, but he is a true officer of the armies of Washington and Bolívar,” Petro added, referring to George Washington and the great South American liberator Simón Bolívar.

On his first day back in the White House in January, Trump signed an executive order designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the president reportedly signed a secret order directing the Pentagon to use military force to combat drug cartels abroad, sparking fears of renewed US aggression in a region that has endured well over 100 US attacks, invasions, occupations, and other interventions since the issuance of the dubious Monroe Doctrine in 1823.

Trump has also deployed a small armada of naval warships off the coast of Venezuela, which has endured more than a century of Washington's imperialist meddling, raising fears of yet another US war of choice and regime change.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 How America and Europe Can Exploit Moscow's Vulnerabilities

 Alexandra Prokopenko

To sustain its war against Ukraine, Russia militarized its economy. Although—contrary to popular belief abroad—the Russian economy is not on a full wartime footing, the Kremlin has both splurged on weapons factories and begun trading more with China to evade Western sanctions. Over the past three years, the Russian economy has outperformed most forecasts thanks to extravagant government spending, high prices for commodities that Russia exports, and skilled economic management.

There are now two views of Russia's economy. One, touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is that the Russian economy has proved surprisingly resilient and is strong enough to sustain his grandiose goals, which include not only maintaining Russia's war in Ukraine but also expanding and upgrading its military so that it could one day take on NATO. Since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, Putin has ramped up his tests of the alliance's resolve. In September, Russian drones violated Poland's airspace and Russian fighter jets intruded into Estonia's. Putin has faith in his own resources: since 2022, Russia has expanded its weapons output even in the face of severe sanctions.

The other view of Russia's economy is that it is bound to one day collapse. But neither is entirely correct. Russia's ability to build a strong-enough military to truly challenge NATO over the long run is constrained by mounting fiscal pressures, an overstretched labor market, sanctions that block access to critical technologies, and a defense industry already working at full capacity. According to defense experts, it will probably take Russia between seven and ten years to reconstitute its military forces—that is, replenish depleted weapons stockpiles, replace heavy equipment losses, and rebuild troop strength and combat readiness. Yet in the meantime, Russia can harass NATO members on the cheap with cyberattacks and sabotage, and it may decide on an outright attack even sooner, given that European countries are rushing to upgrade their defenses.

After three and a half years of full-scale conflict, the contours of Russia's political economy reveal the boundaries of what the Kremlin can achieve. To defeat Putin's grand goals, the United States and European countries must get a better grasp on the specific long-term vulnerabilities of the Russian economy and start exploiting them now.

Despite sanctions and isolation, Russia has managed to keep its war machine running. In 2021, the Kremlin spent around 22 percent of the federal budget on the military. Today, it spends nearly 40 percent, or about eight percent of GDP (including spending on domestic security). The government has expanded its drone and ammunition manufacturing, refurbished stockpiles of Soviet-era equipment, and offered generous financial incentives to encourage men to join the army. Moscow was able to sustain the invasion without putting the entire economy on a full wartime footing by declaring a partial mobilization and encouraging existing defense factories to run around the clock. Parallel imports—goods sold to Russia by a third party without the manufacturer's permission—and Chinese suppliers have covered gaps in critical components caused by sanctions. In the short term, this patchwork approach has been enough to replenish frontline forces and keep Russia in the war.

But these achievements are less impressive than they appear. As the military analyst Dara Massicot has noted, Russia's defense-industrial capacity had largely plateaued by 2024, apart from drone production. Most of the equipment it is now delivering to the Ukrainian front is refurbished, not new, and is often inferior to NATO systems. Corruption and inefficiency in the military and defense sectors remain endemic, and although marginal gains in efficiency are possible, they cannot generate the scale of resources required for rapid force expansion.

Russia has demonstrated resilience and adaptability by tapping into its so-called industry mobilization reserve (standby production capacity that can be rapidly activated during wartime), as well as by expanding its infrastructure somewhat, such as by building ammunition factories. But the country has exhausted its reserves of manufacturing capacity and manpower. To produce substantially more equipment or recruit and train far more soldiers, Moscow would have to shift to a more comprehensive war footing by directing all available resources toward military needs, as it did during World War II, or commandeering civilian production lines for military purposes. Car factories, for example, could be made to produce only military vehicles. But the government has resisted doing so because it feared social unrest and shortages of consumer goods.

Russia's war economy works, but only up to a point. The Kremlin is limited not only by short-term production bottlenecks but also by fiscal strain, an overstretched labor market, technological isolation, and a fragmented defense-industrial base. In effect, defense spending functions like a disposable-goods economy: factories operate at full capacity, workers earn wages, and demand for inputs surges, but the output is designed to vanish almost immediately. Tanks, drones, and shells are produced to be destroyed on the battlefield, and the state pays out lifetime pensions to injured soldiers and death benefits to the families of those killed. This cycle sustains employment and industrial activity in the short term but generates no lasting assets—such as highways, power plants, or schools—or productivity gains, leaving the economy busier yet poorer with each passing year of war.

Russia's fiscal indicators are flashing red. Oil and gas revenues are declining because of lower prices, rising logistical costs, volatile exchange rates, and the threat of expanded sanctions. In the first half of 2025, federal revenues contracted by 16.9 percent. The Finance Ministry designed its 2026 budget around an assumed oil price of $59 per barrel, down from $67 in the previous draft budget, and will likely revise the estimated price even lower.

Non-oil revenues are rising but not nearly fast enough to compensate, especially as Russia's economic growth slows. GDP expanded by just 1.1 percent over the first seven months of the year, a sharp deceleration after two years of overheating. Russia's GDP grew by 3.6 percent in 2023 and 4.1 percent in 2024 because of massive state expenditures that also fueled higher consumer prices. The overheating was unsustainable, but today's deceleration exposes the fragility of a war economy that depends on continuous fiscal stimulus to mask underlying structural weaknesses. To close the revenue gap, the government is resorting to what it calls “revenue mobilization”—expanding fines, penalties, and state fees. In 2024, the government raised taxes on incomes and corporations. Now, according to a draft budget, the Kremlin is considering a two percentage point increase to the country's value-added tax, which could generate $14.3 billion. In addition to raising the VAT to 22 percent, authorities plan a sixfold reduction of the revenue threshold at which businesses must begin paying the VAT, thereby expanding the taxpayer base by a large margin.



Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, an economist by training, has reassured Putin that sustained defense spending in 2026 and beyond, combined with improved government procurement, will drive broader economic growth and potentially stimulate the civilian economy. His strategy involves expanding procurement to include smaller private enterprises and the Rubicon Center of Advanced Unmanned Systems, a drone research and development organization, through simplified contracting and direct funding for dual-use technologies.

In Belousov's thinking, when the state creates substantial industrial demand for military purposes, factories start mass-producing new technologies, causing them to become cheaper and more reliable. That process occurred in the United States in the 1960s. As the Pentagon and NASA pushed to procure materials for the Minuteman II missile program and the Apollo space missions, they created a sustained demand for integrated circuits, allowing manufacturers to achieve the production volumes necessary to drive down costs. That is, in part, how the United States came to be home to the modern computing industry.

Russia's economic structure, however, fundamentally differs from the open American system that enabled such spillover effects. Putin's drive toward autarky has created a semiclosed economy in which every injection of liquidity or subsidized credit generates demand that crashes against rigid supply constraints. Russian firms cannot rapidly scale up production because of logistical bottlenecks, technological limitations, and chronic workforce shortages. Rather than creating more outputs, excess monetary stimulus inflates prices, widening the gap between demand and supply and driving inflation—a dynamic that undermines the very growth objectives that defense spending was intended to achieve.

In the 2026 draft budget, for the first time since the war began, military spending is set to stop growing and could even fall slightly. The goal is economic rebalancing, not peace. But a modest decrease in military spending will not fix Russia's structural problems. Russia is caught in a bind: any attempt to rapidly cut defense expenditures would trigger economic collapse, but maintaining current military spending levels would perpetuate stagnation. Moscow can neither sustain indefinite military spending nor safely transition back to a civilian economy without demobilizing and getting some relief from sanctions.

Russia also suffers from a tight labor market. By the end of 2024, Russian firms faced a labor deficit of 2.2 million workers and 70 percent of Russian businesses reported they were short on employees. Defense production now competes with construction, transportation, and agriculture for scarce manpower. Restrictions on migration compound the problem. Migrants can work in just a handful of low-paid sectors, and they face discriminatory laws. Their children, for instance, have limited access to schools.

Meanwhile, demographic pressures are intensifying: people over 65 already account for 18 percent of Russia's population, a proportion expected to rise to 24 percent by the middle of the twenty-first century. The war has worsened this demographic crisis. According to estimates from August by the BBC and Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet, at least 219,000 Russian soldiers have been killed so far in Ukraine, most of them working-age men. Hundreds of thousands more have permanently withdrawn from the labor force because of injury. Contract soldiers on the frontlines make up approximately 0.5 percent of the workforce. In theory, the economy will reabsorb these workers when the war ends, but combat skills don't always translate to civilian jobs, and many veterans will require retraining and ongoing medical care.



U.S. and European export controls have cut off Russia's supply of advanced components such as high-end semiconductors, precision bearings, and specialized machine tools, forcing its economy into costly substitution. For Russia to make domestic alternatives, it needs to build new production facilities from scratch. The result tends to be a worse product at a higher cost. Parallel imports and Chinese supplies can temporarily plug critical gaps in electronics and machinery, but the quality of these products is often lower. Russia can assemble weapons, but it cannot rebuild the sophisticated industrial base needed for long-term competitiveness. Russia has come to depend on China not only for components but also for machine tools and industrial robots, affording Beijing significant leverage over Moscow when it comes to pricing on consumer and industrial goods. In many ways, Russia is now subordinate to China and operates primarily as a resource supplier rather than a technological equal.

Russia's defense industry now looks like a patchwork quilt. There are state giants such as Rostec, a defense group, regional workshops, and small, even garage-sized firms producing drones and equipment. This decentralized mobilization has proved surprisingly effective in wartime, as small shops can often work faster and more cheaply than traditional large contractors. Yet once the war ends, the Russian government will not be able to keep these firms going. It will be easier for the Kremlin to instead restore the Soviet-style system of centralized plants, bloated procurement, and entrenched corruption. The collapse of these innovative small firms could slow the pace of technological development and implementation, as they are beat out by sluggish state monopolies.

There is also squabbling between Belousov, who supports the small shops (also known as the people's military-industrial complex), and Putin's cronies—such as Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov, an old friend, and Alexei Dyumin, Putin's former bodyguard—who lobby for the traditional defense firms. The two sides fight not only over how to develop the defense-industrial base but also over control of revenue streams and lucrative chunks of an increasingly militarized economy. Since 2008, for example, Chemezov has helped consolidate Rostec's control over state-owned and privatized Soviet-era defense manufacturers by pressuring shareholders and managers to join his industrial empire. Russia's innovative defense entrepreneurs might be met with similar intimidation, resulting in conflicts, delays, and cost overruns.

The United States and Europe cannot bank on Russia's economy simply falling apart. But the structural limits on Russia's economic growth suggest that its planned military resurgence will be slow, uneven, and costly—which provides its adversaries a window of opportunity to hinder its military buildup. Sanctions and export controls, for example, can still hurt Moscow. They have already compelled Russia to substitute imports and develop a dependence on China. If U.S. and European policymakers tighten controls on components—such as optics, semiconductors, and advanced machine tools—and continue to sanction Russia's oil exports and financial system, they can put even more pressure on Russia's economy and industrial base. They could also make it harder for Moscow to preserve the flow of imported consumer goods (such as electronics, clothing, and household items) that underpin middle-class lifestyles.

U.S. and European policymakers should anticipate the Kremlin's adaptations. Russia might further militarize its economy by converting more civilian industries to meet military production needs, building new plants, and attracting more people to the defense industry through higher wages, draft exemptions, and expanded recruitment campaigns. Such actions would be politically risky for Putin because they would force ordinary Russians to make sacrifices. Consumer factories could close, goods might be rationed, and companies could lose their employees to war-related sectors. Putin so far has maintained his public's acquiescence to his grand military ambitions by preserving the normalcy of daily life. A full mobilization could make more people feel the war's effects. But from Putin's perspective, the potential payoff—subjugating Ukraine and eroding NATO—may justify the gamble.

When it comes to thwarting Putin's ambitions to confront NATO, timing is everything. Russia can make up for its losses over the next two to three years, but fully restoring its military will take much longer. The paradox of Russia's war economy is that it is simultaneously strong and brittle. The United States and Europe must act with urgency: pressing their advantages while Russia remains constrained rather than waiting for the Kremlin to get back on its feet.

 How a Father's Struggle Revealed the Price of Power

 Orville Schell



Given the flood of books on China that has poured forth in recent years, one might think the rest of the world would have figured out that provocative country by now. But much of China's historical evolution continues to defy Western understanding, and many of its leaders remain tantalizing conundrums—few more so than Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and the president of the People's Republic of China. Having watched him up close on official trips, once in 2015 with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and once during U.S. President Donald Trump's 2017 trip to China, I've encountered few leaders whose body language and facial expressions reveal so little about what's going on inside their heads. With a Mona Lisa–like hint of a smile permanently etched on his face, Xi's mien is hard to read.

Opacity may have been a skill Xi learned as a child, according to Joseph Torigian's prodigiously researched epic The Party's Interests Come First: The Life of Xi Zhongxun, Father of Xi Jinping. Torigian quotes the Chinese historian Gao Wenqian, who suggests that after watching his father's fall from grace within the CCP, Xi learned the art of “forbearance and concealing his intentions, not revealing anything.” Xi Zhongxun, a close colleague of Mao Zedong's, had been intensely loyal to both the party and its revolution, only to be repaid with political persecution, abuse, imprisonment, and domestic exile. This was the world in which Xi Jinping came of age.

As Torigian observes, the history of internal CCP dynamics confronts scholars, especially those not from China, with “one of the most difficult research targets in the world.” Not only do they have to contend with the formidable language barrier, but the CCP is so sensitive about having its dirty laundry aired in public that it goes to great lengths to distort its historical record with propaganda and to keep embarrassing documents off-limits. The result is an official history that is immaculately well scrubbed and ordered lest it reveal any fallibility.

But peek behind the veil, and a different reality reveals itself: a dog-eat-dog world of power struggles, artifice, hubris, treachery, and duplicity—yet also an enormous amount of sacrifice. By limning the life of Xi Zhongxun in such extraordinary detail, Torigian helps readers see behind the veil and understand the political crucibles in which father and son were “forged,” the term both use to describe how they were shaped by revolutionary hardship and struggle.

“The fall of Xi Zhongxun was a turning point in Chinese history,” Torigian writes. It was also a turning point for the Xi family, which spiraled into tragedy thereafter. Xi Jinping was only nine years old in 1962, when his father, a senior member of Mao's government, was purged on spurious charges, including approving the publication of a novel about his mentor. The elder Xi was plunged into 16 years of political ostracism and violence—he was beaten so badly he became deaf in one ear—that continued until the rise of Deng Xiaoping, in 1978, and the end of the Cultural Revolution.

As one former colleague recalled, Xi's purge caused him “psychological damage.” Yet despite all the abuse, Xi continued to insist that all he wanted to do was to “struggle his entire life for the party.” One is left to wonder why—and how all the injustices and indignities inflicted on the Xi family affected his children.

Xi Jinping's childhood was so traumatic that being “sent down” to the countryside in 1969 to spend seven years in grinding poverty and “learn from the peasants” during the Cultural Revolution came as a relief. Of course, the whole time he lived under the mortifying shadow of his father, a “counterrevolutionary,” which was one of the lowest categories of political damnation in the CCP playbook. As Torigian writes, Xi Jinping “suffered special mistreatment” because of his father, whom he was forced to denounce. One can only imagine his humiliation as a teenager to have his application to join the Communist Youth League—a precursor to full party membership that every child coveted—rejected eight times. And then, before the Cultural Revolution finally ended, his sister, who had suffered her own torments, hanged herself in despair.

Lest any whiff of pop psychology tarnish his rigorous scholarship, Torigian insists his book “is not intended to be a Freudian analysis” of this father-son drama. Instead, he writes that his intention was to use “the life of one rather unique individual to tell the story of the Chinese Communist Party in the twentieth century.” By tapping into new Chinese, English, French, and Russian sources based largely outside China, Torigian has done that and more. Few sons ever escape the influence of their fathers, and by just laying out this father-son narrative, Torigian helps readers gain a deeper sense of how Xi Jinping's passage to adulthood made him who he now is.

Xi Zhongxun, Torigian says, was drawn to the promise of Marxism-Leninism in a manner that was “more emotional than ideological.” Born to a peasant family in 1913, just after the abdication of the last Qing emperor, he received only a rudimentary education in China's hardscrabble northwest Shaanxi Province. “A tough man with chauvinistic tendencies,” writes Torigian, Xi Zhongxun “found motivation in the self-sacrifice and dedication of the professional revolutionary.” His idealization of the Communist revolution, which began in the early 1920s, remained a leitmotif throughout his life, even when the party turned on him in the most irrational and brutal ways.

He first became caught up in the party's internecine power struggles in the early 1930s, when as a young man working with two of Shaanxi Province's most celebrated Communist leaders, Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang, he fell victim to a byzantine purge that saw hundreds executed. Xi was accused of “rightism”—insufficient ardor in executing “class enemies” such as landlords and rural gentry—and consequently beaten and imprisoned. Throughout his ignominy, however, he remained steadfastly loyal to the party and revolution. “I believe that the Central Committee will definitely clarify this matter,” he optimistically declared. “I absolutely am not a counterrevolutionary.”

His fate did change in 1935, when Mao, in need of refuge from his beleaguered Long March, stumbled into the Shaanxi area and ended the purge. Xi was rehabilitated and assigned to do “United Front work” with the Nationalists, who had temporarily joined forces with the Communists to fight the Japanese. Next, he moved to the Communists' capital, Yanan, where he headed the Northwest Bureau Party School.



Mao's paranoia about enemies and desire for ideological uniformity reached hysteria in 1942, when he launched his “rectification campaign.” At the time, many top leaders, including Premier Zhou Enlai, were forced to engage in days of humiliating self-criticism and confession. Xi had been sent to the commercially successful Suide subregion, where he helped organize mass rallies to expose putative spies, enemy agents, and other imagined political malefactors. Torigian describes the rallies as generating “a persecutorial mania that combined elements both farcical and terrifying” and wonders how to definitively account for such extreme actions by Xi, whom he views as a relative moderate.

“Xi was a party member,” Torigian surmises, “so when he was told to find spies, he did.” His goal was to “do everything possible to demonstrate his loyalty to Mao.” As a result, Mao ended up gifting him a white cloth inscribed with the phrase “The party's interests come first,” a token he cherished. Despite all the political extremism that Xi was forced to endure, however, Torigian describes him as a person who preferred “balance,” a state that was difficult to find under Mao.

As his career took off, Xi gained new posts with increasing responsibilities and visibility until he became known as “the king of the Northwest.” In 1944, however, his eight-year marriage to Hao Mingzhu, with whom he had three children, fell apart. The same year, he married the 17-year-old Qi Xin, with whom he went on to have four more children, including Xi Jinping.

As the Communists gained ground on the Nationalists in the late 1940s, Xi joined Mao's land reform movement, which saw millions of landlords “struggled against” and executed. He expressed doubts about such tactics and tried to make the case for a more moderate “middle path.” But this was a time of extremes, and Xi went on obediently supporting Mao in his next campaign against “counterrevolutionaries.” Xi even exhorted his minions to “kill enough to create awe and terror”—a logic, explains Torigian, that presupposed “the party could somehow achieve a ‘right' number of executions.”



After Mao's People's Liberation Army finally triumphed over the Nationalist forces in the Chinese Civil War, in 1949, Xi worked in a variety of central government positions in the newly established People's Republic of China. His posts included minister of propaganda and managing relations with the Soviet Union, then China's socialist “big brother.” In 1956, he joined the CCP's Central Committee and then three years later became a vice premier under Zhou on the State Council, the chief administrative branch and national cabinet. It was there, Torigian reports, that Xi learned that Mao's impetuous communization of agriculture, the so-called Great Leap Forward, had created one of the worst famines in human history and that “Zhou's priority was not good policy” but “political survival.”

By 1962, a strange brew of convoluted accusations laid Xi low once more. Because of Moscow's détente with Washington and Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev's emphasis on de-Stalinization, the Soviet Union had become China's enemy; Mao began to fear Xi might have become infected by Khrushchev's “revisionist” virus. Then there was a novel that Xi had reluctantly approved for publication about Liu Zhidan, his old mentor from Shaanxi Province, whom some rivals were now criticizing. Xi was accused of having “illicit relations with Moscow,” approving an incorrect work of fiction, and being an “antiparty” element. Even after numerous confessions, self-criticisms, and apologies, he found himself excommunicated again by the very party to which he'd dedicated his life.

“Thirty-six years of affection were ruined all at once,” he wrote as the next round of humiliations began. He felt like “a person who fell off an eighteen-floor building,” he told a friend.

All this happened before the Cultural Revolution began, in 1966. As Mao launched his Red Guard army against the party headquarters and state apparat that he believed were becoming too bureaucratic and bourgeois, Xi was exiled to a metal-working shop in Henan Province. There, insult followed injury. Kidnapped by a group of Red Guards, he was transported to a prison and then paraded before a stadium filled with detractors, arms bound behind his back, and beaten as the crowd screamed, “Topple! Set on fire! Deep-fry!” He was later imprisoned, plunged into repeated struggle sessions, and subjected to more beatings.

In desperation, Xi wrote pleas to his old comrades Mao and Zhou. Although neither replied, Torigian notes that Xi “never abandoned his emotional attachment to Mao” or his devotion to the party. Despite his willingness to repeatedly yield, even pander, to Mao and the party, Xi still comes across as well intentioned: someone trapped between submitting and surviving or opposing and being crushed. The party left no middle ground.

In Xi Zhongxun's absence, his young second wife mothered their children as well as she could. But because of her husband's fallen state, she was put on a “black name list” at the Central Party School where she worked and soon suffered numerous physical attacks. This left her children in the painful position of needing parents who had been rendered unlovable.

“I both could not stand to look at the black-and-blue scars on her face and was also worried that my classmates would surround her and look down on her, and I would feel ashamed,” Xi Jinping's brother wrote of the embarrassment he experienced when his mother walked him to school. “I often cried silently out of humiliation for my mother and family.”

One of Xi Jinping's teachers remembered him suffering “extremely unfair treatment” because of his parents. At his mother's work unit, for instance, the young Xi was the only one dragged out with a group of adults to be publicly criticized. The teenager endured his own mother chanting, “Down with Xi Jinping!” out of fear of more persecution herself. When Xi later sneaked out of his school one night to run home and beg his mother for food, she rebuked him and turned him in to the authorities. At 15, he was brought in for questioning and detention at a facility where, he later claimed, he “collapsed from sickness” and “even thought of death.” When, in 1969, he was shipped off as a “sent down youth” to a penurious village in Shaanxi to do seven difficult years of manual labor, he felt it as a deliverance.



When Mao died, in 1976, Deng Xiaoping returned to power, and Xi Zhongxun was finally allowed to return to Beijing. He described his mood as both “joyful and terrified.” Despite all the official abuse, he still looked on the chance to contribute to China's development again as a “glorious mission.” He was assigned as a deputy provincial party secretary to Guangdong Province and charged with cleaning up the mess left by the Cultural Revolution. He was also tapped to help initiate the new special economic zone in Shenzhen, one of four such zones that Deng had approved to bring in foreign investment and invigorate China's lagging socialist economy with market forces. By 1980, Xi was leading China's first delegation of governors to the United States.

Xi proved a deft reform leader and gained a reputation for being open-minded. But even though Xi Zhongxun and his family were ultimately reinstated, Torigian says that the “problems at the heart of the Leninist system”—which had allowed their political persecutions in the first place—remained unresolved. As the CCP amply demonstrated when it ordered troops to fire on protesters in 1989, the party had not lost its habit of responding to both real and imagined political challenges in harshly punitive, often murderous, ways. And so, when Xi Zhongxun died, in 2002, his children's generation was left to wrestle with the same contradictions in China's political system that he'd found so intractable.

Ten years later, when Xi Jinping was enthroned as China's supreme leader, he came freighted with all the hopes to which his father's last years in office had given rise. Many mistakenly thought Xi would follow in his father's reformist footsteps and that China might slowly evolve into a more collective form of leadership, adopt a rule-of-law-based system, and welcome a more liberal economy. Torigian's book offers a wealth of clues as to why these hallmarks have not ended up distinguishing Xi Jinping's tenure.

Torigian recognizes that “the emotional pressure on a child who was denied participation in the grand adventure of revolution because of family ties must have been intense.” But he is wary of addressing the question of what Xi Jinping learned from his father's manic odyssey head-on. Although he'd rather let readers come to their own conclusions, he leaves a breadcrumb trail that is easy to follow.

In what Torigian describes as “a rare moment of candor,” Xi Jinping once confided, “My father entrusted me with two things: don't persecute people and tell the truth. The first is possible, while the second is not.”

Readers may wonder, of course, if the first “thing” is not also impossible in modern China. But one finishes this family saga more fully understanding why, for Xi Jinping, opacity and mendacity became the best guarantors of survival. “Ironically,” Torigian writes, “guessing what [Xi] Jinping ‘really thinks' of his father is difficult in part because he grew up in the Xi household—a place where a person would have learned the need for caution and reticence at a young age.”

While the young Xi was rusticating as a teenager in Shaanxi, he seems to have absorbed one other lesson: the best protection against being viewed as an apostate was to become more orthodox than anyone else. As one U.S. Embassy official wrote in a report quoted by Torigian, Xi concluded that “by becoming redder than red,” he could both assuage his own embarrassment regarding his father and armor himself against further criticism.

The more challenging question than how the father influenced his son, however, is one that lingers everywhere in this book: What does a one-party state such as China do with a revolution in which its own leaders—not outside colonialists, imperial overlords, or exploitative capitalists—became society's main oppressors, all in the name of “liberation”? Can such leaders ever be expected to embrace their government's past with enough honesty to acknowledge the damage done, much less make amends?



The Germans accomplished such a reckoning, but only after the complete defeat of the Nazis. And it was not until 1970 that Willy Brandt, chancellor of West Germany, fell to his knees in apology before the memorial at the Warsaw ghetto. “Faced with the abyss of German history and the burden of the millions who had been murdered, I did what we humans do when words fail us,” he later wrote in his memoir.

Because the CCP is still in power, China's challenge is far more difficult than Germany's. For Xi Jinping or other party successors to similarly reckon with their country's past, they would, in effect, have to take down the portrait of Chairman Mao that hangs on the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Tiananmen Square. Such an act would betray the legacy of all those who, like Xi's father, devoted their lives to the sacred cause of Mao's revolution. Xi Jinping continues to venerate the party and views criticism of its record as “historical nihilism.” Indeed, it's unlikely he will ever admit to the magnitude of crimes it committed against him or his country, much less abandon the rationalizations he inherited from his father that the revolution's travails may have involved excesses but are excusable because they helped forge a better future for China.

Torigian seems vexed by this predicament for China. He ends with this line: “Left out of this narrative is a full account of the terrible costliness in human suffering that has come along with the revolutionary project—a Faustian bargain seen so clearly in the life of the man Xi Zhongxun.”

It is not clear whether Xi Zhongxun understood that to remain a loyal player in Mao's China, he had to sell at least part of his soul. But it is clear that his son, despite all of China's manifold accomplishments, confronts the same wager. Standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xi recently declared at a military parade in Beijing that “the great rejuvenation of China is unstoppable.” Then, sounding almost American, he proclaimed that “the Chinese people firmly stand on the right side of history and on the side of human civilization and progress.”

Yet Xi's declarations were bereft of any suggestion he'd ever be ready to honestly reckon with the CCP's ruinous past. Therein lies the main obstacle to China ever becoming a truly respectable great power. If Xi were to confront history, he would have to demolish the party's pretense that the Chinese Communist Revolution was largely a benign, productive force. So far, nothing suggests he has sufficient dedication to historical accuracy to do that. But future generations in China, those not bound by the same baggage as the Xi family, may someday find their voice and want to overturn Mao's old mendacious order. If they do, they may ironically find it helpful to consider one of Mao's most iconic slogans: “Without destruction, there can be no construction.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","For extra-terrestrial seekers in Nevada's Mojave Desert, ‘the truth is out there'","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/travel/extraterrestrial-highway-nevada","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:47:37 GMT","


            The first time Fontella “Faun” Day believes she saw life from another planet, it came from above.
    


            It was a cloudy afternoon in Rachel, Nevada, and the phones and computers at the Alien Cowpoke gas station and mini mart where she works had been glitching for hours.
    


            When Day finished her shift, she stepped outside for the short drive back to her home in the middle of the Mojave Desert. That's when she saw it: Up in the sky, a peculiar cloud formation that looked remarkably like a flying saucer.
    


            Her heart was pounding. She blinked to make sure she wasn't hallucinating. Even after she rubbed her eyes, the shape was still there, she says, hovering right above her. Something inside of her told her to grab her cell phone and snap some pictures. Today those images — and the eerie, vivid memory of that moment — are all she has from what she considers an otherworldly encounter.
    


            “It was just a weird, weird day,” she said. “(People) say the reason (alien spaceships are in) that shape is because of the frequency of the ship. That's how they hide behind the clouds, I guess.”
    


            Day's story is one of hundreds found along the Extraterrestrial Highway, a 140-mile ribbon of road in south central Nevada, just outside Las Vegas.
    


            The roadway, which runs through one of the darkest and most desolate stretches of the continental United States, is famous for alien encounters: Since the 1950s, there have been more reports of UFO sightings here than anywhere in the country.
    


            Skeptics say these “UFOs” are probably just super stealth aircraft from the nearby Nellis Air Force Base.
    


Ufologists, those people who believe in aliens, have a different explanation for why this stretch of the Great Basin Desert seems to be so popular among beings from the outer corners of the universe.
    


            Many believers cite the region's proximity to the Nevada Test and Training Range and Area 51 — a top-secret base that the US Central Intelligence Agency didn't even admit was real until 2013.
    


            Some who have worked at Area 51 claim it is home to alien spacecraft and possibly even a dead alien. Others have linked the site to a 1947 incident near Roswell, New Mexico, that led to conspiracy theories about the government's role in covering up what some thought was the crash of an alien spaceship.
    


            As Mulder and Scully from “The X Files” would have said,  “The truth is out there.” For many, the best way to search for it in the Nevada desert is on an overnight road trip from or to Las Vegas along a stretch of road known as the Extraterrestrial Highway.
    


            If you leave from Las Vegas, the adventure begins by heading north on I-15 past downtown and beyond the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. From here, exit on US Route 93 and continue 85 miles north through the desert toward Ely.
    


            The first part of the drive is notable for its nothingness — nearly 90 minutes of sand, sagebrush, prickly pear and juniper. It's dry. It's stark. It's about 20 different shades of brown, all year long.
    


            Suddenly, outside the small town of Alamo, the spring-fed marshlands of the Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge appear like an oasis in the desert. There are trees. There is standing water. There's even wildlife: The area comprises wetland and riparian habitats for thousands of migratory birds and other (terrestrial) critters.
    


            It is the first of many head-scratching sightings along the journey.
    


            The next one comes up quickly at the intersection of US 93 and Nevada State Route 375 in Crystal Springs: A roadside market named E.T. Fresh Jerky.
    


            Murals of bug-eyed aliens across the parking lot from a fake UFO in the sand, welcome visitors to this double-wide trailer renowned for its selection of dried snacks. The leathery flagship “Alien Jerky” isn't alien meat, but the packaging – with an alien hand and spaceship beaming up cattle – sparks curiosity. Another creative option is “Freeze-Dried Alien Tongues,” a softer candy that mimics the ice cream they eat in space.
    


            Just north on Nevada 375, no more than a quarter mile from the jerky shop, is a road sign announcing the official start of the Extraterrestrial Highway. The sign, with its futuristic letters, sits atop 20-foot poles covered with years' worth of stickers.
    


            The route received this formal moniker back in 1996, thanks in part to the advocacy of George Harris, a US Army veteran and local entrepreneur.
    


            In the 1960s and 1970s, while Harris served in the Army, he was part of a group tasked with interviewing people who reported alien sightings across the country. In this role he spoke to more than 5,000 people. (The 2009 movie, “The Men Who Stare at Goats,” is loosely based on this group.) He also spent time working inside Area 51.
    


            When he retired from the service, Harris purchased a plot of land just north of where the Extraterrestrial Highway begins. He built a Quonset hut there and opened the Alien Research Center in 2000.
    


            Shortly after opening, Harris added Zork, a 40-foot-tall alien sculpture, out front. The center also has a piece of local alien history: the original Extraterrestrial Highway sign from the 1990s hangs on a wall inside, surrounded by handwritten messages on the wall itself.
    


            Today, it's more of a gift shop than a research center. Visitors can purchase alien-themed clothing, magnets, hot sauce and more. Harris also sells alien shot glasses and Alien Tequila, a brand he started with some friends in Mexico in 2008. The tequila comes in bottles shaped like alien heads (of course).
    


            Harris, who splits his time between the Mojave and Las Vegas, considers these endeavors his personal tributes to extraterrestrial life.
    


            “I believe in aliens, one hundred fifty bazillion percent,” he said, adding that he has seen things inside Area 51 that lead him to hold this position. “Wherever someone else might stand on the subject, we certainly can't say we're the only species in the universe.”
    


            About an hour north of the Alien Research Center is the town of Rachel, the heart of Alien Country.
    


            The town has a sort of extraterrestrial provenance: As the UFO flies, Rachel is the “closest” population center to Area 51. It still takes about an hour on a dirt road to drive to the base, and looky-loos are turned away at the gate. Rachel also is the specific zip code from which the greatest number of the area's reported UFO sightings have been recorded.
    


            To call Rachel isolated would be an understatement. It is the only civilization in the Sand Springs Valley, a largely undeveloped finger of the Mojave. Turn your head to the left, you see nothing but ochre mountains and sand. Turn your head to the right, you see the same.
    


            Because Rachel is so remote, pretty much all 200 of the cars that travel the Extraterrestrial Highway each day stop at one of two places: the Alien Cowpoke or the Little A'Le'Inn.
    


            Technically, the “Cowpoke,” as locals call it, is a gas station — it's the only gas for about 50 miles in either direction. A tiny building behind the pumps doubles as a market that sells snacks and handmade alien souvenirs such as magnets, posters, bags and keychains. There's also a selfie stop out front with haybales and three sculptures of aliens.
    


            This is where Faun Day works, the spot from which she regales visitors with details of her sighting that fateful afternoon. Visitors can marvel at similar yarns down the road at the Little A'Le'Inn, where a model UFO hangs from the hook of a tow truck out front.
    


            While this quirky motel offers 10 barebones overnight accommodations, the real attraction is the restaurant, which serves hot food including a hamburger with special alien sauce. The establishment features a life-size alien mannequin, blow-up aliens, and news clippings about alien sightings over the years. In the bar area, alien faces are taped to the mirror behind the booze.
    


            Perhaps the quirkiest corner of the restaurant at the Little A'Le'Inn is the one loaded with souvenirs. Among the highlights: alien head shot glasses, an alien head cookie jar, and replica Nevada license plates that say 4ALIENS and ET HWY.
    


            From Rachel, the Extraterrestrial Highway continues northwest through some of the most barren and deserted parts of the region. In certain spots, the road stretches into oblivion and looks like a line that someone just scribbled onto the landscape. In other places, dirt roads peel off the highway and disappear into the desert, begging the question: Where the heck do they lead?
    


            The answer: At least two of these rutted roads lead to the perimeter gates of Area 51; curious civilians who drive them are invariably turned away at a military checkpoint, if an MP doesn't pull you over and confiscate your camera equipment first.
    


            Eventually, Nevada 375 ends at US Route 6, and the Extraterrestrial Highway continues west to Tonopah. Though this former mining town lacks an official dark sky designation from DarkSky International, it's considered one of the best places in the United States for stargazing — and, by extension, spotting alien spacecraft.
    


            In particular, the Tonopah Stargazing Park, with cement pads for telescopes and tripods, is a great spot to scan the cosmos on a clear night.
    


            Alien fanatics might remember Tonopah from the climactic scenes of the 2011 movie, “Paul,” a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost comedy about an alien who escapes from Area 51. The city also is notable among those who believe in the supernatural; the upscale Mizpah Hotel in the city center is considered one of the most haunted hotels in the country, and the more modest Clown Motel on the outskirts of town sits next to a cemetery that dates to 1907.
    


            Each of these destinations offers a different flavor of weird.
    


            The Mizpah, said to have several different “permanent” residents, embraces its spooky past with nightly ghost tours that include an Electromagnetic Field Reader and dowsing rods — two tools that those who consider themselves ghost-hunters often use to detect the presence of spirits. All guests are encouraged to report any paranormal experiences at check-out. (For the record, hauntings are not guaranteed.)
    


            The Clown Motel, on the other hand, leans more toward creepy. The lobby displays about 800 of the 2,500 clowns that owners Hem and Vijay Mehar have collected over the years, including several that are believed to be possessed by demons. (Don't worry, those are in a glass case.) Many of the 31 rooms also have dark and sinister themes. There's a room dedicated to Pennywise, the evil clown from the Stephen King book, “It.” The Chucky room is decorated with wallpaper that features giant images of the murderous doll from the 1988 movie, “Child's Play.”
    


            The self-described clairvoyant Wonder Crisp (yes, that's really her name) leads nightly tours through the Clown Motel and the adjacent cemetery, and she characterizes Tonopah as a hotbed of paranormal activity.
    


            On the tour, Crisp boasts that many of the local apparitions have spoken to her for years.
    


            “Spirits and aliens are everywhere around here,” she said after a tour one night. “In order to see them, you just have to believe.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","As tourists continue to visit national parks and DC, advocates and local businesses warn about long-term impact of shutdown","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/tourism-shutdown-national-park-smithsonians","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 11:00:51 GMT","


            The government shutdown didn't deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors' center was closed and no park rangers were nearby.
    


            “We had planned this trip a while back. So, there was really no going back,” she said. “I feel like a shutdown might not close the gates, but it does affect and impact the caretakers. And I guess that's what worries me the most.”
    


            While many tourists like Mahajabin are yet to be discouraged by the government shutdown, national park advocates and businesses are worried about the safety of national parks and tourism's impact on the local economies that surround them if the congressional stalemate continues.
    


            The shutdown, which congressional leaders do not appear close to resolving, has meant tourist destinations like the Smithsonian museums in DC are closed and 9,000 National Park Service employees are furloughed, impacting the operations of the parks. The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds.
    


            In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior.
    


            The state's Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge.
    


            “We know that tourism is huge for West Virginia, bringing in billions and billions of dollars every year,” he said. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.”
    


            Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they're bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on.
    


            Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he's not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall.
    


            “This shutdown has had zero effect on us. We are open for business,” he said.
    


            Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.”
    


            Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, where business leaders are worried the shutdown may deter tourists from traveling to the nation's capital, the shutdown has been a boon for some private museums, which have seen a rise in visitors since the Smithsonian Institute was forced to close its museums and the National Zoo on October 12.
    


            A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors.
    


            It's unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC's trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's data on daily train station entries and bus boardings.
    


            Ferguson also warned of the shutdown's economic impact on the nation's capital, which lost about $47.4 million in revenue during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.
    


            “Everything from the small mom-and-pop sandwich shops to the larger entities are impacted by the shutdown,” Ferguson told CNN. “We are in the prime months and weeks for convention business and tourism. So, the impact is significant.”
    


            And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses.
    


            With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want.'”
    


            She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal.
    


            With these concerns in mind, the National Parks Conservation Association is asking national parks to close.
    


            Visitors “might be able to access beautiful places, but they're not going to have the full experience that they're used to at national parks. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations.
    


            Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, is concerned about the safety of the parks with limited staff.
    


            “Park rangers and Park Service employees do so much at parks regarding safety and preventative messaging,” she told CNN.
    


            Thompson's group has already received reports of trash piling up in some national parks, an issue that arose in previous shutdowns, notably in 2018. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends.
    


            In Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes.
    


            “My hope in all this is that people are leaning in,” said Jason Nelson, the group's communication's director. “We don't know how long this government shutdown is going to be.”
    


            The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.”
    


            Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on.
    


            Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. While his business will be OK, fewer visitors could harm the shops in the downtown area, he noted.
    


            “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We'll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.”
    


            Similarly, William Torres, the owner of DC Trails — a tour bus company — told CNN the government shutdown is not a big concern “at the moment.”
    


            “If it keeps going and it goes on, you know, past November and into the Thanksgiving season, then it could probably affect me some,” he said.

            • Amazon says its services are recovering again after connectivity issues persisted throughout Monday morning. But reports of problems with Amazon's cloud computing services unit AWS continue.
    


            • Amazon has previously reported it “fully mitigated” an earlier outage that disrupted several popular websites and apps across the world including Snapchat, Facebook and Fortnite. Downdetector, which tracks internet disruptions, said it had received 6.5 million reports from users worldwide.

            After narrowing down the cause of its massive and ongoing internet connectivity issues, Amazon said early Monday afternoon that it has a plan in place to fix the system responsible for the outage, and it appears to be working.
    


            Amazon Web Services (AWS) is “now seeing connectivity and API recovery for AWS services,” the company said.
    


            The problem appears to have stemmed from a system designed to monitor how much load is on the network. Amazon said it recently took additional steps to help that system recover. It also said it's working on allowing companies to create new instances of its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a virtual machine that allows customers to build cloud-based applications, which Amazon had throttled to help fix the broader problems.
    


            The number of users reporting outages is rising again for a series of companies and online services, according to Downdetector,  a website that aggregates user-submitted reports of disruptions to online services.
    


            Among them are Amazon, Delta, Snapchat, Google and Venmo, a mobile payment service owned by Paypal.
    


            Over 10,300 users last reported Amazon outages, up from around 600 earlier but down from a the day's high above 15,000.  Over 7,400 users last reported Snapchat outages, up from around 4,000 earlier but down from the day's peak above 22,000.
    


            After earlier reporting that the cause of a massive global internet outage had largely been mitigated, Amazon late Monday morning acknowledged that its cloud services that power some of the world's most popular apps and sites are acting temperamental once again.
    


            Despite early signs of recovery from the latest round of problems, Amazon said that the issues continue to create network connectivity wonkiness for its services that support thousands of apps and customer data.
    


            The company doesn't yet know the source of the issue, but it has narrowed down the possibilities as it continues to investigate.
    


            Amazon said the latest bugginess emanated from its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) network, a virtual machine that allows customers to build cloud-based applications and quickly scale up or down the amount of computing needed to power them. Basically, a company can use EC2 to rent access to servers and computing power so it doesn't have to invest in buying its own equipment, which can be extremely expensive technology.
    


            The company said an internal subsystem designed to monitor how much load customers are putting on its EC2 network went haywire. In the meantime, Amazon is dialing back customers' ability to launch new EC2 instances so it can work on mitigating the problem and help customers get back online.
    


            Monday's service disruptions show just how widespread AWS is and the critical role it plays in supporting the web. And that's resulted in a lucrative business for Amazon.
    


            Here's a snapshot of AWS' reach by the numbers:
    


            Amazon Web Services has now issued a further update, stating in a post at 10.29 a.m. ET that it is once again experiencing network connectivity issues in the US.
    


                    “We can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region.”
                





            AWS has said that it is seeing early signs of recovery and that it is continuing to investigate the “root cause”, which originated from its “EC2 internal network.”
    


                    “We continue to investigate the root cause for the network connectivity issues that are impacting AWS services such as DynamoDB, SQS, and Amazon Connect in the US-EAST-1 Region. We continue to investigate and identify mitigations”, it added.
                





For context: DynamoDB is a database that hosts information for companies, including customer data and EC2 is a kind of virtual server many companies use to build their online applications.
    


            We'll bring you more updates on this as we get them.
    


            Many of you have been in touch to let us know how you've been affected by today's mass internet outage. Here are some more of your experiences.
    


ERIC:



                    I'm from DOKKA, an AI accounting automation platform for businesses. We were watching our platform closely to see if the AWS outage would affect our services – but it wasn't. What was affected was our internal productivity as many of the tools we use were down. Some of my colleagues reported that Slack was having issues – my Slack worked perfectly. But what wasn't working for me was my Zoom. It would login, and a few seconds later automatically close, with a notification showing it was closing. Luckily this just lasted a few hours
                





CHRISTINA:



                    I use Alexa-enabled smart plugs to control the lamps in my room. I'm unable to walk without leaning on crutches so being able to turn lights and music on by voice is very helpful. During the outage my smart plugs became unresponsive. Before I realized why the plug wasn't working, I tried unsuccessfully to reset one of them. Now I can't get it to work at all.
                





            If you're just joining us, here is what you need to know after a mass internet outage caused by an Amazon Web Services fault.
    


            • Reports of disruption to internet usage across apps and online platforms were flagged overnight. AWS issued a statement at 1.26 am ET confirming “significant error rates for requests.”
    


            • Customers were unable to access their banking apps, gaming sites and social media accounts. Amazon-linked smart devices in the home were also affected.
    


            •  Some businesses took to X to reassure customers. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase told users, “All funds are safe,” while artificial intelligence company Perplexity confirmed its service was down, adding, “We're working on resolving it.” Both noted difficulties stemmed from an AWS fault.
    


            • AWS kept customers informed via its website about the steps it was taking to resolve the issue. At just after 2 am ET, the service said it believed it had identified the root cause of the outage. “We are working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery,” it added.
    


            • Flickr, PlayStation and Amazon itself were among the businesses forced to display ‘Error 404' notices and messages of apology due to their inactivity. Those trying to access major UK banks Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland were told to try again later as it was not possible to process any requests.
    


            • AWS then said, on its online ‘health dashboard', that it was seeing signs of recovery.
    


            • Tech expert Lance Ulanoff told CNN that AWS “sits in the middle of everything,” adding that all smart devices depend on “constant connectivity” so as soon as the source is removed, they fail.
    


            • A further update on AWS' health dashboard stated Amazon had “fully mitigated” the outage. It said that some sites were still experiencing delays processing requests, but largely everything was back up and running. The root cause currently remains unknown.
    


            This morning's AWS outage, which the company said has since been “fully mitigated,” is expected to have affected millions of users worldwide.
    


            Downdetector, a website that aggregates user-submitted reports of disruptions to online services, said it received 6.5 million global reports related to the outage, a spokesperson for the site's parent company Ookla told CNN via email.
    


            More than one million reports were submitted from the United States in the first two hours of the outage alone, according to Ookla, while more than 400,000 reports were filed from the United Kingdom in that time period.
    


            Here's a look at how the outage played out in certain regions according to Ookla's data:
    


            From banking services to social networks to airline booking sites to online shopping, the AWS outage disrupted thousands of services as millions of people worldwide – many of whom were on their way to work on the US East Coast – were unable to mobile-order coffee or access key apps.
    


            The latest outage serves as a reminder of how fragile the internet's backbone can be, even if the disruption is brief, and how reliant the world has become on these online services.
    


            There's “no sign” that this was a cyberattack, according to Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity firm NymVPN, adding that it “looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centers.”
    


            “The internet was originally designed to be decentralized and resilient, yet today so much of our online ecosystem is concentrated in a small number of cloud regions,” he said in a note. “When one of those regions experiences a fault, the impact is immediate and widespread.”
    


            Jardin said “these issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down; and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.”
    


            Although AWS and its competitors are generally robust, the internet is a complex web of overlapping services that are only as reliable as their weakest code. The root cause of Monday's outage remains unknown, but a service that converts friendly web names into IP addresses was unable to communicate with thousands of companies' massive databases hosted by Amazon.
    


            Read more here.
    


            As nearly every corner of the internet was affected early Monday morning by the Amazon Web Services outage, Elon Musk was gloating that his X platform was not affected.
    


            “Not us,” he responded to a post showing all the services and sites affected by the AWS outage, later responding and respiting memes making fun of Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.
    


            Musk used the outage to promote X's new chat function as users reported issues with encrypted messaging platform Signal.
    


            “I don't trust Signal anymore,” he wrote on X, adding in another post “The messages are fully encrypted with no advertising hooks or strange ‘AWS dependencies' such that I can't read your messages even if someone put a gun to my head. You can also do file transfers and audio/video calls.”
    


            We've now heard from United Airlines and Delta Airlines.
    


            United said the global outage at Amazon Web Services had disrupted access to its app and website overnight. Some internal United systems were also temporarily affected, the company added in a statement.
    


            “United implemented back-up systems to end the technology disruption and our teams are working to get our customers on their way,” the statement said.
    


            A spokesperson for Delta, meanwhile, said the airline had experienced a small number of minor flight delays earlier this morning as a result of the outage but the company does not expect any more significant impact on customers.
    


            We've been asking you to share your experiences of today's global internet outage, caused by a fault with AWS. Here are some of your responses so far:
    


CHARLES ANDERSON, NEW YORK:



                    When I was online at 5:45 a.m. ET, I had the YouTube app playing video of news stories and then it stopped - that was when I noticed that the app had gone completely black and wasn't loading anything. I tried to open the site in my browser and then it wouldn't load. Then I moved to my smart phone and went to search something on Google and Google Search wasn't working.
                





JAMES W. FORT, WORTH, TEXAS:



                    Working for Amazon Flex we've been sent home due to their systems not being able to check us in or release us with pay. Because of this outage there's no telling if the 80 of us here are going to be paid.
                





TIFFINI, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA:



                    I was at the Amazon VFL3 warehouse hoping to start my Amazon route at 3:30 a.m. and all the systems were down. I submitted a ticket, but there has been no confirmation that we will get paid for the blocks that we missed due to Amazon's system issues this morning.
                





RACHEL, NORTH CAROLINA:



                    Since 3 a.m. ET I've been unable to use RokuTV. Also, my son's Fortnite account was not working, and he tried to redeem a Fortnite gift card through the Epic Games Store but was unable to. RokuTV is still down.
                





CHARLIE SCHMIT IN MADISON, WISCONSIN, SAID:



                    I was pulling an all-nighter, studying for a mid-term exam for one of my classes. All of our reading and review materials are on Canva, a tool which experienced this outage, and I was unable to access nearly all of my materials for about an hour which really stressed me out in the middle of studying.

            Today's huge global outage caused by an issue at Amazon Web Services has highlighted that businesses and consumers have become overdependent on a limited number of cloud providers, according to an expert.
    


            AWS is a cloud computing provider that hosts many of the world's most-used online services. Amazon said its customers couldn't access the data stored in DynamoDB, a database that hosts information for companies, because of a problem with the Domain Name System – a kind of phone book for the internet.
    


            “Amazon Web Services' outage is a timely reminder of how deeply our economies now depend on just a handful of cloud infrastructures,” said Prof. Feng Li at the Bayes Business School at City St George's University in London.
    


            “Complex distributed systems operate at enormous scale and inevitably carry systemic risk. What stands out here though is the breadth of impact – from consumer apps to financial and public sector services – suggesting many organizations still underestimate the level of concentration risk in today's digital infrastructure.”
    


            Marek Szustak, an IT security expert, made a related point, saying that companies using the cloud should design their systems “so that a failure in one region or provider does not bring the entire business to a halt.”
    


            Geographical distribution of resources and testing of emergency scenarios “should be the norm, not a luxury,” according to the IT security officer at eSky Group, which owns Thomas Cook, a British online travel agency.
    


            A massive Amazon Web Services outage temporarily brought down a significant number of popular internet sites and services – affecting banks, airlines, media, delivery apps and many other websites and apps.
    


            AWS is a cloud computing provider that hosts many of the world's most-used online services. In Amazon's infancy, the company needed excess server capacity to ensure it had enough computing power to handle the massive amounts of traffic that came to its site during the holiday season rush. Amazon realized that during the rest of the year, it could use those servers to support other companies' online needs, and out of that AWS was born.
    


            Among AWS' many offerings is DynamoDB, a database that hosts information for companies, including customer data. Amazon Monday morning said its customers couldn't access the data stored in DynamoDB, because the Domain Name System – a kind of phone book for the internet – had encountered a problem. DNS is like an internet location engine, converting user-friendly web addresses like amazon.com into IP addresses – a series of numbers that other websites and applications can understand.
    


            “Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data,” said Mike Chapple at University of Notre Dame. “It's as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia.”
    


            It's not clear what caused the DNS outage, but it lasted only a few hours. By 6:35 a.m. ET, Amazon had fixed the DNS problem and recommended companies dump their cache – temporary storage files – to help speed up the restoration of their services.
    


            Amazon said the outage continued to affect other AWS services, including EC2 – a kind of virtual server many companies use to build their online applications.
    


            The company will likely conduct a postmortem and explain what went wrong with its DNS system in the coming days.
    


            As we reported earlier, major UK banks were also impacted by today's Amazon outage, with customers unable to access vital services.
    


            We've now heard from Lloyds Banking Group, which said services were now coming back online, although still not fully resolved.
    


                    “We are sorry for the issues affecting customers this morning, we are seeing services coming back online and continue to work to see that happens as quickly as possible,” a spokesman said.
                





            We've heard today from a tech expert who told us that Amazon Web Services “sits in the middle of everything.”
    


            Lance Ulanoff, editor at the technology publication TechRadar told John Berman on CNN News Central that AWS provides a space where businesses can essentially rent the services they depend on to operate, rather than building and maintaining those services internally, which is far more costly. “It's like: ‘Why build the house if you're just going to live in it?'” Ulanoff said.
    


            Ulanoff explained that smart home devices, used by millions globally to do everything from monitor who is approaching their property to turning lights on and off, are not designed to work without the internet, despite how widely relied upon they have become.
    


                    “They just don't work without the internet. They're not designed that way,” he said before adding, “We've designed everything to work with that constant connectivity and when you pull that big plug, everything, basically becomes dumb.”
                





            While the mass outage is said to be fully mitigated, it is not yet clear what caused the disruption. Ulanoff saidthe reason for outages such as this one, or the CrowdStrike outage back in 2024, are often difficult to explain.
    


                    “I continue to be confused about why there is not instant redundancy when you can have something that is seemingly so small, or so localized, have such a cascading and global impact,” he added.
                





            Snapchat users are still experiencing technical problems. We can bring you the latest from a spokesperson, who said: “We're aware that some Snapchatters are having issues using the app right now – hang tight, we're looking into it!”
    


            Meanwhile, a Canva spokesperson said the online graphic design tool had seen a temporary service disruption due to an issue with its cloud provider.
    


            “Service has now been restored for many users, and our teams are working closely with the provider to fully resolve the issue and restore access for everyone as quickly as possible… For updates, please visit status.canva.com.”
    


            Major UK banks were also affected by the outages that impacted websites globally this morning, according to Downdetector.co.uk, which tracks internet disruptions.
    


            These screenshots from earlier today show what Lloyds Bank and Halifax were among the banks affected.
    


            CNN has reached out to Lloyds Bank for comment.
    


            If you are one of the many people impacted by the Amazon Web Services issue which has caused today's global outage, we'd like to hear from you.
    


            Get in touch via the form below.
    


            In its latest statement, AWS says the issue that caused the mass outage has now been “fully mitigated.”
    


            All services should now be working as normal, it added, but “some requests may be throttled” while work on a full resolution continues.
    


            “The underlying DNS issue has been fully mitigated, and most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now,” the statement said.
    


            “Some requests may be throttled while we work toward full resolution. Additionally, some services are continuing to work through a backlog of events such as Cloudtrail and Lambda.”
    


            AWS said that, while most operations had recovered, some regions might still experience increased error rates. If this is the case, customers are urged to clear caches via their browser settings.

A problem at Amazon's cloud computing service disrupted internet use around the world early Monday, taking down dozens of online services, including social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games and chat app Signal.

About three hours after the outage began, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover from the problem. AWS provides behind-the-scenes cloud computing infrastructure to some of the world's biggest organizations. Its customers include government departments, universities and businesses, including The Associated Press.

Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system, which converts web addresses into IP addresses so websites and apps can load on internet-connected devices.

On DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many other services.

Coinbase and Signal both said on X that they were experiencing issues related to the outage.

Even Amazon's own services were not immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers reported that they were not working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.

This is not the first time issues with Amazon cloud services have caused widespread disruptions.

Many popular internet services were affected by a brief outage in 2023. AWS's longest outage in recent history occurred in late 2021, when a wide range of companies — from airlines and auto dealerships to payment apps and video streaming services — were affected for more than five hours. Outages also happened in 2020 and 2017.




The first signs of trouble emerged at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time, when AWS reported on its “health dashboard” that it was “investigating increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.”

Later, the company reported that there were “significant error rates” and that engineers were “actively working” on the problem.

Around 6 a.m. Eastern time, the company reported seeing recovery across most of the affected services and said it was working on a “full resolution.”

Sixty-four internal AWS services were affected, the company said. Amazon referred requests for comment to its AWS dashboard.

Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said “a slow and bumpy recovery process” is “entirely normal.”

As engineers roll out fixes across the cloud computing infrastructure, the process could trigger smaller disruptions, he said.

“It's similar to what happens after a large-scale power outage: While a city's power is coming back online, neighborhoods may see intermittent glitches as crews finish the repairs,” said Chapple, an information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.

Because much of the world now relies on three or four companies to provide the underlying infrastructure of the internet, “when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful” across many online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.

“The world now runs on the cloud,” and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity, Burgess said.

And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong, “it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,” Burgess said.

“The good news is that this kind of issue is usually relatively fast” to resolve, and there's no indication that it was caused by a cyberattack, Burgess said.

“This looks like a good old-fashioned technology issue. Something's gone wrong, and it will be fixed by Amazon,” he said.

There are “well-established processes” to deal with outages at AWS, as well as rivals Google and Microsoft, Burgess said, adding that such outages are usually fixed in “hours rather than days.”

PETERSBURG, Va. (AP) — Rae Pickett stepped onto Richell Hines' front stoop wearing a pink T-shirt that foretold the case she hoped to make to Virginia voters as she knocked on doors on a sunny Saturday in early October.

“Abortion is on the ballot,” it read.

Hines answered Pickett's knock on her Petersburg, Virginia, door with a disarming smile and a T-shirt of her own: “She who kneels before God can stand before anyone.”

The polite exchange that followed between Pickett and Hines revealed the complexity of one of the most vivid policy differences between the two women vying to be the first female governor of Virginia — Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. The winner will likely influence abortion law in the only Southern state that's maintained broad access to abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a national right to the procedure. 

Spanberger, a former congresswoman, supports a proposed state constitutional amendment that will reach voters only if Democrats maintain their House of Delegates majority. Earle-Sears, Virginia's lieutenant governor, has been an outspoken abortion rights opponent throughout her political career.

Both candidates have cast the other as an outlier on abortion. But they're also focusing on other matters, from Spanberger's emphasis on the economy to Earle-Sears' opposition to transgender people's rights.




Pickett, who works for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, specifically went to homes of Democratic voters. She quickly encouraged those who answered to vote. If those folks backed Democrats in the competitive House of Delegates district — regardless of their reasoning — she knew they were effectively voting for abortion rights, too.

“I do understand in some circumstances it's needed and others it's preventable,” Hines said when asked her views on abortion.

She added, sighing: “That's a hard one.”

Nationally, advocates across the abortion rights spectrum are watching Virginia for clues about how the issue might resonate in 2026 midterm campaigns, with control of Congress and dozens of statehouses at stake.

“We know that the elections here signal what the tone and temperature could be in other elections going forward,” said Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, which opposes abortion rights.

About 6 in 10 Virginia voters in the 2024 presidential election said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters. More than half of Virginia voters said they'd oppose banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide. Slightly fewer than half, 45%, said they'd favor such a restriction. 

Polling also indicates most people believe abortion should be allowed in some circumstances but not others, roughly in line with national numbers: 62% of U.S. voters last November said abortion should be legal in at least “most” cases.

In their recent debate, both candidates touched on the nuanced opinions of voters like Hines.

Earle-Sears sidestepped a question about abortion, which she once called “wicked” in a clip Spanberger has featured in an ad.

“It's not my view. It's going to be what the majority of Virginians want,” Earle-Sears said. “There's a constitutional amendment, and the voters will make that decision.”

Earle-Sears insisted Spanberger backs unfettered abortion access.

Spanberger remained silent for several seconds after Earle-Sears suggested she supported letting fully birthed infants die. 

“Abigail?” Earle-Sears said as the Democrat ignored the attack.

Spanberger countered by noting women who suffered life-threatening and, in some cases, fatal infections from pregnancy complications but could not receive medically necessary abortions in states that adopted restrictions after the 2022 Supreme Court decision.

“Women have died,” Spanberger said. “If my opponent were to become governor, that is what she would inflict upon Virginia.”

Earle-Sears shot back: “Don't lie like that.”

Spanberger, when asked about restrictions, opted first for a legalistic explanation of “the Roe standard” that Supreme Court justices overturned. She affirmed her support for the constitutional amendment that she argues would protect that standard. Pressed by moderators, she endorsed existing Virginia law that includes parental consent for minors seeking abortions and certain controls on third-trimester procedures.

Virginia Republicans assert the amendment threatens current limitations, especially the parental consent law. 

“The language is so vague,” said Turner, arguing women, including minors, could challenge any statutory limitation as violating a state constitutional right.

The proposed amendment requires one more approval from lawmakers before it can go to voters. Abortion rights supporters hold a one-vote edge in the House of Delegates.

Republicans have drawn attention to claims a Fairfax County school social worker helped students access abortion care in 2021, which officials described as untrue in their interim findings. Those claims are being investigated by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's administration and Fairfax County Public Schools, under the direction of the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Senate's health committee.

“I think everybody in the Commonwealth can agree that parents should know what their daughters are doing,” Del. Phillip Scott said at a Moms for Liberty town hall recently in Fairfax.

For now, Virginia Republicans have little hope of imposing tighter abortion restrictions because the state Senate's Democratic majority is not on the ballot this year. But in a state that elected Youngkin four years ago, voters could eventually pair a governor like Earle-Sears with a GOP-majority legislature, making way for tighter restrictions.

Tethering abortion to parents' rights, an issue that led to Youngkin's victory, resonated with some conservative parents.

Stephanie Lundquist-Arora, who spoke at the town hall, likened an abortion-related women's history display at a county high school to the “leftist rendition of the alphabet.” 

“Starting with ‘A is for abortion,' with an image of a coat hanger,” Lundquist-Arora said. The room gasped.

Abortion demand in Virginia has risen as other Southern states imposed new restrictions or effective bans.

“We are a destination state,” Turner lamented. 

Autumn Celeste, a spokesperson for the Charlottesville-based Blue Ridge Abortion Fund, said that during their fiscal year between 2021 and 2022, the organization helped 1,600 callers access abortion care and gave $578,000 to abortion clinics. Between 2024 and 2025, the clinic has supported 2,400 callers, Celeste said, an uptick straining the system. 

More than 17% of the more recent patrons were from Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. 

Despite potential consequences in Virginia and beyond, abortion is one of many issues voters are weighing.

About three-quarters of Virginia voters in the 2024 presidential election said abortion policy had an impact on which candidates they supported in that election, and about 7 in 10 said abortion policy was an important factor in their vote. Yet 4 in 10 Virginia voters said “the economy and jobs” was the most important issue facing the country at that time, and about 2 in 10 said it was immigration. About 1 in 10 Virginia voters said abortion was the nation's top issue, and a similar share named health care. 

Back in Petersburg, Hines said the cost of living worried her. She said she'd vote for Spanberger despite disagreeing with Democrats on some social issues. 

Still, her feelings toward abortion were complicated.

“I don't think it's my place to judge,” she said. “Only God can judge.”

A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.

About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months.

“That's a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.

“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn't implemented this public health effort,” he added. 

The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.

The effort hasn't yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.




Peanut allergy is caused when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.

For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King's College London, published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial. 

Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. 

The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.

Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.

Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. 

The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. 

However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. 

Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.

“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research & Education, or FARE. 

The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. 

“It doesn't have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”

Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.

At first, Leon's own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.

“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it's done now, these are the new guidelines,' I just though, OK, well, this is what we're going to do.”

TOKYO (AP) — Sanae Takaichi is on track to become Japan's first female prime minister, after her governing party secured a crucial coalition partner. 

Takaichi, 64, is set to replace Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tuesday's parliamentary vote. If she's successful, it would end Japan's three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the coalition's loss in the July parliamentary election.

The moderate centrist Komeito party had split from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party after a 26-year-long coalition. It came just days after Takaichi's election as LDP leader, and forced her into a desperate search for a new coalition partner to secure votes so that she can become prime minister.

The Buddhist-backed Komeito left after raising concerns about Takaichi's ultraconservative politics and the LDP's lax response to corruption scandals that led to the party's consecutive election defeats and loss of majority in both houses.

While the leaders of the country's top three opposition parties failed to unite to seek a change of government, Takaichi went for a quick fix by teaming up with the most conservative of them: the Osaka-based Ishin no Kai, or Japan Innovation Party. The two parties on Monday signed a coalition agreement that includes joint policy goals on diplomacy, security and energy.

The fragile new coalition, still a minority in the legislature, would need cooperation from other opposition groups to pass any legislation. 

Big diplomatic tests await the government will come within days — talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and regional summits. At home, Takaichi needs to quickly tackle rising prices and come up with economic stimulus measures to appease the frustrated public.

An admirer of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi's breaking of the glass ceiling makes history in a country whose gender equality ranks poorly internationally. 

But many women aren't celebrating, and some see her impending premiership as a setback. 

“The prospect of a first female prime minister doesn't make me happy,” sociologist Chizuko Ueno posted on X. Ueno said that Takaichi's leadership would elevate Japan's gender equality ranking, but “that doesn't mean Japanese politics becomes kinder to women.”

Takaichi, an ultraconservative star of her male-dominated party, is among those who have stonewalled measures for women's advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family's male-only succession, opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the civil law allowing separate last names for married couples, so women don't get pressured into abandoning theirs.

“Ms. Takaichi's policies are extremely hawkish and I doubt she would consider policies to recognize diversity,” said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper.

If she's successful in the parliamentary vote, Takaichi would immediately launch her Cabinet on Tuesday and make a policy speech later in the week.

A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to emulate his economic and security policies. 

She would have only a few days to prepare for diplomatic talks at regional summits, and with Trump in between. She is expected to keep ties with China and South Korea stable, despite concerns over her revisionist views on wartime history and past visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.

The shrine honors Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as a lack of remorse about Japan's wartime past.

Takaichi supports a stronger military, currently undergoing a five-year buildup with the annual defense budget doubled to 2% of gross domestic product by 2027. Trump is expected to demand that Japan increase its military spending to NATO targets of 5% of GDP, and purchase more U.S. weapons. 

Takaichi also needs to follow up on Japan's pledge of investing $550 billion in the U.S. as part of a U.S. tariff deal.

Her policy plans have focused on short-term measures such as battling rising prices and improving salaries and subsidies, as well as restrictions against a growing foreign population as Japan faces a rise in xenophobia. Takaichi hasn't addressed bigger issues like demographic challenges. 

Takaichi's mission is to regain conservative votes by pushing the party further to the right. The LDP's coalition with the right-wing JIP may fit Takaichi's view. 

On Friday, Takaichi sent a religious ornament instead of going to the Yasukuni Shrine, apparently to avoid a diplomatic dispute with Beijing and Seoul. She also reached out to smaller opposition groups, including the far-right Sanseito, apparently in a bid to bring her coalition closer to securing a majority in parliament. 

“There is no room for Takaichi to show her true colors. All she can do is cooperate per policy,” said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University political science professor. “It's a pathetic situation.”

Many observers expect a Takaichi government wouldn't last long and an early election may follow this year. 

Experts also raised concerns about how Takaichi, a fiscal expansionist, can coordinate economic policies with Ishin's fiscal conservative views. 

“The era of LDP domination is over and we are entering the era of multiparty politics. The question is how to form a coalition,” Sato said, noting a similar trend in Europe. “We need to find a Japanese way of forming a coalition and a stable government.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his reportedly tense meeting with U.S President Donald Trump last week was “positive” — even though he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine — and emphasized what he said is continued American interest in economic deals with Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said Trump reneged on the possibility of sending the long-range missiles to Ukraine, which would have been a major boost for Kyiv, following his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin hours before the Ukrainian leader and American president were to meet on Friday.

“In my opinion, he does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Sunday. His comments were embargoed until Monday morning.

Ukraine is hoping to purchase 25 Patriot air defense systems from American firms using frozen Russian assets and assistance from partners, but Zelenskyy said procuring all of these would require time because of long production queues. He said he spoke to Trump about help procuring these quicker, potentially from European partners.

According to Zelenskyy, Trump said during their meeting that Putin's maximalist demand — that Ukraine cede the entirety of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions — was unchanged. 

Zelenskyy was diplomatic about his meeting with Trump despite reports that he faced pressure to accept Putin's demands — a tactic he has kept up since the disastrous Oval Office spat on Feb. 28 when the Ukrainian president was scolded on live television for not being grateful for continued American support. 




Zelenskyy said that because Trump ultimately supported a freeze along the current front line his overall message “is positive” for Ukraine.

He said Trump was looking to end the war and hopes his meeting in the coming weeks with Putin in Hungary — which does not support Ukraine — will pave the way for a peace deal after their first summit in Alaska in August failed to reach such an outcome.

So far, Zelenskyy said he has not been invited to attend but would consider it if the format for talks were fair to Kyiv.

“We share President Trump's positive outlook if it leads to the end of the war. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive — that we stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides understand what is meant,” Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy expressed doubts about Hungary's capital of Budapest being a suitable location for the next Trump-Putin meeting. 

“I do not consider Budapest to be the best venue for such a meeting. Obviously, if it can bring peace, it will not matter which country hosts the meeting,” he added.

Zelenskyy took a stab at Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, saying he does not believe that a prime minister “who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution.”

Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about Putin's proposal to swap some territory it holds in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions if Ukraine surrenders all of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 

“We wanted to understand exactly what the Russians meant. So far, there is no clear position,” he said.

Zelenskyy said he thinks that all parties have “moved closer” to a possible end to the war. 

“That doesn't mean it will definitely end, but President Trump has achieved a lot in the Middle East, and riding that wave he wants to end Russia's war against Ukraine,” Zelenskyy added.

He said the United States is interested in bilateral gas projects with Ukraine, including the construction of an LNG terminal in the southern port city of Odesa. Other projects of interest to the U.S. include those related to nuclear energy and oil.

Michaela Renee Johnson says fear is a natural response to seeing the recent aviation disasters — and shares thoughts on how people can ultimately tackle their fear. 

New details have emerged surrounding the tragic plane crash that killed country music songwriter Brett James, the man behind Carrie Underwood's hit ""Jesus, Take the Wheel.""

According to a new report released by The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and obtained by People magazine, James departed from John C. Tune Airport (JCA) in Nashville, heading for Macon County Airport (MCA) in Franklin, North Carolina, before the fatal crash on Sept. 18. There were three passengers total, including James, his wife Melody Carole, 59, and her daughter Meryl Wilson, 28. There were no survivors. 

Per the report, at around 2:48 p.m. local time, James approached MCA to land, reporting that he was at 6,800 feet and ""intended to perform a 360° turn to land"" on the runway.

Air traffic control received no further transmissions from James after that, according to the report.

The plane reportedly began ""a descending left turn from 6,300 ft"" and made a full turn before approaching the runway at 3,300 feet.

""Surveillance video showed the airplane flying over the runway before initiating a descending left turn. The airplane continued descending in the left turn before entering a tightening spiral and impacting the ground,"" the NTSB said in the report. The plane was ""rocking from side-to-side"" and eventually began ""rolling inverted and descending behind a tree line,"" the report stated, per People.

No signs of engine failure were found in NTSB's investigation. The aircraft was recovered and is undergoing further examination.

A representative for the NTSB did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

Just months before his untimely death, James shared a heartfelt moment with his loved ones. On June 16, he was all smiles as he posted a family photo.

""Such an amazing Father's Day!!"" James captioned the Instagram post.

Republican New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli discusses the tight race against Mikie Sherrill, his response to her claims on opioid deaths and more on ‘Fox News Sunday.'

With the November election just 15 days out, the Republican nominee in one of the nation's only two races for governor this year is feeling confident.

""The energy across the state is electric. The reception in minority communities has been great, and on being endorsed by prominent Democrats, that tells you all you need to know in terms of the people of New Jersey wanting change. And that's what this election is all about. Change,"" Jack Ciattarelli said this weekend in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Ciattarelli, who's making his third straight run for Garden State governor and who nearly upset Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago, has good reason to be optimistic he can pull off victory in blue-leaning New Jersey.

In a state where registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans despite a GOP surge in registration this decade, three public opinion polls released last week — from Fox News, Quinnipiac University and Fairleigh Dickinson University — indicated Ciattarelli narrowing the gap with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in the race to succeed the term-limited Murphy.

The Fox News poll conducted Oct. 10 – 14, put Sherrill at 50% support among likely voters, with Ciattarelli at 45%. Sherrill's 5-point advantage was down from an 8-point lead in Fox News' September survey in New Jersey.

New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states to hold gubernatorial showdowns in the year after a presidential election, and the contests traditionally grab outsized attention and are viewed as political barometers ahead of the following year's midterm elections.

And this year, they're being viewed, in part, as ballot-box referendums on President Donald Trump's unprecedented and combustible second-term agenda.

While Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in blue-leaning New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past 10 elections.

And Trump made major gains in New Jersey in last year's presidential election, losing the state by only six percentage points, a major improvement over his 16-point deficit four years earlier.

Ciattarelli, interviewed by Fox News Digital last week in Bayonne, New Jersey, noted that he ""made big gains"" in his 2021 showing ""in Hudson County and Passaic County,"" two long-time Democratic Party strongholds.

""And the President did very, very well in '24 in those very same counties. And if you take a look at who's been endorsing me, including some very prominent Democrats here in Hudson County, people want change,"" Ciattarelli emphasized.

But Ciattarelli is also aiming to energize Republican base voters in what's likely to be a low-turnout election.

Multiple sources confirmed to Fox News that Trump will hold a tele-rally with Ciattarelli ahead of Election Day. Trump's teaming up with Ciattarelli may help energize MAGA supporters, many of whom are low propensity voters who often skip casting ballots in non-presidential election years.

And last week, Ciattarelli was joined at a jam-packed diner stop in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, by Vivek Ramaswamy, the MAGA rock star who is running for governor next year in his home state of Ohio.

Ramaswamy, the multimillionaire biotech entrepreneur and conservative commentator who pushed an ""America First 2.0"" platform as he ran for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before ending his bid and becoming one of Trump's top supporters and surrogates, told Fox News Digital that a Ciattarelli win this year would ""set the table for even bigger and more decisive victories, hopefully in places like Ohio next year.""

And this week another well-known Republican politician in MAGA world is headed to New Jersey.

Fox News has learned the Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, a top House ally of the president who has Trump's backing as he runs next year for Florida governor, will team up with Ciattarelli on Wednesday.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, commenting on why Republicans feel bullish about the New Jersey showdown, raised concerns.

""New Jersey is the best place, probably, for Donald Trump to actually stop the Democratic momentum — or at least minimize the Democratic momentum that we've seen throughout this year,"" Martin said in a Politico interview. 

But the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) forecasts a Sherrill victory in two weeks.

""As numerous polls show her holding a strong lead and earning more than 50% of the vote, Mikie Sherrill is rising to meet the moment in this incredibly competitive race,"" DGA spokesperson Izzi Levy told Fox News. ""It's clear that Mikie has the momentum, and that New Jersey voters are all-in to reject Ciattarelli for a third time this November.""

Sherrill had plenty of company on the campaign trail this weekend from major Democratic Party surrogates, including two of the biggest names in the party — Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Wes Moore of Maryland.

""From Maryland to New Jersey, we're united with one goal – making sure every voice is heard at the ballot box,"" Moore wrote on social media. ""Proud to stand with @MikieSherrill and community members in Newark to get out the vote. Let's finish strong this November!""

And former President Barack Obama endorsed Sherrill and starred in a new ad for the party's nominee.

CIATTARELLI WELCOMES TRUMP'S HELP IN FINAL STRETCH IN BATTLE FOR NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR

While Trump isn't on the ballot, he's loomed large over the New Jersey gubernatorial election.

At the second and final debate two weeks ago, Sherrill charged that her GOP rival had ""shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA, and he's shown every sign of being that.""

Asked whether he considered himself part of the MAGA movement, Ciattarelli said he was ""part of a New Jersey movement.""

When asked to grade the president's performance so far during his second term, Ciattarelli said, ""I'd certainly give the president an A. I think he's right about everything that he's doing.""

""I think that tells us all we need to know about who Jack Ciattarelli's supporting. I give him an F right now,"" Sherrill responded, as she pointed to New Jersey's high cost of living.

The race in New Jersey was rocked a couple of weeks ago by a report that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, mistakenly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information like her Social Security number, to a Ciattarelli ally. 

But Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal.

Sherrill, who was never accused of cheating in the scandal, went on to serve nearly a decade in the Navy, flying helicopters.

The showdown was jolted again two weeks ago after Sherrill's allegations that Ciattarelli was ""complicit"" with pharmaceutical companies in the opioid deaths of tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, as she pointed to the medical publishing company he owned that pushed content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain.

Last week, Trump set off a political hand grenade in the race, as he ""terminated"" billions of federal dollars for the Gateway Project, which is funding a new train tunnel under the Hudson River connecting New Jersey and New York.

Sherrill, holding a news conference Thursday at a major commuter rail station just a few miles from the site of the tunnels in one of the busiest train corridors in the nation, called the project ""critical"" as she took aim at Trump and Ciattarelli.

""I'm fighting for the people of New Jersey. He's fighting to excuse Trump. It's unacceptable,"" Sherrill charged.

New Jersey traditionally elects a governor from the party out of power in the White House, which this year favors the Democrats.

But Garden State voters haven't elected a governor from the same party in three straight elections in over a half century, which would favor the Republicans.

One of those political trends will be busted in next month's election.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest developments in the government shutdown on 'Special Report.'

Government shutdowns can be pretty boring.

Until a shutdown impacts you.

There's a missed paycheck. Flight delays. You can't visit the Smithsonian. Questions about food and drug safety.

You get the idea.

But until you reach that tipping point, most Americans are ho-hum about government shutdowns and interpret the infighting between Democrats and Republicans as de rigueur on Capitol Hill.

So they don't pay much mind to them.

However, Democrats engineered a scheme in advance of this fall's government shutdown. They would transmogrify the shutdown into something Americans care about: healthcare.

DEMOCRATS STRUGGLE FOR COHESIVE MESSAGING STRATEGY AMID SHUTDOWN STANDOFF

Democrats know that healthcare consistently polls well with voters. Democrats have known for months that many people who receive their healthcare coverage via ""Obamacare exchanges"" would absorb a marked price spike with their premiums early next year. Moreover, notices informing people about the impending price increase would start to hit mailboxes in mid-October.

So Democrats have pleaded with Republicans to subsidize Obamacare to defray looming price increases. Obamacare subsidies and the government shutdown aren't directly connected. But Democrats believed they could link the two. And then, after people snored off to sleep about the government shutdown on Oct. 1, they were rudely awakened by a notice in the mail that their healthcare premiums were about to jump.

Say what you will about the tactics, but it was a shrewd strategy by Democrats to seize on an issue important to their base. Moreover, it gave the party the opportunity to show voters that it's ""fighting"" against President Donald Trump. That's something which didn't happen in the March funding round. In fact, the Democrats' lack of fighting is what set a match to an internecine fight among Democrats about how to combat the president. The public and the government are absorbing the flames of that internal conflagration now, but Democrats may have found a way to salve those wounds.

""Fighting for healthcare is our defining issue,"" said House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., in an exclusive sit-down interview with Fox News. ""Shutdowns are terrible and there will be families that are going to suffer. We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.""

That's why healthcare is the linchpin to the shutdown.

But enter Republicans. They believe Democrats own the healthcare crisis. They passed Obamacare in the first place. It was a Democratic Congress under President Joe Biden that boosted the subsidy to defray the cost of Obamacare in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the touchstone of the Democrats' legislative agenda.

""It is the Democrats who created that subsidy who put the expiration date on it. They did it all on their own,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Some Republicans have even reverted to their 2010 mantra to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare.

That said, Johnson tried to beat back those calls from conservatives.

DEMOCRATS ROLL OUT NEW CAMPAIGN ADS TARGETING REPUBLICANS OVER ONGOING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks to the media next to Vice President JD Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on the day President Donald Trump met with top congressional leaders from both parties ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government, at the White House in Washington, Sept. 29, 2025. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

""There's no way to repeal and replace it because it's too deeply ingrained right now. We have to improve it,"" said Johnson.

Such a declaration would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Here we have a Republican Speaker of the House arguing that Congress must sustain — even assist — Obamacare.

""Obamacare has been a failure,"" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., on Fox News. ""We've been enduring this now for almost 15 years.""

Stutzman benefited from the GOP's plan to ditch Obamacare in 2010. It was an historic, 63-seat midterm election pickup for Republicans. Voters sent Stutzman to Washington for the first time in that midterm.

The Indiana Republican added that he's ""not sure that subsidies are the answer in the long run.""

""Every couple of years they need more and more subsidies to be able to prop [Obamacare] up because it's not affordable,"" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., on Fox Business Network.

Democrats are demanding Obamacare subsidies before they agree to a Republican plan to fund the government.

""It is an inflection point in this budget process where we have tried to get the Republicans to meet with us and prioritize the American people,"" said Clark.

But Republicans believe the need to boost Obamacare reveals flaws in the law.

""Isn't that an indictment that there's a problem with [Obamacare]?"" I asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. ""The fact that it needs to be propped up in some form?""

""No,"" replied Jeffries. ""The overwhelming majority of the American people, including in the Republican-run states, support an extension of the [Obamacare] tax credits.""

Some Republicans reject extending the subsidies.

""I'm not going to vote to extend these subsidies. They're through the roof expensive,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

But other conservatives insist that Obamacare needs rescuing.

""If you're on [Obamacare] your premium is going to literally double. If you have your own private health insurance policy, your premium is going to go up and people already can't afford their premiums,"" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. ""People back at home are going, ‘Wait a minute, my premium is going to skyrocket.'""

Greene is one of the most outspoken members of her party when it comes to concerns about the premium increases. In fact, she believes that Republicans allowed ""Democrats to hold the moral high ground on it, because they're talking about it.""

Greene and Johnson spoke about her concerns several days ago.

But Obamacare vexed the GOP for years.

Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and others led an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. House Republicans voted dozens of times to wipe out Obamacare in 2011 and 2012. They couldn't push such a package through the Senate, but it made for a powerful GOP talking point. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., got a little closer. Republicans had the Senate in 2016. So the House and Senate both voted for the first time to repeal and replace Obamacare, but President Barack Obama vetoed it.

Republicans finally had the trifecta of the House, Senate and White House in 2017 after Trump won the election. The House initially stumbled, having to yank the repeal and replace package off the floor in the spring of 2017. But the House regrouped and finally engineered a strategy that passed. But the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., single-handedly tanked the bill when he famously voted against the package in a dramatic roll call vote in the summer of 2017.

DEMS IN THE HOT SEAT AFTER OBAMACARE'S SPIKING PREMIUM COSTS TORPEDO THEIR NARRATIVE

""I still have PTSD from the experience,"" said Johnson of the GOP efforts.

Trump even offered a familiar, if well-traveled promise, during last year's campaign.

""I have concepts of a plan,"" the president said at the ABC presidential debate last fall. ""You'll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.""

So while a resolution to the government shutdown remains elusive, so do the positions about one of the most controversial pieces of legislation in the past 50 years.

Republicans have tried to flip the script on the Democrats — now highlighting the problems with Obamacare. The GOP hopes that rekindles a familiar antipathy the right has for Obamacare and helps them during the shutdown.

""Obamacare is a failed product in the first place. And they used that as an excuse in order to add additional federal dollars,"" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D.

The sides just don't see eye-to-eye.

""When [Obamacare] was passed, healthcare was a lot less costly than it is now, and insurance rates were a lot lower. So these healthcare tax credits are necessary for healthcare inflation to make it affordable for people,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

Obamacare and the shutdown are now inextricably linked. And if dealing with that wasn't complicated enough, the infusion of Obamacare into the debate makes the legislative morass seemingly intractable.

Speaker Mike Johnson tells ABC's ""This Week"" why he thinks Democrats are to blame for the shutdown and defended the Pentagon's new press policy.

FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans' campaign arm is announcing it brought in nearly $24 million in the months of July through September this year.

More than half of that — roughly $13.95 million — came in September, as Republicans were readying for a political messaging war over federal funding.

That fight is still ongoing now, more than halfway through October. The government has been shut down for 20 days as Republicans and Democrats are still in disagreement over federal spending.

The National Republican Congressional Committee's (NRCC) $13.95 million haul represents its best September in a non-election year and a 50% increase from the previous comparable September in 2023.

The NRCC is ending the third quarter with nearly $46 million cash on hand and nearly $93 million raised in 2025 alone.

In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, NRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., pointed out that House Republicans already voted to keep the federal government funded last month and touted the GOP base propelling his group ahead of the 2026 elections.

""House Republicans are firing on all cylinders. Our majority funded the federal government, and we're delivering for working families and building unstoppable momentum heading into 2026,"" Hudson said.

""With President Trump leading the charge and voters rallying behind our conservative agenda, we're raising record-breaking resources to hold the House and grow our majority,"" he said.

Republicans are battling to keep the House in next year's midterm elections, which have historically been unfavorable to the party in power. The GOP has held the House majority since 2023.

But GOP leaders have expressed confidence in their agenda and in the White House, while arguing the Democratic Party is facing a lack of cohesion and disapproval of its policies by American voters.

The NRCC outpaced its counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) in the previous quarter of 2025, raising $32.3 million compared to the DCCC's $29.1 million.

The DCCC ended the year with more cash on hand, however, with $39.7 million compared to the NRCC's $37.6 million.

Republicans are accusing Democrats of holding the federal government hostage by refusing to vote for their funding bill unless partisan healthcare demands are met.

Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that Republicans are risking the healthcare costs of millions of Americans by not including an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire this year without congressional action.

The House passed a seven-week federal funding bill largely along party lines on Sept. 19. It has been stalled in the Senate, however, where at least several Democrats are needed to hit the chamber's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster.

Colorado Bankers Association CEO and President Jenifer Waller explains why one blue state continues to rank near the top for bank robberies despite nationwide declines and how banks are responding to new threats.

Despite a national decline in bank robberies over the past several years, Colorado remains among the top states for these crimes — a fact that concerns local banking leaders who report an uptick in heists. 

According to the FBI, Colorado recorded 104 bank robberies in 2023, the most recent year with data available. That ranked third in the nation behind California (192) and Illinois (116).

Jenifer Waller, chief executive officer and president of the Colorado Bankers Association, said the state's high ranking is nothing new.

""Colorado, unfortunately, has always been high in robbery,"" Waller said. ""We compete with California and a few other states for the number one position on bank robberies.""

BRAZEN BLUE STATE JEWELRY STORE HEIST CAUGHT ON CAMERA AS ARMED MOB MAKES OFF WITH $1M IN MERCHANDISE: POLICE

While incidents declined after 2021, when Colorado had 191 bank robberies, Waller said the trend appears to be edging upward again.

""We saw what I would consider a drastic increase a little over a year ago,"" she added. ""Some of our member banks have noticed a slight uptick again in recent months.""

That concern has been echoed by law enforcement agencies across the state — including in Aurora, where police recently responded to an armed bank robbery that underscored how quickly these crimes can escalate.

On Sept. 24, Aurora police were called to a BMO Bank branch after a man pulled a gun on a teller and demanded cash.

""A man walked in, went straight to the middle counter, pulled out a gun, put it into one of the employees' faces and demanded money,"" an Aurora Police Department (APD) spokesperson told Fox News Digital. 

The suspect fled with about $1,000. Detectives identified him as 41-year-old Matthew Procella, and three days later — aided by a license-plate reader hit — officers located his vehicle and arrested Procella without incident.

The APD said that while the department doesn't separately track bank-robbery data, overall robbery in the city is down 36.3% year-to-date, alongside a 40% increase in arrests.

The FBI declined to comment, citing the ongoing government shutdown.

When asked what might be fueling this increase, Waller admitted it's a complex issue with no clear cause.

BLUE STATE'S CRIME ‘CRISIS' THREATENING TOURISM, COLLEGE PARENTS AND KILLING SMALL BUSINESSES: REPORT

""I've often questioned if the easy access to highways and interstates doesn't aid in bank robberies here,"" she said. ""But I don't have a solid answer. It could also be a downturn economically that motivates it — we have seen that in the past.""

Colorado banks are taking proactive steps to deter robberies and protect both customers and employees. Many of these security upgrades were accelerated by pandemic protocols and have continued as permanent deterrents.

""Banks are very proactive. Our number one priority is ensuring the safety of our customers and employees in any robbery situation,"" Waller said. ""One thing we saw implemented ... is where banks' doors would be locked and the customers would have to get access to come inside the bank. We've seen banks continue that as a means of security.""

Banks are also leaning on technology, including dye packs, advanced cameras and continued employee training. Some institutions have opted to employ armed guards as a further deterrent.

Despite the high numbers, most bank robberies in Colorado are nonviolent, Waller said.

""The majority of robberies in Colorado and nationwide are note jobs and nonviolent robberies,"" Waller explained. ""Usually not even a gun is drawn.""

Still, even nonviolent robberies take an emotional toll.

""Bank robbery isn't a victimless crime,"" Waller said. ""Those involved — employees and customers alike — experience a certain amount of stress, even if it's just a note job.""

While physical robberies remain a major concern, fraud and scams are rapidly increasing — particularly involving check-washing schemes and organized crime groups exploiting vulnerable individuals to cash fraudulent checks.

""It surprises me, but we're seeing a rise in old-fashioned check washing,"" Waller said. ""Law enforcement has identified organized criminal activity behind it.""

In addition to traditional bank robberies, Colorado is beginning to see a dangerous crime trend known as ""jugging,"" which had previously been more common in other parts of the country.

""We're starting to see that in Colorado,"" Waller said. ""Jugging is when an individual is robbed after taking a withdrawal or carrying cash. We're reminding customers to stay aware of their surroundings and not leave bank bags in vehicles.""

Banks and law enforcement agencies are responding with public education campaigns focused on situational awareness and safe handling of cash.

Waller credited the FBI and the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force for their strong partnership with financial institutions.

""The FBI is extremely helpful,"" she said. ""The Task Force does a phenomenal job of identifying and convicting bank robbery. We're very pleased with the support we get.""

Waller noted that historically, about 80% of bank robberies were solved within 24 months, though she emphasized she did not have a current figure.

For customers who might find themselves in a robbery situation, Waller offered simple but firm advice.

""You just comply with the robber's demands immediately,"" she advised. ""After the fact, you write down everything you can remember… without talking to anyone else so no one influences your memory. The most important thing is for a customer not to try to intervene.""

As bank crimes evolve, Colorado's financial institutions continue to adapt — balancing technology, vigilance and customer safety.

""Customer and employee safety is our number one priority,"" Waller emphasized.

While Colorado may not currently top the list of states with the most bank robberies, the rise in new criminal tactics and fraud schemes remains a concern — one that Colorado's financial institutions are watching closely.

Fruit is widely regarded as a healthy food — but is there such a thing as too much? Harvard researcher Nick Norwitz explores the benefits and risks of consuming large quantities of different types of fruit.

If your digestive system's been a bit sluggish, scientists have found some new solutions — including a fruit you might already have at home.

Researchers in the United Kingdom recently published new guidelines in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics about the foods that can relieve constipation.

In an Oct. 13 news release, King's College London said the research is the ""first ever evidence-based dietary guidelines for adults with chronic constipation.""

GREEK YOGURT HAS 'AMAZING BENEFITS' FOR THE BODY AFTER WORKOUTS, NEW STUDY SAYS

The main recommendations are kiwi, rye bread and mineral water — all of which appear to improve bowel regularity.

It turns out that eating plain fiber isn't enough, according to researchers.

""Our guidelines found that there simply isn't enough evidence to suggest [fiber] actually works in constipation specifically. Instead, our research reveals some new dietary strategies that could indeed help patients,"" study author Eirini Dimidi said. 

""At the same time, we urgently need more high-quality trials to strengthen the evidence on what works and what doesn't.""

Jason Heiselman, a New York-based certified nutritionist and professional chef at Hungryroot, told Fox News Digital that kiwis contain vitamin E and an enzyme called actinidin, which can speed up digestion and combat bloating.

""Feels like a no-brainer to include a few slices with any meal,"" said Heiselman, who was not involved with the new study. ""Pairing kiwi with some good fat sources like seeds, nuts or full-fat dairy allows your body to absorb more nutrients.""

""It's also absolutely delicious,"" added Heiselman.

If you don't have a sweet tooth for fruit salads and kiwi smoothie bowls, the fruit is an ""underutilized element"" in savory dishes, he said.

The chef, whose family is Sicilian, is well-acquainted with kiwis, as they've grown on the island of Etna since the early 1900s. 

""Raw kiwi slices often make their way to my dinner table,"" he said.

A massive internet outage on Monday morning caused panic, leaving many of the world's largest online sites inoperable.

A problem at an Amazon Web Services facility in northern Virginia knocked out many websites, messaging platforms, banks, and other internet-based services, according to reports.

Among the sites affected by the outage are Amazon webpages and services, Snapchat, Grammarly, Canva, and Ring. Streaming services such as Hulu, Disney+, and Roku were also down due to the outage, as were the cryptocurrency site Coinbase, the financial services site Robinhood, the rideshare service Lyft, the popular game Fortnite, the foreign language educational app Duolingo, numerous banks from around the world, and many others.

The New York Times reported that the internet outage affected travelers at LaGuardia Airport in New York City, as “kiosks appeared to not work and apps were down.” Later, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were also included among the companies with outages.

A list of all the sites and services disrupted can be found here.

The cloud service company initially reported outages at 12:11 a.m. Pacific time, revealing “increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.” At 2:01 a.m., the company posted the following message: 

“We have identified a potential root cause for error rates for the DynamoDB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region,” AWS said in an update. “Based on our investigation, the issue appears to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-EAST-1. We are working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery. This issue also affects other AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region. Global services or features that rely on US-EAST-1 endpoints such as IAM updates and DynamoDB Global tables may also be experiencing issues. During this time, customers may be unable to create or update Support Cases.”

TRUMP REPUDIATES 25 YEARS OF FAILED DEMOCRACY PROMOTION

At 2:27 a.m., AWS reported progress on the outage, stating it has seen “significant signs of recovery.” 

“Most requests should now be succeeding,” AWS said. “We continue to work through a backlog of queued requests. We will continue to provide additional information.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump scored a victory for consumers on Friday by effectively blocking a United Nations carbon tax scheme for at least a year. The battle isn't over yet, as the Trump administration still needs to convince 40 other nations to abandon what would be the world's first global carbon tax.

It comes from the International Maritime Organization, which was created by the U.N. in 1948 and is the implementing international agency for several international treaties, including the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, otherwise known as MARPOL. MARPOL was signed in 1973 after a number of oil tanker accidents, and in 1997, MARPOL Annex VI gave the IMO jurisdiction over shipping air emissions as well.

In 2018, the IMO adopted its initial greenhouse gas emissions strategy, a regulatory effort that eventually became a draft “Net-Zero Framework” that was set to be approved by IMO voting members on Friday.

THE DAWN OF TRUMP'S NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE

If adopted, the Net-Zero Framework would charge vessels of more than 5,000 gross tons between $100 and $380 for every ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, depending on how badly each vessel overshot an emissions target set by the IMO. The stated goal is to end the use of oil in shipping, reducing the sector's net emissions to zero by 2050.

Global shipping is responsible for just 2% of all greenhouse gas emissions each year, meaning that eliminating all its emissions would have virtually no impact on global climate or temperatures. But the impact of the first global carbon tax would be at least $10 billion a year. That is what proponents, not critics, say. U.N. bureaucrats would then waste the $10 billion on whatever corrupt kickbacks struck their fancy.

While the United States is both a member of the IMO and a signatory to MARPOL Annex VI, nothing in the Net-Zero Framework specifies what would happen to countries that ignore the agreement. Only about 1% of all cargo ships are owned by the U.S., and the flag state of each vessel, the nation where it is registered, would be authorized to collect the tax. The Net-Zero Framework also empowers inspectors to assess the carbon tax at any port a vessel stops at to offload or load cargo.

The Trump administration has always opposed any international environmental agreement that harms our national interests. Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced strict measures they would take against any country that voted to approve the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework. These include visa restrictions, commercial penalties from contracts with the federal government, port fees, and increased tariffs.

A BAD DAY FOR RACIAL GERRYMANDERING AT THE SUPREME COURT

This worked, with Singapore and Saudi Arabia leading the effort to delay a final vote on the framework for at least a year. In total, 57 countries, including the U.S., voted in favor of delaying the measure, 49 voted against, and 21 abstained. The IMO needs two-thirds of the votes to approve the framework before it can become legally binding.

Trump's success at blocking the carbon tax is a victory for common sense and American sovereignty. For decades, global bureaucrats have used climate policy as a pretext to siphon billions of dollars from productive nations into corrupt international schemes that punish workers and consumers. By standing up to the IMO's climate crusade, Trump defended affordable energy, economic growth, and national independence. But this fight isn't over. The same oligarchy that sought to tax global trade will be back next year. America must remain vigilant and continue leading the world away from destructive globalism and toward true energy freedom.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump revealed that he will be slapping a new tariff on Colombia, the latest move in his war on drug trafficking in South America.

Trump told reporters on Sunday night that he will announce the specific rate on Monday, while calling the country a “drug manufacturing machine” with a “lunatic” for president.

The move to impose additional tariffs on Colombia was already teased by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who met with Trump earlier in the day.

In a statement after that meeting, Graham called the new levies “major” ones.

“Those who continue to be involved in narcoterrorism against the United States will pay a very heavy price,” he added.

Trump has been feuding with Colombian President Gustavo Petro for months, which seemingly culminated on Sunday.

In a blistering Truth Social post, Trump trashed Petro as an “illegal drug leader” who has been “strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia.”

TRUMP THREATENS TO STRIKE COLOMBIAN DRUG FIELDS, CUTS SUBSIDIES TO COUNTRY

Trump then threatened to strike these drug production facilities and cut all U.S. subsidies to Colombia, which he said “are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.”

Petro has responded to these threats and actions from Trump by denying he's a drug trafficker, saying that “in my heart there is no greed.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Shrapnel from the 250th anniversary celebration for the U.S. Marine Corps on Saturday struck and damaged a law enforcement officer's vehicle along a major California highway. 

An artillery round fired from one of the weapons used in the “Sea to Shore — A Review of Amphibious Strength” celebration prematurely exploded in the air over Interstate 5 freeway, read a press release from the California Highway Patrol. The shrapnel hit the patrol vehicle at 1:45 p.m. local time, “where the CHP had elected to stop traffic during the live-fire exercise,” resulting in a dent and scratch on the highway patrol car's hood, according to reports. The celebration occurred at Camp Pendleton near San Diego.

CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said the incident was a rarity.

“This was an unusual and concerning situation,” Coronado said. “It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.”

No injuries were reported from the debris, and the only known damage from the falling shrapnel was the CHP car. Officers notified the USMC, who were on assignment at the location of the incident, and “then canceled firing additional live ordnance over the freeway, and the area was swept for further evaluation,” the CHP said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) criticized Vice President JD Vance and the Trump administration over the incident in a social media post on Sunday. Vance, a former Marine, was the keynote speaker for the USMC celebration event.

We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects.https://t.co/vQ3epSTvyh

“We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects,” Newsom posted.

His comments echo remarks he made last week when he called the celebration a “vanity parade” and rebuked the Trump administration for supposed plans to close the interstate due to the festivities. 

“Donald Trump and JD Vance think that shutting down the I-5 to shoot out missiles from ships is how you respect the military,” Newsom posted on Oct. 15. 

“PUT ASIDE YOUR VANITY PARADE AND PAY OUR TROOPS INSTEAD,” he added.

The CHP said it was evaluating and filing an internal report on the incident. It added that it would offer a “recommendation to conduct an additional after-action review into the planning, communication, and coordination between federal, state, and local government” to ensure necessary steps would be implemented to “strengthen protocols for future demonstrations and training events near public roadways.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Is there a social phenomenon that's as infuriating—and as commonplace?

Ghosting existed in some form long before modern technology made it ubiquitous. “Disappearing without word or warning is no doubt as old as the human race,” the cultural theorist Dominic Pettman notes in his slim new book, Ghosting. The infant first detecting maternal absence, the pet abandoned in an alley, the friend suddenly iced out have all felt the sudden departure of someone who was expected to be there. What has changed in recent years, Pettman argues, is the ease—and cruelty—with which people can enter and exit one another's lives. Today's version of ghosting, he writes, “is abandonment with a contemporary garnish”; a plethora of options for ignoring others have turned it into a “universal, even banal, experience.” Or, as he puts it pithily, “when we came up with texting, we also came up with not texting.”

I was curious to read Pettman's book, because I'd been thinking about the banality of ghosting—or, rather, how it can seem so commonplace as to be expected and, at the same time, be hurtful and infuriating. Culturally, ghosting is a paradox. It can be something you brush off even as it lives rent-free in your head. It's still considered rude, and people on both sides tend to feel bad about it, albeit in different ways. It's also extremely common: 90 percent of respondents to one 2021 study reported that they had ghosted someone. Last month, the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd bemoaned the fact that online dating has become a “digital derecho, with oh so many ways” to “make and drop connections.”

Read: What we gain when we stop caring

But perhaps ghosting—or being ghosted—doesn't need to be so upsetting. I recall a text I received at the end of the summer that illustrated, for me, the ways we apparently still tiptoe around ghosting. It was from a guy I had been on three dates with and then hadn't heard from in weeks. I'd thought the third date was the best of them—a nice dinner with lots of talking, a little making out at my place—so I was surprised when the guy, a divorced dad, offered a tepid response to a follow-up text I sent before disappearing completely.

In the new text, prefaced by a cheery “Hello!,” he apologized, telling me he “didn't intend to ghost” and that he'd been “focused on other connections (and life in general).” Mulling my response, I decided on “thanks—be well!” and then blocked him. The blocking was superfluous—he and I were unlikely to ever talk again—but it spoke to a twofold annoyance on my part. At the point that the guy texted back, I had mostly forgotten about him and moved on; his outreach was an unnecessary coda. I also felt like I should appreciate the fact that he reached out at all, though it seemed like he was doing so to make himself, not me, feel better; to, essentially, correct the record: I'm not someone who ghosts. It came across like a performance of nicety.

Contemporary ghosting, according to Pettman, is a by-product of what he calls an “overly social world,” one in which the real and the virtual are so intertwined that we can lose sight of another person's humanity while engaging (or disengaging) with them. Ghosting can also often undermine a person's perception of reality. In the case of the guy who ghosted me, my surprise stemmed from both his unanticipated disappearance and what I believed to be true: that he and I had had a genuinely good time together.

Some of this was projection. “We love an avatar more than a specific being,” Pettman writes, “a gestalt abstraction, lifted from all the love stories we've imbibed since childhood.” I wanted this guy to be the sort of guy who liked and wanted me. As for my irritation when he reappeared? Research shows that people who acknowledge or apologize for rejection risk activating the rejectee's ire, rather than alleviating hurt feelings. Gili Freedman, a social psychologist who has studied both ghosting and apologies, told me that although apologies after a ghosting can in some cases provide closure, ghostees can also interpret ghosters' apologies as insincere or self-serving.

Apologies also put ghostees into a double bind, she said. Ghostees can feel pulled back into a dynamic they didn't choose to be part of, or be forced to confront the feeling of a wound being reopened, a sort of secondary rejection. The guy's apology, I found, reminded me of the ghosting infraction in the first place, reasserted his control (he dictated the timing and the terms of communication), then created a social obligation for me to respond—a sort of obligatory forgiveness that can erode the ghostee's sense of agency or even humanity.

The guy's ghosting of me also dehumanized him. When he vanished after that seemingly promising third date, he quickly went back to being an idea of a man I had met: a profile picture on an app. After he apologized and I replied and blocked him, he became a different sort of ghost—one of my, not his, making. His belated effort had left me more dismissive of him than if he had simply stayed gone.

Many of us might have been ghosted enough times over the years that we've developed a thicker skin about what appear to be arbitrary disappearances. The cultural critic Kyle Chayka, for one, recently mused in The New Yorker about whether ghosting was such a “persistent feature of twenty-first-century life” as to be unavoidable. Pettman considers detaching a “necessary skill” and an “emerging discipline” for “the typical citizen of the new millennium.” And with the benefit of thicker skin, perhaps there's room for more curiosity, room for ghosting to be, if not embraced, at least better understood.

Pettman is useful on this front. Ghosting may indicate individual cowardice, he writes, but “it also doesn't get us very far to demonize individual behavior, as if the answer to structural social woes was to simply instill better moral codes in everyone's hearts and minds.” (What to do about this? He doesn't really say.)

The phenomenon is also perhaps indicative of our alienation from a sense of shared community. We're spending more and more time alone, and some have suggested that we're in the midst of a crisis of societal rudeness. One writer recently posited that contemporary self-help books might be encouraging people's selfishness and self-interest (even at the cost of alienating or hurting others) by espousing the idea that “it's OK to be a little bit of a jerk.”

Read: The decline of etiquette and the rise of ‘boundaries'

It's worth considering a slightly counterintuitive idea too: that ghosters do care about their interactions, and the people who are affected by them. Somewhat. As Freedman told me, ghostees tend to underestimate ghosters' contrition, and ghosters' choice to disappear can actually be evidence of their complicated feelings. I'd add that not being informed of the reason for a ghosting might save many of us from embarrassment or self-loathing. One study on ghosting in a hiring context—say, an employer's nonresponse to a job applicant—found that those who were ghosted had more self-esteem than those who got personal feedback.

Is this an argument for accepting ghosting in its contemporary form? Probably not—especially in the case of being stood up, which has always felt particularly egregious. And a new study that examined the consequences of being ghosted or rejected directly found that the adverse psychological effects of the former appear to last longer than those of the latter, because of ghosting's “unique consequences linked to its ambiguity and lack of closure.” But I do sense that a certain softness might be found under the surface of this particular expression of our so-called epidemic of rudeness.

Maybe we can extend some empathy, or at least the benefit of the doubt, to those who disappear on us. Perhaps, in reaching out to me, even six weeks after our previous communication, my date was showing evidence of care, though he expressed it in a ham-handed way. Or, as Pettman puts it, “in a world of atomized, liquified, symptomatic and transactional relations,” maybe the act of ghosting can also “be a merciful one.”

Listers understands how technology can corrupt our leisure activities.

The new YouTube documentary Listers is a down-the-rabbit-hole glimpse at the norms and neuroses of the “extreme bird-watching” community. If that sounds painfully boring, it's not—this is one of the funniest documentaries I've seen in some time. In it, the brothers Quentin and Owen Reiser chronicle their try at a “big year,” a bird-nerd term for attempting to identify as many different species as possible in a single calendar year. They start out knowing next to nothing about birds—an app designer and a cinematographer from Collinsville, Illinois, the Reisers get into birding after one of them stumbles across an ornithological guidebook during a bleary-eyed smoke session. Then they buy a $4,500 Kia Sedona and traverse the country with the goal of finding more than 700 unique specimens. Although both brothers are the subjects of the film, Quentin spends most of the time on camera while Owen remains behind the lens. He alternates between a low-tech camcorder and a high-resolution camera, the former to capture the mundane and often gritty work of tracking down birds, and the latter to reveal their quarry in all its splendor.

On their bird-maxxing quest, the two cook endless beans and sleep in a shocking number of Cracker Barrel parking lots. Quentin takes magic mushrooms on a seabird boat tour.  The vibe here is less Animal Planet and more Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle: “It's all gonna be, like, accurate? Scientifically accurate?” Owen asks early on when he learns that his brother is planning to create an illustrated bird guide about their travels. “Yeah,” Quentin responds, deadpan. The camera zooms in on his drawing of a bird—one presumes a tufted titmouse—with crude, cartoonish boobs protruding from its feathers.

But underneath the stoner hijinks (and legitimately stunning wildlife videography), Listers is a serious film about the meaning that hobbies can provide to our lives, and the corrupting influence of smartphone apps on our leisure activities. As the documentary progresses, it gradually begins to examine how eBird, a social app that is popular in the bird-watching community, has overtaken the pastime. The brothers start without complaints about eBird, which connects them with other hobbyists, helps them track their progress when they “list” birds, and provides a ranking system so they can see how they're stacking up against other birders. But by the end of the year, they become disillusioned by eBird and interview other hobbyists who are as well. “This country is so big, and you have to go everywhere in the country to see enough birds to be in the power rankings or whatever the fuck it is,” Quentin grouses. “I like bird-watching, but I don't like it in the competitive sense.”

Read: What we lose when we're priced out of our hobbies

Birding is not the only hobby with an app problem. So many leisure pursuits now have their own gamified digital platforms: Untappd for beer enthusiasts. Strava for runners. Ravelry for knitters. Fishbrain for fishermen. Beli for foodies. Goodreads and Letterboxd for bookworms and movie buffs. The list goes on. Some have anointed these sorts of hobby apps a new, “kinder” frontier for social media: Sharing your knitting patterns is certainly more wholesome than bare-knuckle political fighting on X. But like all online social networks, these apps—many of which include leaderboards, progress bars, and achievement badges—have a corrosive side, one I've experienced myself as a runner. I used to log my runs, until I realized I was putting on my sneakers and getting out the door simply because I wanted to see my stats go up. I found that the apps made me more focused on narrow metrics, such as my VO2 max or total weekly miles, than the pleasure derived from the hobby itself.

Complaints about the intrusion of technology into hobbies are not new. Leisure activities have always been settings in which what academics call “conspicuous consumption” is common—enthusiasts flaunt the latest high-tech golf clubs or fly rods or bird-watching binoculars as a way to demonstrate their seriousness or skill (even when they don't have much of either). But hobby gamification has added a novel and far more perverse twist to this long-standing trend: conspicuous accumulation, users' vying for in-app prestige by logging, listing, or otherwise compiling as much online data as possible.

Watching the birders in Listers discuss their love-hate relationship with the eBird app, I was reminded less of their feathered friends than of another class of winged creatures—parasitoid wasps. I became fascinated by these hellish insects years ago after reading a letter in which Charles Darwin described their existence as proof against “a beneficent & omnipotent God.” It's not hard to see why: The wasps inject eggs into a host, usually a caterpillar, and when they hatch, the larvae eat the unfortunate creature from the inside out, taking care to leave the vital organs intact so that their meal ticket doesn't die too soon. Eventually, the larvae hijack the host's brain, turning the caterpillar into their slave. From the outside, the parasitized insect still looks like a normal caterpillar, but the guts of the thing have been emptied out, and it now exists to serve an entirely different master. Eventually, it dies of starvation.

This makes for a grisly analogy, but it's an apt one. As Listers demonstrates, hobby apps such as eBird parasitize our leisure pursuits from within: The app stops being a way to engage with the hobby and instead turns the hobby into a way to engage with the app. From the outside, the hobby still looks the same—you're still running, or watching an art film, or peeping a bufflehead sea duck through your binoculars—but the goal is no longer the experience itself.

Read: The logic of the ‘9 to 5' is creeping into the rest of the day

Perhaps the only truly chilling scene in the otherwise lighthearted Listers occurs when one of the brothers questions a top-ranked birder about what motivates him. “If eBird didn't exist, would you still go bird-watching?” Owen asks. “No!” the other man says, shaking his head vigorously and laughing, as though the very prospect of birding without the app is ridiculous.

The response raises an interesting philosophical question: Is this man actually a birder at all? Can you be a true bird-watcher if your main source of joy is not, you know, the birds? It would seem that his actual hobby is the app. The audience of Listers is made to understand the tragedy of many of these men and women who look and act like birders but whose primary love is no longer the birds themselves or the environments in which they're found, rather the glowing screen they're so bound to. The platform is not all bad—at its best, it provides an admirable example of citizen science and generates useful data for researchers—but the brothers, and those they interview, know all too well that eBird can be a fun suck as much as it can be an avenue for fulfillment.

“I'm tired of these fucking assholes who work for the bird software,” Quentin vents near the end of the documentary. He's miffed about how often the app rejects his photos, but he's also angry that it matters to him in the first place. By the end of Listers, he decides the app mostly doesn't matter to him. He still loves birding but seems to hate eBird. The irony, of course, is that his documentary is as likely to turn people off the app as it is to drive new users to it.

In a humorous final montage, we learn that the birder who wouldn't bird if it weren't for the app broke a record by identifying 758 birds in a year, and that Quentin and Owen—impressively for neophytes—ranked 23rd in the contiguous United States, listing 579 birds. To celebrate, the boys crack a Martinelli's Gold Medal Sparkling Cider and tell a gas-station attendant about their success. “Not bragging, but we've seen 579 species of bird this year,” Quentin informs the young woman behind the register. When she responds, “Pretty cool,” we get the distinct sense that she does not, in fact, think it is pretty cool. The Reisers don't care. They're in it for the birds.

A new history of the circumstances that led to the Great Depression sheds light on the systemic dangers we face today.

In his new book about the stock-market crash of 1929, the journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin recounts a scene from a summer day that year in Manhattan. The dining room of the Plaza Hotel came to attention, he writes, when top figures from Wall Street and the business world trickled in for Saturday lunch. The presence of such a crowd might not have created a stir at another historical moment, but these were not typical times. The nation was infatuated with the market, which was showering wealth on investors big and small.

Several of these boldface names, including the esteemed leaders of big banks, had a history of joining forces in market-manipulation schemes that were not a well-kept secret. Together, major players would form a pool and bid up a stock through “wash trades” with one another, creating the appearance of high demand, before they all sold, cratering the price and devastating the dupes who had followed their lead.

One might think that some of these men would have faced consequences, or at least lived in fear of exposure, even though their conduct was technically legal at the time. But they were well connected. One of them, John J. Raskob, was the chair of the Democratic National Committee and a prominent political donor; his biggest beneficiary, the former New York governor and presidential candidate Al Smith, was dining with him that day. Another, William Durant, had secretly met with President Herbert Hoover earlier in the year, to lean on him to stop the Federal Reserve Board from curbing Wall Street's excesses.

In his book 1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History—And How It Shattered a Nation, Sorkin refers to “remarkable parallels” between the run-up to that crisis and today's political and economic climate, but he doesn't elaborate on the notion; his account is essentially a straight history, written in a journalistic register. Yet some revealing parallels do emerge from beneath the surface, and they don't reflect well on our current path. In addition to the greed and “this time is different” hubris that precedes every stock-market tumble, the 1929 collapse was powered, it seems to me, by a more insidious and pervasive force that is in fact everywhere in evidence today.

Read: The lesson of 1929

The 1920s were, as Sorkin shows, an era in which Wall Street largely got its way and Washington kept its hands off, a precursor to President Donald Trump's tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. More interesting to examine, in light of the present day, is how the environment became so perilously friendly to Wall Street in the '20s—and how it stayed that way even as red flags began to appear. The key element, I would argue, was the phenomenon known in regulatory circles as “capture”: Wall Street and Big Business managed to co-opt the other centers of power in society. Those with clout in various spheres coalesced into one clubby circle, and fell prey to a groupthink that foresaw riches for everyone, without consequences. The regulatory bodies, the political and judicial apparatus, the press—nearly all of the mechanisms of correction in our system were either enfeebled or so aligned with the bullish and wealthy that it didn't occur to them to use what muscle they still had.

Some critics did raise alarms, most notably Senator Carter Glass, but the banking elite and their well-placed friends could safely ignore the skeptics, who would get swept away by the prevailing current. (Only after everything fell apart was the senator able to rein in banks with the Glass-Steagall Act.)

Financiers organized press offensives and enlisted top reporters as allies, offering lucrative jobs or outright bribes. Private-sector titans took on quasi-governmental roles—for instance, advising the president and negotiating deals with other nations—or they became actual federal officials. The investor and industrialist Andrew Mellon enjoyed a lengthy tenure as Treasury secretary—a forerunner to Trump's Treasury appointees, Steven Mnuchin and Scott Bessent, both of them recruited straight from Wall Street. The joke about Mellon's influence, Sorkin tells us, was that three U.S. presidents served under him.

This kind of crossover calls to mind Elon Musk, who, like the J.P. Morgan chairman Thomas Lamont and other '20s moguls, became a player in public policy without going through the trouble of getting elected or being empowered by Congress. During Joe Biden's presidency, Musk made the decision to provide Ukraine and its troops with crucial access to his satellite-internet service, Starlink. After backing Trump with his considerable clout in the 2024 election cycle, he got himself tapped by the president to slash the federal bureaucracy through DOGE, in a rather blatant example of political capture. The fact that Musk and his giant businesses stood to benefit from severe cuts to the regulatory state did not go unnoticed (Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Carter Glass–like critic, issued a report on the subject), but resistance had little effect.

No 1920s figure is so reminiscent of Musk as Raskob, the DNC chair, whose rise to great influence figured centrally in the crash. Raskob was an auto executive who fathered 13 children and became a wildly ambitious entrepreneur. He could move the market with an offhand comment about General Motors, where he was a director, much the way Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private and saw its stock promptly shoot up by more than $20 a share; the transaction never happened. Raskob took his own leap into the political fray by bankrolling Smith and using the DNC to settle scores—with the help of a pliant press.

Musk hasn't co-opted the news media to nearly the same degree as did Raskob and his ilk in the '20s; reporters behind the typically sunny coverage of the time were widely believed to be on the take, Sorkin writes, and J. Pierpont Morgan “was known to have countless journalists in his pocket.” Now many of the traditional press outlets are not so much corrupt as they are impoverished and weak, and their corporate owners have shown a willingness to knuckle under if enough force is applied. While vilifying the press, Trump has skillfully leveraged podcasters and streamers, and Musk was able to literally capture Twitter—by buying the company—and thereby covertly shape the news and opinion that reaches the masses. Meanwhile, the best legacy outlets are far less influential than they once were. It's difficult to believe any longer that the next New York Times exposé is going to take down or even contain the president. After all, he was already indicted four times, with help from reporters—and then won the popular vote.

Trump's own story represents the ultimate capture. In his administration, Big Money interests and political power are effectively fused within one person: the president himself. He doesn't always take the side of financiers and moguls, but when he does, he becomes not just their enabler but also their bullying representative. Bankers needn't meet with Trump in secret to lobby him to neuter the regulatory state; he'll do that himself. He has relentlessly assailed the putatively independent Federal Reserve Board, worked to weaken the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency released a worrying jobs report. His administration has also forged deals that give the government some stake in companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and U.S. Steel, further blurring the line between the public and private sectors.

Just before Trump's second inauguration, he issued his own Trump meme coin, which surprised no one by immediately exploding in value, directly benefiting his family. He thus became a major cryptocurrency entrepreneur days before taking office and launching a volley of crypto-friendly initiatives, pleasing an industry that had donated heavily to his campaign. Trump's Securities and Exchange Commission promptly put on hold a case against the crypto billionaire Justin Sun. (The suit accuses Sun of, among other things, creating a wash-trading pool, in an echo of the '20s.) Months later, Sun, a top investor in the Trump meme coin, attended a dinner with the president at one of his golf courses.

Trump's leniency toward dubious white-collar figures also extends well beyond the crypto realm. The president granted clemency to the fraudster Carlos Watson of Ozy Media, saving him from a 10-year prison term; commuted the sentences of Jason Galanis and George Santos after they won his favor; and pardoned the former Nikola CEO Trevor Milton, who was convicted of ripping off his investors. Trump explained himself by saying of Milton, “He supported Trump.”

Moves such as these undermine the integrity of the wider financial system. Yet the danger of capture is not just that it can lead to a recession or even a depression. The danger is also moral. Capture can dramatically alter a society's conception of what qualifies as acceptable. In sober retrospect, it seems inconceivable that brokers during the '20s boom allowed customers to buy stock with borrowed money and only 10 percent down; if a share price dips by just 10 percent in this scenario, the trader is wiped out. The most prominent bankers in the country were unembarrassed to defend the practice by arguing that if the common person can buy a refrigerator on credit, why not a stock? The comparison is absurd, but the important point is that it didn't necessarily appear that way at the time. Neither did the notion of top financiers colluding to bolster the price of certain stocks.

Now we face a situation in which President Trump sets pro-crypto policy while his family businesses reap the rewards; the president fires officials who bring bad news; and convicted scammers are pardoned without even a fig-leaf rationale. Opponents have filed a number of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration, and some of them have found traction (a federal appeals court blocked for now Trump's order to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook). But the Supreme Court has largely sided with Trump in his second term, the pardons are irrevocable, and the sheer volume of attacks on our financial system seems to ensure that many will prevail or, worse, be ignored or accepted. In contrast to 1929, when capture was not a well-publicized phenomenon, ignorance is an even less plausible excuse. The parties poised to check state power over our economy are well aware of the grifts and the graft, but they appear to have lost the capacity to act.

The term moral hazard entered the popular lexicon during the 2008 global financial crisis, which Sorkin chronicled in his hit book Too Big to Fail, to explain the widespread fear that bailing out banks would set a damaging precedent by rescuing them from the consequences of their own actions. In 2025, there is a twist: The moral hazard is plain as day before any large-scale consequences have even come. What was once beyond the pale has little by little become accepted. In that sense, the collapse has already begun.

Ensuring GLP-1s are covered by Medicaid in all states would save lives—and not be as costly as some people fear.

An estimated 100 million adult Americans—more than 40 percent of the population—are classified as obese. This is a massive health crisis that will claim many lives over the next decades. As is well known, drugs now exist that can dramatically reduce obesity and its related health risks. But most of the roughly 37 million adult Americans on Medicaid—an estimated 14 million of whom suffer from obesity—do not have access to these drugs, known as GLP-1s. The reason is simple: These medications are hugely expensive, and the cost of covering them could seriously stretch state budgets in the short term. America should do it anyway.

GLP-1s are near-miracle drugs. On obesity alone they make a huge difference—resulting in about 15 to 20 percent weight loss in randomized trials. And although weight does not define health, and BMI is an overused number, the data are clear that obesity is a risk factor for a variety of diseases and is associated with higher mortality. Individuals experiencing obesity at age 40 have a life expectancy, on average, three to four years shorter than those who are in the normal weight range.

What's more, these medications are also showing substantial benefits for both related and unrelated conditions. They have been used since 2005 to treat diabetes, and have more recently been approved to treat certain liver and kidney diseases as well. New evidence suggests that they may reduce alcohol consumption among those with a drinking problem. A summary paper comparing diabetics on a GLP-1 with those on other medications found that those taking a GLP-1 saw greater reductions in substance abuse, dementia risk, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions.

Read: Ozempic killed diet and exercise

Some, especially within the MAHA movement, have criticized the widespread use of these medications, arguing that doctors and patients should focus more on diet and exercise as mechanisms for weight control. Whatever the benefits are of this individualized approach, it is impractical at the population level. We have mountains of evidence that lifestyle-based weight-loss interventions are not effective in the long term for the overwhelming majority of people.

GLP-1s are much more likely to succeed at scale. As of last year, an estimated 15 million adults were taking these medications. The millions of eligible adults on Medicaid, however, are mostly not covered, and this population generally cannot afford to pay out of pocket. Although state Medicaid programs are required to cover most FDA-approved medications, Congress has exempted weight-loss medications from this requirement because of cost concerns. As of August 2024, only 13 states covered these medications to treat obesity under Medicaid. The inequality in access itself creates further health inequalities, effectively denying individuals living in poverty a medical treatment that would improve their health and longevity. Ensuring coverage for these drugs by Medicaid in all states would make them more accessible and improve lives.

The primary objection to doing so is cost. There is substantial price variation, but the out-of-pocket cost for Wegovy, for example, is about $850 a month. At that price, if 10 percent of individuals with obesity who are covered by Medicaid took up these medications, it would cost about $1.2 billion a month, or $14.3 billion a year. Total Medicaid yearly spending is about $918 billion, so this would be a sizable increase. If every adult on Medicaid with obesity took up these medications, that would cost an estimated $143 billion a year. This is an enormous increase, and worries about it are why Congress has not required states to cover these drugs.

These budget concerns reflect the scope of the problem and the value of these medications in addressing it. If the medications were useless or the problem was small, then we wouldn't worry so much about the cost. The fact that so many people will want these drugs, and so many doctors will be eager to prescribe them, is both an argument for making them available and a reason not to do so.

From an economic standpoint, I believe the budgetary concerns are overstated.

First: Some of the costs of these medications will be recouped in overall lower health-care spending. Estimates suggest that a one-point increase in BMI for individuals with obesity is associated with about a $250 increase in annual health-care expenditures. Treatment for obesity with GLP-1s reduces BMI by an estimated three points; that change in obesity would reduce the cost of coverage for these individuals by an estimated 11.5 percent. A broader calculation, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated that at current prices, 27 percent of the costs of these medications would be offset by other savings.

From the June 2024 issue: Ozempic or bust

Second: The calculations assume that Medicaid would pay something similar to the current cost to private insurers. This is unrealistic. First, Medicaid generally pays far less for drugs than private insurance does; for a high-price drug, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicaid pays 53 percent less after rebates. Second, opportunities for negotiation abound. There are multiple similar drugs in this class, and more are yet arriving. It may be possible for Medicaid to get a better deal.

Perhaps most important, the price of these drugs is expected to fall over time, as more competitors enter the market and as oral versions of these medications become available. We are already seeing this. Many calculations assume prices of $700 to $800 a month; Costco just announced that it will sell these medications for $499 a month.

With a baseline non-Medicaid cost of $499 a month and an expected 53 percent Medicaid discount, the expected cost will be about $235 a month. If 10 percent of the eligible Medicaid population took these drugs for obesity, that would mean an annual cost of $3.9 billion, which is just a 0.4 percent increase in Medicaid spending. This calculation also ignores the cost savings of lowering obesity, which, as noted above, may be in the range of $750 a person annually.

It is easy to get in the weeds with these admittedly back-of-the-envelope numbers, and with even moderately different assumptions, they could look quite different. Without an actual policy, we cannot be sure. But what is definitely true is that the costs here are far lower than the simplistic “these drugs are expensive” calculation would suggest. And the fact remains that they will literally save lives. Which, I would argue, is also worth something.

Better broke than woke, right?

Toward the end of the Biden administration, conservatives, fed up with the supposed imposition of liberal ideas by “woke capital,” tried to create what The Economist described as a “parallel economy” in which one could buy “anti-woke” versions of goods such as beer and razors. Those products might come at a premium, but if that was the price of your beliefs, you were free to pay it.

Now, in Donald Trump's second administration, that parallel economy is just the economy. Trumpist culture wars have made almost everything more expensive, effectively forcing all Americans to pay an anti-woke tax. Although conservatives usually use woke to describe some form of egalitarianism they oppose, it's proved such an effective epithet that they're now applying the label to anything they need their constituents to dislike.

Tariffs are the most obvious example. An analysis by the Harvard Business School professor Alberto Cavallo noted that although inflation was trending downward before Trump's tariffs took effect, “prices on both imported and domestic goods have climbed modestly but steadily since March.” Trump has an economic argument for his tariffs, if a rather unconvincing one. But the tariffs make more sense if you look at them as a kind of anti-woke tax. The administration has presented them as a temporary setback on the road to long-term prosperity, a corrective to the cooperative diplomacy of the past, and a promise—one impossible to fulfill—that America can return to some golden age of plentiful manufacturing jobs, the kind of manly work that soft-handed libs with email jobs took from you.

“The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones—that kind of thing is going to come to America,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared in April while defending Trump's tariffs. Caked in foundation, manly Fox News hosts have gushed that the tariffs, by supposedly making it possible for Americans to go back to work in mines and factories, could be the “ultimate testosterone boost.” No more desk jobs! Which are bad because “when you sit behind a screen all day, it makes you a woman.”

Adam Serwer: ‘Woke capital' doesn't exist

Despite this, I'm not aware of any Fox News pundits lining up to get black lung in West Virginia coal mines. Nor are the tariffs bringing back those manly jobs; in fact, about 30,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since January. Macho construction gigs aren't going to fill the gap—new tariffs on materials such as lumber and furniture are likely to drive up the cost of building homes, worsening an already serious housing-affordability crisis. Speaking of manly jobs: Trump's tariffs are hitting truckers especially hard. Fewer imports means less stuff to truck. Also, it turns out, even American-manufactured trucks use foreign materials. Some blue-collar workers have seen some wage growth under Trump—but in the fields of retail, hospitality, and medical care, fields that conservatives don't typically portray as bastions of traditional masculinity.

And, of course, the tariffs have driven up the price of food, because some food simply can't be grown in the United States and must be imported. Maybe bananas and coffee are woke?

One thing that is definitely woke is racial diversity—see the administration's whites-only refugee policy—something Trump officials hope to solve through the demographic-engineering project known as mass deportation. “The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic polity,” an administration document explains, which is rather like an arsonist noting that the fire they set raised the temperature in the house they burned down. “Diversity” doesn't reduce social trust; bigotry and those who foment it do.

Making America whiter and therefore less woke is also driving food prices up and wages down, because the administration is terrorizing and deporting the immigrants who do most of the planting and picking of the American food supply. The Trump administration itself admits it: As David Dayen reports in The American Prospect, a new Department of Labor filing acknowledges that the mass-deportation agenda is “threatening the stability of domestic food production and prices” for consumers. The filing is about a new rule that will cut wages for immigrant farmworkers on H-2A visas, but Dayen writes that the wages of American agricultural workers are likely to come down too, resulting in a major labor shortage on farms. So food will cost more, but at least the workers getting that food to supermarket shelves will make less?

Energy prices are another example. Thanks in part to government investment in research, clean-energy sources such as wind and solar have become more efficient and less expensive than other forms of energy production. But Trump-administration officials have decided that green energy is woke, and so they've reversed this progress, cutting funding for renewable-energy projects and using government policy to encourage the use of fossil fuels instead. As a result, NPR reports, “electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year.”

Ellen Cushing: The drink that Americans won't give up without a fight

Americans seem to like the culture-war fixation on manliness in the abstract much more than they like the financial reality. Some 80 percent of Americans, according to one YouGov poll, think “America would be better off if more Americans works [sic] in manufacturing than they do today,” but only 25 percent agree with the statement “I would be better off if I worked in a factory instead of my current field of work.” Like the Fox News pundits, many people support the idea of “manly jobs” but prefer that someone else actually works them.

Conservative pundits' fixation on condemning the “identity politics” of historically disfavored groups seeking equal rights seems to have kept them from noticing that U.S. economic policy is now justified by a particularly silly form of right-wing identity politics. Their nostalgia for the manly jobs of yesteryear ignores what made those jobs good in the first place, which was a higher rate of unionization that put pressure on employers to provide better wages and benefits.

There was nothing wrong with the idea of an anti-woke economy in which people could, if they chose to, shell out for Conservative Dad's Ultra Right “100% woke-free” beer. People are allowed to vote with their wallets. The problem is that Trump-era conservatives don't seem to believe in that kind of freedom. Instead, they are imposing their anti-woke tax on all of America, raising the cost of living for everyone.

Behind all of the culture-war nonsense, the administration's political allies—the ultra-wealthy, the fossil-fuel industry, and many in the corporate elite—are making out quite well. Some politically connected companies have even managed to get convenient exemptions from the tariffs. It's all of those regular Americans Trump promised to fight for who are seeing their dollars buy less because of a conscious, deliberate effort to make things anti-woke. One might almost suspect that was the idea all along.

But, hey, better broke than woke, right?

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

Broadly, there are 5 ways to constrain rogue federal law enforcement agents. The Supreme Court nuked 3 of them.

By now, you've probably seen some of the videos of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as other federal law enforcement agencies, attacking immigrants and unarmed Americans protesting President Donald Trump's immigration policies. In one, officers shoot a pastor in the head with a pepper ball. In another, an officer sprays pepper spray directly into the air vent of a protester dressed in an inflatable frog costume — in an apparent attempt to fill the suit with noxious gas.

This administration's abuse of immigrants, protesters, and Trump's perceived enemies appears to be systemic. An August report by Sen. Jon Ossoff's (D-GA) office identified 510 “credible reports” of human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities since Trump took office in January. ProPublica found that over 170 US citizens have been held by immigration officials, some of whom were beaten or worse.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Even high-ranking elected officials are victims. Last May, for example, federal law enforcement forcibly arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) after Baraka sought a tour of an immigration detention facility. After those charges fell apart, the Trump administration indicted US Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who attempted to shield Baraka from arrest. In a video cited by McIver's attorneys, one of the officers claims that Baraka's arrest was ordered by US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Worse, the Supreme Court — or, at least, its six Republicans — appears to be entirely on board with these tactics. In September, the Republican justices voted to block a lower court order that, among other things, forbade ICE from targeting suspected undocumented immigrants solely because of their race. That case is known as Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo.

The Republican justices rarely explain their decisions when they rule in Trump's favor, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write a concurring opinion explaining why he voted the way he did. His assertion that someone targeted by ICE's “apparent ethnicity” was “relevant” to law enforcement deciding whom to stop has received the most attention, as Kavanaugh seemed to blow off fears that federal law enforcement is targeting Latinos because of their race. But Kavanaugh also strongly implied that no one victimized by ICE may seek an injunction prohibiting ICE from engaging in illegal tactics in the future. (In the wake of this decision, many commentators are now referring to ICE's tactics as “Kavanaugh stops.”)

So are there any legal avenues left to challenge abusive tactics by ICE, or by other law enforcement agencies controlled by Trump? The short answer is that a few narrow pathways still exist, but they are unlikely to provide a meaningful check on ICE's behavior.

Broadly speaking, there are five ways that the law could constrain federal law enforcement:

Let's look at each of these options in a bit more detail.

It is quite difficult to obtain a court order prohibiting a law enforcement agency from committing an illegal action in the future, and it has been for more than four decades. The seminal case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), which held that Adolph Lyons, a man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by police officers without provocation, could not obtain a court order forbidding the Los Angeles Police Department from using these chokeholds in the future.

Lyons held that “past exposure to illegal conduct” does not permit someone to seek an injunction prohibiting similar conduct in the future. Instead, the Court concluded that “Lyons' standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”

To prevail, in other words, Lyons had to show that he personally was likely to be choked a second time, at some point in the future, by a Los Angeles police officer.

In Vasquez Perdomo, Kavanaugh claimed that the plaintiffs' argument challenging ICE's actions in that case “largely tracks the theory rejected in Lyons.” The plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo alleged that they were stopped by ICE for impermissible reasons, including because they are Latino. But Kavanaugh claimed that they have “no good basis to believe that law enforcement will unlawfully stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors.”

As a factual matter, Kavanaugh's claim is dubious. A federal appeals court found that “at least one individual with lawful status was stopped twice by roving patrols in just 10 days.” So the fact that ICE targeted this one individual twice in such a short period suggests that they were likely to be targeted again unless a court intervenes. The Trump administration also repeatedly targeted certain businesses where they believed that undocumented people worked — one car wash was hit four times in nine days, according to Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent. So the workers in that car wash sure seemed to be likely to be targeted again in the future.

Ultimately, however, the real facts underlying a Supreme Court case matter a whole lot less than what a majority of the justices say about the facts of a case. Both the Court's decision in Vasquez Perdomo, and Kavanaugh's reliance on Lyons in his defense of that decision, suggest that this Court is unlikely to allow anyone who is illegally targeted by ICE to seek an injunction against that law enforcement agency — even if in reality, these very decisions give the Trump administration permission to target the same people over and over again.

More than half a century ago, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971), the Supreme Court held that the victim of an unconstitutional action by a federal law enforcement officer could sue that officer and potentially collect money damages directly from them. Bivens explained that an officer who acts unlawfully “in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” And so it follows that there should be a meaningful remedy to discourage officers from abusing their power.

But this view of accountability has long been out of favor with a majority of the justices. And, in two recent cases, the Court's Republican majority have come very close to overruling Bivens outright.

In Hernández v. Mesa (2020), the Republican justices ruled that a US Border Patrol agent who allegedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy in cold blood could not be sued, even if the boy's parents could prove that the shooting was unjustified. And, in Egbert v. Boule (2022), the Republican justices immunized Border Patrol agents who allegedly used excessive force against an innkeeper from lawsuits.

Both decisions were exceedingly hostile to Bivens. In Egbert, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas's majority opinion concluded that courts should reject Bivens suits if there is “any rational reason (even one)” to do so.

Given these decisions, it is safe to say that the current slate of justices will not allow an ICE officer to be sued by their victim, even if the officer clearly violated the law or the Constitution.

The Federal Tort Claims Act frequently permits the United States to be sued if a federal law enforcement officer engages in “assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.” And the Supreme Court took a fairly expansive view of how this law applies to bad actions by law enforcement in its unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013), a case about a prisoner who sued corrections officers who allegedly threatened and sexually assaulted him.

So it is likely that even this Supreme Court would allow some victims of illegal activity by ICE, or similar agencies, to sue the federal government and seek compensation from the United States Treasury.

That said, it is doubtful that this remedy will do much to deter future lawless behavior by ICE. Neither an individual law enforcement officer, nor the senior Trump administration officials giving them orders, are likely to change their behavior because, maybe a year from now, a federal judge might order the US Treasury to pay money to someone who was victimized by ICE.

The whole point of Bivens was to impose consequences personally upon rogue officers, so that they will be deterred from breaking the law. A lawsuit requiring US taxpayers to compensate victims is unlikely to achieve the same goal.

Finally, to the extent that any individual law enforcement officer violates a federal criminal statute, they might be prosecuted for doing so. That's highly unlikely to happen, however, for as long as Trump rules the Justice Department. Any future prosecutions are likely to turn on who wins the 2028 election.

One person who will suffer no criminal consequences, however, no matter how many laws he breaks, is Donald Trump. The Republican justices' decision in Trump v. United States (2024) held that Trump is immune from prosecution for his official acts as president. That decision even said that he is immune if he orders law enforcement to target someone “for an improper purpose.”

Moreover, even if some law enforcement officer — or maybe some Trump political appointee — is prosecuted for unlawful actions, there is always some risk that the same Republican justices who invented the concept of presidential immunity from prosecution will also decide to immunize officers who were carrying out Trump's orders. Trump could also use his pardon power to protect them.

So if you hope that ICE officers, and other federal officials who have abused their powers, will someday be held to account for their actions, the news is not good. The Supreme Court has cut off the most effective ways of ensuring that federal law enforcement officers comply with the law.

The difference between a baguette here and in France is a matter of law.

Have you ever gone on a trip to another country and thought, “Why does the food here taste so much better than the food in America?”

That's the question Kate called in recently to Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast. “When I was in Japan recently, the produce and the meat were amazing,” she told Vox. “Same thing about food in Europe: the bread, the yogurt just tastes better. Is food actually higher quality elsewhere, or do we just think it is? And if it is, what would it take for the US to have food that tastes and feels that good?”

Yes, the fact that you're in a new and exciting environment is a factor. But you also aren't imagining things: other countries have different ways of preparing and producing food that factor into what you're tasting as well. Take the French baguette: that iconic bread that brings to mind berets and bicycling along the famous Champs-Élysées avenue as accordion music plays in the background. According to Eric Pallant, the author of Sourdough Culture: A History of Bread Making from Ancient to Modern Bakers, that image is no accident; France is so invested in its bread that the country made a law protecting it from the encroaching mass-produced bread market. “By the 1980s, premade breads, breads that have a dozen or more ingredients in them, were starting to take over the market, and that's un-French,” Pallant said. And so they said, “If you're going to sell it in a boulangerie — and there are thousands of them in France — it has to meet criteria.”

So what is that criteria? And why are America's standards so different? Pallant tells us on this week's episode of Explain It to Me. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Pallant, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545. We love to hear from you.

Does the bread in France actually taste better? Or does being on vacation make us think it does?

It really is better bread. But there's a caveat. If you go to a supermarket, you can buy industrial bread in France just as easily as here. But go to a boulangerie and that bread will be fresh and taste of wheat and leavening and love and time and patience. Nothing you can buy in a colorful plastic bag will ever match.

Why is the bread so different there?

A law passed in France in 1993 dictated that the bread you're buying in a boulangerie must be made that day with four ingredients: flour, water, a leavening agent, yeast or sourdough, and some salt.

Meanwhile, in the US, I can walk into the grocery store right now, and I will find so many bagged loaves. What's the story behind the type of bread that's more common here in American grocery stores?

For 6,000 years, nobody knew what made bread rise. It was just magic. You put this glop called sourdough starter into a dough, and like magic, it rises. By the 1870s, 1880s, Louis Pasteur discovered that yeast are living things. They reproduce, they grow, they consume the starches, exhale carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide makes the bread rise. Once we know that yeast is a thing, we can make bread much faster than we do with sourdough. Sourdough takes two days. From a capitalist's perspective, it makes sense if you're a baker to bake a lot of bread very, very quickly.

As the 1920s and 1930s roll around, we have the mass production of everything. Picture this: the dough is mixed in a machine that can hold 1,500 to 2,000 pounds of flour and water. There are blades on the inside that will mix the flour and water in about three minutes. To modify the dough so it can withstand that kind of intensity, you need to add dough stretchers, dough elasticizers, dough conditioners, dough destickers that keep it from sticking, oils that will make every tiny little bubble inside of a loaf of Wonder Bread exactly like the bubble next to it, whereas your French baguette has big holes and little holes and all in between.

So, we have modified food production and bread chemistry. I've looked at the ingredient list on Wonder Bread, and there might be 30, 35 ingredients. From beginning to end, you can have dough on one side and bread in a bag on the other side in under four hours. We're all about speed and convenience in America.

And there's really a fifth ingredient that's in sourdough bread: time. Time is that fermentation process. If it's slow and methodical, flavors develop, aromas develop. You just need your nose to know that it has flavors a speedy bread doesn't have.

Do we have any laws in the US on the books about bread?

If you look, the first ingredient on your loaf of bread is called enriched white flour. Enriched white flour has five things added: thiamine, niacin, riboflavin, iron, and folic acid.

In the 1920s and 1930s, we were making the transition from whole wheat flour — heavy, dense breads that were what your grandparents ate from the old country if you're a white immigrant from Europe — to white bread, which has the germ and all the dark parts removed, which contain the vitamins that the plants provided.

By 1942, in the middle of World War II, the US Army was seeing so many potential recruits who were suffering from vitamin deficiencies — they had pellagra and beriberi and anemia. They were part of a society that, as a whole, moved to this white flour and white pasta for primary carbohydrates. In 1942, the Army said, all of the flour we buy to feed all of our soldiers who are going to go fight for us in World War II has to be enriched.

Here's the kicker. By law, countries all around the world require their flour to be enriched. The law in the US says if your label says that your bread flour is enriched, it must be enriched; it's a label law, not a flour law.

It seems more like a law that's about truth and advertising than it is about the actual bread itself.

Every public health official will tell you that you need to have enriched flour if you're going to have a healthy population.

Do you think people will ever rave about the bread in America the way they do about France? Like people will visit here and be like, I ate the best bread in the United States.

That's a tough one. Inside the sourdough world, what's circulating like crazy is that Taylor Swift has become sourdough-obsessed. So every time she appears on a late-night talk show, she brings a sourdough now. She made a loaf that was good enough to show up in one of her videos. When she first announced this, [fans] cleared the shelves of every sourdough bread they could find. But then, commercial bread has taken over, right? They've since filled shelves with something called Taylor Swift's Funfetti bread.

Wow, capitalism sure does jump in, doesn't it?

So fast, right? So fast. It's going to take a revolution of sorts, and I'm a big believer that bread is the place to start in reshaping and rethinking our cultural attitudes. We would be different people if we took time and put it back into the ingredient list of our foods.

Americans continue to run into issues accessing many online services on Monday afternoon as Amazon works to mitigate a major Amazon Web Service outage.

The AWS outage brought down many online services in the early hours of the morning, including Amazon, Snapchat, Signal, and Perplexity.

A status page for Amazon's cloud unit showed more than 80 of its own services were affected at the outage's peak Monday morning.

While the company said the underlying issue had been ""fully mitigated"" and that most AWS service operations are ""succeeding normally now"" at 6:35 am ET, a new wave of issues appeared to crop up later in the morning for many US users.

At 10:14 a.m. ET, AWS reported ""significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region."" The severity status on the AWS status page is currently ""degraded.""

Reports on Downdetector, a site that tracks online outages, trended up for Amazon, Venmo, and Pinterest.

Many other online services that use AWS' cloud services and infrastructure, including Zoom, Strava, and Amazon's Alexa assistant, appeared to experience outages early Monday morning, according to Downdetector.

Among other services that showed issues on Downdetector earlier on Monday were financial service providers Venmo and Robinhood; airlines including United and Delta; and telecoms giants AT&T and Verizon. User reports also indicated problems with workplace tools, including Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Asana.

Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of AI startup Perplexity, said in an X post at 3:22 a.m. ET that its service is down. ""The root cause is an AWS issue,"" he said. ""We're working on resolving it.""

A United spokesperson told Business Insider that the AWS outage disrupted access to its app and website overnight, and that the airline implemented backup systems to ""end the technology disruption.""

The outage lasted about three hours, with some companies reporting that their services are running again while others are still experiencing issues.

Robinhood said in a post on X that its services are ""back online and recovering,"" while a Snapchat spokesperson told Business Insider the company is aware that some users are experiencing issues with the app and advised them to ""hang tight"" while it investigates.

T-Mobile was listed as showing issues on Downdetector but a company spokesperson told Business Insider that it didn't experience an outage on its own service, and that its customers ""had issues when trying to use other sites or services due to a third party's outage early this morning.""

An Amazon spokesperson directed Business Insider to its service status page.

On Monday morning, AWS's status page showed that DynamoDB, its database service underpinning many online applications, was experiencing ""significant error rates"" for requests to its data centers located on the US East Coast.

The issue stemmed from a problem with DNS, the company said, which translates website names to IP addresses and is often described as a phone book for the internet.

The company's status page first reported that it was investigating the issue at 3:11 a.m. ET on Monday. 

At 12:13 p.m. ET, Amazon reported progress had been made.

""We have taken additional mitigation steps to aid the recovery of the underlying internal subsystem responsible for monitoring the health of our network load balancers and are now seeing connectivity and API recovery for AWS services,"" the company said.

It's not the first time an outage at one service provider has brought down large chunks of the internet.

In July last year, a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused computers around the world to crash, sparking chaos for airlines, hospitals, banks, and businesses.

There have also been notable online service outages in 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 — typically stemming from faulty updates or misconfigurations at one underlying service provider.

""Today's outage is another reminder that the digital world doesn't stop at borders — a local fault can ripple worldwide in minutes,"" said Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at Check Point Software, a cybersecurity company. ""We've built convenience on shared systems, but resilience still depends on people and process.""

Steven Qiu, the founder of Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, says a multi-sensor system is a better and safer approach for self-driving vehicles than the vision-only system touted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a sensor that scans the environment by emitting laser beams and measuring the time it takes to get a return signal. LiDAR can be found in Waymo's robotaxis and consumer products, like robot vacuums and smartphone cameras.

""There's been a lot of debate over whether a vision-only or multi-sensor approach is better when it comes to self-driving vehicles in the past 10 years or so,"" Qiu told Business Insider on the sidelines of the FutureChina Global Forum held in Singapore in September.

""But by now, it is clear that everyone understands that a vision-only approach is not safe enough. There are a lot of corner cases that a vision-only system cannot account for,"" he added.

Qiu told Business Insider that vehicles would not be able to achieve Level 3 or Level 4 driving automation capability with a vision-only system. He added that other sensors, including LiDAR, need to be added to the mix to do so.

The standards organization SAE International ranks automation systems from Level 1 to 5. Level 1 systems can only provide basic assistance, like automatic braking and lane-keeping, while Level 5 systems can drive a vehicle in all conditions. Tesla's Full Self-Driving software requires human supervision and is a Level 2 system.

""Let's say you are cruising on an expressway. If there is a white car that has stopped in front of you, it would be challenging for a vision-only system to tell if it's a car or a white cloud in the sky,"" Qiu said.

""Similarly, if you are driving toward a tunnel, the system may not be able to tell if there's a black car driving ahead of you,"" he added.

RoboSense, founded in 2014, had the world's largest market share for passenger car LiDAR systems in 2024, market research group Yole Group said in a report published in March.

Musk has long been a critic of LiDAR systems, including as recently as August. In April 2019, Musk said at Tesla's ""Autonomy Day"" event that automakers will eventually stop using LiDAR technology on their self-driving vehicles.

""I should point out that I don't actually super hate LiDAR as much as it may sound,"" Musk said, adding that SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft uses LiDAR to navigate and dock at the International Space Station.

""In cars, it's friggin stupid. It's expensive and unnecessary,"" he continued. ""Once you solve vision, it's worthless. So you have expensive hardware that's worthless on the car.""

Qiu said that the cost of LiDAR systems has fallen significantly in the past few years, from about $70,000 per vehicle to around a few hundred dollars. He added that the performance capabilities of LiDAR systems have also increased as their cost continues to decline.

Musk's views on LiDAR appear to be in the minority among auto executives. Ford CEO Jim Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June that his company views LiDAR as ""mission critical.""

""For example, a reflection on the back of a truck or the sun in the camera's eyes where the camera will be completely blinded, the LiDAR system will see exactly,"" Farley said.

Li Xiang, the CEO of Chinese EV maker Li Auto, said at his company's ""AI Talk"" event last year that Musk cannot see the value of LiDAR because American and Chinese traffic conditions are vastly different.

""If you drive in China at night, you will often see trucks with broken tailights, or even trucks without working tailights, just parked on the road,"" he said, adding that existing camera systems would not be able to detect these trucks from afar.

""I believe that if Musk were in China, and driving on various highways late in the night, he would choose to include LiDAR as well,"" he added.

Paris' Louvre Museum remained closed on Monday following a seven-minute jewelry heist that has shocked France.

Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said that the state had ""failed"" to protect one of its most famous landmarks after thieves used a truck and a freight elevator to steal ""priceless"" jewels from the museum's Galerie d'Apollon on Sunday morning.

Speaking on France Inter radio on Monday morning, Darmanin said: ""We cannot completely secure all locations, but what is certain is that we have failed, since it is possible to set up a freight elevator in the middle of a Paris street, lift people up in a matter of minutes to steal priceless jewelry, and give France a terrible image.""

""These people will be arrested,"" he added.

Later on Monday morning, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told BFM TV that around 60 investigators had been mobilized to track down the thieves, adding that the authorities have ""total determination"" to recover the stolen jewels.

Without specifying a timeline, Beccuau said she was confident that the museum ""will be able to reopen in the coming days,"" as technical inspections at the site now appeared to be complete.

French interior minister Laurent Nuñez told France Inter radio on Sunday afternoon that the thieves had gained access to the museum's Galerie d'Apollon early that morning, using a truck with a lift and an angle grinder to breach a window.

They then targeted several display cases before escaping on motor scooters, he said.

""They stole jewelry that I won't list, as I believe there is a criminal investigation underway, but which is jewelry that has real heritage value and is actually priceless,"" Nuñez said, adding that the heist lasted around seven minutes in total.

In a post on X on Sunday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the theft, calling it ""an attack on a heritage we cherish because it is our history"" and pledging to recover the works and bring those responsible to justice.

Macron added that the Louvre Nouvelle Renaissance project, launched in January, includes enhanced security measures ""to ensure the preservation and protection of what constitutes our memory and our culture.""

Culture Minister Rachida Dati said on Sunday afternoon that no injuries had been reported and that she was at the scene with museum staff and police.

According to the Louvre's website, the Galerie d'Apollon houses the French Crown Jewels and hardstone vessels collected by the kings of France.

This is a developing story.

Palmer Luckey says his defense startup Anduril has an internal strategy that guides everything it does: ""China 27.""

""The idea is that anything we are working on, anything that we are investing in, needs to be built with the assumption that sometime in 2027, China is going to move on Taiwan,"" Luckey said on a recent episode of the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast.

Luckey conceded that there's a chance he might be wrong about China's plans for Taiwan, a democratic island that the Chinese government considers a renegade province.

""And I might be wrong on this, right? It might be never. It might be a longer-term thing,"" Luckey said.

""But, in general, like imagine how stupid I'll feel if I spend hundreds of millions of dollars building some new weapon system that I know is not going to come into service until the 2030s, which is what most experts say is outside of the window of when this invasion would happen,"" he said. ""Wouldn't I feel pretty stupid if there's a gigantic fight and I've spent all my money on something that wasn't ready in time?""

Luckey added that he thinks a full-scale invasion of Taiwan isn't likely to be the route the Chinese want to take, and that it would opt for a blockade instead to choke off the island.

""And the thing is, even a blockade, the best way to deter that is for Taiwan to have the things that make them a very prickly porcupine, right?"" Luckey said. ""You want to have things like sea mining capabilities that make a blockade basically impossible to affect without destroying the entire fleet. You want things like missiles and counter-missile systems that make it impossible to lock in the country.""

Luckey told Rogan that he went to Taiwan just a few weeks ago to personally deliver ""a bunch of missiles and weapon systems that are specifically to counter a Chinese invasion.""

He also added that, in his opinion, the US should avoid getting into a ""shooting war"" where US troops are being sent to ""die for other countries."" Instead, the US should become ""the world's gun store,"" he said.

""And, what do you need to do to be a good gun store, right?"" Luckey said. ""You got to keep stuff in stock. You got to keep things on the shelves. You need to be reasonably priced. You need to not arbitrarily cut off allies.""

Representatives for Luckey at Anduril directed Business Insider to his comments on the podcast. 

Under Luckey, Anduril has carved out a space for itself in a defense industry dominated by the prime weapons contractors. The US military, meanwhile, appears willing to move to a more startup-friendly procurement process.

""We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,"" US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on October 13 at the annual meeting of the Association of the United States Army in Washington.

Meta in May announced that it would partner with Anduril to design and build next-generation extended reality gear for military use. Anduril said in a May 29 press release that the project is ""funded through private capital, without taxpayer support, and is designed to save the US military billions of dollars.""

That collaboration's already bearing fruit. Anduril revealed a suite of products called EagleEye on October 13.

The devices range from helmets to visors and glasses, and feature displays that Anduril says can display data like teammates' locations on top of a soldier's view of a live battlefield.

Anduril's also giving defense heavyweights a run for their money on the drone front.

In March, it scored a 10-year, $642 million contract with the US Marine Corps for anti-drone defenses geared toward fighting smaller drones.

Anduril was publicly valued at $30.5 billion in June.

After years of working remotely for companies in North America, I landed a remote role as the head of growth at a European creator tech company in January. I wanted to move back into sales and join a tech company, and this role checked both of those boxes.

My original team operates almost entirely out of North America, but the rest of the company operates on Central European Time. I was allowed to work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern, but all the other team leads live in Europe.

After about two weeks, I realized that working a normal 9-5 schedule left me little time to work with them, build key stakeholder relationships, and ensure I was bringing my best to the role, so I switched my schedule from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern.

Shifting my schedule from a 6 a.m. to a 4:30 a.m. wakeup wasn't a big deal. The first month and a half was exhausting, but I adjusted. I'm in bed by 9 p.m. most nights.

In August, I was promoted to head of plus (professional services), and I now direct the work of four teams, three of which are based mostly in Europe. I'm glad I switched schedules when I first joined, as I believe it made my professional advancement easier.

The difference in my mornings is in how I spend my time. Before I started work at 5, I'd often spend my morning scrolling or have an extra leisurely start, and I'd get nothing productive done. Now, I'm often in a meeting at the beginning of my day or coworking with another team lead.

About an hour before my teams in North America log on, I review everyone's calendars so I know what they have going on in their day and can shift work around so nobody is overburdened. I also review our active deals so I can help things close and ensure we hit or exceed our weekly target.

By the time we have our morning team huddle at 9:30 a.m., I've solved problems, set a clear road map for the day, and done most of my own stuff so I can be available to them for whatever they need.

I stop working on work things somewhere between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. most days. I do my best to leave at 2 p.m., but management is never a 40-hour-a-week job.

I keep my Slack open in case my team has emergency questions. I get maybe two or three messages a day after 2 p.m., and it takes me less than five minutes to get to whatever the team's asking me for, so I really don't mind having to hop back in briefly.

I wasn't sure how working for a predominantly European company would go, as most of what I knew about work culture in Europe came from TV, but it's been overwhelmingly positive. My colleagues have dedicated lunch breaks, so I started taking one for the first time. It's made my back-half-of-the-day decision-making so much sharper.

The company has menstrual leave and a flexible sick days policy, so I also never feel the pressure to show up if I'm not well. At North American companies I've worked for, I was expected to do calls the day after a hip replacement while still in the hospital and work through having COVID-19.

Many of my colleagues take their vacation days without logging into work at all. I always had to leave a method of communication at North American companies, and people reached out to me frequently. I'm still not as chill about disconnecting, but I did spend two weeks in Paris and only checked Slack and email twice, which I consider a win.

On occasion, I also travel for work. I went to the Berlin headquarters in September to work with a few colleagues, so I had the joy of seeing a bit of a new city, collecting a stamp on my passport, and racking up significant airline miles. I love to travel, so this is a huge perk of the job.

My full-time job is just one of my income streams. I have a six-figure revenue stream in career coaching and fractional C-level AI consulting services. In the current market, I'm busy reviewing and rewriting résumés and LinkedIn profiles, helping out-of-work job seekers prep for interviews, and helping current employees set themselves up for a promotion in the next fiscal year.

I write for publications about careers, leadership, AI, and travel, and I'm a coach in a program that helps people grow their LinkedIn following with strategic content. I also occasionally do B2B LinkedIn brand deals to promote products to my 100,000-person audience.

When I worked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., I used to work 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on my other income streams, which meant my weekends were my only free time.

Now, I work from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on those revenue streams. My evenings are mine again, and I can give my clients and my audience my best every day.

Inflation isn't just driving up the cost of rent and groceries — it's coming for your lunch break, too.

New data from ezCater shows employees are spending more than $108 a week on work lunches, up sharply from $88 last year. And as costs climb, a growing number of workers say they're skipping meals entirely to save money.

The report, based on the results of an online survey conducted in June 2025 among 1,000 full-time US employees in on-site or hybrid roles, found that, on average, employees buy lunch 2.6 times each week, spending around $34.82 a week buying lunch out — up 26% compared to last year.

Those increasing costs are then driving more employees, mostly millennials and Gen Z, to skip lunch entirely, which reduces productivity and increases work stress.

Business Insider previously reported that skipping lunch can harm a worker's mental, physical, and social health.

""Our data shows that hangry workers are bad for business: 43% take longer to complete tasks, 38% report being blunt with colleagues, and 25% avoid interacting with their peers,"" Robert Kaskel, VP of People at ezCater, said of the report's findings.

The ezCater report found that not only are younger workers more inclined to skip lunch, they're also more likely to feel guilty about taking a lunch break at all. Gen Z employees in particular are 110% more likely than their older colleagues to believe their boss will frown on them taking a break, the report found.

Business Insider has previously reported that Gen Z employees are more likely than their older colleagues to feel anxiety at work.

""When your youngest employees feel guilty about taking their lunch break, it's a big red flag,"" Kaskel said. ""Pair this lunch guilt with employees' tendency to skip lunch for short-term productivity gains, and business leaders have a performance and burnout issue on their hands.""

A 2021 study published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International found that a regular, one-hour lunch break plays a role in preventing absenteeism and improving employees' job satisfaction and attitudes toward work.

In the ""hardcore"" work era, skipping lunch may seem like a win for efficiency, but a workforce running on empty can't stay productive for long.

If lunch has become a luxury, it's one the modern workplace can't afford to lose.

In this article

Apple shares rose 4% on Monday as a new report showed iPhone 17 sales off to a strong start in the U.S. and China.

The iPhone 17 series, which dropped in September, has outsold the iPhone 16 series by 14% in the U.S. and China within its first 10 days of availability, according to data from Counterpoint research.

""The base model iPhone 17 is very compelling to consumers, offering great value for money,"" Counterpoint senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said in the report. ""A better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade – all for the same price as last year's iPhone 16. Buying this device is a no brainer, especially when you throw channel discounts and coupons into the mix.""

The company is positioned to rally with demand for the latest iPhone generation exceeding expectations, according to Loop Capital.

The investment bank upgraded Apple from hold to buy, raising its price target to $315 per share from $226.

""While [Wall] Street is baking in some degree of outperformance from AAPL's iPhone 17 family of products, we believe there remains material upside to Street expectations through CY2027,"" Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah said in a note to clients on Monday.

Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook visited employees and government officials in China, and appeared at a launch for Apple's new iPhone Air, which reportedly sold out in minutes after going on sale, according to the South China Morning Post.

In a note on Sunday, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said that the iPhone Air's apparent popularity in China may boost Apple shares. They have the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.

The Evercore analysts wrote in the note that Apple is poised to report strong numbers during next week's earnings report.

""We think AAPL is well positioned to report upside to Sep-qtr expectations later this month,"" Daryanani wrote.

Apple shares have had an up-and-down year so far. The stock is up about 5% in 2025, significantly lagging big Magnificent 7 winners Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet, but has roared 24% over the last 3 months.

Anthropic on Monday announced Claude for Life Sciences, a new offering for researchers to use the company's artificial intelligence technology in the advancement of scientific discovery. 

Claude for Life Sciences is built around Anthropic's existing AI models, but supports new connections with other scientific tools that are commonly used in labs during research and development.

It will be able to help researchers through all stages of the discovery process, from carrying out literature reviews to developing hypotheses, analyzing data, drafting regulatory submissions and more, Anthropic said.

The launch of Claude for Life Sciences marks Anthropic's first formal entry into the sector, and comes just months after the company hired longtime industry executive Eric Kauderer-Abrams as its head of biology and life sciences. 

""Now is the threshold moment for us where we've decided this is a big investment area,"" Kauderer-Abrams told CNBC in an interview. ""We want a meaningful percentage of all of the life science work in the world to run on Claude, in the same way that that happens today with coding.""

Anthropic, which is one of the companies at the center of the AI boom, develops a family of large language models called Claude. It was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers, and its valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years.

The company launched a new model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, late last month and said it is ""significantly better"" at life sciences tasks like understanding laboratory protocols.  

Kauderer-Abrams said researchers have already been engaging with Anthropic's models to help with isolated parts of the scientific process, so the company decided to formally build out Claude for Life Sciences as a way to support them from start to finish. 

That meant Anthropic had to establish integrations with key players in the life sciences ecosystem, including Benchling, PubMed, 10x Genomics and Synapse.org, among others. Anthropic has also partnered with companies that can help life sciences organizations adopt AI, like Caylent, KPMG, Deloitte, and cloud providers AWS and Google Cloud, the company said.

""We're willing and enthusiastic about doing that grind to make sure that all the pieces come together,"" Kauderer-Abrams said.

In a prerecorded demo, Anthropic showed how a scientist working on preclinical studies could use Claude for Life Sciences to compare two study designs that test different dosing strategies. 

The scientist was able to query her lab's data directly from Benchling, generate a summary and tables of key differences with links back to the original material. After reviewing the results, the scientist generated a study report that could be included in a regulatory submission. 

Anthropic said an analysis like this used to require ""days"" of validating and compiling information, but now, it can be done in minutes. 

Kauderer-Abrams said the company believes AI can bring about real efficiency gains for the life sciences sector, but it's also under ""no illusions"" that it will magically overcome the physical limitations of conducting scientific research. Clinical trials that take three years are not suddenly going to take one month, he said.

Instead, Anthropic is focused on exploring the time-consuming, expensive parts of the discovery process ""piece by piece"" to determine where AI could be most useful.

""We're here to make sure that this transformation happens and that it's done responsibly,"" Kauderer-Abrams said.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday that Elon Musk's SpaceX is falling ""behind"" the U.S. timeline to return to the moon with Artemis and he will open the contract to other companies.

""We're not going to wait for one company,"" Duffy, who is currently the acting NASA administrator, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. ""We're going to push this forward and win the second space race against the Chinese. Get back to the moon, set up a camp, a base.""

SpaceX did not immediately return a request for comment.

SpaceX is among the various contractors participating in NASA's Artemis mission, which aims to establish the ""first long-term presence on the Moon"" and prepare for missions to Mars. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are also supporting the mission.

SpaceX won a contract in 2021 to provide a lunar landing system for astronauts on the Artemis III mission.

In December, NASA pushed back the next Artemis missions, with the next launch to send astronauts around the moon and back delayed until April 2026 and the trip to land two astronauts on the south polar region of the Moon moved to 2027.

Duffy said Monday that he thinks the April launch can happen in early February and the agency is looking to get ""back to the moon in 2028"" with two potential companies. Duffy highlighted Blue Origin as a potential competitor that could take over.

""They push their timelines out, and we're in a race against China,"" Duffy said of SpaceX. ""The president and I want to get to the moon in this president's term, so I'm going to open up the contracts.""

Rocket tests for SpaceX and the space sector haven't always been smooth sailing.

The company launched its eleventh Starship test rocket earlier this month following a string of stumbling blocks and explosions. Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket exploded last month, shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration cleared it to continue testing.

The ongoing government shutdown could put a dent in plans to reopen contracts. CNBC's request for comment on the contracting process was answered with an automatic reply that the agency was closed.

CNBC previously reported that NASA employees working on the Artemis missions with contractors such as SpaceX and Blue Origin would continue working during the shutdown.

TKMS, the German warship manufacturer which has spun out from parent group Thyssenkrupp, plans to capitalize on the expected surge in Europe's defense spend with ""prudent, margin-oriented growth"" after debuting on Frankfurt's stock exchange Monday.  

The initial public offering saw TKMS launch at around 60 euros ($70) per share — giving it a market value of around 3.8 billion euros ($4.4 billion) — drawing strong demand from investors. Industrial engineering giant Thyssenkrupp will continue to hold a 51% stake in the company following the offering.

The company, also known as Thyssenkrupp Marine Services, builds both submarines and surface vessels, as well as electronics and software technology, which TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard called the ""jewel in the chest box"" of the company.

This includes sonar equipment and certain autonomous devices, which are critical in the so-called 'mighty domain' operations ""which is the next big thing in military warfare,"" Burkhard told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.

The IPO will enable the company to raise capital and expand capacity amid an anticipated ramp-up in demand for stronger defense capability, particularly in the naval sector, in Europe in the coming decades.

The U.S. has 71 submarines, while Russia has an estimated 64. Germany, by comparison, has just six, and has ordered six more.

Burkhard said TKMS has an order backlog of 18.6 billion euros, which will mean the company will likely remain at full capacity towards 2040, with one submarine typically taking between 5 and 15 years to build.

TKMS has doubled its capacity in recent years, and now has two shipyards where it can build state-of-the-art submarines, which can remain underwater for weeks at a time.

""With that capacity we're having, we can of course build our order book and we can also take on other orders,"" Burkhard said, adding that the firm is targeting ""prudent, margin-oriented growth.""

The company benefits from a ""robust"" supply chain, about 90% of which is in Europe, mostly in Germany, he said.

Thyssenkrupp's shares were were preliminarily 7.3% higher when the trading session closed on Monday. The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index advanced about 2.7% by close, with battle tank parts maker Renk closing 6.7% higher, defense technology firm Hensoldt rising almost 7.9%, and Rheinmetall settling on a gain of 5.9%.

Gareth McCartney, global co-head of equity capital markets at UBS, said TKMS' public debut comes at a time when investors are sitting on considerable liquidity, and have demonstrated a solid appetite for IPOs in the region.

""We now have a catalyst over the last few months with both defense and infrastructure spending very much at the core of what international investors are looking for when they look towards investing in Europe,"" McCartney told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.

Shares of U.S.-listed companies related to the rare earth supply chain climbed on Monday as investors continued to weigh the impact of export restrictions on domestic producers.  

Rare earths are minerals that are essential to many aspects of modern life, particularly for the technology sector and the energy transition, as they are used in everything from semiconductors, fighter jets to the motors of electric vehicles.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview last week that the President Donald Trump's administration will set a price floor for rare earths to combat market manipulation by China. Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors consider which firms might be future targets for the government's industrial policy.

NioCorp led the sector's gains with an increase of 9.3% shortly after the session began, at 9:45 a.m. in New York. Energy Fuels was last seen 3.8% higher while USA Rare Earth made gains of 2.9% and Perpetua Resources was up 3.4%. MP Materials was also in the green, moving 1.8% higher.

Canadian firms made gains, with Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals increasing 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively.

The moves come as the Trump administration is working to build up its own domestic rare earth supply chain.

The Defense Department struck a deal in July with MP Materials, which is the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.

Investors are anticipating that the administration will back additional miners. William Blair initiated coverage of USA Rare Earth on Monday with an outperform rating on the expectation that the Trump administration ""could soon take a material stake in the company.""

Michael Silver, the CEO and chairman of rare earths distributor American Elements told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week that the U.S. has enough heavy rare metals for its military applications, but the supply chain squeeze could impact EVs, lasers, and ""quite a lot of commercial technology."" 

Getting mines up and running should be ""treated as national priorities,"" Silver said, adding that there will likely be government involvement and subsidies.  

Under new rules that were announced earlier this month, foreign companies now need Beijing's approval to export rare earths and are required to explain what they will be used for.

In this article

Amazon Web Services, a leader in the cloud infrastructure market, reported a major outage on Monday, taking down numerous major websites. 

Many sites came back online within a few hours, although Downdetector showed another spike in user reports around noon ET of outages at Amazon, AWS and Alexa.

Around 11 a.m. ET, AWS said it was working to identify the ""root cause"" for the network connectivity issues impacting some of its services.

""We have identified that the issue originated from within the EC2 internal network,"" the company wrote, referring to its popular cloud service that provides virtual server capacity. ""We continue to investigate and identify migrations.""

The outage was first reported at 3:11 a.m. ET in AWS' main US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. A notice on AWS' status page said it was experiencing DNS problems with DynamoDB, its database service that underpins many other AWS applications.

DNS, or Domain Name System, translates website names to IP addresses so browsers and other applications can load.

AWS cited an ""operational issue"" affecting ""multiple services"" and said it was ""working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery,"" in an update at 5:01 a.m. ET. More than 70 of its own services were affected.

Shortly afterward, AWS said it was seeing ""significant signs of recovery.""

AWS said in an update at 6:35 a.m. ET that the DNS issue had been ""fully mitigated"" and that AWS service operations were ""succeeding normally.""

AWS is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure technology, accounting for around a third of the market, ahead of Microsoft and Google, according to Synergy Research Group. Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS for cloud computing services, such as servers and storage.

Downdetector showed user reports indicating problems at sites including Disney+, Lyft, the McDonald's app, The New York Times, Reddit, Ring doorbells, Robinhood, Snapchat, United Airlines and Venmo.

British government websites Gov.uk and HM Revenue and Customs were also experiencing issues, per Downdetector.

A government spokesperson told CNBC: ""We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.""

Lloyds Banking Group confirmed that some of its services were affected and asked customers ""to bear with us"" while it worked to restore them. Some 20 minutes later, it added that services were coming back online.

The outage also brought down critical tools inside Amazon. Warehouse and delivery employees, along with drivers for Amazon's Flex service, reported on Reddit that internal systems were offline at many sites. Some warehouse workers were instructed to stand by in break rooms and loading areas during their shift, while they couldn't load Amazon's Anytime Pay app, which lets employees access a portion of their paycheck immediately.

Seller Central, the hub used by Amazon's third-party sellers to manage their businesses, was also knocked offline by the outage.

Reddit, too, is ""working on scaling Reddit back to 100 percent as we speak,"" a spokesperson told CNBC.

Some United and Delta Air Lines customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags.

Canvas, an online teaching platform used to host course information and submit assignments, said it was also hit by the ""ongoing AWS incident.""

Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage.

Graphic design tool Canva said it was ""experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider.""

Generative artificial intelligence search tool Perplexity was also affected. ""The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it,"" CEO Aravind Srinivas said in a post on X.

It's not the first time in recent history that major companies have been affected by a technical issue. In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed the fragility of global technology infrastructure when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. It also affected hospitals and banks.

AWS has also experienced other outages in recent years. A disruption in 2023 knocked many websites offline for several hours, while a more severe outage in 2021 affected websites and services across the globe, including some of Amazon's own delivery operations, which were briefly brought to a standstill.

""There's no sign that this AWS outage was caused by a cyberattack - it looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres,"" Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN, said in a statement. ""These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.""

An Amazon spokesperson pointed to AWS' service health dashboard when reached for comment.

Indeed, ""DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know,"" Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. However, it ""is one of the record-keepers of the modern Internet.""

""We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. The data appears to be safe. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data,"" he added.

""This episode serves as a reminder of how dependent the world is on a handful of major cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. When a major cloud provider sneezes, the Internet catches a cold.""

In this article

DETROIT — ""A lot of cost and a lot of chaos."" That's how Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley described the state of the automotive industry earlier this year amid geopolitical tensions, tariffs, inflation and other disruptions.

All those factors created massive uncertainty for the U.S. automotive industry that led to relatively bearish outlooks for the sector in 2025. Some of those concerns have come to fruition, but the industry has proven to be far more resilient than many had expected.

""Six months into the onset of tariffs, we've been positively surprised by the extent to which the industry has held in better than anticipated,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an investor note last month that upgraded the U.S. auto/mobility sector to neutral from negative.

The neutral rating by Barclays speaks volumes about the state of the automotive industry right now, according to auto executives, insiders and analysts who say circumstances aren't as bad as they once feared — but also that they still aren't as positive or certain as they could be.

S&P Global last week released a new report explaining how tariff burdens have eased, but noting that demand headwinds persist amid slowing disposable income growth, consumer pessimism and fluid trade policies. The government shutdown also adds uncertainty to the economic outlook, the firm said.

The cautiousness followed S&P revising its U.S. light vehicle sales estimates upward by about 2%, to 16.1 million vehicles for 2025, and to 15.3 million, up 200,000, in 2026.

Part of what's driven the unexpected optimism has been industry sales and production holding up much better than expected, in addition to broader macroeconomics such as consumer spending being relatively stable.

""The [economic] outlook is getting better, and part of it is realizing that tariffs didn't end the world, and that applies to the auto market as well,"" Cox Automotive's chief economist, Jonathan Smoke, told CNBC. ""I think we can navigate it, and I'm holding on to that optimistic outlook.""

Such optimism will be tested as major automakers such as General Motors, Ford and Tesla begin announcing third-quarter results this week.

Each of the American automakers is expected to report double-digit declines in adjusted earnings per share but remain profitable on an adjusted basis, according to analyst estimates compiled by LSEG.

""We expect Q3 earnings that [are] generally in line to slightly above expectations. Industry production did come in better than expected,"" Wolfe Research analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in an Oct. 10 investor note. ""But as always there are nuances to consider.""

The automotive industry is in a bit of a balancing act.

Tariffs have cost automakers billions of dollars this year, but deregulation of fuel economy penalties, as well as corporate gains under the Trump administration's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" are expected to help offset those costs, Ford's Farley and others have said.

Meanwhile, there are red flags of stress in auto lending for lower credit buyers, including the recent bankruptcy of subprime auto lender Tricolor — but sales and pricing of new vehicles through the third quarter remained far better than many had expected.

""There's some positives for next year, but there could also be some really bad negatives if there's a freak out on tariffs or the consumer finally breaks down or whatnot,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston told CNBC. ""But no one's calling for a complete crash.""

Whiston — who covers GM, Ford and several auto retailers and suppliers — characterized his outlook as ""cautiously optimistic,"" saying the significant industry concerns are countered by other bullish circumstances.

UBS analyst Joseph Spak agreed, noting a lot of challenges for automakers such as tariffs and losses on electric vehicles ""have already been incorporated into 2025/2026 estimates,"" he said in an investor note last month.

In addition to the economic and political concerns, the automotive industry faces significant changes in all-electric vehicle adoption that caused GM last week to pre-report $1.6 billion in special charges during the quarter related to its pullback in EVs.

Adding to this year's ""chaos,"" especially for Ford, is a fire last month at aluminum supplier Novelis that is impacting vehicle production. Wall Street analysts estimate the fire to cost Ford between $500 million and $1 billion in operating income.

""The industry is in a lot of flux. It faces an array of challenges,"" Elaine Buckberg, a senior fellow at Harvard University and former GM chief economist, said regarding tariffs, EVs and other issues. ""The level of volatility they've faced over the last seven years or so is unlike what came before.""

The broader supplier industry remains a major potential concern for automakers, as it did to begin the year.

The automotive supplier industry is made up of thousands of companies — ranging from multibillion-dollar publicly traded corporations to ""mom-and-pop shops"" making one or two parts — that industry experts say cannot support many, if any, additional cost increases.

""The market has been under pressure. It's fragile,"" said Mike Jackson, executive director of strategy and research for vehicle supplier association MEMA. ""Those suppliers that are flexible and agile have been able to reposition themselves to be successful despite the changes, despite the shifts.""

Not all have been able to compete successfully. The bankruptcy of U.S. auto parts maker First Brands Group in late September heightened concerns on Wall Street about the health of the private credit market. First Brands had a web of complex debt agreements with a slew of lenders and investment funds globally.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon last week called the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings ""early signs"" of excess in corporate lending, while some Wall Street analysts have written them off as idiosyncratic.

Executives have said automakers, also known as OEMs, or original equipment manufacturers, have so far done their best to assist suppliers when needed and have not passed on added tariff costs to such companies, but it's unclear how long that may last.

""Suppliers clearly are working as hard as they can with their customers to try and mitigate the impact, understating it's an important issue to work through,"" Jackson said. ""That said, there have been a number of different cost pressures that we've seen that go beyond the tariffs. … It varies by customer, by OEM.""

Shares of many larger publicly traded suppliers, such as Aptiv, BorgWarner, Dana and Adient, are up double digits so far this year. Even Canada-based Magna International, which at one point was expected to be one of the companies most impacted by tariffs, is up roughly 7%.

Those gains are despite the third quarter marking the 14th consecutive quarter of building pessimism by North American auto supplier executives, according to MEMA's most recent ""Vehicle Supplier Barometer"" released earlier this month.

Adding to supplier concerns are continuing issues with tariffs between the U.S. with Mexico and Canada as well as the Trump administration's ongoing trade war with China, where many rare earth materials, some of which are used in vehicles, are processed and sourced.

There are also continuing concerns that the automotive industry is an example of a ""K-shaped"" economy in the U.S., where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.

Economists have warned the U.S. economy is increasingly K-shaped following the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers experiencing different realities depending on their income level.

Used vehicle retailer CarMax was the first major auto-related company to sound the alarm on the consumer late last month.

""The consumer has been distressed for a little while. I think there's some angst,"" CarMax CEO Bill Nash told analysts earlier this month, with an auto lending executive for the used car retailer warning the ""cracks"" are ""an industry issue.""

But that ""issue"" appears to only be for lower-income consumers or those with subprime credit, many of whom are not new car buyers.

Wealthier Americans have been assisted by rising house values, lucrative stock market returns and favorable credit, while lower- and middle-income buyers have faced tighter budgets and have been hit hard by rising inflation.

Fitch Ratings reports 6.43% of subprime auto loans in August were at least 60 days past due, in line with a record high of 6.45% that was hit in January. Delinquency rates for borrowers with higher scores have remained relatively stable.

""Clearly there is concern about the consumer, because if you're not in the upper part of the 'K' then yes, there is stress,"" Cox Automotive's Smoke said. ""But it tends to be a demographic story about median and below income households.""

About two-thirds of new vehicle purchases are made by people whose household income is above the median, according to Buckberg. The U.S. household median income last year was $83,730, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates

That percentage could continue to grow and impact sales if tariff costs begin getting passed on to new car buyers or the whiplashing regulatory chaos barrels more into the automotive industry.

""That's really the big question for 2026. I think everyone in the industry is assuming consumers are going to start to get tariffs passed down to them for autos. They haven't really yet,"" Whiston said. ""How does the consumer react to that? Will they just take it in stride, pay more and keep going? Or will it just cause a massive freak out? No one knows the answer to that yet.""

In this article

Airline websites, including those for Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, were affected during Monday's hourslong disruption of Amazon Web Services, the massive cloud computing provider, with some customers complaining they were unable to access flight check-in functions or their reservations.

At 5:27 a.m. ET, Amazon said: ""We are seeing significant signs of recovery. Most requests should now be succeeding. We continue to work through a backlog of queued requests. We will continue to provide additional information.""

The company had said earlier Monday on its AWS dashboard that its customers were experiencing ""increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.""

Some reservations were showing up on airline apps, while customers complained on social media that they couldn't check in or drop off bags, for several hours.

United responded to a customer on X on Monday that it was ""experiencing a system glitch affecting our online tools.""

United told CNBC some of its internal systems were temporarily affected by the outage and that it was using backups to end the disruption. The airline said ""our teams are working to get our customers on their way.""

Delta said mid-morning it had some ""minor"" delays on Monday because of the outage but that it did not ""anticipate any significant customer impact moving forward as a result of this event.""

A massive CrowdStrike outage in July 2024, due to a botched software update, took thousands of Microsoft Windows systems offline, disrupting air travel and other industries around the world. Delta said the disruption forced it to cancel more than 5,000 flights and cost it more than $500 million in revenue and compensation for passengers, among other expenses.

The disruptions on Monday occurred as the U.S. government shutdown stretches on. Staffing shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work though they're not getting paid during the impasse, contributed to delays at major U.S. airports on Sunday, including in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas;  Chicago and Newark, New Jersey.

More than 7,800 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, according to FlightAware, with staffing shortages, bad weather and other constraints contributing to the problems.

U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a shift in support toward Russia's Vladimir Putin as he looks for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, likely striking fear into Ukrainian officials.

Trump held a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the potential supply of U.S. long-range cruise missiles, Tomahawks, on the agenda.

Zelenskyy walked away from the meeting not only empty-handed, but apparently upbraided by Trump, who said Ukraine should accept Russia's terms for ending the war — by handing over the entire eastern territory of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters this weekend, Trump said for Donbas to be ""cut the way it is.""

""It's cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,"" he said on Air Force One on Sunday. ""They should stop right now at the battle lines. ... Go home, stop killing people and be done.""

In the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also warned the Ukrainian leader that Putin had told him — in a lengthy phone call on Thursday in which they agreed to hold in-person talks in Hungary — that Russia would ""destroy"" Ukraine if it did not agree to the demand.

The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy descended into a ""shouting match,"" the Financial Times reported, with Trump ""cursing all the time,"" according to unnamed people familiar with the matter cited by the FT.

In a Truth Social post, Trump described the meeting as ""very interesting, and cordial,"" but said he had ""strongly suggested"" to both leaders that it was time to end the war.

""Let both claim Victory, let History decide!"" he said in the post Friday.

Zelenskyy put on a brave face, telling NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" in an interview recorded Friday after the meeting with Trump, that ""we are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning."" He also remained optimistic despite leaving the White House without the Tomahawk missiles he was coveting.

""It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'"" Zelenskyy told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker in the interview, which aired Sunday.

He also said he was ready to join Putin and Trump's upcoming summit in Budapest, which could take place in the next few weeks. Whether Zelenskyy will be invited to Hungary remains to be seen, however.

As well as declining to provide Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, which Trump had previously mooted in an apparent bid to bring Russia to the negotiating table, Trump also mused about giving security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the talks.

The White House declined to comment further to CNBC on Monday.

As for Moscow, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told CNBC on Monday in emailed comments that the Kremlin welcomes ""Trump's efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in Ukraine.""

Close followers of Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy relations fear the U.S. president is easily swayed by the veteran Russian leader's arguments over Ukraine. They say Trump does not appear ready or willing to exert more pressure on Putin, be it in the form of more arms transfers to Kyiv, or more economic restrictions on Russia.

""We keep dismissing Donald Trump as kind of 'Everybody's Fool' because he's so bombastic and says many things a mile a minute, but he actually is being very transactional about the relationship,"" Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at The New School, told CNBC ""Squawk Box"" on Friday.

""Everybody keeps pulling him one side or another, be it the Russian side or Ukrainian side. But he's not taking sides, and he's really playing, interestingly, both hands.""

She noted that Trump still wants to win over Putin, but is also keeping him on a ""tight leash,"" demonstrated by his threat to give Ukraine more weapons.

""So far, I think it is working. He's not giving either side what they wanted, but he keeps going, and eventually, potentially, they may agree to some sort of a peace agreement,"" she said.

Michael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC that Putin is likely to wait Trump out.

""I think it would be more effective [for Trump] to combine the military threat with greater economic pressure, but we'll see maybe that comes later,"" he noted Friday.

O'Hanlon said there were several ways the U.S. could ramp up the pressure on Moscow, including another U.S. aid package for Ukraine and a bigger crackdown on Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of tankers facilitating shipments of Russian crude to circumvent the oil price cap and sanctions.

""We don't do much trading with Russia, but, of course, other countries do, and I think it's time to talk to not just India, but also China about a strategy whereby they would consider reducing their interaction, their economic interaction, and you threaten secondary sanctions if you don't get that kind of help,"" he said.

""So those are the different pieces. Not all of them have to happen at the exact same minute, and they can happen. They can be phased in, but I think President Trump is a little too fixated on just the Tomahawks, plus his personal rapport with Putin, and I don't think that's going to be enough [to stop Russia].""

In this article

Gucci owner Kering has agreed to sell its beauty business to L'Oreal for 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion), in a major shift in strategy by new CEO Luca de Meo as he moves to tackle the luxury group's high debt and refocus on its core fashion business. 

Under the deal, French beauty giant L'Oreal will acquire Kering's fragrance line Creed, which former CEO Francois-Henri Pinault acquired in 2023 for 3.5 billion euros, as well as exclusive rights to develop fragrance and beauty products for 50 years under Kering's fashion labels including Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.

L'Oreal will also get the Gucci license, also for 50 years, once a deal with Coty, which analysts believe to last until 2028, expires.

""We believe selling Kering Beauté at around the same price paid for Creed two years ago is bitter but necessary medicine,"" said analysts at Bernstein.

While the idea of selling the beauty business had been identified as an option before de Meo officially took charge in September, the Italian dramatically accelerated discussions with L'Oreal this month, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Kering beauty will be L'Oreal's largest acquisition to date, bigger than its purchase of Australian brand Aesop for $2.5 billion in 2023. The deal makes sense strategically, Bernstein analysts said, with Creed one of the most exciting brands in the growing luxury fragrances area.

Shares in Kering jumped 4.7% while L'Oreal rose 1.4%.

The sale is a significant step towards reducing Kering's net debt, which stood at 9.5 billion euros at the end of June, on top of 6 billion euros in long-term lease liabilities, sparking investor concern. It is also a major shift in direction by De Meo less than two months after taking the helm, as he unwinds one of the biggest strategic pivots made by his predecessor Francois-Henri Pinault, whose family controls the group, in recent years.

Kering set up its beauty business in 2023 after acquiring perfume maker Creed to cut its reliance on star brand Gucci, which accounts for most of its profits. But the French conglomerate has struggled to ramp up the beauty business. The division that comprises beauty operations reported a 60 million euro operating loss for the first half of the year.

Kering is also battling declining growth at its largest brand Gucci as demand in the key Chinese market slowed. Gucci's revenue plummeted 25% year-on-year in the last reported quarter, increasing the pressure on Kering to deleverage to avoid further credit downgrades. De Meo, who took over as CEO in September, had told shareholders he planned to take some difficult decisions to reduce debt at the group, including rationalising and reorganising where necessary. The company has also postponed a plan to fully acquire Italian fashion brand Valentino, and is aiming to sell stakes in its real estate to raise cash.

L'Oreal, the maker of Maybelline make-up and CeraVe skincare, already produces blockbuster perfumes under the Yves Saint Laurent label after acquiring rights to the brand from Kering for 1.15 billion euros in 2008. The two companies also said they were setting up a joint venture to provide experiences and services for luxury clients.

Fragrances, which account for about 14% of L'Oreal's 2024 revenues, according to Bernstein, were growing in double-digit figures in the second quarter at L'Oreal, outperforming the segment.

""L'Oreal enjoys strong momentum in the Luxe division and they must be looking forward to getting hold of the perfume and beauty licences associated with Kering's prestigious yet relatively underdeveloped brands,"" said Bruno-Roland Bernard, a consultant and adjunct professor for corporate finance and luxury management at Paris-based Institut Francais de la Mode.

""It's also possible they are taking advantage of a favourable bargaining position - with limited competition: who has the credentials and the firepower to deal with a Kering under time pressure?""

It is not clear where the deal leaves talks between Armani group and L'Oreal, which was named in the will of late designer Giorgio Armani as one of the preferred buyers for a minority stake in his fashion house.

Kering was advised by Evercore and Centerview, and L'Oreal by Bank of America and Rothschild. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Activist investor Jana Partners has taken a stake in medical device maker Cooper Companies and will push the firm to explore strategic options, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

Shares of Cooper Companies jumped 6% in premarket trading Monday.

The hedge fund, founded by Barry Rosenstein and known for pressuring companies to make changes that enhance shareholder value, also intends to urge Cooper to improve how it allocates capital in order to boost returns, said the Journal, which cited sources close to the matter.

CNBC reached out to Jana Partners for comment and didn't immediately hear back.

Jana may encourage Cooper to consider merging its contact-lens business with rival Bausch + Lomb, the Journal reported.

Cooper recently cut its full-year revenue outlook in August, citing weaker demand in some markets. The stock is down nearly 22% this year.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin rose back above $110,000 early Monday, rebounding alongside broader crypto market gains as traders regained confidence in macroeconomic conditions.

According to The Block's crypto price page, bitcoin climbed 3.16% in the past 24 hours to trade at $110,544, after spending the previous four days below the $110,000 mark.

Ether jumped 3.6% to trade at $4,036, reclaiming the $4,000 threshold. BNB gained 3.91%, XRP advanced 3.54% and Solana added 2.68%, signaling renewed optimism across the broader crypto market.

""The recent rebound in Bitcoin, now trading above $110,000, has been driven by a combination of institutional inflows and improving macroeconomic conditions,"" said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. Lucas pointed out that spot crypto ETFs have seen renewed demand, with participants treating the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity. 

The crypto market had recently faltered from major macroeconomic headlines including U.S. President Donald Trump's China tariffs announcement and mounting concerns regarding U.S. regional banks' involvement with bad loans.

Despite the macro headwinds, traders are now factoring in a potential interest rate cut in October and an early end to quantitative tightening, the analyst said. 

""Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that while growth remains firmer than expected, labor market softness persists,"" Lucas said. ""This shift has eased bond yields and improved the liquidity environment for risk assets, including digital assets.""

The CME Group's FedWatch Tool currently indicates a 98.9% chance that the U.S. would lower rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting.

""Upcoming U.S. inflation and manufacturing figures, along with Australian employment and retail data, could influence interest rate expectations and broader risk sentiment,"" Lucas said. ""These factors will likely determine whether Bitcoin continues to consolidate or begins a new directional move.""

Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu said the key levels to watch at current prices are $107,000 and $110,000.

""A break below structural support around $107K may trigger liquidations and a sharp sentiment shift, especially if macro or geopolitical shocks resurface,"" Liu said. ""Sustained buying pressure above $111K could extend momentum and open the door for another leg higher.""

Lucas also noted that bitcoin is testing resistance between $111,700 and $115,500, where a decisive break above $111,000 could result in a short squeeze, potentially accelerating upward momentum.

Nonetheless, significant near-term risks remain, according to BTC Markets' Lucas. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, especially with the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting at the end of the month, which Lucas said carries ""significant headline risk.""

On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally.

Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains.

Huge L for the entire community tbh

— Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025



The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on “cryptographic proof instead of trust” and the problems with traditional systems being related to “all the trust that's required to make it work,” much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino.

Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called “stablechains,” which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets.

A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value.  Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them.  OTOH,…

— Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2025



Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma.

More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks.

As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy.

There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain.

Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size war back in 2017. However, Ethereum's reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology.

As seen by the recent “stablechain” phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoin's main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network.

While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Corporate creep could corrupt Ethereum's ethos, dev warns","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-dev-warns-paradigm-influence-tail-risk-ethereum","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:14:47 GMT","

 Ethereum developer Federico Carrone warns venture capital firm Paradigm's growing influence on the network could eventually lead to a misalignment in values. 

Ethereum developer Federico Carrone says the growing influence of corporations such as Paradigm on the network could be  “tail risk” for the Ethereum ecosystem.

In a post on Sunday, the Ethereum core dev, who goes by “Fede's intern” on X, argued that while Paradigm has “created valuable things for the community,” he is worried about the growing influence of a venture fund whose ultimate goals are driven by profit and influence. “I've been saying for the past two years that the influence of @paradigm within Ethereum could become a relevant tail risk for the ecosystem. I believe this will become increasingly clear to everyone in the months ahead.”  

Carrone added that while Paradigm's hiring of key Ethereum researchers and funding of open source libraries that are “critical to Ethereum” looks good on the surface, it's not for those who think that Ethereum should represent a “philosophical and political” movement that is “larger than any corporation.”

Paradigm has made a series of Ethereum plays over the years, which also includes the Rust-language-based Ethereum development software Reth.

One of the most recent notable plays includes the incubation of a competing layer-1 blockchain, Tempo, in partnership with fintech giant Stripe.

Tempo is still in the works and will be a stablecoin and payments-focused L1 with Stripe essentially being in control of the network. Its ethos marks a stark contrast to Ethereum's decentralized and open-source nature, given that it will be a corporate-controlled chain. 

Related: Can Ethereum price reclaim $4,500 in October?

Ultimately, Carrone's concerns center around the differing aims of decentralized and centralized entities, and the dangers of allowing any type of fund — not just Paradigm — to have too much sway over the Ethereum ecosystem. 

“Ethereum should be extremely cautious about developing a technical deep dependency on a fund that is playing cards in a very strategic way.”

Cointelegraph reached out to Paradigm for comment, but did not hear back by the time of writing. 

Paradigm is a crypto and AI investment firm founded in 2018 by former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Paradigm has invested widely across the market, covering anything from DeFi and NFTs to blockchain security, infrastructure and startups.  

In its initial announcement of Tempo in September, Paradigm outlined its goal was to push forward the technology and adoption of crypto through a “mix of investing, building, and researching.” 

“This helps us understand friction points and opportunities, and keeps us close to the edge of what's possible,” the announcement reads. Outside of purely financial plays, it has made several moves that display a firm conviction in the crypto community. It submitted an amicus brief in support of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm and hired respected blockchain sleuth ZachXBT as an adviser to fund research and help protect its VC companies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Tom Lee's BitMine expands Ethereum holdings after $820 million week of buying","https://www.tradingview.com/news/the_block:e993367d0094b:0-tom-lee-s-bitmine-expands-ethereum-holdings-after-820-million-week-of-buying/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 14:14:55 GMT","

Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (ticker BMNR) has disclosed a fresh week of ether accumulation, saying it purchased roughly 203,826 ETH and now holds 3.24 million ETH in total.

The company also listed 192 bitcoin, $219 million in cash, and $119 million in equity of Eightco Holdings as part of $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings.

BitMine's ether position represents about 2.7% of ETH's circulating supply and solidifies its lead as the largest digital asset treasury company focused on Ethereum, according to the press release.

The update is part of a string of rapid-fire purchases that The Block has tracked this month. Onchain watchers last week flagged a 104,000 ETH transfer inbound to BitMine-linked addresses during a market drawdown. Earlier this month, the firm said its ether balance had topped 3 million.

Meanwhile, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee has argued that Ethereum is a ""truly neutral"" chain likely to see growing institutional adoption, a view the company has used to justify its bid to reach 5% of ETH's supply over time.

Ether's price is down almost 10% in October following the recent historic deleveraging event. BitMine has framed the buying as opportunistic amid post-liquidation price dislocations.

""The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week, and this put downward pressure on ETH prices,"" Lee said, adding that ""given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward.""

Ether has hovered near $4,000 today, according to The Block's price page, while BMNR shares rose 7% shortly after today's announcement and U.S. market open.

Bitcoin's weekend rebound has set off a selective rally in altcoins, with Bittensor and Zcash leading gains as BNB, last week's top performer, slipped from focus.

Bitcoin's rebound from $105,000 to an intraday high of $110,000 came as macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions showed signs of improvement.

The weekend's strength has set the stage for renewed momentum in altcoins.

""Bitcoin's rally has renewed market confidence,"" Shawn Young, chief analyst of MEXC Research, told Decrypt. ""Traders are now rotating capital into high beta assets to seek short-term outperformance,"" signaling a comeback in speculative appetite.

Bittensor rose 12% over the past 24 hours, extending gains from last week's 11.1% rise. Zcash also advanced 10.2%, trimming a seven-day loss of 11.4%, according to CoinGecko. 

BNB, by contrast, has lost steam, down 12.3% over the week despite a modest 4.1% daily uptick. The rotation reflects typical market cycles, where shifting narratives and profit-taking after brief rallies redirect capital toward altcoins showing fresh momentum, Young said.

Despite the rebound in altcoins, Bitcoin's market dominance held steady near 60%, indicating investors remain hesitant to move significantly away from the leading cryptocurrency.

“Over the next few weeks, the focus will shift to whether Bitcoin can hold its key support levels, Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, told Decrypt. ""If it does, we could see momentum return, especially around narratives like AI, restaking, and tokenized assets.”

Young, however, expects the trend toward selective strength to continue.

""Altcoins are now entering a phase where selective strength matters more than broad-based rallies,"" he said. ""The next leg would most likely depend on capital inflows extending beyond major Layer-1s into DeFi and AI-linked projects.""

Experts who previously spoke to Decrypt maintain a cautiously optimistic stance, suggesting that the macro and geopolitical outlook needs to cool before an explosive uptrend emerges.

Coinbase down, Canva down, and we've all learned that we're at gunpoint from Amazon AWS. If that goes down, we're all screwed. Lesson learned!

Meanwhile, altcoins are making a comeback and the SEI Crypto (SEI/USDT) chart is flashing early bullish signals again.

After weeks of quiet trading, the Layer-1 blockchain built for high-speed decentralized finance and Web3 apps may be coiling for its next move. Here's why SEI is making moves:

According to CoinGecko, SEI's chart is caught between pressure and potential. Resistance at $0.203-$0.204 has stalled every bounce so far, while tightening Bollinger Bands signals the calm before another move.

With RSI drifting near 45, momentum is cooling but far from dead. A push above $0.203 could spark a quick rally to $0.25–$0.28, but a slip under $0.197 could collapse the price fast.

Immediate support sits at $0.200, with significant backing at $0.197, where buyers absorbed every sell-off last week. Resistance remains firm at $0.203-$0.204, the ceiling short-term traders have repeatedly defended.

Moreover, Bollinger Bands are tightening, a classic precursor to volatility expansion, while RSI hovers around 45, signaling cooling momentum but not capitulation.

In a recent Blockcast interview at Token2049 Singapore, Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, described the city as a “vital hub” for both development and expansion across Asia.

“The density of talent in Singapore is unbelievable,” Feng said. “It's the perfect base for building across China, Korea, and the broader APAC region.”

Feng's thesis for SEI is straightforward: the core use case of blockchain is trading digital assets, and whoever solves that problem best wins. According to him, SEI's architecture borrows

	 developer network effects and Solana's hardware throughput. Guess we'll see if that's enough to grow it.

SEI's network is stretching past finance and trying to break into unproven Web3 sectors like gaming, social apps, even tokenized DNA. Additionally, the chain's pending acquisition of a 23andMe business unit would let users trade and stake their own genetic data, turning personal biology into an on-chain asset. It's a radical experiment in ownership.

“The goal is to give power back to users who generated the data,” Feng said, calling it “the next wave of real adoption.”

DeFi Llama data shows total value locked (TVL) on SEI exceeding $469 Mn, making it one of 2025's fastest-growing L1s. With a tightening Bollinger setup and institutional expansion in Asia, SEI may be positioning for an L1 rotation trade if altcoins regain momentum later this year.

Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider, has recently held talks about going public in the U.S. via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listing, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. 

The company appointed Cohen & Company Capital Markets to advise on a potential SPAC deal, one of the people said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is private. It's unclear if any talks are ongoing at present.

Blockchain.com declined to comment. Cohen & Company Capital Markets didn't respond to a request for comment by publication time.

While the valuation of a potential deal is unknown, throughout the years the firm has raised funds at different valuations due to market volatility.

In March 2021, it raised $300 million at a post-money valuation of $5.2 billion. The following year, its valuation climbed to $14 billion after another funding round. However, by November 2023, a $110 million raise valued Blockchain.com at $7 billion, according to Bloomberg.

The firm is the latest crypto company to seek a public listing amid a flurry of deals in the space. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in June, followed by CoinDesk's owner Bullish (BLSH) in August and crypto exchange Gemini (GEMI) in September. Rival exchange Kraken is also reportedly looking to list early next year.

Blockchain.com signaled progress toward a potential go-public transaction by appointing two experienced executives with strong financial and operational backgrounds, according to a report in February.

The company hired Justin Evans, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs (GS), as its new chief financial officer. It also appointed Mike Wilcox, previously CFO of Velocity Global and former Point72 portfolio manager, as its chief operating officer.

Evans said at the time that the exchange is “taking the steps necessary to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.”

Earlier this year, the company expanded its operations into several African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and South Africa.

 AI will automate most retail purchases in the future, with blockchain used to finalize payments, Shark Tank co-host and venture capitalist Kevin O'Leary says. 

AI and blockchain will spark the “next revolution in business,” according to multimillionaire Kevin O'Leary, with AI being able to autonomously make retail purchases and using blockchain to take care of payments.

In a three-minute video posted to X Saturday, the Shark Tank co-host and venture capitalist said that blockchain will support an incoming wave of AI-driven transactions, handling everything from orders at Walmart and Target to burger shops and cafes:

“So what happens there is the AI analyzes where you are, looks at the geography of what retailer [is nearby] and determines that that's the one, and then uses a blockchain to actually do a digital payment system for the tall low-fat latte,” explained O'Leary. 

“It already knows who you are. So the retailer has your name on it when you walk in,” he added.

AI is about to collide with blockchain and change everything. Imagine ordering your coffee by voice, AI finds the café, and blockchain processes your payment instantly. That's the next revolution in business. Faster, smarter, fully on-chain. The question is: who builds it… pic.twitter.com/IWyTgY2tga

However, O'Leary said he hasn't yet found a solution that can handle millions of retail transactions simultaneously at a low cost. 

He said current solutions like Ethereum can't do it because they order transactions linearly, leading to delays and expensive fees during peak traffic. 

“So we don't have the technology yet, with at least those… ones to do what I just described,” O'Leary added.

However, there are already solutions to the problem that O'Leary described, known as Directed Acyclic Graphs, which process transactions in a spider web-like structure rather than ordering them into single blocks.

Hedera and Nano are among the crypto solutions that use this architecture, though they have only captured a fraction of the user base seen on top chains like Ethereum and Solana.

O'Leary said he's looking for the first project to achieve this at scale, adding: “This is a fantastic career because the Walmarts, the Targets, the burger guys need millions of transactions a day, all independent, all going through the tolls at the same time.”

Funnily, it was just last year that O'Leary criticized people for spending $5.50 on coffees and $15 on sandwiches when they could make them at home for a fraction of the price.

Agentic AI is already assisting people with everyday tasks, from searching and ordering to reminding people of daily tasks.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Kyle Okamoto, the chief technology officer of decentralized infrastructure platform Aethir, said his wife built an agentic AI solution to remind her when to stock up on groceries.

Her agentic AI can categorize items across Target, Whole Foods and Amazon, and even tracks which products are on sale, Okamoto said. “Sometimes the kids' yogurt is going to be a dollar cheaper at Target because of a sale compared to Whole Foods. 

“She doesn't want to keep checking all these sites for the entire list, so she has the agent do it and give her price alerts.”

Now all that's needed is a blockchain solution that handles the payment side of things, according to O'Leary.

Blockchain.com, a major crypto financial services company, is exploring a SPAC deal to go public, CoinDesk reported Monday.

The firm is said to have held preliminary discussions about its US market debut through a SPAC merger; however, it is unclear whether the talks are still ongoing.

A SPAC merger would allow Blockchain.com to enter the public market without a traditional IPO process. Crypto firms are increasingly exploring public listings through alternative methods like mergers, aligning with broader industry efforts to achieve regulatory compliance and mainstream visibility.

The potential public listing would place it among a growing number of crypto firms pursuing public market debuts in 2025, including Circle, Bullish, Gemini, and Kraken.

This paper analyzes the time-varying herding behavior in the non-fungible token (NFTs) and cryptocurrency markets and investigates their interrelationship. Using the daily market data from January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2023, our study covers the period characterized by Covid and post-Covid-19 induced global financial market volatility, capturing the dynamics in the global macroeconomic system and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Based on the rolling window method, our findings show the presence of herding behavior in both markets, where herding behavior in these markets may be influenced by the major events announcements particularly those related to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Vector error correction model (VECM) indicates that the NFT market impacts the price of Ethereum, thereby influencing the broader cryptocurrency market. Such finding contributes to a deeper understanding of the market dynamics. By examining herding behavior, our findings indicate that the NFT market demonstrates relative independence from the volatile prices of the cryptocurrency market, suggesting the potential diversification benefits of incorporating NFTs for investors' portfolio construction and risk management.

Based on blockchain technology, in contrast to traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for intermediaries to address trust-related concerns (Ballis and Drakos, 2020). Similarly, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are a type of digital asset that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, such as art, music, photos, or even land (Ante, 2022b; Dowling, 2022a; Yousaf and Yarovaya, 2022a), also rely on blockchain technology and smart contracts as their digital infrastructure.

NFTs open up new possibilities for digitizing and trading unique values on the Internet. According to the report by Nonfungible (2022), NFT sales skyrocketed to $17.6 billion in 2021, marking a staggering increase of approximately 210 times compared to the $82 million recorded in 2020. The year 2022 also witnessed an increasing trend in NFT sales, reaching 23.74 billion. Moreover, the substantial increase in the number of NFT transactions, soaring from 54 million in 2022 to 90 million in 2023, provides strong evidence of growing participation in NFT trading (Moen, 2024). Data from CryptoSlam further reveals a growing interest in NFTs, as evidenced by over 800,000 unique buyers tracked for three consecutive months, starting from January 2022 (Keller, 2022). This growth underscores the increasing appeal and resilience of the NFT market within the fintech and cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The objectives of our study are twofold. First, we analyze the presence of herding behavior in the NFT market and the cryptocurrency market during periods of market volatility. Second, we investigate the relationship and cross-market herding behavior between the cryptocurrency market and the NFT market during periods of cryptocurrency herding. Both cryptocurrencies and NFTs are frequently regarded as speculative and risky assets due to their high price fluctuations and high probability of cyber threats. This phenomenon can be explained by Network Externalities and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, which illustrates how the value and adoption of NFTs are influenced by the interconnectedness of market participants and the rapid diffusion of new technologies. Coupled with inadequate, commonly accepted regulation or information (Makarov and Schoar, 2020; Corbet et al., 2019), market volatility and signals may influence investors' portfolio rebalancing decisions when allocating funds to the non-fungible token (NFT) and cryptocurrency markets, potentially resulting in herding behavior (Wilson et al., 2022). Herding behavior may be exacerbated during periods of extreme fear in a crisis when investors suppress their rational thinking and follow the market's reaction due to a lack of information or fear of loss, rather than relying upon their analysis (Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000; Christie and Huang, 1995; Galariotis et al., 2015). Thus, severe herd behavior emerges, resulting in highly volatile, explosive, or distressed markets (Bouri et al., 2019). Considering the non-fungibility feature of NFTs, which provides investors with additional value beyond price appreciation (Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000), we argue that the NFT market can exhibit greater stability during periods of market volatility, with less herding behavior compared to the cryptocurrency market. Hence, we extend previous studies by examining the herding frequency in both markets during periods of high fluctuation and frequent interest rate hikes. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between investors' herding behaviors and major event announcements during this special period.

Additionally, it is imperative to acknowledge cross-market herding behaviors in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Major NFT platforms like OpenSea and Rarible accept cryptocurrencies as a means of transaction, enabling users to exchange cryptocurrencies for NFTs (Ante, 2022b; Osivand and Abolhasani 2021). Dowling (2022a) also find that participants in the NFT market recognize a significant overlap between the two markets because they understand that accessing and using cryptocurrencies can pose challenges and that those who already possess cryptocurrencies are more likely to invest in the NFT market. The interconnectedness of these markets implies that herding behavior observed in the cryptocurrency market may spill over and influence investor behavior in the NFT market.

While some previous studies have explored the interaction of pricing efficiency between these two markets (Kong & Lin, 2021; Dowling, 2022a), limited emphasis has been placed on understanding how herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market impacts herding behavior in the NFT market. For instance, Ante (2022b) does not specifically address investor behavior in the cryptocurrency market and instead generalizes the relationship between the two markets. Investigating the effects of herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market on the NFT market is crucial, especially considering the potential for NFTs to exhibit relative resilience to shocks originating from other asset classes (Umar et al., 2022a; Umar et al., 2022b). However, it is worth noting that currently, there is a lack of studies examining the relationship between investor behavior and sales volume in the NFT market with cryptocurrency price fluctuations, particularly considering the role of cryptocurrency herding behavior in linking these two markets. Thus, our study bridges this gap by providing a deeper understanding of the cross-market herding dynamics between these two interconnected markets. We introduce the dates of herding presence in the cryptocurrency market as a dummy variable in our model to investigate the causal relationships between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets. Our study contributes to understanding whether NFTs represent an independent asset class and how they potentially contribute to the growth of cryptocurrency markets. Should NFTs display a propensity for absorbing risk and remain unaffected by the herding behaviors observed in the cryptocurrency markets, they could serve as a valuable tool for diversifying investments and spreading risk, thereby contributing to the overall stability of financial markets.

Our study encompasses the period from 2020−2023, characterized by heightened volatility in the global financial market due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This study period captures the highly dynamic global macroeconomic environment and interest rate policies that triggered investor panic and influenced investor behavior in financial markets. The period also observes significant growth in the cryptocurrency market in 2020 and the NFT market in 2021, as investors explored new investment alternatives in light of concerns about macroeconomic instability and low-interest rates. Both the cryptocurrency and NFT markets experienced significant volatility and uncertainty during the pandemic, amplifying the possibility of more pronounced herding behavior in these markets. Furthermore, in 2022, as the world transitioned into the post-pandemic era, the Federal Reserve announced a substantial increase in interest rates, marking the largest rate hike in nearly three decades (Tepper, 2023). This development adds to the interest of investigating herding behaviors in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Our paper thus provides insights into herd behavior during periods of heightened volatility, in comparison to previous studies such as Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a) and Amirat and Alwafi (2020), which examine herd behavior in relatively steady markets.

Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, we adopt a rolling window method, following the approach of Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022b), which distinguishes our study from most previous research that uses the static model of Cross-Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD). The static method is sensitive to the sample period selection and may fail to capture the system's dynamics during structural breaks (Bouri et al., 2019). In contrast, the rolling window method accounts for changes over time, making it more suitable for analyzing behaviors during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we extend the study period beyond Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022b) to include the post-pandemic phase, where we discover the presence of herding behavior. Furthermore, this study innovatively links herding behavior to the macro-environment by discussing how it responds to major event announcements, including the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate hikes.

Secondly, our study specifically considers the role of cryptocurrency herding behavior in linking the NFT and cryptocurrency markets within our model, thereby complementing the growing body of NFT literature. Notably, to our knowledge, our research is among the first to show that during the periods of market turbulence, the NFT market could potentially affect the larger cryptocurrency market by influencing the price of Ethereum. Additionally, we highlight the relative independence of the NFT market from the volatile prices of the broader cryptocurrency market. This may be attributed to investors making more rational investment decisions in the Ethereum-priced NFT market compared to the broader cryptocurrency market. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of market dynamics and thus add to the current research realm by identifying the appropriate asset class for composing portfolios to mitigate the risks of a volatile macroeconomic environment. It holds significant implications for portfolio construction and risk hedging against market events.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section two reviews the literature. Section three presents data and methodology. Section four reports the empirical results. Section five discusses the results and concludes the paper.

According to Bouri et al. (2019), Ng et al. (2022), and Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021), a relatively immature and emerging financial market such as the cryptocurrency market may exhibit significant herding behaviors due to information asymmetry and uncertainty regarding returns. Extant studies about herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market mainly revolve around static herding and time-varying herding behavior.

Past studies such as Vidal-Tomás et al. (2019), Da Gama Silva et al. (2019), and Ballis and Drakos (2020) that rely on the CSAD and cross-sectional standard deviation (CSSD) of returns models find support for the static herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market. Their findings reveal a tendency for synchronized movements among the cryptocurrencies during both markets increases and declines. It is important that the herding behavior identified in the cryptocurrency market deviates from the fundamentals that usually drive the value of these digital assets. This suggests that other non-fundamental factors or market dynamics may be at play, influencing the herding behavior observed in the cryptocurrency market.

However, certain studies do not find evidence of static herding behavior when utilizing the CSAD model. Instead, they employ the rolling window method to demonstrate significant time-varying herding behavior (Bouri et al., 2019; Amirat & Alwafi, 2020; Kurt Gümüş et al., 2019; Yousaf & Yarovaya, 2022a). Bouri et al. (2019) suggests that applying a static CSAD model may not be suitable for detecting herding behavior due to the presence of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the cryptocurrency data series. With the rolling window method, their daily prices for six major cryptocurrencies from August 2015 to December 2018 with 1242 observations show that time-varying herding behavior tends to occur during periods of increased market uncertainty. Amirat and Alwafi (2020) support the notion that static herding behavior is not evident, instead they find evidence of time-varying herding. They collect daily closing prices for the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from January 2015 to January 2019, covering a period of 1492 trading days. Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021) also find the presence of time-varying herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market. They suggest that this behavior may be associated with significant economic events at the time. Their hypothesis is substantiated by the observation in that periods of herding, identified through the rolling window method, correspond with price surges in 2017 and the official recognition of cryptocurrencies as legal tender under Japan's Payment Services Law. Following the literature, we hypothesize that:

H1: There is time-varying herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets.

Apart from Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021), various studies including Bouri et al. (2019), Amirat & Alwafi (2020), Demir et al. (2018), and Corbet et al. (2017) also highlight that, cryptocurrency market, being a component of the broader financial market, is susceptible to significant economic events such as the interest rate policies implemented by the Federal Reserve. According to these studies, significant economic policies have the potential to trigger herding behavior among investors in the cryptocurrency market. Hence, as part of our H1, we attempt to explore the time-varying herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets during periods of uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Besides policy announcements, media coverage also influences investors' behavior. This assertion aligns with the findings of Umar et al.(2021), which demonstrate the relationship between media coverage and cryptocurrency volatility using the time-varying parameter-VAR approach. Media coverage also includes key decisions by institutional investors or celebrities. For instance, Elon Musk's public support of Dogecoin on Twitter not only impacted the price of Dogecoin but also spurred investor attention and investment behavior towards other cryptocurrencies (Elsayed et al., 2024a; Elsayed et al., 2024b).

Among existing empirical studies, the investigations of pricing efficiency and spillover effects in the NFT market are considered the two most representative directions, with most studies showing evidence of NFT market inefficiency. Specifically, Dowling (2022a) suggests that the rapidly expanding NFT market is in an early stage of searching for an appropriate pricing model. He collects data on all secondary market transactions of Decentraland tokens between March 2019 and March 2021 using automatic variance ratio (AVR) tests, automatic portmanteau (AP) tests, and Domínguez and Lobato (DL) consistency tests to validate the inefficiency of pricing in the NFT market, indicating that it is an unmatured and emerging market. Kong and Lin (2021) and Kampakis (2022) concentrate on a specific project, similar to Dowling (2022a) and use a hedonic regression model with a similar observed period to examine the pricing dynamics and return-risk trade-off of the CryptoPunks project, which is one of the most valuable NFTs. These studies investigate the extraordinary returns offered by NFTs compared to traditional assets, highlighting their association with high volatility. Kong and Lin (2021) further propose that the pricing of NFTs is predominantly influenced by factors such as token scarcity and investor preferences. Additionally, Vidal-Tomás (2022) explores the metaverse segment of NFTs and investigates their short- and long-term performance from October 2017 to October 2021. The study identifies the presence of market bubbles within this segment. Similarly, Borri et al. (2022) extend their analysis to the broader NFT market and find that volatility and the NFT valuation ratio are significant predictors of NFT market returns. These studies collectively provide compelling evidence supporting the findings of Dowling (2022a) that pricing inefficiencies exist in the NFT market.

The presence of herding behavior provides an additional perspective to comprehend the inefficiency within the NFT market, contributing to its remarkable returns and market instability (Bao et al., 2022). To delve deeper into the occurrence of herding, the researchers utilize the static CSAD model, analyzing a dataset spanning from November 2017 to April 2021. Their investigation reveals that herding behavior is more widespread during the launch of submarkets. Furthermore, they argue that herding behavior exhibits a correlation with investor attention, predominantly influenced by media coverage. Jiang and Xia (2023) provide support for the view that investor attention can significantly amplify the volatility of NFTs, as demonstrated by their autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-mixed-data sampling (G-M) model. De Silva et al.(2024) employ a time-varying method using three different-length windows within the CSAD model, also suggesting that herding behavior exists in the NFT market because of media movement. However, Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022b) present contrasting findings as they collect daily data from May 16, 2020, to May 15, 2021, using the same model as Bao et al. (2022). Their study reveals no evidence of static herding behavior in the short term for the NFT market. These conflicting conclusions may be due to the shorter duration of data examined in the study conducted by Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022b) or the limitations inherent in the classical CSAD model, as noted by Bouri et al. (2019).

NFTs, because of their scarcity and value distinguish them from cryptocurrencies, are seen as an important development direction of blockchain technology, and the existence of its market herd is controversial (Chohan, 2021). There has not been as much research on the NFT market herd as there has been on the cryptocurrency market. To assess the existence of herding behavior in the NFT market, we extend the dataset beyond previous studies to address model and data constraints. Accordingly, we hypothesize that:

H2: There is time-varying herding behavior in NFT markets.

The spillover effects of NFT are one of the most significant directions of empirical research, with various studies analyzing the interactions between NFT and other major asset classes. However, the interrelationship between NFT and major cryptocurrency markets remains debatable. We further investigate its relationship with the cryptocurrency market because both markets are based on blockchain technology (Dowling, 2022b; Ante, 2022b; Umar et al., 2022a; Umar et al., 2022c; Borri et al., 2022).

Numerous studies argue that NFT is relatively independent of other cryptocurrency markets (Karim et al., 2022; Aharon & Demir, 2022; Yousaf and Yarovaya, 2022a). Dowling (2022b) conducts wavelet coherence analysis and finds a weak correlation between the NFT market and the cryptocurrency market. The study incorporates data from the NFT secondary market trades and traditional cryptocurrency market data, covering the period from March 3, 2019, to March 2021, and aims to investigate the transmission of volatility between NFT pricing and traditional cryptocurrency pricing. The findings of the study indicate that there are insignificant spillovers between these two markets. This suggests that the volatility in one market does not spill over into the other market to a significant extent during the examined period. Karim et al. (2022) employ the quantile connectedness technique and demonstrate that NFT exhibits significant disconnection from other blockchain markets, offering potential diversification benefits and bearing significant risk. Aharon and Demir (2022) find that NFT is independent of shocks from other asset classes, exhibiting weak interaction and even absorbing risk during the COVID-19 period. Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a) examine volatility transmission links between NFT and other cryptocurrencies, corroborating Dowling's (2022b) conclusion regarding the decoupling of NFT from other markets.

On the other hand, several of the studies argue that there is a correlation between the NFT market and cryptocurrency markets (Umar et al., 2022a; Kong and Lin, 2021). Ante (2022b), and Osivand and Abolhasani (2021) analyze the interactions between these two markets, extracting the volume of all NFTs transactions and the number of wallets participating in the NFT market from January 2018 to April 2021, and demonstrate that the cryptocurrency market influences the growth and development of the NFT market. Kong and Lin (2021) provide support for the correlation between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets. They propose that during periods characterized by a surge in demand for alternative investments and the pursuit of higher returns in a low-interest rate environment, NFT prices experience significant increases due to investors' aesthetic preferences. Umar et al. (2022a) also support the view that global investments were transferred to the cryptocurrency market from other markets, causing spillover effects between markets, using the TVP-VAR connectedness approach. Additionally, Elsayed et al. (2024b) suggest that other cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum) are influenced by price fluctuations in non-traditional crypto assets, especially when the market size of these assets increases. This impact is particularly significant due to the speculative nature of NFTs, which are often characterized by high market volatility. However, they partially consider the spillover effects between markets but do not fully account for other factors influencing herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market, such as macroeconomic trends.

Ante (2022a) shows that sales and wallets in the NFT market are related to the pricing of Bitcoin and ETH through the vector error correction model. According to Wang et al. (2023), the trading volume of CryptoPunk in the short time before investors buy CryptoPunk has a negative relationship with the return of NFT, suggesting that investors interested in NFT should avoid joining the market when the market trading volume is at a high level. It indicates that NFT unique buyers are correlated with market volume. Furthermore, Ante (2022b), and Osivand and Abolhasani (2021) explore the interaction of NFT projects and adopt three variables: the number of transactions, trading volume, and the number of wallets. Their results show that there is a short-term causal relationship between NFT sub-markets. Umar et al.(2022a) also indicate that there are spillover effects among NFT segments by employing the TVP-VAR connectedness approach. Moreover, Apostu et al. (2022) adopt the NFT price as well as the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum and obtain the same conclusion as Ante (2022a).

Umar et al. (2022b) present separate findings based on different time intervals, revealing distinct relationships between NFT and other assets in various circumstances. They observe that NFT exhibits relative independence from other assets, but the linkages between NFT and other assets strengthen during periods of market volatility. The study divides the period from June 26, 2017, to October 29, 2021, into three subintervals and utilizes data from Bloomberg terminals, including NFT, Bitcoin price, MSCI World Equity Index, FTSE World Government Bond Index, gold, and crude oil, for empirical analysis. Employing the square wavelet coherence technique, the authors investigate the multiscale dependence of NFT on major asset classes, highlighting the increased coherence between NFT and other assets during the pandemic. Based on the previous literature, we hypothesize that:

H3: There is a relationship between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets.

Our dataset comprises 1,216 daily observations, spanning from January 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2023. It includes several variables such as the daily number of unique buyers and unique sellers in the NFT market, as well as the closing prices of two categories of cryptocurrencies: NFT and traditional cryptocurrencies. To expand upon the dataset used by previous studies and for the purpose of examining time varying herding, we collect data for the top 10 cryptocurrencies in each category based on market capitalization. The selected cryptocurrencies must have at least one year of available data. For NFT market data, we obtain information from Cryptoslam Corporation (https://www.cryptoslam.io). This dataset specifically covers NFT transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which represents the majority of the NFT market. As for traditional cryptocurrencies, we collect daily closing prices from the cryptocurrency exchange platform (https://coinmarketcap.com).

Following the methodology employed by Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a), we conduct an analysis of time-varying herding behavior in both the cryptocurrency market and NFT market. We calculate the Cross-Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD) value for each market and then utilize R to identify the specific dates on which herding behavior is observed. Subsequently, with the data on NFT market sales and the number of unique buyers and sellers, we proceed to investigate the presence of a Granger-causal relationship between the cryptocurrency market and the NFT market. Shih et al. (2012) and Ferreruela et al. (2022) also support the notion of cross-market herding behavior through Granger causality tests. According to Christie and Huang (1995), herding behavior in financial markets refers to investors' tendency to buy or sell an asset based on the perceived opinions or actions of others. Therefore, we include the number of unique sellers and unique buyers as variables to measure changes in the NFT market.

Our study opts to use the VECM model because it has the advantage of handling non-stationary time series with cointegration relationships, providing estimates of long-term equilibrium relationships, while connectivity methods focus primarily on detecting causal relationships between variables as applied by Elsayed et al.(2024a) and Umar et al. (2022a). Therefore, our study builds upon the work of Ante (2022b) and Osivand and Abolhasani (2021), aiming to enhance the understanding of the relationship between the cryptocurrency market and the smaller NFT market. Unlike Ante's (2022b) study, which does not distinguish between herding and stabilization scenarios in the cryptocurrency market, our research incorporates herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market as an exogenous dummy variable to account for the impact of herding. Various past studies also include exogenous dummy variables in their vector autoregressive models to account for various impacts such as financial crises (Jiang and Liu, 2011), airlines strike and war (Bonham et al., 2009), and Olympic Games (Yap and Allen, 2011) which enhance their analyses. Additionally, we differentiate between unique buyers and unique sellers by dividing the variable ""wallets"" in Osivand and Abolhasani (2021) and Ante's (2022b) studies into these two categories. Similarly, we utilize the variables NFT sales, bitcoin prices, and Ethereum prices, as employed in Ante's study, to investigate the impact of cryptocurrency market herding on the NFT market. By considering these factors, we aim to examine whether the herding behavior of the cryptocurrency market can affect the NFT market across markets.

A preliminary test is conducted to ensure the variables are suitable for our model. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test results allow us to assess whether multicollinearity exists among the model variables. Generally, the VIF criteria are as follows: VIF < 10: No significant impact on the model, though some degree of multicollinearity may exist(O'brien, 2007). The VIF results as shown in Table 1 for all variables in the current model fall within an acceptable range, indicating that the model is suitable for use.

To conduct the Granger causality test, we adopt the methodology employed by Apostu et al. (2022) and Ante (2022b). In line with Dowling's approach, we consider ETH (Ethereum) as the primary currency for issuing and trading NFTs, given its prominence and relevance in the NFT market. Additionally, BTC (Bitcoin) is selected as the largest and most significant cryptocurrency, serving as a reference market for our analysis. By incorporating these specific currencies and following Dowling's methodology, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics and interactions between NFTs and cryptocurrencies within the context of our analysis.

We first employ Chang's et al. (2000) model as the measure of dispersion to investigate herding behavior in the rolling window method. To quantify this, we utilize the cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD), which is defined by Eq. 1:

where N = the number of cryptocurrencies (NFTs). \({R}_{{mt}}\) = the daily returns of the market at time t \({R}_{{it}}\) = the daily returns of cryptocurrencies (NFTs) i at time t.

Chang et al. (2000) provide the following Eq. 2 for estimating market herding:

If the coefficient of \({({R}_{{mt}})}^{2}\) is negative and statistically significant, it implies that the connection between the distribution of individual cryptocurrencies (NFTs) returns and cryptocurrencies (NFTs) market returns is non-linear, indicating the presence of market herding.

As previously stated, the static model is sensitive to the chosen sample period, and it may not be suitable when there is a structural break in the data. Forecasting each series separately without considering the broken structure of the data often leads to undesirable outcomes (Zhang et al., 2017). Given that our selected sample period includes the Covid-19 crisis, which deviates from the conditions assumed by the static model, we have opted not to use it for examining herding behavior.

We employ a more robust rolling window approach to assess the stability of model parameters and detect potential time-varying parameters. In this analysis, we select a window length of 14 days to assess the stability of the (Rmt)2 coefficients in the CSAD model, as mentioned in Eq. 2. It is important to note that there is no definitive guideline for determining the optimal window length. However, in our case, we choose a relatively short window length to ensure an adequate number of windows, enabling us to detect trends and capture any potential instability in the parameters (Stavroyiannis & Babalos, 2017). Therefore, in our case, we choose a relatively short window based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), traditionally using a 14 day period, which is a widely recognized technical indicator for evaluating overbought and oversold conditions. This period helps ensure an adequate number of windows, allowing us to detect trends and capture any potential instability in the parameters (Stavroyiannis and Babalos, 2017). It is considered optimal for capturing market dynamics without excessive noise or lag.

The Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model helps to elucidate the complex interactions and relationships within the system by capturing the interdependencies and feedback mechanisms among variables. VAR model (Eq. 3) could be displayed as follows:

\({\alpha }_{0}\) is a vector of intercept terms, \({{\rm{Y}}}_{t}\) represents a matrix composed of endogenous variables, and A1 to \({A}_{p}\) are coefficients of a matrix.\({D}_{t}\) is an exogenous variable matrix consisting of dummy variables. ε represents the random disturbance term, which captures unmodeled factors. The parameter p denotes the lag order.

In this study, we consider the day of cryptocurrency market herding behavior as exogenous variables to account for their impact on the NFT sales, the number of unique buyers in the NFT market as well as the price of bitcoin and Ethereum. Hence, \({{\rm{Y}}}_{t}\) = (volume, unique buyer, bitcoin prices, Ethereum prices), and to incorporate cryptocurrency herding as an exogenous variable, we assign a value of 1 to \({D}_{t}\) to represent the day of herding and 0 otherwise. Our model's optimal lag length is determined based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Fransiska et al., 2018; Scott Hacker and Hatemi-J, 2008; Hatemi-J 2004; Hamilton, 1994). To mitigate the volatility of the data and address the presence of heteroscedasticity in the time series, a natural logarithm transformation is applied to the variables while preserving their relationships. The transformed variables are denoted as \(\mathrm{ln}{\_btc}\) \(\mathrm{ln}{\_eth}\), \(\mathrm{ln}{\_sales}\), \(\mathrm{ln}{\_buyer}\). Our VAR model (Eq. 4) is displayed as follows:

We then apply the Johansen test to check for any cointegration among the series. Such long-run connections make the VECM a suitable model to study any short-run deviations from the equilibrium relationship (Engle and Granger, 1987). Based on the Johansen cointegration test result (reported in section 4), we employ the vector error correction model (VECM) in our analysis. VECM is a combination of the vector autoregressive model and cointegration restrictions. Variables cointegrated to the order of one, I(1), indicates that they will tend to revert to the trend in the long run, even though they may deviate from each other in the short run. The general VECM can be represented by Eq. 5:

where \({Y}_{t}\) represents the independent I(1) variables being integrated to form an I(0) vector, C is the intercept, \(\delta\) is the matrix that reflects the short-run dynamic relationship between the elements of \({Y}_{t}\), and \({\in }_{t}\) is the residual. ∆ = (I–L), where L is the lag operator, k is the number of lags, and \(\beta\) is the matrix containing long-run equilibrium information. If the elements of \({Y}_{t}\) are I(1) variables and are cointegrated, then the rank of \(\beta\) can be rewritten as \(\delta\) = \(\alpha {{ect}}_{t-1}\); \({{ect}}_{t-1}\) is the error correction term, and \(\alpha\) is a loading matrix that defines the adjustment speed of the variables in \({Y}_{t}\) to the long-run equilibrium defined by the cointegrating relationships

The use of VAR or VECM models to study herding behavior is supported by information cascade theory. This theory explains how investors, in the face of uncertainty, are inclined to replicate the trades they observe, leading to herding behavior (Avery & Zemsky, 1998; Cipriani & Guarino, 2014). VAR models can capture the short-term dynamics of these cascades, while VECM model is suitable when long-run equilibrium relationships are expected, as often seen in interconnected markets (Park & Sabourian, 2011). These models allow us to study the observed trading actions on market behavior, particularly in highly fluctuating markets like cryptocurrency and NFT markets (Hirshleifer & Teoh, 2003). By modeling the dynamic interactions between observed actions and market outcomes, these models can shed light on how information cascades propagate herding behavior (Anderson & Holt, 1997).

Figure 1a and Fig. 1b depict the historical prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. Based on the figures, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum underwent a rapid surge starting in 2020 and continuing until early 2021. To be more specific, Bitcoin reached its relatively high price levels earlier and sustained them for a longer period, fluctuating within the upper price range during the first quarter of 2021, whereas Ethereum's price only reached a relatively high level during the first month of the second quarter, and its duration was very short. Subsequently, the prices dropped substantially until July, marking a nearly 50% decrease from their peak levels. The prices then rebounded in the following two months, reaching a second peak in September 2021. However, from that point onwards, the prices experienced a steep decline, ultimately plummeting by a staggering 77% by 2023.

Figure 1c presents the historical sales volume of the NFT market. Based on the figure, the sales volume remained relatively low in 2020, gradually increased in early 2021, and experienced a significant surge in May. Throughout 2021, NFT sales volume exhibited rapid growth and substantial fluctuations, with sales increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2020. Notably, August 2021 witnessed an incredible surge in NFT sales volume, while the remaining months of 2021 experienced a decline. However, as we may note from Fig. 1c, starting from the first quarter of 2022, the sales volume increased and fluctuated. In April 2022, the sales volume reached its peak. Conversely, after May 2022, the sales volume experienced a significant decline, reaching a lower level, although it remained higher than the sales record in 2020.

Figure 2a, b present the time-varying herding behavior observed in the cryptocurrency market and the NFT market, respectively. The analysis utilizes a rolling window method with a length of 14 days, selected to effectively capture the underlying trends. In these figures, if the t-statistics fall below the negative 10% critical value line (indicating that negative γ2 becomes statistically significant), it indicates the presence of herding behavior.

In these figures, if the t-statistics fall below the negative 10% critical value line (indicating that negative \(\gamma 2\) becomes statistically significant), it indicates the presence of herding behavior.

From May 2020 to the beginning of 2021, the cryptocurrency market experienced multiple herding periods, as shown in Fig. 2(a). These periods could be attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty and the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market. According to Sharma (2021), uncontrolled economic stimulus measures implemented during the economic slowdown, such as extensive money printing coupled with macroeconomic instability resulting from low-interest rates, led to the depreciation of the dollar, increased inflation rates, and raised investor concerns. However, the halving of Bitcoin in May 2020, which reduces the rate of Bitcoin inflation and emphasizes its scarcity, encouraged investors to shift their funds from dollars to cryptocurrencies (Copeland, 2020). In late 2020, the announcement of investments in cryptocurrencies and their trading ecosystems by institutional investors and banks had a significant impact, particularly benefiting Bitcoin and fueling investor frenzy (Sharma, 2021). These factors contributed to the herding behavior observed during this period in the cryptocurrency market as depicted in Fig. 2(a).

In 2021, the herding behavior observed in the cryptocurrency market aligns with a period characterized by cryptocurrency price volatility, often referred to as a bubble period. During this period, significant price fluctuations were witnessed in Bitcoin. For instance, from February to March, the price of Bitcoin surged to new highs before experiencing a minor decline. Subsequently, following a bottoming out in July, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies embarked on a solid recovery, partially driven by Elon Musk's engagement with leading Bitcoin mining companies to develop more sustainable and efficient mining practices (Ante, 2023). These specific timeframes in 2021 coincide with the bubble period, providing evidence of time-varying herding behavior in traditional cryptocurrencies. The herding behavior observed during this period reflects market participants' responses to the price volatility and rapid changes in the cryptocurrency market.

It is interesting to note that in 2022, the herding behaviors observed in the cryptocurrency market, as shown in Fig. 2a, coincided with the Federal Reserve's announcements of interest rate increases. This suggests that investor herding behavior is influenced by economic policy, which aligns with the conclusions drawn by Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021). Bitcoin, as the most prominent cryptocurrency, is often perceived as a hedge against risks associated with traditional currencies, such as the dollar. This perception is evident from the investor herding behavior observed in both 2020 and 2022. According to Corbet et al. (2019), monetary policy decisions made by the FOMC, particularly those concerning interest rates, exert a significant impact on Bitcoin prices. The herding behavior observed in 2020 can be attributed to low-interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty, leading to a surge in cryptocurrency prices, as depicted in Fig. 1a, b. Conversely, as investors perceive the dollar as a stable currency with minimal risk of rapid depreciation, the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in March, followed by an additional 50 basis points in May, culminating in a 75-basis point increase in June 2022, becomes even more appealing (see Table 2, Panel B). This prompts investors to shift their funds from risky cryptocurrency investments to dollar-denominated financial markets, resulting in a significant decline in cryptocurrency prices.

These findings consequently imply the potential utility of Bitcoin as a risk management tool, particularly in the face of unpredictable interest-rate risk shocks. They suggest that investors may consider incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios as part of their risk analysis and management strategies.

To further analyze the linkage between events and herding behaviors, Table 2 shows the major event announcements related to the dates when herding behavior is observed. According to Table 2, Panel A, herding behavior occurs from 3 days before to 10 days after the announcement, except for the event on July 21, 2021. The herding behavior related to ""The B Word"" conference begins 10 days prior to the event, as the press had forecasted and informed the public in advance. Moreover, herding behavior is not persistent over time but it occurs periodically. Specifically, herding behaviors are observed prior to the announcement date; however, the public tends to appear calm as the actual event date approaches, including on the announcement date itself. After the announcement, the public's response can be either immediate or delayed, depending on whether the announcement meets their expectations. This is in line with the observation by Qiang (2023).

Table 2b presents the relationship between the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting dates and the herding dates during 2022 and 2023. Investors tend to respond to the announcement more quickly than they do to a 50 bp hike, while no herding behavior is observed in response to a 25 bp hike except on March 22, 2023. The main reason for the herding behavior observed is attributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) (Jin and Tian, 2024). Moreover, investors postponed their reaction during the herding period on October 12th, primarily because Bitcoin's value increased further as global markets improved, and traders were awaiting the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data while also monitoring a significant upgrade to the Ether blockchain (Bloomberg, 2022; Qiang, 2023). The herding behavior predominantly occurred prior to the announcement, driven by investors' expectations.

Figure 2(b) specifically illustrates the presence of herding behavior in the NFT market, as evidenced by the consistently falling time-varying t-statistics below the critical value line. From February to August 2020, the presence of herding behavior in the NFT market can be attributed to market inefficiencies, aligning with the findings of Bao et al. (2022) and Dowling (2022a). The year 2021 witnessed the rise of NFTs, marked by a significant surge in NFT sales volumes occurring in May 2021, as depicted in Fig. 1(c). This surge in activity explains the occurrence of herding behavior during that period as depicted in Fig. 2(b). Furthermore, herding behavior can be observed in the NFT market from May to September 2022 and April 2023. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency market also exhibits herding behavior (see both Figs. 2a, b). Thus, our hypotheses H1 and H2 are both supported. Consequently, it is reasonable to speculate that there may be a causal relationship between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets.

Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables under study. It is observed that all variables have mean values greater than their corresponding standard deviations, indicating an under-dispersed distribution. Additionally, the Jarque and Bera (1987) test results indicate that none of the variables follow a normal distribution. This suggests that Bitcoin prices, Ethereum prices, sales volume, and the number of unique buyers in the NFT market exhibit volatility and instability throughout the selected period.

Unit root test results (Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)) are shown in Table 4, indicating that all the variables are stationary at their first difference level, which means that they are in the same order of integration, making VAR a suitable method. Yet, as shown in Table 5, on the basis of eigenvalues, Trace test and Maximum Eigenvalue test, our Johansen test of cointegration indicates one cointegration relationship, thus making the VECM as our model. Based on the AIC, we adopt the model with lag seven, following the approach of Ante (2022a) and Apostu et al (2022), to examine the linkage between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets.

After confirming the presence of a long-run association between our variables, we examine the long-run dynamics among these variables. Before establishing the VECM, we check for the presence of serial correlation in our model with the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test. The results show that all the p-values (in Table 6) are greater than 5%, suggesting that there is no evidence of serial correlation in our model.

The results of our VECM indicate a negative and significant sign of the error correction term, which implies the existence of a long-run relationship among the proposed variables. The long-run relationship among the proposed variables for one cointegrating vector is displayed below (standard errors are displayed in parenthesis).

In the following analysis, we present the Granger Causality Test results to interpret the VECM findings. Table 7 displays the short-run Granger causality test results, which assess whether a change in one variable precedes a change in other variables. These statistics are computed for each combination of our dependent and independent variables.

To illustrate, the first row of results shows whether all independent variables (ETH price, the number of unique buyers and Bitcoin price) significantly impact NFT sales. Since the estimates of these independent variables exceed the significance threshold of 10%, we cannot conclude that ETH price, Bitcoin price, and the number of unique buyers Granger-cause NFT sales. The third row shows the relationship between the number of unique buyers and the other variables. It demonstrates similar results, indicating that neither Bitcoin price, Ethereum price, nor NFT sales Granger cause the number of unique buyers. However, the second and fourth rows of results reveal that, there is a Granger-causal relationship between the price of Bitcoin and the price of Ethereum. Additionally, the number of unique buyers Granger causes the prices of both cryptocurrencies. The causality results remain unaltered with the herding dummy incorporated into the model.

Based on the Granger Causality Test results, we conclude that the prices of cryptocurrencies have a mutual influence on each other including during the period of cryptocurrency market herding, but the herding effect does not spill over into the NFT market. However, the number of investors participating in the NFT market can have an impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies, namely the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

We conduct a further test by substituting variables. Specifically, we replace the number of unique buyers in the NFT market with the number of unique sellers. It is important to note that variables in the further test are stationary at I(1), and again the Johansen cointegration test confirms the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between them.

Table 8 presents the results of our robustness test, which reveal important insights. The number of unique sellers exhibits a Granger-causal relationship with NFT sales volume at the 1% significance level (see first row of Table 8). Conversely, NFT sales volume Granger-causes the number of unique sellers at the 10% significance level, as indicated in the third row. However, the null hypothesis that the prices of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) do not Granger-cause NFT market-related variables is accepted (see first and third rows of Table 8). Moreover, the price of Ethereum is influenced by both the number of unique sellers in the NFT market and the price of Bitcoin (see second row of Table 8). Combined with the result mentioned above, where the number of unique buyers Granger-causes Ethereum's price, this enhances our findings that investors in the NFT market have a significant impact on Ethereum's price. On the other hand, Bitcoin's price is influenced by Ethereum's price at the 5% significance level, indicating a Granger-causal relationship between these two cryptocurrencies during periods of market herding. However, NFT market-related variables do not significantly affect Bitcoin's price (see forth row of Table 8). Based on these results, we can infer that the NFT market may impact the cryptocurrency market by influencing the price of Ethereum. This suggests that changes and activities in the NFT market can potentially influence the dynamics of the broader cryptocurrency market. Thus, hypothesis H3 is supported.

Our Granger causality results suggest that, the number of investors in the NFT market have cross-market influence in cryptocurrencies' prices. To further analyze the dynamic mutual effects of cryptocurrency prices and the number of investors in the NFT market in the short run, impulse response functions are employed. Figure 3 shows the relevant impulse response function results. Specifically, it illustrates the response of cryptocurrency prices to a unit shock in the number of investors, including both unique sellers and buyers, and also shows the response of investors to a unit shock in cryptocurrencies prices.

Impulse response functions. Impulse response functions based on the VECM are shown for a time horizon of ten days.

Unlike VAR, impulse response functions of a VECM need not return to their mean value, as series are cointegrated in the long-run (Mills, 1998, Ante, 2022b). During the initial two periods, the response of cryptocurrency prices (as shown by the four diagrams in the left column of Fig. 3) to a unit shock in the number of investors (both unique buyers and unique sellers) in the NFT market is negative and exhibits a decreasing trend. Following slight fluctuations in the 3rd and 4th periods, there is a sharp increase in the response of cryptocurrency prices from the 5th period onwards that can be considered significant. However, as shown by the four diagrams in the right column of Fig. 3, the number of investors shows slight changes in response to the shock of cryptocurrencies and converges to zero as the effects of the shock die out. Comparing the left and right columns of Fig. 3, we observe that the shock from the number of investors lasts longer on cryptocurrency prices as expected. This indicates that the number of investors Granger-causes the prices of cryptocurrencies in the long run. In addition, long-term herding effects captured by the VECM model reflect more stable, equilibrium-driven behaviors that emerge over extended periods. The unique buyer would cause the increasing price of cryptocurrencies for both Bitcoin and Ethereum; however, the increasing price of cryptocurrencies would not cause an increase in the number of unique active wallets (both sellers and buyers) in NFT markets.

Overall, impulse response functions are helpful in mapping the short-run effects and thus complementing the results of the Granger causality tests. Specifically, the results show that the shock from the number of NFT investors (both buyers and sellers) on cryptocurrency prices lasts longer as expected, while the response of the number of investors in the short-run equilibrium adjustment process is rather fast.

Using the rolling window method to investigate the presence of time-varying herding behavior in both the cryptocurrency and NFT markets from January 2020 to April 2023, our findings indicate the existence of herding behavior in both markets. These findings align with previous studies such as Bao et al. (2022) and Jiang and Xia (2023). We argue that the herding behavior in these markets is influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, corroborate with Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021) and Amirat and Alwafi's (2020) view. Furthermore, we observed that the herding behaviors in our study are not persistent over time but happened periodically as they are related to the major event announcements, not only to the FOMC meeting announcements but also the influencers and institutional investors' decisions. Our analysis also reveals more instances of herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market compared to the NFT market, implying that NFTs possess more characteristics of an asset than a liquid currency because the NFT market does not react quickly to changes in other markets. While herding behavior is present in the NFT market, it can be attributed to the market's initial inefficiency during its early development and the subsequent rapid growth in 2021. These findings are consistent with the explanations provided by Bao et al. (2022) and Dowling (2022a, 2022b).

Regarding the relationship between the cryptocurrency market and the NFT market, our findings indicate that the NFT market demonstrates relative independence from the volatile prices of the cryptocurrency market, aligning with the findings of Karim et al. (2022), Aharon and Demir (2022) and Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a). However, the number of investors in the NFT market influences the price of Ethereum. These findings suggest a relationship between the two markets, where developments and activities in the smaller NFT market can potentially shape the dynamics of the larger cryptocurrency market, primarily through their effects on Ethereum's price. This emphasizes the potential diversification benefits of incorporating NFTs into investment portfolios (Xia et al., 2022; Ko et al., 2022). Therefore, our finding supports the conclusions of Zhang et al. (2022) and Umar et al. (2022c), suggesting that NFTs can be considered relatively independent assets for portfolio construction and risk hedging purposes, as argued by Kong and Lin (2021). It should be noted that in portfolio construction, it is the overall value of the entire NFT projects that is being considered, in which the NFT projects may consist of multiple unique NFTs. Finally, we identify a mutual Granger-causal relationship among cryptocurrencies. Notably, the number of investors in the NFT market influences the price of Ethereum. This finding indicates a relationship between the two markets, where developments and activities in the NFT market can potentially shape the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, primarily through their effects on Ethereum's price.

Our study highlights the presence of herding behavior in both the cryptocurrency and NFT markets, suggesting important strategies for investors and policy implications. For investors, the findings suggest that investors need to be sensitive and cautious especially during major market events such as FOMC meetings and key decisions by institutional investors. Investors should diversify their portfolios to reduce the risks of these periodic herding behaviors, especially in the more volatile cryptocurrency market. As NFTs show relative independence from cryptocurrency market fluctuations, they offer an opportunity for risk hedging and diversification, which could help stabilize portfolios.

From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that regulators should focus on mitigating the effects of herding behavior, particularly in the cryptocurrency market, where it is more prevalent. This could include implementing measures to monitor cryptocurrency exchanges and the substantial electricity fees associated with cryptocurrency mining to increase market transparency. Additionally, introducing policies to reduce the influence of speculative behaviors, such as increasing the value of collateral for NFT transactions to decrease the possibility of flash loans, could be beneficial. Policymakers should also monitor the NFT market's rapid growth and inefficiencies, ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect investors.

Limitations in our study should be acknowledged. First, the data used in our model are only relevant to the early stages of the rapid development of the cryptocurrency market and the NFT market. As the markets continue to mature and gain prominence, the relationship between them may evolve, and the efficiency of market pricing may improve. Moreover, due to the accessibility of off-chain NFT transactions, our study primarily relies on on-chain data, excluding a portion of the market conducted through private sales or via third-party platforms. These off-chain transactions can be significant and may influence overall market dynamics, particularly when capturing the full extent of herding behavior in the NFT market. Another limitation is the variation in NFT transactions across different blockchain platforms. Our study does not differentiate between NFTs built on various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana). Given that the majority of NFTs are built on Ethereum, we focused solely on data from this blockchain, which could potentially introduce biases in analyzing NFT market behavior. Second, we recognize that certain characteristics of NFTs as a unique asset are not fully explored in our research. For instance, the unique nature of NFTs may make them symbolic of social status, as observed when celebrities endorse and promote them on social media, leading to a surge in sales volume driven by influential individual purchasers rather than market dynamics. This characteristic of NFTs is not explicitly considered in our study. Finally, with regards to the issue of wash trading via flash loans, our study does not specifically control for such manipulative practices. Flash loans are used to artificially inflate trading volumes, which can distort market activity and affect price discovery in the NFT market. While our approach focuses on the broader relationship between NFTs and cryptocurrencies, it does not address these market distortions. This limitation presents an avenue for future research. For instance, future research could explore the application of machine learning techniques to identify and filter out wash trading activities.

Moreover, while our study relies on traditional econometric models, incorporating machine learning techniques in future studies could offer additional insights into the complexities of NFT and cryptocurrency markets. Methods like random forest, XGBoost, or neural networks could help in modeling nonlinear relationships, identifying patterns in large datasets, and improving prediction accuracy. This could also allow for real-time monitoring of market trends and herding behavior.

            By Erik Gibbs
            - 20 Oct, 2025          


The complaint, filed with Swiss prosecutors, follows an investigation into FIFA's digital collectibles platform at collect.fifa.com.

Gespa explained that it had determined that certain activities on the site, such as “drops” and “challenges,” constitute forms of gambling under Swiss law, as participation requires some form of monetary payment and outcomes are determined by chance.

The authority noted that these offerings fall under definitions of lotteries and sports betting, yet the platform operates without a Swiss gambling licence.

Gespa said it became aware of the FIFA Collect platform in early October 2025 and concluded that it presents monetary rewards determined by random mechanisms or similar chance-based systems.

As a result, the regulator invoked its legal obligation under the Federal Act on Gambling to refer potential violations to criminal authorities.

The supervisory body emphasised that the final legal assessment of the case will rest with Swiss prosecutors, who may seek Gespa's assistance in further investigations.

The regulator declined to release more details, citing respect for the ongoing legal process.

FIFA Collect was introduced as part of FIFA's broader effort to merge blockchain technology with fan engagement.

The platform allows users to purchase, trade, and participate in digital collectibles associated with global football events.

However, its introduction of competition-style offerings, where users can pay to enter challenges and potentially win exclusive rewards, has raised concerns among regulators about its compliance with gambling regulations.

The model relies heavily on chance to allocate prizes, a key criterion under Swiss law that defines a gambling operation.

The controversy around FIFA Collect comes amid FIFA's broader shift toward blockchain-based fan experiences, particularly through its “Right to Buy” token initiative launched last year.

These tokens were marketed as a revolutionary new method for fans to gain early access to tickets for the 2026 World Cup.

By purchasing the tokens, fans were guaranteed the right to buy tickets for specific matches once sales opened, bypassing FIFA's traditional system of lotteries and staggered releases.

This approach sought to alleviate the frustration of FIFA's notoriously competitive ticketing process, where millions of fans compete for limited seats that often increase in price as availability dwindles.

Each Right to Buy token grants its holder a guaranteed purchasing opportunity, even though the specific seat and teams may not be known at the time of purchase.

Token owners can also trade or sell their digital assets on secondary markets, where values have ranged from hundreds to several thousand dollars.

The speculative nature of these trades, combined with their dependence on future match allocations, has led some experts to compare the token model with gambling behaviour since the outcomes and resale values hinge on unpredictable tournament progress.

FIFA, anticipating over 5 million attendees for next summer's World Cup, outlined its multi-phase ticketing plan earlier this year.

The first sales window, the Visa Presale Draw, began on 10 September and was limited to Visa cardholders.

Eligible participants who created a FIFA ID and registered their card details were entered into a randomised draw for a chance to secure a purchase slot.

While this offered a structured pathway to access, winning a time slot did not guarantee that tickets would still be available for purchase once the session opened.

This new ticketing framework represents FIFA's attempt to modernise and digitise the fan experience using blockchain and tokenisation technologies.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) has imposed a £14 million fine on Capita for a data breach it suffered in March 2023. The breach was suffered after an unknown threat actor gained access to Capita's systems following the inadvertent download of a malicious file onto an employee device, which led ultimately to the theft of the personal data of 6.6 million individuals, including highly sensitive data, such as financial information, criminal record data, data relating to children, and other ‘special category' data.

Even as Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to as low as $104,000 on Friday, the same can't be said for its fastest Layer-2 project, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), which raised another $300,000 over the weekend to bring its total presale funding to $24.3 million.

On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve is set to hold discussions on “payment systems”, a topic that includes cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Many in the market view it as a potential bullish spark that could help lift BTC from its current $111,000 range and perhaps push it toward a new all-time high.





Yet, no development may prove more transformative for Bitcoin's long-term demand than one that extends its store-of-value appeal into utility – the exact goal of Bitcoin Hyper's existence.

The project introduces Bitcoin's first high-performance Layer-2 network built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling BTC to power thousands of on-chain transactions per second across DeFi, gaming, real-world applications and more.

When it goes live, BTC won't just store value but will move with it, gaining a new role across dApps that operate at Solana-level speed.

The current presale round is closing fast, with just 26 hours left to secure HYPER at $0.013145 per token before prices rise in the next phase.

The Fed's Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, streamed live on the Fed's official YouTube channel, is drawing attention as one of the first central bank events to openly feature cryptocurrency discussions.

The agenda includes a session titled “Creating a Bridge Between Traditional Finance and the Digital Asset Ecosystem”, joined by Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov, Fireblocks' Michael Shaulov, and Jackie Reses of Lead Bank. Other panels will explore stablecoins, AI in payments, and tokenized products, featuring executives from Circle, Coinbase, BlackRock, and Ark Invest.

For many observers, the U.S. central bank's direct engagement with crypto leaders marks a turning point and could help reignite Bitcoin's price, which has remained subdued since the October 10 flash crash.

Historically, October has been one of Bitcoin's strongest months, and traders are watching closely for signs of recovery. Polymarket bettors see limited downside, with most expecting BTC to hold above $102,000, and some betting it could close above $110,000 by Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Fundstrat's Tom Lee and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes maintain that $250,000 remains achievable within the next two months – as both believe that the right catalysts are already in place. But none could be bigger than what Bitcoin Hyper brings in new demand and utility to the world's top crypto.

Bitcoin Hyper is building a system that makes BTC usable across DeFi, gaming, meme coins, real-world assets (RWAs), and beyond.

The project's goal is to enable Bitcoin to function as a transactable asset across applications, rather than remain limited to a store-of-value role. To achieve that, Bitcoin Hyper is creating a developer ecosystem compatible with Solana's existing toolkit, meaning developers can use familiar Rust-based SDKs, Anchor framework, and Solana APIs to build high-speed applications that inherit Solana's efficiency while tapping into Bitcoin's liquidity.



In practice, Bitcoin can now move seamlessly across these applications at Solana-level speed and at a fraction of traditional transaction costs. But while it gains speed, it doesn't lose security as every moving BTC is backed by real Bitcoin locked within Bitcoin Hyper's canonical bridge. The transferable asset within the ecosystem is a wrapped version of BTC, which can be burned at any time to release the original BTC back to the base chain.

In doing so, Bitcoin Hyper establishes a Layer-2 framework that combines Solana-level transaction speed with Bitcoin's base-layer security, potentially redefining how BTC operates within the digital economy.

While BTC serves as the medium of exchange within the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, HYPER is the asset investors have been accumulating in over $300,000 worth of purchases in the past two days.

HYPER complements BTC by powering the network. It covers gas fees, functions as the staking and governance token, and anchors user participation across the ecosystem.

Beyond its utility, many investors see HYPER as a form of indirect exposure to Bitcoin. At its early-stage valuation and low token price, it offers a way to participate in the infrastructure that could drive new demand for BTC itself – much like early Bitcoin exposure once offered asymmetric upside.

HYPER also reflects the hybrid architecture of the network it powers. Operating within the SVM while remaining anchored to BTC through the canonical bridge, it combines high-speed functionality with Bitcoin-grade security.

As adoption grows and Bitcoin Hyper lists on exchanges, investors anticipate increasing visibility and demand, not only for BTC within the ecosystem but for HYPER, the fuel that keeps it running.

With $HYPER theres only ONE way to go. 😉

The opportunity to secure HYPER at $0.013145 is closing in 26 hours.

To take advantage of the current round while the price remains lower, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and purchase HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or a credit card.

Remember, HYPER functions as the staking currency, with even newly purchased tokens eligible for staking at a 49% dynamic APY.

Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet, one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets on the market. HYPER is already listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

Diacente Group, a prominent Ugandan developer specializing in green industrial zones, has announced a strategic partnership with the US-based Global Settlement Network (GSN) to launch an ambitious $5.5 billion project aimed at building national digital infrastructure across Uganda. This landmark initiative will connect farms, mines, power projects, and factories throughout the country, helping to modernize the country's economic landscape.

At the heart of the effort lies a pilot program for Uganda's first central bank digital currency (CBDC), known as the digital shilling. The digital currency, which is backed by treasury bonds, will allow Ugandans to conduct transactions through mobile phones, even on basic devices. This development is significant as it directly links financial transactions to real economic activity, providing a foundation for a more inclusive and efficient economy.

The $5.5 billion investment will be financed through tokenized loans, as well as contributions from investors based in Korea and the Middle East. With more than 80% of Uganda's workforce currently employed in the informal economy, the promise of cheaper, faster, and more transparent trade through this system could significantly transform the economic landscape.

The rollout of the initiative will commence in the Karamoja Green Industrial & Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), a government-backed industrial zone that is part of Uganda's Vision 2040 development plan.

Ryan Kirkley, cofounder of GSN, emphasized that the project will merge technology with tangible production processes while ensuring that local licensing and control remain central to the project. Odongo Solomon, CEO of Diacente, highlighted that this initiative would integrate cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies into Uganda's broader development framework, marking a significant step toward modernizing the nation's financial and industrial systems.

Chinese tech and financial companies Ant Group and JD.com are now obligated to halt the issuance of stablecoins in Hong Kong following instructions from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Cyberspace Administration of China.

Both Ant Group and JD.com partnered to explore and participate in Hong Kong's stablecoin program. Both companies were also working on the tokenisation of financial products, like digital bonds.

One source told FT: “Who has the ultimate right of coinage — the central bank or any private companies on the market?”

In prior closed-door meetings, they urged the PBoC to authorise yuan-pegged stablecoins in Hong Kong ahead of the territory's new licensing rules, according to a report from the Financial Times on Sunday, citing people familiar with the discussions. 

But officials basically view privately run stablecoins as a potential challenge to the e-CNY, China's central bank digital currency (CBDC), which has struggled to gain broad adoption. One of those officials is the PBoC governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, who claimed stablecoins are a security risk for the financial system.

Central banks currently have at least two key concerns. First is “over-issuance”, meaning the issuer releases stablecoins without a true 100% reserve backing, effectively expanding the money supply. Second is “leverage amplification”, where the circulation of stablecoins after issuance creates a multiplier expansion of derived money. The U.S. GENIUS Act and Hong Kong's Stablecoin Ordinance have noted these risks, though control remains insufficient.

In August, Mainland regulators also asked major brokerages to stop publishing research that endorses stablecoins, and in recent weeks advised leading firms in Hong Kong to slow real-world asset tokenisation initiatives.

Starting this year, the Chinese government tightened its grip on the local cryptocurrency industry. In January, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange presented new laws for banks forcing them to monitor and report suspicious international transactions, including crypto.

President Trump promised to turn the US into ‘the crypto capital of the planet'. May James/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images

Crypto should be soaring right now. All the conditions are in place for a spectacular rally: abundant money supply, easy financial conditions, and a US administration which is actively pushing crypto with favourable deregulation and the creation of a strategic reserve to boost its price. President Trump has promised to turn the US into “the crypto capital of the planet” — and he appears to mean it.

And yet, after a rally to an all-time peak at the start of October, Bitcoin has fallen hard, shedding some 15% of its value in just the last two weeks. Sharp volatility isn't unusual in crypto but this pullback has happened at a time when the broader market has either held steady or kept rallying. G7 markets are off by 1 or 2% but emerging markets remain buoyant. Meanwhile, gold — the heavier, klunkier version of the “digital gold” that Bitcoin purports to be — is soaring, rising 7% over the same two-week period, and taking its gain since the new year to an eye-popping 60%.

It could be that Bitcoin's seemingly relentless upward climb will resume in the coming days and that all this will turn out to be much ado about nothing. But the past fortnight could also be a harbinger of its eventual demise. The Bitcoin oligarchs may find it eventually explodes in their hands.

When Bitcoin was created amid the angry fallout from the 2008 bank bailouts, it was designed to take money out of the hands of the bankers and oligarchs who dominated finance and hand it to the people, offering them an alternative system in which to conduct their business. Its political purpose was buried in the very first block of Bitcoin mined, which contained the line:  “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The digital currency was built upon the novel blockchain technology, which substituted a digital chain for the ledgers used by banks to record transactions, enabling users to thereby circumvent the banks. By fixing its supply at a maximum of 21 million, Bitcoin's creators ensured that unlike the fiat currency managed by central banks, it could not be devalued: the more money central banks printed to re-capitalise the collapsed financial system, the more valuable Bitcoin would become.

Yet the revolution in finance it was meant to bring about never took place. True, for those rebels who got in early, Bitcoin has certainly paid off handsomely. Worth mere pennies at its creation, it surpassed the $10,000 mark by the end of its first decade and is worth over $100,000 today.

Beyond that, though, not much remains of Bitcoin's early, idealistic vision. There was admittedly some democratisation, as over 50 million people bought Bitcoin — more if one includes people who've bought shares in funds that own Bitcoin. Yet it never managed to become an actual currency, being too cumbersome and volatile to be useful as a medium of exchange.

More tellingly, the crypto universe is now dominated by a handful of oligarchs managing large funds and “Bitcoin treasuries” who, by forging close ties with the Trump administration, have used state patronage to boost their asset values, much as the banks did in 2008. Trump and his family have themselves reportedly made $1 billion off their crypto creations. And with investment banks now offering crypto products to their clients, the formal takeover of crypto seems complete. This isn't the radical, decentralised financial system we were promised.

Rather than treat crypto as an alternative financial system, these “crypto-garchs” have turned it into a speculative asset, whose price they manipulate through Bitcoin treasuries — large funds whose purpose is to take Bitcoin off the market so as to further boost its price.

The biggest of these funds is MicroStrategy (which, though recently re-branded as Strategy, still goes by the stock-ticker label of MSTR). MSTR was originally a software company founded in 1989 by American entrepreneur Michael Saylor. After a history of setbacks and repeated run-ins with regulatory and tax authorities, Saylor finally found his pot of gold in 2020. At that time, as central banks responded to the Covid crash by flooding the market with money, Bitcoin rallied strongly. Saylor used his company's cash to buy a relatively small stash of Bitcoin. When it rose in value, his plan took flight.

The business model was simple: by buying Bitcoin in large quantities, MSTR helped bid up its price. As the value of its holdings rose, so did the company share price. That meant MSTR could both sell new shares and raise new debt, further boosting its holdings. And on it went for the next four years in a virtuous — to the company and its shareholders — upward spiral. The value of MSTR's Bitcoin holdings rose from $250 million in 2020 to over $40 billion this year, while MSTR's share price shot up from $12 to over $400 in the same time span. Other funds soon followed suit, and today the vast majority of Bitcoin are held by just 2% of its owners, with a few dozen of them alone controlling a fifth.

Taking over the market in this way gave the crypto-garchs both economic and political leverage: economic, in that by removing Bitcoin from circulation they reduced the market's liquidity, which amplified the impact of their further purchases, since they were now bidding for a smaller pool of Bitcoin. And political, in that they now had deep pockets with which to influence politicians in the 2024 election.

By John Rapley

With the Biden administration taking a sceptical view of crypto, the crypto-garchs turned to Donald Trump. Although originally a crypto-sceptic, calling it a scam as recently as 2021, Trump saw the opportunity in forging ties with an industry that was then out of favour. The industry donated more than $130 million to election campaigns, with an eye on displacing crypto-sceptics and supporting their backers, led by Trump. In return, Trump promised to lift regulation and promote the industry.

After Trump won the election, he came good on his pledges. He appointed big crypto-donors such as Howard Lutnick to his Cabinet, ended investigations into firms such as Gemini, which is owned by the same Winklevoss twins who'd donated $3 million to his political action committee, and withdrew a lawsuit against Coinbase, which together with some of its owners had contributed some $16 million to Trump's campaign funds. After announcing his plan to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump hosted several crypto-garchs at the White House, Michael Saylor among them, to discuss its implementation.

All this paid big dividends to MSTR. In the month after Trump's election victory, the price of Bitcoin rose over 50%, which enabled Saylor to return to the market with a major share flotation. MSTR raised $21 billion in share sales, giving it a powerful armoury to juice the Bitcoin price further.

But for all its lucre, there was an obvious flaw in this plan. Given their dominance of the market, that amplification of the impact of their purchases worked both ways. Given the relatively low volume of Bitcoin trades on any given day, even a small sale will sharply raise the supply — MSTR alone owns more Bitcoin than trade daily, so even a small liquidation of its portfolio would cause prices to fall sharply. If the crypto-garchs sold in volume to cover their debts or meet expenses, they'd crash the market. In for a penny, they were now in for a pound.

The crypto-garchs may now be holding a time-bomb. If MSTR is anything to go by, the money may be drying up: of the $21 billion the company raised last year, MSTR blew it all in the following three months. Since then, the company has struggled to raise new share capital.

The company isn't under any imminent pressure. The debt MSTR raised to buy Bitcoin doesn't come due for another two years, and having purchased its stash of Bitcoin for an average price of around $74,000, it's still nearly 50% up. But if Bitcoin doesn't resume rising, MSTR will struggle to raise more capital. In the meantime, its purchases of Bitcoin are diminishing, and failing — for now, at least — to bolster the price. MSTR is still buying Bitcoin at a weekly rate, but it is paying above market rates and its purchases have grown much smaller. Amid this, smaller Bitcoin treasuries are now starting to go to the wall.

This may explain why the gold market is booming as Bitcoin suffers. It appears that investors believe that if the only thing left of Bitcoin is a digital equivalent to gold — a store of value with limited fungibility — they might as well stick with the original. After all, humans have turned to gold amid social and economic crises for millennia, but have only held Bitcoin for a few years. If they sense a major crash might be coming, atavism may lead them back into the fold of what they know to work.

In the short term, given all the favourable tailwinds, it seems more likely than not that Bitcoin will resume its rise. But the events of the last two weeks may foreshadow Bitcoin's eventual endgame: the spark that lights a fire under markets. Bitcoin has now spread so deeply into the formal system that a major crash would likely force other liquidations as fund managers looked to cover their losses, possibly starting a chain-reaction through markets. And while oligarchs in 2008 had every reason to expect the government would bail them out, this time might be different. The proportionate size of US debt has doubled in the intervening years, and bailing out the Bitcoiners would likely send bond yields soaring. The crypto-garchs may thus not find the shelter they'd expect in a storm.

If this ends up toppling a few oligarchs, Bitcoin's original creators may feel their vision came true after all.

Oops, something went wrong

China has moved to block private stablecoin ambitions in Hong Kong, in what could be interpreted as an effort to reaffirm its state authority over monetary policy.

Two of China's largest technology companies, Alibaba-backed Ant Group and JD.com, an e-commerce group, have been instructed to suspend their stablecoin plans in Hong Kong.

That follows guidance from the People's Bank of China and the Cyberspace Administration of China, which warned against allowing private entities to issue currency-like assets, according to a Saturday report from the Financial Times.

Beijing's move signals a recalibration of Hong Kong's role in digital assets as it aligns with Beijing's regulatory priorities. Instead of expanding on retail speculation, it shows a push toward disciplined, cross-border compliance where innovation is tolerated only within clearly defined state and policy boundaries.

There appears to be a tendency to “push a narrative that Hong Kong could serve as a loophole for mainland firms to circumvent PRC crypto restrictions, especially around stablecoins,” Joshua Chu, lawyer, lecturer, and co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association, told Decrypt.

“This was never Beijing's intention,” Chu said, noting how China's crypto strategy “views speculative retail participation within the mainland as off-limits.”

What's happening “is a natural refinement emphasizing responsible innovation and compliance rather than speculative hype,” he explained. “Hong Kong's reputation depends on maintaining a clean, sophisticated framework that supports genuine market growth without undermining Beijing's policies.”

Beijing's intention for Hong Kong's stablecoin regime is “designed to absorb foreign crypto capital, not serve as a conduit for domestic mainland transactions,” Chu said, adding that there is a misconception around private entities that neglects China's pronouncement from 2021 regarding risks in speculative virtual currency transactions, which are still in effect.

The directive comes just months after both firms signaled interest in Hong Kong's new stablecoin framework in June, even as mainland officials warned of persisting stablecoin scams.

Ant Group, whose payment arm previously partnered with Circle in July to support cross-border settlements using USDC, had planned to apply through its international division, while JD.com explored global stablecoin licenses in June to cut costs.

China Presses Brokers to Halt Real-World Asset Tokenization in Hong Kong: Report

The PBoC reportedly told both firms not to proceed, warning that private stablecoins could blur the line between financial tech and sovereign monetary policy. Officials cited risks to capital supervision and potential overlap with the e-CNY, China's central bank digital currency, which remains the cornerstone of Beijing's long-term payments strategy.

An earlier analysis from Decrypt explored how China's early stablecoin studies pointed to a tiered but fragmented strategy, where state-backed banks, licensed payment firms, and private fintech companies were each exploring separate digital-currency models instead of a unified framework, showing competing priorities within the system.

Late last month, Chinese regulators reportedly instructed several mainland-linked brokerages to similarly pause real-world asset tokenization efforts in Hong Kong, reflecting continued caution toward privately managed blockchain projects amid broader reviews of cross-border financial activity.

Decrypt reached out to Ant Group and JD.com for comment.

As Pakistan gears up to regulate crypto and blockchain, with the creation of a United Arab Emirates-like Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, a specific use case related to stablecoins — a unique form of digital currency — raises concerns. These concerns, amplified by recent stablecoin legislation adopted by the US, have also led the European Central Bank to fast-track its plans for a digital euro, according to a Financial Times report. Why? The threat of a local currency substitution, particularly dollarisation, in this case of increasingly popular stablecoins pegged to the dollar.

Humza Khan, Binance's regional operations lead for the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, said, “The main risks with stablecoin adoption in Pakistan relate to dollarisation and the potential impact on the country's monetary policies.”

Mubariz Siddiqui, a legal expert and founder of Carbon Law, further added that the biggest issue that the central bank has is the “dollarisation of the economy”. Therefore, Pakistan now faces a critical policy question: can a central bank's fiat digital currency provide resistance to this threat posed by centralised fiat-backed digital currencies to preserve the central bank's authority and Pakistan's monetary sovereignty?

 
 


While confirming an uptake in interest in Binance and its users since government efforts to regulate virtual assets, Mr Khan said, “The community in Pakistan has been active for many years, and that strong foundation has supported the growth we have seen more recently.” He also confirmed, “In Pakistan, stablecoins are increasingly being explored as a tool for remittances and everyday transactions.”

As Pakistan prepares to pilot a central bank digital currency, stablecoins are emerging as a haven for institutional as well as retail investors, raising concerns of dollarisation and monetary sovereignty

He further acknowledged the interest of Pakistanis in stablecoins “being used for peer-to-peer [P2P] transactions” as it provides a means of hedging against local currency fluctuations. Delivering on these pain points for a population and an economy which relies heavily on cross-border transactions, with personal remittances contributing 9.4 per cent of the GDP in 2024, according to World Bank Data, “Stablecoins are a product-market fit for remittances and payouts,” said Faisal Aftab, Founder and CEO of Zayn VC.

According to Mr Aftab, stablecoins will “eventually terminate in RAAST, which is the State Bank's central switch”. He added that “The central bank will then hold those stablecoins as reserves, convert them into digital rupees, most likely a central bank digital currency [CBDC], and from there distribute them into wallets and bank accounts.”

As much as this use case fulfils the current needs of this population, it is dependent on an unstable local currency. Therefore, with increased dependence on stablecoins, there is a structured incentive for an unstable local currency, compounded by an already dollarised textile and information technology sector.

These incentives are amplified by the unique nature of this form of centralised digital currency, as it makes it even more accessible to get “digital dollars”, and to retain the dollar as a local medium of exchange through P2P transactions. This, in the end, affects the central bank's authority, as the dollar displaces even more use cases of the rupee, eventually weakening the impact of the central bank's policies to manage inflation.

Mr Khan also explained, “The increase in stablecoin adoption and reliance on the stablecoin USDC's risks reliability of the local rupee, delegitimising the currency and limiting the central bank's ability to mitigate inflation and liquidity.” He further adds that this could lead to a Pakistan-backed stablecoin “to ensure that the central bank of Pakistan and the digital asset landscape in the country grow and adapt in unison.”

A veteran tech founder, currently building on a similar use case, shared “Stablecoins can help formalise a lot of this informal saving.” While wishing to stay anonymous, he added, “Emerging markets with unstable money usually have foreign exchange controls,” and that “any platform that gives people access to digital dollars should follow those foreign exchange controls”.

Furthermore, “when a government appropriately regulates stablecoins, this can actually result in tremendous inflows”, he explained, as these dollar stablecoins come from abroad; if stablecoins are allowed to come in, but not go out, it results in “net new inflows”.

Mr Aftab, on the other hand, while acknowledging the risk of dollarisation, said, “Regulators in Pakistan have made it clear that stablecoin activity will be channelled through RAAST and digital rupee rails, which means there will be a path to manage this risk.”

But this is just one of the many use cases that blockchain technology provides, which, if used correctly, are ideal for emerging economies like Pakistan. Talking about the different use cases, Mr Khan from Binance shared that “each emerging market is unique and looks to different use cases” within decentralised finance. “In South East Asia, we see strong interest in technology, smart contracts, and developing new projects,” he discussed, “While across Africa, adoption has been driven by tools and services such as cross-border payments.”

While the central bank avoided offering specific timelines, it confirmed exploratory work on CBDCs. The chief spokesperson for the State Bank of Pakistan, Noor Ahmed, says that as part of its exploratory initiative, “SBP is engaging with selected CBDC solution providers at the proof-of-concept stage to better understand the underlying technologies, operational models and their solution offerings.”

Jack Dorsey, the creator of Twitter and a strong supporter of Bitcoin, has reignited debate in the crypto community with his latest comments on what BTC truly is.

Dorsey took to X on Sunday to post a brief message stating “Bitcoin is not crypto,” prompting a massive response with more than 4,000 comments.

While some argued that the anonymous BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto described Bitcoin BTCUSD as a “peer-to-peer cryptocurrency” on the Bitcointalk forum back in 2010, Dorsey highlighted the word “currency,” underscoring its monetary roots.

An early Bitcoin adopter himself, Dorsey has long been rumored to have played a role in Bitcoin's creation. Earlier this year, Seán Murray of deBanked published a list of circumstantial evidence suggesting as much, though it remains unverified.

Dorsey denied being Nakamoto in a 2020 interview with Lex Fridman, stating: “No, and if I were, would I tell you?”

“Crypto” not mentioned once in Bitcoin's white paper

Looking at Bitcoin's origins, Dorsey said the Bitcoin white paper — the foundational document introducing BTC in 2008 — makes no reference to “crypto,” backing his argument that BTC stands apart from the broader industry.

Instead, the white paper describes Bitcoin as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” and an “electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”

In a Bitcointalk post in July 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto also referred to Bitcoin as a “digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace the need for a trusted central server.”

So what is Bitcoin?

While distinguishing Bitcoin from “crypto,” Dorsey offered his answer in an earlier post just an hour before the “not crypto” tweet, writing simply: “Bitcoin is money.”

Dorsey defended Bitcoin's status as “money” by highlighting progress with zero-fee BTC payments by his financial services company Block and its payments processing arm Square.

The Bitcoin advocate specifically cited a post user Jamie Selects, who claimed to have “sold every Square Seller on bitcoin payments” at a local market, thanks to excitement over Square's “zero processing fees in 2026.”

Dorsey has long been an advocate of Bitcoin as a payment method, encouraging social media apps like Signal Messenger to adopt BTC payments in April.

Bitcoin's “money” status comes in line with Dorsey's vision that Bitcoin cannot succeed as a pure store of value, and has to maintain its payment use case to stay relevant.

Community criticism

Not everyone agrees with Dorsey's view, with critics pointing to Bitcoin's limited scalability, which can lead to slower processing times and higher fees.

Many have also pushed back against his “Bitcoin is not crypto” claim, highlighting the divide between Bitcoin maximalists and supporters of the broader crypto ecosystem, or altcoins.

David Schwartz, a prominent industry figure who is set to step back from his role as chief technology officer at Ripple by year-end, has joined the debate by highlighting confusion over Dorsey's tweet.

“I don't really know what Jack was trying to communicate here. I think he's somehow trying to say that bitcoin should be seen as a payment system rather than a speculative asset. But I don't know,” Schwartz wrote.

October 20, 2025

Last week, the Treasury Department finished receiving responses to a request for comments on “Innovative Methods To Detect Illicit Activity Involving Digital Assets.” It turns out I have such a thing in mind. It's just a matter of weeks before the law enforcement dynamics around digital assets—and in general—change completely. I'm being wry.

A few months ago, I wrote in characteristically laudatory terms about the GENIUS Act. Still being wry! In my role as skunk at the garden party, I pointed out that GENIUS stablecoins will be “horrible on privacy.” I also sought to show how GENIUS doled out favors to select business sectors, guaranteeing that stablecoin holders will lose the benefits they could reap from digital currency.

The GENIUS Act also called for a study of “anti–money laundering innovation.” That, I said, is an understated admission that today's financial surveillance policies are questionable.

Two years ago, I broached the idea of a system that would allow for law enforcement to query participants in financial transactions, obviating the need for wholesale financial surveillance. I have fleshed out that idea. Forthcoming in the Case Western Reserve University Journal of Law Technology and the Internet (Spring 2026)—available now on SSRN—is my article, “A Law Enforcement Paradigm for the New Form of Money.”

Here's the background: Money has evolved over recent centuries from movements of tangible things to digital communications events. Over the last half-century, financial surveillance law has taken root. The product of the two trends is a comprehensive, global financial surveillance regime that has substantial costs in both dollar terms and in values such as privacy, free speech, and autonomy.

My article goes through how those costs appear to vastly outstrip the benefits of such surveillance. I rely heavily on superlative research from Ronald Pol, who has more evidence coming out soon to show the weakness of global financial surveillance.

In place of broad financial surveillance, I propose a system through which law enforcement agencies could query digital transactors for investigative purposes. In a communications channel parallel to private transaction channels, law enforcement requests could be transmitted selectively from anywhere on the globe to transactors anywhere else, inviting them to help suppress and punish criminal activity. Such a system would maintain or strengthen law enforcement capabilities while obviating the existing broad and costly financial surveillance regime.

Writing it was a fascinating and challenging tour through the social and criminological dimensions of a new technical system. You can decide for yourself how well I do as a sociologist and criminologist.

For many, this may be a daunting, heavily technical idea, too difficult to grok. A “communications channel parallel to private transaction channels”? What does that even mean? But the underlying idea is simple and traditional. As I write, “Where law enforcement need is shown, people should be able to participate in detecting wrongdoing and catching wrongdoers. The new law enforcement paradigm proposed here is the old law enforcement paradigm refitted for modern global networks.”

For some, that is contrary to the ethos of digital currency, which is to escape the oppressions of present-day surveillance-mongers. I agree with that instinct, but I'm also thinking down the horizon. Crypto users, I'm confident, don't want their networks to be powerful and ready tools for ransom-takers, terrorists, child-abusers, and every other type of wrongdoer. They want privacy and a capacity for law enforcement and the community to prevent and punish genuine wrongdoing.

There are native political controls on the system I describe, which make it superior to the present status quo (which is the appropriate comparison):

Because a system for communicating law enforcement queries to global transactors would be “retail,” it would allow for political feedback loops that cause law enforcement practices and priorities to hew more closely to public values than the current “wholesale” financial surveillance system.

With that, we have a system that should meet with unanimous acclaim. The Treasury Department will no doubt adopt the system I describe upon reviewing my comment, shunning financial surveillance and dismantling both the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, our domestic financial surveillance agency, and the Financial Action Task Force, which has pressed financial surveillance on countries around the world.

Any minute now. Yes, I'm still being wry.

On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally.

Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains.

The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on “cryptographic proof instead of trust” and the problems with traditional systems being related to “all the trust that's required to make it work,” much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino.

Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called “stablechains,” which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets.

A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value.  Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them.  OTOH,…

Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma.

More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks.

As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy.

There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain.

Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size war back in 2017. However, Ethereum's reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology.

As seen by the recent “stablechain” phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoin's main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network.

While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

Chainlink's native token, LINK, rose 13.6% over 24 hours on Monday as it led the way for a wider crypto recovery following last week's leverage-inspired move to the downside. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, added 4.2% in the same period.

On-chain analyst Lookonchain reported that 30 new wallets had withdrawn a total of 6,256,893 LINK ($116.7 million) since Oct. 11, signaling accumulation from high net worth entities.

In its third-quarter review released on Friday, Chainlink Labs detailed several major deals and technology milestones driving renewed investor optimism. The network announced collaborations with interbank message system Swift, U.S. financial system clearing company Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. (DTCC) and European equivalent, Euroclear, alongside a pilot with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring government data on-chain.

The report also outlined Chainlink's broader platform vision, evolving from a decentralized oracle provider into a full-stack infrastructure layer for tokenized and real-world assets.

DefiLlama data shows that ChainLink still dominates rival networks in terms of oracle capacity, with $62 billion in total value secured (TVS) equating to 62% of the market. The nearest competitor is Chronicle with $10 billion TVS.

Bitcoin BTC$111,296.88 and the broader crypto market recovered over the weekend, offering a brief reprieve after sticky selling pressure kept cryptocurrency prices depressed in the aftermath of a $500 billion value-destruction event.

The price of bitcoin rose 3% in the past 24 hours to $110,770. It remains down about 4% for the month. The recovery came as global risk sentiment improves, with equities rising and investors rotating back into more volatile assets.

U.S. President Donald Trump's softer stance on tariffs and signs that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy later this year have helped calm markets. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 4.3% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green.

“While bitcoin has seen a notable short-term correction, the long-term trend remains a different story, as the cryptocurrency's trajectory is still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, U.S. dollar strength, spot bitcoin ETF flows, and geopolitical risks,” XS.com markets analyst Linh Tran told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.

Still, short-term momentum may not signal a lasting trend. Analysts at Coinbase Institutional warned that thin liquidity, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate path continue to weigh on market structure.

A spike in U.S. Treasury yields at the end of last week and geopolitical tensions with Israel conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza after attacks on its forces while a ceasefire was in effect and as Russia advances in Ukraine, have kept many institutional investors cautious.

Nevertheless corporate accumulation has kept on going, with BitcoinTreasuries data showing that in the past 30 days these entities increased their holdings by 8.4% to 4.04 million BTC. Access to crypto exposure is also growing, with BlackRock and 21Shares adding debuting their crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange for retail investors.

“Overall, in my view, bitcoin is currently in a reaccumulation phase following its short-term correction, with market sentiment stabilizing and institutional demand remaining resilient,” Tran added. Stay alert!

BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021.

In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly.

BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRock's page for the product.

Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee ""Core” offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%.

“Today's launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,” 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban “begins to level the playing field with Europe.”

The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said.

Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. 

BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelity's FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets.

UPDATE (Oct. 20, 12:06 UTC): Adds listings by 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise starting in first paragraph.

Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider, has recently held talks about going public in the U.S. via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listing, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. 

The company appointed Cohen & Company Capital Markets to advise on a potential SPAC deal, one of the people said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is private. It's unclear if any talks are ongoing at present.

Blockchain.com declined to comment. Cohen & Company Capital Markets didn't respond to a request for comment by publication time.

While the valuation of a potential deal is unknown, throughout the years the firm has raised funds at different valuations due to market volatility.

In March 2021, it raised $300 million at a post-money valuation of $5.2 billion. The following year, its valuation climbed to $14 billion after another funding round. However, by November 2023, a $110 million raise valued Blockchain.com at $7 billion, according to Bloomberg.

The firm is the latest crypto company to seek a public listing amid a flurry of deals in the space. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in June, followed by CoinDesk's owner Bullish (BLSH) in August and crypto exchange Gemini (GEMI) in September. Rival exchange Kraken is also reportedly looking to list early next year.

Blockchain.com signaled progress toward a potential go-public transaction by appointing two experienced executives with strong financial and operational backgrounds, according to a report in February.

The company hired Justin Evans, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs (GS), as its new chief financial officer. It also appointed Mike Wilcox, previously CFO of Velocity Global and former Point72 portfolio manager, as its chief operating officer.

Evans said at the time that the exchange is “taking the steps necessary to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.”

Earlier this year, the company expanded its operations into several African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and South Africa.

 Long-term Bitcoin holders took profits at record levels with realized gains hitting $1.7 billion daily as older coins re-entered circulation. 

The price of Bitcoin will have a challenging road ahead as long as long-term holders continue to take profits, according to analysts.

The failure of crypto markets to recover was not due to manipulation, paper Bitcoin, or suppression, “just good old-fashioned sellers,” said analyst James Check on Sunday.

Check added that the sheer volume of sell-side pressure from existing Bitcoin (BTC) holders is still not widely appreciated, and that it was “the source of resistance” at the moment. 

The analyst shared a chart showing that the average age of spent coins has drifted higher throughout the cycle, indicating that long-term holders were the ones selling.

Another chart showed that realized profit had spiked to $1.7 billion per day while realized losses climbed to $430 million per day, the third highest level this cycle.

Meanwhile, the “revived supply” from older coins reached its second-highest level at $2.9 billion per day. 

Crypto investor Will Clemente said that “the last year of relative weakness for BTC has mostly been a transfer of supply from OGs to TradFi,” which can be seen in onchain data.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz echoed the sentiment in an interview with Raoul Pal last week.

“There are a lot of people in the Bitcoin world who had rode this so long and finally decided, ‘I wanna buy something',” he said, citing friends who bought a yacht and part of a sports team. 

Novogratz confirmed that the only supply his firm has seen is “old OGs” and miners. 

Bitcoin has held onto support with a weekly closing candle at $108,700, according to TradingView.

“Continued holding here could see price rally to $120k+ over time. Stability here is absolutely key,” said analyst “Rekt Capital” on Sunday. 

The asset had reclaimed $110,000 at the time of writing, but it faces more resistance just above this level.

 Andrew Cuomo wants to make NYC a global crypto and tech hub with a new innovation office and council for AI, blockchain and biotech. 

Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo is reportedly betting big on crypto and AI as part of his bid to return as the city's next mayor. 

The New York City mayoral candidate plans to make NYC “the global hub of the future” by coordinating initiatives across the blockchain, AI and biotech industries and modernizing how the city integrates new technology, the co-host of Crypto in America, Eleanor Terrett, said on Saturday.

Part of this will also involve creating a new chief innovation officer position aimed at attracting more investments and jobs to boost innovation, she said. 

An Innovation Council with three advisory committees for crypto, AI and biotech would be formed to “advise on adoption, workforce development, and cutting red tape for these emerging industries,” Terrett added, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Cuomo has experience in crypto, having advised crypto exchange OKX over a federal probe that resulted in it pleading guilty to several violations and agreeing to pay over $500 million worth of fines and penalties.

Should Cuomo be appointed and follow through on his reported plans, NYC could shift from a regime characterized by ruthless enforcement action to one that attracts and retains more industry talent and places itself at the forefront of financial innovation.

It may also strengthen the bridge between TradFi and crypto and channel far more inflows into crypto markets, given that Wall Street has the greatest concentration of capital on earth.

The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq boast market caps over $30 trillion — far exceeding the third-place Shanghai Stock Exchange at around $8 trillion.The current NYC mayor, Eric Adams, has already taken action into his own hands, establishing America's first municipal Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology last Tuesday.

“The office will promote the responsible use of digital assets and blockchain technologies, grow economic opportunities for New Yorkers, attract world-class talent, and reinforce the city's standing as the world's hub for financial and technological innovation,” his office said.

Adams initially sought a second term but withdrew from the race last month amid increased political pressure to stand down. 

Cuomo is competing with anti-tech Democrat Zohran Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa to replace Adams as the new mayor, with voting scheduled to take place on Nov. 4.

Mamdani is the odds-on favorite to replace Adams, leading almost every poll tracking the race, New York Times data shows.

While Mamdani has been relatively silent on crypto, his policy positions are widely considered more “left” than the Democratic Party norm. 

Mamdani has received criticism from a few crypto industry leaders, including Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss, who, in light of Mamdani's rising popularity, said: “It appears things will have to get worse in NYC before they get better.”

Cells Have a Crystal Trigger That Makes Them Self-Destruct When Viruses Invade

A special class of immune proteins protect us from pathogens but also drive inflammation and cell death

By Viviane Callier edited by Tanya Lewis

A model showing proteins called death fold domains (green) telling a caspase enzyme (blue) to kill the cell after it has been compromised by pathogens.

Stowers Institute for Medical Research/Tayla Miller

The immune system has a tough job: When a tiny virus invades one of our cells, that cell must detect it and, within minutes, decide what to do. If the cell quickly self-destructs, that will prevent the virus from spreading throughout the body. But such a response to a false alarm will mean the cell will die unnecessarily.

Now researchers have discovered that a special group of about 100 immune proteins hangs out inside every cell in the body, where these proteins do nothing but wait. Then, when a virus breaks in, it seeds a crystal, and the proteins instantly clump around it, forming a scaffold for enzymes known as caspases to activate and immediately initiate cell death. (The caspases must be brought together to kill the cell; it is their proximity to one another that activates them.) The kind of cell death caused by this mechanism is called pyroptosis, and unlike apoptosis (programmed cell death), it triggers inflammation.

“What we found, in essence, is that the cells are literally waiting to die all the time,” says Randal Halfmann, an associate investigator at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. Halfmann oversaw the work, which was published in eLife in September.

Historically, scientists have studied proteins' folded structures to understand their function individually. But “we're in this explosion of discovery, realizing that these individual molecules that we've studied so well are coming together into larger structures that are not bound by membranes,” says D. Allan Drummond, a molecular biologist at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the study. This new understanding has prompted “new kinds of ways of thinking about cellular function and decision-making by cells, new ways for them to store energy, and so on.”

The study, which was done in living yeast cells and human cell lines, illustrates how proteins act collectively by forming a crystal that gathers caspases together to activate the cell death program and enable the cell to make a rapid life-or-death decision. It also provides an example of how solid protein clumps, which are typically believed to be pathological (such as in Alzheimer's disease), can be essential to function: “In order to be useful, their whole job is to be this irreversible, downhill, spontaneous reaction that allows the cell to make decisions that include killing the cell,” Drummond says. The rapidity of the decision is key: if the cell relies on more traditional signaling pathways that activate genes in response to an infection, an agile virus could take control of the cell's protein-making machinery before the cell has a chance to respond.

Although structural biologists had studied this kind of protein behavior in test tubes, “what was really lacking was: ‘Does this really happen in the cell?'” says Bostjan Kobe, a protein structural biologist at the University of Queensland in Australia. “That's why [Halfmann's] work was really interesting—because it came at the problem from a completely different angle.”

Halfmann's team observed that these immune proteins typically remain soluble but that, given enough time—over a lifespan—they will spontaneously crystallize, misfiring in a way that leads to cell death and inflammation. “What this means is that if you wait long enough, every cell will die via this mechanism because even if a virus doesn't get into the cell, it will happen at some frequency spontaneously,” Halfmann says. (Of course, cells can die by other mechanisms, such as apoptosis, first.)

Halfmann's team quantified the driving force for these proteins to crystallize in different human cell types and found that their concentration is correlated with the rate of cell turnover in our body. For example, some blood cells are replaced every few days, whereas neurons often last a lifetime. The faster cells normally turn over, the more of these immune proteins they tend to have, suggesting that this process of spontaneous activation might be responsible for killing them.

These results suggest that these immune proteins might be contributing to the low-grade inflammation that accompanies aging. Finding ways to keep the proteins from crystallizing could potentially extend cells' lifespan and reduce aging-related inflammation, but the trade-off would be a weaker immune system, Halfmann says.

This feature of the immune system is very ancient. It is found in the earliest animals, such as sponges, and it even exists in bacteria, from which we likely inherited it. It is specifically found in some bacteria that live in tight-knit communities. “If you're a single-celled organism, there's no drive to kill yourself,” Halfmann says. “But when you're part of a community and you're compromised by a phage [a virus that kills bacteria], then it absolutely makes sense to kill yourself because you're related to everybody around you, and that is where these proteins seem to have evolved.”

Automation plays a key role in Toyota's production, but only to supplement skilled human labor. Skilled workers are still the engine of the operation.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Earlier this month, we had the opportunity to tour Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK), the brand's largest vehicle manufacturing plant in the world. Covering over nine million square feet, roughly 156 football fields. While the size and scale of the operation was simply astonishing, the human element at TMMK is what really caught my eye. 

Employing just under 9,500 workers, TMMK was able to produce 435,631 vehicles in 2024. In fact, the Kentucky-based factory is one of the few Toyota facilities able to produce engines and dies (tools used to cut, form, or shape material) as well as automobiles. Such numbers and capabilities still rely heavily on skilled labor with a healthy amount of support from automation and robotics. 

Despite considerable advancements in automation, Toyota (and Lexus) maintain that humans are still the right answer. In fact, the brand's “Kaizen” strategy of continuous improvement aligns much better with a human workforce than a fleet of robots. Having said that, the superiority of a skilled workforce is much more complex than just simply being better.

Humans and robots both require training to complete tasks with significant proficiency levels. That's why all production-line employees at TMMK (and all other Toyota Motor Manufacturing facilities) are trained in a classroom environment before working on customer vehicles. Such instruction has proven incredibly effective, giving Toyota the ability to train new line-workers to millimeter-levels of precision. 

The program firmly follows a crawl, walk, run approach, with the training demonstration beginning with tasks as simple as picking up bolts. Sure, picking them up was easy, but manipulating them into the impact wrench before fastening them necessitated a surprising level of dexterity—which as you'll see to the left, I didn't have. The rest of the process was easy, as the impact was programmed to shut off after the bolt was tightened to its specific torque specifications. 

There were actually a number of “analog” training aids that helped steer me in the right direction. Namely, the table in front of the bolt tightening demo would alarm if I pushed too hard; along with simply being unnecessary, I was told excess pressure could put undo strain on workers. You may also be able to spot a bar that runs the length of the table, which plays a subtle train whistle if I leaned into it. 

Many are worried about Artificial Intelligence (AI) “stealing” jobs as it continues to become further integrated into society. Thankfully, Toyota is approaching the new technology with a much more nuanced approach that balances human expertise with automation. Known as the “Toyota Way,” the Japanese automaker is approaching AI as a tool to support workers instead of replacing them.

Toyota still firmly believes that humans are a significant asset on the production line, even without automation lending a helping hand. Automation is excellent for repetitive tasks; however, it still can't compete with a human's ability to spot minute details for quality control, solve problems, and improve processes on the fly.

As we were being driven around inside the factory, while listening to the tour in a set of headphones, I couldn't help but notice the number of other autonomous vehicles passing by. 

Many of them came quite close to our golf cart, but none of them actually ended up making contact. And that's a good thing, as the majority of these vehicles are responsible for transporting parts and pieces from storage to workers on the production line. The Kentucky facility uses a fleet of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) to deliver those components. Some of the more compact AMRs are able to transfer smaller loads, while the AGV you see above is able to transport a rolling chassis to the production line.

If you've ever seen videos of those fast food delivery robots putzing around on college campuses, these operate on much the same logic. Of course, in a perfect world, TMMK would build in dedicated lanes in the factory to make life easy. Much like their life on the street, these robots are trained to avoid collisions with humans and other autonomous vehicles. The end result is a homogeneous factory where robots and humans work together in harmony. 

So if you suddenly find yourself in the market for a Toyota vehicle, know that it was primarily built by skilled sets of hands.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The hidden evolution making men's sperm more dangerous with age","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251019120513.htm","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:39:27 GMT","

Genetic mutations that can cause disease become increasingly common in sperm as men grow older, and new evidence suggests this happens because certain DNA changes are actually favored during sperm production, according to new research.

In a major study published on October 8 in Nature, scientists from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the TwinsUK study at King's College London mapped how harmful DNA mutations accumulate across the entire sperm genome as men age.

The results open new avenues for studying how environmental and lifestyle factors might influence the genetic health of future generations.

In tissues that constantly renew, mutations (changes in DNA) can give some cells an advantage, allowing them to multiply faster than others. These groups of identical ""clonal"" cells then expand, eventually outnumbering their neighbors. While most mutations in the body's ordinary cells (such as those in organs, connective tissue, and bone) are not passed to children, mutations in sperm and egg cells can be inherited. Until recently, however, scientists lacked the precise tools to measure how strongly certain mutations are favored in sperm.

To overcome this, the team used NanoSeq1, a highly accurate DNA sequencing technology, to analyze sperm from 81 healthy men aged 24 to 75.2,3 The samples came from the TwinsUK cohort, the UK's largest adult twin registry, which provided a well-documented and diverse population for comparison.

The data revealed that about 2 percent of sperm from men in their early 30s carried disease-causing mutations. This proportion increased to 3-5 percent in men aged 43 to 74. Among 70-year-old participants, 4.5 percent of sperm contained harmful mutations, showing a clear link between age and genetic risk to offspring.

The increase is not caused solely by random DNA errors accumulating over time. Instead, a subtle form of natural selection within the testes appears to give certain mutations a reproductive advantage, allowing them to become more common during sperm formation.

Researchers pinpointed 40 genes that seem to benefit from this process, many of which are tied to serious neurodevelopmental disorders in children and inherited cancer risks. While 13 of these genes were previously known to be involved, the new study shows the phenomenon affects many more genes linked to cell growth and development than scientists once realized.

Although the number of sperm carrying harmful mutations rises with age, not every one of these mutations leads to conception or a healthy pregnancy. Some may prevent fertilization or normal embryo development, while others could cause miscarriage. More studies are needed to determine how the growing number of sperm mutations affects children's health outcomes.

By revealing how mutations arise and are shaped by selection within sperm, the researchers hope to refine reproductive risk assessments and better understand how genetics, lifestyle, and environment interact across generations.

In a complementary study, also published in Nature,4 scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Sanger Institute investigated the same phenomenon from a different angle by looking at mutations already passed on to children, rather than those measured directly in sperm. By analyzing DNA from over 54,000 parent-child trios and 800,000 healthy individuals, the team identified more than 30 genes where mutations give sperm cells a competitive edge, again including many linked to rare developmental disorders and cancer, and many overlapping the set of genes observed directly in sperm. The study found that these mutations can increase sperm mutation rates roughly 500-fold which helps explain why some rare genetic disorders appear when parents do not carry the mutations in their own DNA. Interestingly, the study notes that as these mutations are common in the sperm, it may look like some genes cause false-positive disease association due to the elevated mutation rate rather than a true disease link. The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders.

Dr. Matthew Neville, first author from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""We expected to find some evidence of selection shaping mutations in sperm. What surprised us was just how much it drives up the number of sperm carrying mutations linked to serious diseases.""

Professor Matt Hurles, Director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and co-author, said: ""Our findings reveal a hidden genetic risk that increases with paternal age. Some changes in DNA not only survive but thrive within the testes, meaning that fathers who conceive later in life may unknowingly have a higher risk of passing on a harmful mutation to their children.""

Professor Kerrin Small, co-author and Scientific Director of the TwinsUK study at King's College London, said: ""We are incredibly grateful to the twins who took part in this study. By working with the TwinsUK cohort, we could include valuable longitudinal samples linked to rich health and genetic information, allowing us to explore how mutations accumulate and evolve with age in healthy individuals. This collaboration highlights the power of large, population-based cohorts for advancing our understanding of human development and inheritance.""

Dr. Raheleh Rahbari, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""There's a common assumption that because the germline has a low mutation rate, it is well protected. But in reality, the male germline is a dynamic environment where natural selection can favour harmful mutations, sometimes with consequences for the next generation.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This new iron supplement heals anemia without hurting your gut","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251019120516.htm","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 05:16:29 GMT","

Iron-deficiency anemia is a widespread health problem that often leads to fatigue, headaches, or even cravings for ice. Traditional oral iron supplements can help, but they often leave behind unabsorbed iron that irritates the digestive tract and triggers inflammation. Researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have developed a new type of supplement that blends iron with prebiotics and probiotics. In animal studies, this innovative formula successfully restored healthy blood iron levels in anemic mice while preventing inflammation and keeping the gut microbiome balanced.

""By advancing biomaterial-based iron delivery, this research offers a transformative approach to address anemia, directly contributing to improved nutrition and long-term public health,"" explains Poonam Sagar, an author of the study.

Anemia develops when the body lacks enough red blood cells to transport oxygen efficiently. It can result from infections, inherited conditions, or, most commonly, a shortage of dietary iron. Doctors typically prescribe oral iron tablets to treat the condition. However, the body absorbs only a small fraction of the iron they contain. The remaining iron can upset the balance of gut bacteria and cause inflammation, which is why probiotics are sometimes prescribed alongside iron to protect digestive health.

In earlier research, scientists had already tried combining iron with probiotics. Sagar, Nitin Kumar Singhal, and their team expanded on this concept by adding prebiotics (nutrients that feed beneficial bacteria) to create a three-part supplement designed to be more effective and gentler on the gut.

The new formulation combines dietary fiber extracted from millet (a grain), the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and an iron-containing complex. The researchers first tested the supplement's compatibility with human cells, then evaluated its effects in mice with iron-deficiency anemia. After two weeks, the treated mice showed:

While more research is needed, the team believes this approach could lead to a new generation of iron supplements that restore iron safely, improve gut health, and reduce unwanted side effects.

The study received support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of India and the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reveal the best exercise to ease knee arthritis pain","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251019120521.htm","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 08:30:35 GMT","

People living with knee osteoarthritis may find the greatest relief from aerobic activities such as walking, cycling, or swimming, according to a new study published in The BMJ. Researchers found that these forms of exercise were the most effective for easing pain, improving movement, and enhancing overall quality of life.

Although other exercise types can provide added benefits, the researchers emphasized that aerobic activity should remain the foundation of treatment. Osteoarthritis develops when the cartilage cushioning the ends of bones wears down, leading to swelling, stiffness, and discomfort. It can affect any joint, but the knees are most commonly impacted. About 30% of adults over age 45 show signs of knee osteoarthritis on x-rays, and roughly half of them experience significant pain and mobility problems.

Filling the Evidence Gap in Exercise Guidance

Exercise is a cornerstone of osteoarthritis care, yet many medical guidelines lack clear direction on which kinds are most beneficial for knee osteoarthritis specifically. To clarify this, researchers analyzed the effectiveness and safety of several exercise approaches.

Their comprehensive analysis drew on 217 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1990 and 2024. In total, the research included 15,684 participants and compared multiple exercise categories -- including aerobic, flexibility, strengthening, mind-body, neuromotor, and mixed programs -- against control groups.

Evaluating Pain Relief, Function, and Mobility

The trials varied in quality, but the team assessed the strength of the evidence using the internationally recognized GRADE system. They examined several key outcomes: pain reduction, physical function, gait performance, and quality of life. Each was measured at short term (four weeks), mid-term (12 weeks), and long term (24 weeks) follow-ups.

Across these studies, aerobic exercise consistently ranked highest in improving outcomes among all exercise types tested.

Aerobic Activity Delivers the Broadest Benefits

Moderate-certainty evidence showed that, compared with control groups, aerobic exercise effectively reduced short- and mid-term pain and improved function in both the short and long term. It also enhanced gait performance and quality of life over short and mid-term periods.

Other exercise forms showed value too. Mind-body workouts likely provided a notable improvement in short-term function, neuromotor exercises likely boosted short-term gait performance, and strengthening or mixed routines improved function in the mid-term.

Safe and Effective for Long-Term Use

Importantly, none of the exercise types resulted in more adverse events than the control groups, indicating that these therapies are generally safe.

The authors did acknowledge some study limitations. Many results came from indirect comparisons, certain outcomes lacked long-term data, and smaller studies may have influenced some early findings.

Clear Takeaway for Patients and CliniciansDespite these limitations, the researchers describe their work as one of the most complete and current evaluations of exercise for managing knee osteoarthritis. They believe the findings will help clinicians make more targeted recommendations.

Based on the evidence, the team advises aerobic exercise ""as a first line intervention for knee osteoarthritis management, particularly when the aim is to improve functional capacity and reduce pain"" and say if aerobic exercise is not possible owing to individual limitations, ""alternative forms of structured physical activity may still be beneficial.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Your DNA may shape how you use cannabis","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251019120518.htm","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 05:31:05 GMT","

Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, working with the genetic testing company 23andMe, have pinpointed regions of the human genome linked to cannabis use. Their discoveries reveal new genetic connections to psychiatric, cognitive, and physical health, offering insights that could eventually guide prevention and treatment strategies for cannabis use disorder. The findings were published on October 13, 2025, in Molecular Psychiatry.

""Cannabis is widely used, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly characterized,"" said Sandra Sanchez-Roige, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and senior author of the study. The researchers were also interested in the relationship between genetics and traits that contribute to the development of cannabis use disorder, which can interfere with a person's daily life.

""While most people who try cannabis do not go on to develop cannabis use disorder, some studies estimate that nearly 30% will,"" said Sanchez-Roige. ""Understanding the genetics of early-stage behaviors may help clarify who is at greater risk, opening the door to prevention and intervention strategies.""

To explore these connections, the researchers performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using genetic data from 131,895 23andMe research participants. Participants completed surveys about whether they had ever used cannabis, and those who had were asked about their frequency of use.

""We've known for decades that genetic factors influence whether or not people will try drugs, how frequently they use those drugs, and the risk that they will become addicted to them,"" said Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor and vice chair for basic research in the department of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-author of the study. ""Genetic tools like GWAS help us identify the molecular systems that connect cannabis use to brain function and behavior.""

The study identified two genes significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use. The first, Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (CADM2), plays a role in how nerve cells form connections and communicate in the brain. Earlier research has tied CADM2 to traits such as impulsivity, obesity, and cancer metastasis. This same gene was also linked to how often people use cannabis.

The second gene, Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 3 (GRM3), influences how neurons communicate and how the brain adapts over time. GRM3 has previously been connected to psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

""We showed that the genetics of cannabis use -- both trying it and using it more often -- are tied to the genetics of other psychiatric traits, cognitive measures, and even physical health problems,"" said Sanchez-Roige.

A secondary analysis revealed an additional 40 genes associated with lifetime cannabis use and four genes associated with frequency of cannabis use. Twenty-nine of these genes had not previously been associated with cannabis-related traits.

The researchers then analyzed which health conditions were correlated with a genetic predisposition for cannabis use. They analyzed thousands of traits in two large independent datasets from the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) All of Us Research Program and Vanderbilt University Medical Center's biobank.

Across the genome, lifetime cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use were genetically correlated with more than 100 different traits including psychiatric conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, ADHD, anxiety and depression), cognitive traits (e.g., executive function and risk-taking) and physical health (e.g., diabetes, chronic pain and coronary artery disease). They were also associated with an increased risk for tobacco use, infectious diseases including HIV and viral hepatitis, and autoimmune diseases.

The study is one of the first genome-wide association studies to examine behaviors that precede cannabis use disorder.

""Cannabis use exists on a continuum,"" said first author Hayley Thorpe, Ph.D., a visiting scholar in Sanchez-Roige's lab and postdoctoral researcher at Western University. ""By studying these intermediate traits, we can begin to map how genetic risk unfolds before cannabis use disorder develops.""

There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. The authors hope that the biological discoveries generated by GWAS will support future efforts to identify therapeutic targets and preventative interventions against the disorder.

Additional co-authors on the study include: John J. Meredith, Mariela V. Jennings, Renata B. Cupertino, Shreya Pakala, UC San Diego; Pierre Fontanillas, Sarah L. Elson and the 23andMe Research Team at 23andMe, Inc.; Jibran Y. Khokhar, Western University; Emma C. Johnson, Washington University in St. Louis; and Lea K. Davis, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

The study was funded, in part, by the National Institutes of Institute on Drug Abuse (grants R01 DA050721, P50DA037844 and P30DA060810) at the NIH, and the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program (grant T32IR5226).

The 23andMe Research participants provided informed consent and volunteered to participate in the research online, under a protocol approved by the Association for Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, Inc. (AAHRPP)-accredited Salus IRB.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Glowing sugars show how microbes eat the ocean's carbon","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251019120511.htm","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 02:56:26 GMT","

A group of chemists, microbiologists, and ecologists has developed a molecular probe (a molecule designed to detect e.g. proteins or DNA inside an organism) that glows when a sugar is broken down. Writing in the journal JACS, the researchers describe how this innovation makes it possible to observe the microscopic competition between algae and the microbes that consume their sugars in the ocean.

""Sugars are ubiquitous in marine ecosystems, yet it's still unclear whether or how microbes can degrade them all,"" says Jan-Hendrik Hehemann from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology and the MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, both located in Bremen. ""The new probe allows us to watch it happen live,"" Peter Seeberger from the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces adds.

Sugars and the Ocean's Carbon

Algae take in carbon dioxide and transform it into oxygen and organic matter, with sugars playing a central role in the process. Yet not every sugar is easy for microbes to digest. Some are so complex that only a few microorganisms can break them down. When these tough sugars resist decay, the carbon they contain sinks to the seafloor, where it can remain trapped for centuries until the right enzymes appear. Determining which microbes can digest specific sugars has long challenged scientists, especially in diverse ocean ecosystems.

Watching Sugars Glow

To overcome this problem, the team used automated glycan assembly to create a sugar tagged with two fluorescent dyes. These dyes interact through a process called Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), acting together like a molecular switch. The probe stays dark when intact, but once an enzyme breaks the sugar's backbone, it emits light. This allows scientists to see exactly where and when the sugar is being degraded. The researchers tested the probe by tracking α-mannan turnover, a polysaccharide (long sugar chain) found in algal blooms. It performed effectively in purified enzyme tests, bacterial extracts, live cell cultures, and even complex microbial communities.

""This research is a wonderful example of interdisciplinary collaboration between Max Planck Institutes. With our FRET glycans, we now have a new tool for researching phytoplankton-bacterioplankton interactions in the ocean,"" says Rudolf Amann from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology.

Revealing Hidden Degraders 

By enabling the tracking of α-mannan turnover, this glycan probe opens up new avenues for studying microbial metabolism without the need for prior genomic knowledge. Researchers can now pinpoint active degraders in situ, map the progression of glycan breakdown through space and time, and quantify turnover rates in complex communities. This tool paves the way for deeper insights into glycan cycling across ecosystems, from ocean algal blooms to the human gut. By observing which microbes are activated and under what conditions, scientists can link specific enzymatic activities to environmental processes and ultimately gain a better understanding of carbon flux in the ocean.

""Sugars are central to the marine carbon cycle,"" concludes first author Conor Crawford from the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces. ""With this FRET probe, we can ask: Who's eating what, where, and when?""

Scientists believe that the remarkable longevity of naked mole-rats may be tied to subtle changes in just four amino acids. A recent study found that small evolutionary mutations in cGAS -- an enzyme in the innate immune system that detects DNA and triggers immune defenses -- could make these animals better at repairing age-related genetic damage. In contrast, the same enzyme in mice and humans can actually hinder DNA repair.

Despite their wrinkled, almost alien appearance, naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are extraordinary among rodents, living up to 40 years, or about ten times longer than most animals their size. Surprisingly, their genetic blueprint is closer to humans than to mice, making them an important species for studying how organisms maintain health over long lifespans. One crucial element of longevity is the ability to preserve genome stability. Yet how naked mole-rats manage to keep their DNA so resilient has remained largely unclear.

How Naked Mole-Rats Protect Their DNA

A key process involved in maintaining DNA integrity is homologous recombination (HR), a pathway that repairs genetic breaks. When this process fails, it can accelerate aging and increase the risk of cancer. In humans and mice, the DNA-sensing enzyme cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase) is known to interfere with HR repair, which can lead to genome instability and a shorter lifespan.

To understand whether naked mole-rats have found a way around this limitation, Yu Chen and colleagues examined how their version of cGAS behaves. The researchers discovered that four amino acid substitutions in the naked mole-rat's cGAS reduce the protein's tagging for degradation, allowing it to remain active longer and accumulate after DNA damage. This stability enables the enzyme to interact more effectively with important DNA repair proteins, including FANCI and RAD50, strengthening the HR repair process.

Evolutionary Mutations That Extend Life

When the scientists removed cGAS from naked mole-rat cells, the amount of DNA damage sharply increased, confirming the enzyme's protective role. Even more strikingly, fruit flies genetically engineered to carry the same four naked mole-rat-specific mutations in human cGAS lived longer than flies with the normal version of the enzyme.

These findings suggest that just a few precise molecular tweaks may help explain why naked mole-rats live so long. The mutations appear to turn cGAS from a potential inhibitor into a powerful ally of DNA repair, offering the animals a natural mechanism to combat the effects of aging.

A New Clue in the Search for Longevity

""The findings from Chen et al. describe an unexpected role for naked mole-rat cGAS in the nucleus that influences longevity,"" write John Martinez and colleagues in a related Perspective. ""Further research will be required to establish the roles that cGAS may play in the nucleus in other organisms, both short- and long-lived, but the answer may be substantially more complex than originally predicted.""

People who had lost their sight have regained the ability to read after receiving an innovative electronic eye implant paired with augmented-reality glasses, according to a clinical trial involving researchers from UCL (University College London) and Moorfields Eye Hospital.

Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the European trial reported that 84% of participants could once again recognize letters, numbers, and words using prosthetic vision in an eye that had previously gone blind due to geographic atrophy caused by dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a currently untreatable condition.

Participants treated with the device were able to read an average of five lines on a standard vision chart. Before surgery, several could not even distinguish the chart at all.

Breakthrough Study and Participants

The study enrolled 38 patients across 17 hospitals in five countries, testing a pioneering implant known as PRIMA. Moorfields Eye Hospital served as the only UK site. All participants had completely lost central vision in the treated eye before receiving the implant.

Dry AMD gradually destroys the light-sensitive cells of the macula, eroding central vision over time. In its advanced stage, called geographic atrophy (GA), the degeneration can lead to total blindness in the affected eye as the central macula deteriorates. Around 5 million people worldwide live with GA, for which no treatment currently exists. Those enrolled in the study retained only peripheral vision.

This implant is the first of its kind capable of restoring the ability to read letters, numbers, and words through an eye that had lost its sight.

A New Era of Artificial Vision

Mr. Mahi Muqit, associate professor at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and senior vitreoretinal consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital, led the UK arm of the trial. He said: ""In the history of artificial vision, this represents a new era. Blind patients are actually able to have meaningful central vision restoration, which has never been done before.

""Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence. The PRIMA chip operation can safely be performed by any trained vitreoretinal surgeon in under two hours -- that is key for allowing all blind patients to have access to this new medical therapy for GA in dry AMD.""

How the PRIMA Implant Works

The procedure begins with a vitrectomy, where the eye's vitreous gel is removed from between the lens and the retina. The surgeon then inserts a microchip shaped like a SIM card, only 2mm by 2mm, beneath the central retina through a small opening.

After surgery, patients use augmented-reality glasses equipped with a video camera linked to a pocket-sized computer with a zoom feature worn at the waist.

About a month after surgery, once the eye has healed, the implant is activated. The glasses' camera captures visual scenes and projects them as an infra-red beam across the chip. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the computer process this data and convert it into electrical signals, which travel through retinal and optic nerve cells to the brain. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing patients to perceive vision.

With training, patients learn to scan text using the glasses and adjust the zoom to read. Each participant underwent several months of rehabilitation to interpret these new signals and regain reading skills.

No participant experienced a decline in their remaining peripheral vision. The results pave the way for regulatory approval of the device and broader clinical use.

Patient Story: Seeing Words Again

Sheila Irvine, one of Moorfields' patients on the trial who was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, said: ""I wanted to take part in research to help future generations, and my optician suggested I get in touch with Moorfields. Before receiving the implant, it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.

""I was an avid bookworm, and I wanted that back. I was nervous, excited, all those things. There was no pain during the operation, but you're still aware of what's happening. It's a new way of looking through your eyes, and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter. It's not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up.

""The team at Moorfields has given me challenges, like 'Look at your prescription', which is always tiny. I like stretching myself, trying to look at the little writing on tins, doing crosswords.

""It's made a big difference. Reading takes you into another world, I'm definitely more optimistic now.""

The global trial was led by Dr. Frank Holz of the University of Bonn, with participants from the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.

The PRIMA System device used in this operation is being developed by Science Corporation (science.xyz), which develops brain-computer interfaces and neural engineering.

More About the Device

The device is a novel wireless subretinal photovoltaic implant paired with specialised glasses that project near-infrared light to the implant, which acts like a miniature solar panel.

It is 30 micrometers/microns (0.03mm) thick, about half the thickness of a human hair.

A zoom feature gives patients the ability to magnify letters. It is implanted in the subretinal layer, under the retinal cells that have died. Until the glasses and waistband computer are turned on, the implant has no visual stimulus or signal to pass through to the brain.

In addition to practicing their reading and attending regular training, patients on the trial were encouraged to explore ways of using the device. Sheila chose to learn to do puzzles and crosswords while one of the French patients used them to help navigate the Paris Metro -- both tasks being more complex than reading alone.

Further quotes from Mr. Mahi Muqit, UCL and Moorfields clinical researcher:

""My feeling is that the door is open for medical devices in this area, because there is no treatment currently licensed for dry AMD -- it doesn't exist.

""I think it's something that, in future, could be used to treat multiple eye conditions.

""The rehabilitation process is key to these devices. It's not like you're popping a chip in the eye and then you can see again. You need to learn to use this type of vision.

""These are elderly patients who were no longer able to read, write or recognize faces due to lost vision. They couldn't even see the vision chart before. They've gone from being in darkness to being able to start using their vision again, and studies have shown that reading is one of the things patients with progressive vision loss miss most.""

The timing of the biological onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unclear. We used high-throughput discovery proteomics and samples from presymptomatic patients with MS and matched healthy controls to define the biological neurological onset and characterize the mechanisms involved. Remarkably, evidence of myelin injury was seen ~7 years before the symptomatic onset and preceded evidence of axonal injury by ~1 year. By contrast, astrocyte involvement became evident only at clinical onset. Numerous changes in the serum proteome indicate the involvement of interleukin 3 and nuclear factor kappa B pathways during the presymptomatic stage. Furthermore, people with MS with a previously reported distinct autoantibody signature showed increased immune cell activity compared to those without. We propose a protein biomarker panel that may help distinguish presymptomatic patients with MS from healthy controls, pending validation in future studies. Our findings can help understand the pathophysiology of MS as well as the cascade of central nervous system injury and might facilitate early detection of MS in high-risk people.

Van der Waals heterostructures host many-body quantum phenomena that are tunable in situ using electrostatic gates. Their constituent two-dimensional materials and gates can naturally form plasmonic self-cavities, confining light in standing waves of current density due to finite-size effects. The plasmonic resonances of typical graphite gates fall in the gigahertz to terahertz range, corresponding to the same microelectronvolt to millielectronvolt energy scale as the phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures that they electrically control. This raises the possibility that the built-in cavity modes of graphite gates are relevant for shaping the low-energy physics of these heterostructures. However, probing these cavity-coupled electrodynamics is challenging as devices are notably smaller than the diffraction limit at the relevant wavelengths. Here we report on the intrinsic cavity conductivity of gate-tunable graphene heterostructures. As the carrier density is tuned, we observe coupling and spectral weight transfer between graphene and graphite plasmonic cavity modes in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We present an analytical model to describe the results and provide general principles for cavity design. Our findings show that intrinsic cavity effects are important for understanding the low-energy electrodynamics of van der Waals heterostructures and open a pathway for useful functionality through cavity control.

Many low-energy quantum phenomena have been observed in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, constructed by mechanically stacking and patterning exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) materials. Examples include superconductivity1, correlated insulating states2, polaritons3,4, 2D magnetism5 and both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects6,7. These effects are sensitive to their electromagnetic environment8 and can be tuned in situ using electrostatic gates, which control the material's carrier density and electronic structure. We show here that exfoliated flakes of 2D materials can also form plasmonic self-cavities, confining terahertz (or millelectronvolt) light in standing waves of current density in the subwavelength regime due to finite size effects9,10,11. The plasmonic resonances of prototypical graphite gates (in the range of 0.25–2.5 THz) coincidentally fall on the same energy scale of many predicted collective modes and energy gaps in vdW heterostructures (in the range of 0.1–10 meV)1,2,6,7,12. This raises the question: can discrete modes of light confined in a plasmonic graphite gate modify or control the electrodynamics of a vdW heterostructure?

Engineering the properties of quantum materials using the enhanced light–matter interaction provided by a cavity has gained traction as a route to new functionality13,14,15,16,17,18,19. When the cavity coupling strength g approaches the cavity resonance frequency ν0, collective matter modes, such as phonons, plasmons or magnons, are transformed into light–matter hybrids, whose formation can modify the macroscopic properties of the material itself13,14, even in the presence of dissipation20. As the interaction increases, the light–matter coupling becomes non-perturbative. In the ultrastrong coupling regime, defined as η = g/ν0 ≳ 0.1, few photon drives, or even only photon vacuum fluctuations, can create new thermodynamic ground states21,22. Pioneering experiments have demonstrated an enhancement of ferromagnetism23, shifts in the critical temperature of metal–insulator transitions24 and the modification of both integer25 and fractional26 quantum Hall states in an empty cavity—all achieved with relatively low cavity quality factors on the order of 5.

The phenomena found in vdW heterostructures reflect the weakly formed long-range order in two dimensions, and thus small perturbations by plasmonic cavity modes could tip the balance between two competing phases with qualitatively different macroscopic responses27. In addition, the low energy scale of the emergent physics should make it easier to enter the ultrastrong light–matter coupling regime18,21,22. VdW heterostructures, with their built-in plasmonic cavity modes, are therefore good candidates for developing and testing cavity control protocols. The first step to doing so is capturing their intrinsic cavity-coupled electrodynamics. This requires measuring the frequency-dependent, complex terahertz conductivity of a gate-tunable heterostructure assembly and understanding the manifestation of finite-size effects on the electrodynamics. This presents experimental challenges, as far-field spectroscopic tools cannot operate on subwavelength-sized samples, and local near-field probes do not measure the global conductivity.

On-chip terahertz spectroscopy is a technique for investigating the terahertz response of vdW heterostructures11,28,29,30,31. By confining terahertz light to the near-field in metallic transmission lines interfaced to these micrometre-sized materials, the discrepancy between the free-space terahertz wavelength and small sample size can be overcome. This approach has been used to measure gate voltage-dependent changes in transmitted terahertz fields, from which estimates of the sample conductivity have been made. However, probing the conductivity of self-cavity modes and their hybridization in vdW heterostructures has not been possible so far due to circuitry limitations and the lack of a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of finite-size effects on the terahertz response.

Here, we report on the cavity electrodynamics of gate-tunable vdW heterostructures by delivering a terahertz circuitry architecture and methodology for performing on-chip terahertz spectroscopy. We extracted the cavity conductivity of monolayer graphene heterostructures with graphite gates and found that plasmonic self-cavity modes form both in the graphene and graphite layers (Fig. 1). We observed distorted carrier-density dependencies of plasmon modes and spectral weight transfer from the graphite cavity mode to multiple graphene modes, demonstrating their hybridization. We quantified the normalized coupling strength of this hybridization as η = g/ν0 > 0.1, accessing the ultrastrong light–matter interaction regime. We developed an analytical theory that accounts for the geometry and dielectric environment of vdW heterostructures in their terahertz response, which reproduces the results of both numerical simulations and experimental data. This non-perturbative theory enables us to identify the coupling mechanism between two modes and provides generalizable design principles for enhancing or minimizing cavity coupling.

a, A schematic of a subwavelength-sized (W ≪ λTHz) vdW heterostructure consisting of a 2D material and a few-nanometre-thick graphite gate embedded in a micropatterned dielectric environment provided by a metallic transmission line. A plasmonic self-cavity mode of a 2D material (red), such as a graphene plasmon studied in this work, can hybridize with the plasmonic self-cavity mode of the graphite gate (blue). b, The frequency of the screened plasmonic mode in the 2D material (light-magenta line) is tuned with carrier density into resonance with the screened graphite mode, ν0 (light-blue line). The self-cavity modes of graphene and graphite hybridize due to coupling mediated by unscreened currents between the metal strips and an avoided crossing appears (Supplementary Section 0.9), with an energy splitting of twice the coupling strength, g. When η, the ratio of g/ν0, exceeds the value of 0.1, the system is in the ultrastrong coupling regime21,22.

We find that self-cavity and cavity-coupling effects are intrinsically present in vdW heterostructures. This indicates the need for determining how cavity modes affect the properties of vdW materials and raises the possibility of intentionally engineering cavities to control quantum phases. These results deliver a pathway to realize collective quantum phenomena and new functionality, such as Bose–Einstein condensation of plasmons32, polariton condensation33,34 or single photon detection in the terahertz regime35. By providing a chip-scale platform that enables contact-free measurements of the complex terahertz cavity conductivity of vdW heterostructures, deterministic tuning of light–matter interactions and spectral read-out of coupling strength, this work presents an experimental route for investigating and controlling vdW heterostructures via cavity dynamics.

The cavities reported here combine vdW heterostructure devices of typical dimensions of the order 10 × 10 μm2 interfaced with circuitry for performing on-chip terahertz spectroscopy10,36,37,38,39,40,41. Each cavity was constructed using a precision-cut graphite flake, encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and placed on a sapphire substrate (see Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1 for precise cavity dimensions, and Extended Data Fig. 2 for a micrograph of the device). The hBN preserves the intrinsic properties, such as high mobility, of the 2D material from the deleterious effect of the environment and electrically insulates it from the circuitry. This circuitry confines light to the near-field, where the (νλnear−field)/c ≪ 1 (c is the speed of light), and enables spectral readout from 0.05 to 1 THz (refs. 11,28,29), within the terahertz gap42. The circuitry features a symmetric terahertz antenna, which injects a single odd mode into the coplanar strip transmission lines43, a requirement for probing the pure in-plane conductivity44. The use of highly repeatable evaporated silicon switches enables the introduction of in situ referencing circuitry, allowing the simultaneous measurement of the time-domain cavity and reference terahertz pulses on separate transmission line arms (Fig. 2a,b). The Fourier transforms of the recorded time-domain signals were then used to calculate the transmission coefficient, which in turn was used for numerically computing the real and imaginary parts of the heterostructure's near-field optical conductivity, which we refer to as the cavity conductivity, plotted in Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2.

a, The circuit design for on-chip terahertz spectroscopy of vdW heterostructures: Two identical terahertz pulses (dark blue) are emitted from a voltage-biased terahertz antenna and coupled into two symmetric coplanar strip transmission line arms. The terahertz pulse interacts with the graphite cavity (dark → light blue) and is measured using a photoconductive switch triggered by a delayed probe beam on the left. The signal can be compared withthe reference signal measured on the detector on the right. b, Experimentally measured terahertz transients of a typical bare graphite plasmonic self-cavity (without an additional 2D material) and reference as a function of time delay. The detected cavity signal is notably modified as compared with the reference trace. c, Real and imaginary parts of the near-field cavity conductivity obtained from the data in b. d, Analytical theory simulation mapping where a plasmonic cavity or Drude response is expected as a function of σ2D and total sample width W (with equally spaced metal strips that make up the transmission line, and dhBN = 25 nm). hBN encapsulated vdW heterostructures typically fall in the cavity response regime due to finite-size effects, regardless of the presence of transmission lines. The boundary between regimes indicates where the measured cavity conductivity can be reliably fit with a Drude model (see Supplementary Fig. S18 for details). Cavity parameters (see also Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1): W0 = 1.9 μm (graphite width exceeding the metal strips), W1 = 3.55 μm (width of each metal trace) and W2 = 2.26 μm (width of the gap between strips), dgr = 16 nm (graphite thickness) and dhBN = 26 nm (hBN thickness).

The experimental bare graphite self-cavity response in Fig. 2c exhibits a resonance at ν0 that is described by a Lorentz oscillator model and results from the excitation of a 2D plasmonic standing wave, which is predominantly confined beneath the metallic strips that form the transmission line. The electric field of the terahertz pulse generates a current in the graphite (Supplementary Fig. 9) that reflects at discontinuities in the dielectric environment, particularly at the sample boundaries, forming a standing wave of current density (jm=0 in Fig. 2b, inset). The wavelength and thus finite momentum of the confined plasmonic resonance are determined by the geometry and dielectric environment of the heterostructure9,10,11,45,46 (Supplementary Fig. 14).

We developed an analytical model to describe the plasmonic modes of the cavity and their conductivity47, whose results match with both experiment and finite element numerical simulations that capture the full electromagnetic field propagation through the cavity48 (Supplementary Figs. 10, 11 and 20). The analytical model enables predictions of the terahertz conductivity of micropatterned vdW heterostructures, facilitating the design of cavity modes within a target spectral range. It further highlights that vdW heterostructures of typical dimensions (of less than 100 μm) and 2D conductivities σ2D exhibit cavity modes, in contrast to the far-field Drude response of metals (Fig. 2d). This insight underscores the need to incorporate the role of finite-size effects when interpreting on-chip terahertz spectroscopy data (Supplementary Section 0.5).

The terahertz circuitry and framework for understanding self-cavity effects offer multiple key functions. First, they enable contact-less, finite-momentum measurements of the complex cavity conductivity on the length-scales of typical vdW heterostructures, which are inaccessible with far-field techniques, local probes or photocurrent readout mechanisms42. The additional reference transmission line enables direct detection of the complex conductivity, an advancement over previous approaches that estimated conductivities by comparing gate-dependent changes in the transmitted terahertz field. Independent access to the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity, combined with an understanding of self-cavity effects, is necessary for measurements of parameters such as linewidths, mobilities and superfluid stiffness. In systems where electronic correlations shift spectral weight to high frequencies, the applicability of using Kramers–Kronig transformations of the absorption to extract complex quantities would be limited42. Finally, the metallic transmission lines provide sharp electrodynamic boundary conditions, breaking momentum conservation in a controllable manner that mediates the coupling between gate and sample plasmonic self-cavity modes, as elaborated below.

We investigated the behaviour of the plasmonic cavity modes of hBN-encapsulated graphene with an electrostatic graphite gate. We designed the device (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3) such that the graphite cavity resonance frequency was centred at approximately 1.13 THz, outside of the experimental spectral sensitivity range, to facilitate the spectral characterization of individual graphene plasmonic cavity modes (Fig. 3a). On-chip terahertz data taken at 20 K show that the transmission decreases as the sample reflectivity increases with increasing carrier density (Fig. 3b). In addition, time-domain oscillations appear, indicating a frequency-dependent optoelectronic response.

Cavity parameters for device 2: W0 = 2.0 μm, W1 = 2.80 μm and W2 = 1.91 μm, dgr = 17 nm, dhBN1 = 23 nm and dhBN2 = 91 nm.

The real (dissipative) part of the cavity conductivity of a gate-tunable monolayer heterostructure was calculated from the time-domain data in Fig. 3b (see Supplementary Fig. 3 for Fourier transforms). The results are plotted in Fig. 3c. At the lowest carrier density, close to charge neutrality, the cavity conductivity data grow slowly with increasing frequency. This is consistent with the expectation that charge neutral graphene is largely transparent to terahertz fields. Only the rising edge of the graphite plasmonic self-cavity resonance is captured, which peaks outside the experimentally accessible spectral range.

As the graphene becomes more conductive, three resonances appear on top of this background, which grow in amplitude and blueshift as the carrier density increases. This can be explained as the formation of plasmonic self-cavity modes in the graphene (jgraphene)9,10,11,49,50. Higher-frequency resonances, represented schematically in Fig. 3a, originate from higher-order plasmonic cavity modes. The labelling s = 0, 1, 2 corresponds to the number of nodes in the current density beneath each metal strip of the transmission line, as determined from finite element electromagnetic field simulations (Supplementary Fig. 8). The spectra in Fig. 3c were fit with a sum of Lorentzians to extract the linewidth and resonance frequency of each mode as a function of carrier density. A representative linewidth for the s = 2 mode at n = 2.85 × 1012 cm−2 corresponds to an electronic mean free path of approximately (9.1 ± 0.2) μm, roughly the width of the device (Supplementary Fig. 4). The quality factor is Q ≈ 5.7 ± 0.1, defined as Q ≈ νs=2/γs=2, where νs=2 is the resonance frequency and γs=2 is the linewidth. The scattering rate and quality factor are limited by device dimensions, illustrating that the graphene in the microstructured cavity exhibited ballistic transport, thereby achieving the highest possible quality factor for a device of this geometry in this frequency range.

In an uncoupled system and in the absence of electronic correlations, the carrier-density dependence of the resonance frequency is determined by the electronic band dispersion of the sample51. This can be monitored by tracking the resonance frequency extracted from fits as a function of carrier density n. We find that the s = 0 mode scales as ν ∝ n0.23±0.03, in good agreement with the expectation of a Dirac band structure, where 2D plasmons scale as ν ∝ n0.25 (ref. 51). However, the higher-order plasmon modes, s = 1, 2 scale as 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.11 ± 0.01, respectively.

To understand the suppressed power laws of the s = 1, 2 modes, we included the contribution from the graphene layer in our electromagnetic calculations (Supplementary Fig. 12). Figure 3d plots the results of the real part of the simulated cavity conductivity up to 1.5 THz, using similar linewidths as extracted in experiment. Three modes appear below 1 THz with good agreement to the experimental data. Examining the simulated conductivity outside of the experimental range shows that, when the graphene s = 3, 4 modes cross with the graphite self-cavity mode (Fig. 3d, dashed line), they hybridize and form avoided crossings, splitting into upper and lower polariton branches. The simulations reveal that, at high carrier densities, the observed s = 1, 2 modes also form lower branches of avoided crossings occurring at carrier densities outside of the experimentally accessible range. The experimentally detected, suppressed power-law behaviours of the graphene s = 1, 2 modes are thus a consequence of the hybridization of graphene and graphite plasmons (Supplementary Fig. 21).

Having demonstrated the role of hybridization in a device where resonances were well separated in frequency, we now turn to the observation of ultrastrong coupling between graphene and graphite plasmonic cavity modes within the experimental spectral sensitivity range. To enter this regime, we designed the heterostructure (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 4), using our analytical theory, such that four modes, the graphite cavity mode centred at 0.43 THz in addition to three graphene modes, s = 0, 1, 2, overlap in frequency within the experimental measurement range of the terahertz circuit. This was achieved by making both the graphite and the hBN between graphene and graphite thinner (Fig. 4a) as compared with the device in Fig. 3.

The graphene s = 2 mode couples in the ultrastrong regime to the graphite m = 0 mode inside the experimental spectral sensitivity range. b, Experimentally obtained real part of the near-field terahertz conductivity spectra of a selection of measured graphene carrier densities (Supplementary Fig. 5).

The ultrastrong coupling of graphene and graphite plasmonic self-cavity modes is indicated by the near-field carrier-density-dependent conductivity spectra, shown in Fig. 4b. We fit the spectra with a sum of four Lorentzians to capture the expected modes of the cavity (Supplementary Fig. 6). As the carrier density increases, all modes shift to higher frequencies. At a graphene carrier density of n = 0.5 × 1012 cm−2, the s = 2 mode becomes resonant with the m = 0 mode (Fig. 4b, dashed line). Rather than crossing in frequency, as would be expected given the different momenta of the m = 0 and s = 2 modes (Supplementary Figs. 13, 26 and 27), they hybridize and split. The spectral separation of these two modes at this carrier density corresponds to twice the coupling strength g, found to be (50 ± 5) GHz, corresponding to approximately 0.2 meV. Comparing this with the frequency of (0.43 ± 0.01) THz, which is approximately 1.8 meV, at which this coupling occurs, we obtained a normalized coupling strength of \({\eta }_{\exp }=0.12\pm 0.01\) characterizing this cavity as in the ultrastrong coupling regime (Supplementary Fig. 22).

The ultrastrong coupling between the graphene and graphite plasmonic self-cavity modes can be seen to modify the electrodynamic properties of the system. Tracking the resonance frequencies of the four modes as a function of carrier density (Fig. 4c) reveals that the lowest-order graphene mode s = 0 is again uncoupled from the cavity as it scales with νs=0 ∝ n0.24±0.01. However, the s = 1 and s = 2 modes are suppressed when compared with their uncoupled nature (Supplementary Fig. 22).

The spectral weight of each mode was calculated as the area of each Lorentzian shown in Fig. 4b and plotted as a function of carrier density in Fig. 4d. As the graphene becomes metallic, the spectral weight of the upper branch (purple) decreases, as the lower branch (magenta) increases in spectral weight. This stands in contrast to the expected spectral weight behaviour of graphene and graphite cavity modes in the absence of coupling, where the spectral weight of graphene modes should increase in amplitude and the cavity mode should only be weakly affected when the graphene carrier density n is increased (Supplementary Fig. 29). The large transfer in spectral weight across the avoided crossing is thus a consequence of the cavity coupling achieved.

The analytical model captures the carrier-density dependence and spectral weight trends of this device, as shown in the middle panel of Fig. 4c. The theory predicts ηtheory = 0.11 ± 0.05 (Fig. 4c, right), consistent with the experimental observation. The theory further shows that the broadening of the linewidths of the graphene plasmonic modes in device 3 compared with the narrow linewidths detected in device 2 can be attributed to hybridization of the currents in the graphene and graphite layers (Supplementary Fig. 19). The unexpected carrier-density scaling of the plasmon frequency, linewidth broadening and spectral weight transfer can thus be attributed to tunable, multimodal cavity coupling between the plasmonic modes of the graphite and graphene layers, which reach the ultrastrong coupling regime for the s = 2 mode (Supplementary Fig. 25).

While the devices highlighted in this work exhibited coupling between sample and graphite cavity modes, it would be useful to also be able to build cavities with negligible coupling such that the unperturbed electrodynamics of the sample can be interrogated. The analytical model developed as part of this work provides design principles to construct cavities which either minimize or maximize coupling strengths to either sense or control the terahertz electrodynamics of collective modes in microstructured quantum materials (Fig. 5).

a, A cavity with a small-gap transmission line and no extended sample regions behaves as a sensing tool, meaning the properties of a sample of interest can be probed without the additional influence of resonant cavity coupling to the graphite gate.

The theory predicts that a heterostructure built with a thick hBN, thick graphite gate and with a transmission line geometry patterned to cover all but a small gap between the traces (αW2 ≪ W1; Fig. 5a) minimizes the coupling between the graphene and graphite self-cavity modes (Fig. 5c). In such a device, momentum conservation is preserved and, thus, the graphite and 2D material plasmon modes are orthogonal to each other. Our theory and numerical simulations show that both the current density j and the spatial derivative, dj/dx, are approximately continuous throughout the device (Supplementary Fig. 23). As the terahertz spectroscopic platform introduced here is capable of independently capturing the complex uncoupled 2D material conductivity, which are necessary for extracting correlation-induced spectral weight shifts, measurements of a sensing cavity will provide insight into the dynamics of quantum materials52. For example, properties such as quasiparticle scattering rates, eigenfrequencies of collective modes, magnitudes of electronic energy gaps, and superfluid density can be extracted from the sensing cavity conductivity as a function of temperature, displacement and magnetic field, and carrier density.

By contrast, the ultrastrong coupling can be enhanced by patterning the dielectric environment (Fig. 5b). A plasmonic cavity built with increased conductor separation and additional vdW heterostructure widths outside of the transmission line maximizes the coupling between modes of different momenta (Supplementary Fig. 24), with predicted strengths of η > 0.18 (Fig. 5b,d,e). This is due to broken translational symmetry of this cavity design and, thus, broken momentum conservation. While discrete plasmonic cavity modes of 2D material and graphite gate are typically orthogonal to each other, the inhomogeneous dielectric environment allows the two cavity modes to spatially overlap and hybridize. Unscreened graphene plasmons are excited in the gap and mediate the coupling of the screened graphite and graphene plasmons. The relative widths of the metal strips to the widths of the unscreened regions provide a tuning knob for the coupling strength. Thus, the coupling can be controlled through the cavity geometry and carrier density, allowing for either probing (α ≪ 1) or controlling (α ≈ 1) quantum materials (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 29). The details of this coupling are captured by the analytical theory (Supplementary Figs. 26–29).

Our results show that terahertz cavity electrodynamics must be taken into account for vdW heterostructures of typical dimensions. As microstructured electrostatic gates and contacts in common vdW device architectures may break momentum conservation in a similar way to the metallic transmission lines used in this work, cavity-coupling effects in vdW heterostructures may even be relevant for understanding the emergence of quantum phases.

The platform developed here delivers a route to deterministic cavity control of vdW heterostructures. These advances in on-chip THz circuitry allow both the cavity coupling strength and spectral weight transfer to be probed under the same experimental conditions in which d.c. transport is measured. With this, the effects of cavity-mediated coupling on the ground state, as probed by transport, could be experimentally related to the cavity hybridization, as probed by terahertz measurements. Moreover, the subwavelength nature and broken symmetries in these microstructured self-cavities could enable hybridizing and probing a variety of collective modes. With this strategy, these devices provide a platform for both spectroscopic characterization and cavity-based control of emergent properties in vdW heterostructures.

Graphene monolayers, few-nanometre-thick graphite and hBN crystals (15–100 nm) were obtained by mechanical exfoliation onto silicon substrates with a 285-nm SiO2 layer. Thicknesses, morphology and cleanliness of the exfoliated 2D crystals were characterized with an atomic force microscope. Atomic force microscope anodic oxidation lithography was used to cut graphene and graphite flakes into well-defined shapes53. Subsequently, the heterostructures were fabricated in ambient conditions by the dry-transfer technique using propylene carbonate stamps. The fully assembled heterostructures were transferred to a sapphire substrate (1 × 1 cm2, 2 mm thick, c-cut, two-side epi-polished), which has a nearly constant dielectric function (ϵ ≈ 10) over the relevant gigahertz-to-terahertz frequency band. Optical lithography (LOR-7B and ma-P 1205) and reactive ion etching (O2 and SF6) were used to precisely define the shape of the cavity and create clean sample edges. After the cavity was shaped, edge contacts (7 nm Cr and 40–100 nm Au) were patterned by optical lithography and e-beam evaporation. Finally, the optoelectronic circuitry was fabricated in two steps. First, three silicon (α-Si) patches were evaporated to form the terahertz antenna and photoconductive detector switches. Second, the metallic leads to the terahertz antenna and the two coplanar strip transmission lines for the reference and cavity side were fabricated. The transmission lines have a conductor–gap–conductor geometry of approximately 3–3–3 μm and consist of a titanium (10 nm) and gold (275 nm) layer.

The geometric dimensions of the bare graphite cavity discussed in Fig. 2 (device 1), the graphene cavity discussed in Fig. 3 (device 2) and the ultrastrongly coupled graphene cavity discussed in Fig. 4 (device 3) were obtained by optical and atomic force microscopy and are defined in Extended Data Fig. 1 and listed in Extended Data Table 1. The error bars for the flake thickness measurements are approximately 0.5 nm, and for the transmission line and cavity width measurements approximately 10 nm. The widths W0 of the cavity region extending the transmission line (Extended Data Fig. 1) vary slightly along the length axis of the cavity and are slightly asymmetric between the left and right sides. The values for W0 given in Extended Data Table 1 are averaged values that are used for the analytical theory simulations. The full three-dimensional electromagnetic simulations discussed below use actual flake shapes, including varying W0 and l, obtained from the optical micrographs shown in Extended Data Figs. 2, 3 and 4.

The geometric parameters used in the analytical theory simulations of the sensing cavity (Fig. 5c) and the ultrastrongly coupled cavity (Fig. 5d) are given in Extended Data Table 1.

The measurement set-up is built around a Yb-based femtosecond laser (Spirit HE 1040-16) which provides pulses at a central wavelength of 1,040 nm and full width at half maximum of 310 fs at a repetition rate of 200 kHz. For more efficient operation of the photoconductive switches, the 1,040-nm pulses were frequency-doubled in a thin beta barium borate crystal to generate green 520-nm light. This green light was split into two paths, one for terahertz generation and the other for terahertz detection. The beam for terahertz generation was intensity modulated by an acousto-optic modulator that sent every second pulse onto the chip. The beam for detection was routed through two different optical delay lines: a translation stage and a fast optical delay line (scanDelay from APE). The latter was used for terahertz measurements to generate a time delay of up to 50 ps between generation and detection pulses at a scanning frequency of 2 Hz. After the delay lines, the detection beam was split into two for detecting the cavity and reference side of the optoelectronic circuitry. All three beams were coupled in a microscope assembly and focused onto the different photoconductive switches. The microscope provided an optical image of the device and was used for active alignment stabilization.

The sample was mounted in a continuous-flow optical cryostat (ST500 from Janis), and all measurements were performed at a base temperature of 7–20 K. Currents generated by the photoconductive detector switches were collected by home-built transimpedance amplifiers (2 × 108 V A−1, 100 kHz bandwidth) and the generated voltage signal was demodulated by a lock-in amplifier at the frequency of the intensity modulation of the terahertz generation (100 kHz). The lock-in output was digitized by a data acquisition card and synchronized to the fast optical delay line (2 Hz) to recover the terahertz signal.

Today's best artificial intelligence (AI) models sail through the Turing test, a famous thought experiment that asks whether a computer can pass as a human by interacting via text.

Some see an upgraded test as a necessary benchmark for progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) — an ambiguous term used by many technology firms to mean an AI system with the resourcefulness to match any human cognitive ability. But at an event at London's Royal Society on 2 October, several researchers said that the Turing test should be scrapped altogether, and that developers should instead focus on evaluating AI safety and building specific capabilities that could be of benefit to the public.

“Let's figure out the kind of AI we want, and test for those things instead,” said Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. In focusing on “this march towards AGI, I think we're really limiting our imaginations about what kind of systems we might want — and, more importantly, what kinds of systems we really don't want — in our society”.

The event was organized to mark the 75-year anniversary of the publication of British mathematician Alan Turing's seminal paper describing the test, which he called the imitation game. Addressing the philosophically gnarly question of whether machines can think1, the test involves a series of short, text-based conversations between a judge and either a human or a computer. To win, the machine must convince the judge that it is human.

The meeting's low-hype approach to machine intelligence proved popular. At the oversubscribed event, speaker Gary Marcus was introduced by Peter Gabriel, the frontman of the rock band Genesis, and, as a personal friend of Marcus, Matrix star Laurence Fishburne had a spot in the audience. More than 1,000 people also watched the event online.

“The idea of AGI might not even be the right goal, at least not now,” said Marcus, a neuroscientist at New York University in New York City, during one of the keynote addresses. Some of the best AI models are highly specialized, such as AlphaFold, Google DeepMind's protein-structure predictor, he said. “It does a single thing. It does not try to write sonnets,” he said.

Turing's playful thought experiment has often been used as a gauge of machine intelligence, but it was never meant as a serious or practical test, said Sarah Dillon, a literature researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, who studies the mathematician's works.

Some of today's most capable AI systems are refined versions of large language models (LLMs) that predict text on the basis of associations made in learning from internet data. In March, researchers tested four chatbots in a version of the Turing test, and found that the best models passed.

Yet the fact that chatbots can imitate speech credibly does not mean that they can understand, said several researchers at the event. Although LLM responses can be uncannily human, “when you go outside the box of what you normally ask of these systems, they have a lot of trouble,” said Marcus. As examples, he cited the inability of some models to label the parts on an elephant correctly, or to draw clock hands in anywhere but the ten and two positions. For this reason, models could still fail the Turing test if they are challenged by a scientist who knows their weaknesses.

Still, the rapid improvement of LLM-based systems in a broad range of areas, especially reasoning tasks, has prompted speculation about whether machines will soon reach human-level performance on cognitive tests. To chart AI's growing capabilities, and to capture non-language-based skills, researchers have sought to construct harder tests. One of the most recent is the second version of the puzzle-based Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for AGI (ARC-AGI-2), which is supposed to assess an AI's ability to adapt efficiently to new problems. Such tests are often framed as milestones on the route to general intelligence, but researchers don't agree on any one benchmark for achieving AGI.

Living systems transform their shapes via reversible formation of macromolecular structural complexes, leading to deformations at localized sites. Here we report DNA–inorganic flower-shaped crystals with inscribed deformation modes that enable flowers to shrink and bend reversibly. Template-independent DNA polymerization of pH-responsive and inert blocks tune the hierarchical assembly and spatial localization of DNA within flowers. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that reversible, pH-triggered folding of intraflower DNA strands drives reconfiguration of flowers. By contrast, the subflower localization of these contractile DNA motifs dictates the mode of shape change. As microscale flowers close and open, their nanoscale crystal organization changes reversibly, suggesting that mechanical metamorphosis of flowers is transduced across multiple organizational length scales. The adaptability of flowers to environmental changes activates cascaded biocatalytic reactions and reveals gel-encrypted information. Further variation of the DNA polymer sequence, its subcrystal localization and its reversible folding advances a new class of organic–inorganic shape-shifters.

(a) Representative images of polyN (mixed bases), polyA, polyC, and polyT DNA-inorganic crystals at ranging polymerization times (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hr) and their respective DNA lengths. [Blue shading indicates flower-shaped crystals shown in main Fig. 1; unshaded area indicates immature crystals]. Scale bars, 2 μm, and identical for images in the same column. Flowers emerge when the DNA strands lengthen to 650 bases, (see magnified SEM images in b, scale bars, 1 μm) and form in a kinetics that follow T>C>A>N, matching the kinetics of enzyme polymerization (shown in c). (c) Agarose gel electrophoresis of polyT, polyC, polyA and polyN. The primers/initiators and monomers ratio is I:M = 1:1000. (d) Control crystal growth experiments show that purley inorganic Co2PPi crystals (I-II) grow after 24 hours upon mixing Na4PPi and CoCl2 (1000 μM), while DNA-templated inorganic crystals emerge at as early as 1 hr with poly T (in a). Mixing pre-polymerized DNA (>650 bases) with cobalt and pyrophosphate (III-IV) accelerates flower formation, but not as much as in situ DNA polymerization and hybrid DNA-inorganic crystallization. Scale bars, 2 μm.

Source data

Circular dichroism spectra of C flowers (solid lines) compared to T flowers (dashed lines) at (a) varying pH and (b) after 24 hr polymerization. C(8) at pH 7 (light green) shows random coil with a positive band at 275 nm, while C(24) at pH 7 (dark green) shows i-motif signatures of a positive band at 286 nm and negative band at 265 nm signal, suggesting that C flowers show more i-motif folding as the polymerization progresses. However, switching the C(8) from pH 7 to pH 5 shows a transition to i-motif. T(2) to T(24) shows a shift from a positive peak at 273 nm to 278 nm and a negative peak from 248 nm to 252 nm, suggesting a stronger B-form-like character as T polymerization progresses. Moreover, switching T(2) from pH 7 to pH 5 continues to show B-form-like bands. (c) Schematics of a single-stranded polyC with 650 bases at neutral pH with an estimated length of ~420 nm, calculated using 0.63-0.67 nm per base30,31,32,33. At acidic pH, if we estimate that 10 bases of C form an i-motif with stretches of 10 unpaired bases in between, and using ~0.83 nm per width of i-motif and ~0.63-0.67 nm per base in the 10-base ssDNA stretches, the estimated folded i-motif strand for 650 bases is ~240 nm. Insets show schematic representations of fully formed and partially folded i-motif structures and the corresponding chemical structure of the protonated base-pairing of cytosine bases.

Source data

Enzymatic curves from GOx- and HRP-loaded TC (a) and CT (b) flowers compared to free GOx and HRP in solution. Reactions were run in 1X PBS with 0.5 nM GOX, 0.5 nM HRP, 10 mM glucose, and 2 mM ABTS. DNA flowers at 0.05 nM were used. (c) Enzymatic rates of the catalytic cascade within flowers (and controls). Enzymatic rates were calculated from the first 30 min (green bars and points) and 30-60 min after switching to pH 5 (red bars and points) or keeping the sample at pH 7 (white points) (all ****p < 0.0001). Monitoring the enzymatic efficiency of these constructs at neutral pH (flowers open) showed that the T(GOx)C(HRP) flowers had the highest rate among combinations/cases [free enzymes, free flowers, the mixture of free flowers and enzymes, enzymes encapsulated in T-flowers “T(GOx+HRP)”, enzymes encapsulated in C- flowers “C(GOx+HRP)”, the mixture of T(GOx+HRP) and C(GOx+HRP) flowers, etc]. The on/off switch of the cascade reaction was confirmed by monitoring the efficiency at acidic pH (flower closed). Bars show the mean of n = 4 reactions per sample, and statistics were calculated with an ordinary two-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism. (d) The fold change in reaction rates during reaction cycles for the catalytic cascade (and the control). To determine the fold change of reaction rate, the rate of each “ON” was compared to the “ON” rate of free enzymes in solution for that cycle (the mixture of free enzymes GOx+HRP). Interestingly, reversing the order of the DNA layers [C(GOx)T(HRP) flowers] did not result in a sizeable improvement when undergoing pH cycles. This highlights the crucial role of bending versus shrinking in facilitating the enzymatic cascade reactions and providing switchable activity. n = 4 separate assays taken from one batch of flowers.

Surgically severing part of the brain can send the area into a deep sleep.Credit: Peter Cade/Getty

Slow, sleep-like brain waves persist in part of the brain that has been surgically disconnected from the rest of the organ even though the person is awake. The findings1, published in PLoS Biology, add to researchers' understanding of what conscious and unconscious brain states look like.

Children with severe epilepsy who do not respond to medication can undergo a surgical procedure called a hemispherotomy. During surgery, clinicians disconnect the part of the brain in which seizures originate from the rest of the brain, stopping them from spreading. The disconnected tissue is left in the skull and has an intact blood supply.

The team wanted to find out whether the disconnected part has some form of awareness — or was capable of exhibiting consciousness, says co-author Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiology researcher at the University of Milan in Italy. “The question arises because we have no access” to the disconnected region, he says, adding that it was unclear what happens once part of the brain is isolated.

Studies investigating consciousness are difficult because there is no consensus on what conscious and unconscious states in the brain look like, says Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “There's no generally accepted definitive signatures of consciousness in terms of electrical readings or brain activity,” he adds.

Even defining unconsciousness is challenging, because activities associated with consciousness, such as remembering dreams, can occur during states associated with unconsciousness, such as sleep or anaesthesia, Massimini says.

Researchers in Italy, Australia and the United Kingdom examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) — a test that measures electrical activity in the brain — from ten awake children before they had a hemispherotomy and between six months and three years after the procedure. They compared the recordings with a database of EEGs from children with typical brains that were taken while they were awake or asleep.

They found that the electrical activity slowed in the disconnected region after surgery, whereas activity in the intact brain did not change. The EEG of the intact region was also similar to EEGs from control children who were awake. After surgery, the disconnected region became dominated by slow rhythms called delta waves and was similar to EEGs taken while control children were in deep sleep.

The slow pattern persists for months or years after surgery. Massimini says this finding raises questions about its function. The pattern has also been observed in injured parts of the brain among awake people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury. It could be protective, involved in maintaining a stable environment in the brain or helping the brain adapt to injury, he says.

A polarized debate in biomedical research is pitting those who favour ‘traditional animal models' — meaning living non-human mammals, such as mice, that are used to investigate human disease mechanisms, responses to treatments and so on — against proponents of various experimental approaches collectively termed NAMs.

NAMs, short for ‘new approach methodologies' or ‘novel alternative methods', include in vitro models, such as organoids grown from stem cells or other cells, that are designed to mimic the properties of human organs or tissues1; computational (in silico) modelling approaches that predict how biological systems respond to drugs or other perturbations2; and chemical (in chemico) techniques that assess how biological molecules interact outside an organism or cell3.

NAMs could markedly accelerate progress in drug discovery, toxicology and disease modelling. They could also lessen the need for animal testing, which is ethically problematic for many people. But framing NAMs as innovative disrupters and ‘traditional animal models' as outdated holdovers — as many are now doing — oversimplifies a reality that is much more nuanced. Worse, it is distracting researchers from considering the scientific, ethical and translational issues related to both types of approach.

As a clinically trained veterinarian and biomedical scientist, I have been using mouse models to try to understand human genetic diseases for more than 20 years. The principles driving the development of NAMs are not new. For decades, researchers have been using tools, such as human induced pluripotent stem cells, to garner information relevant to humans and to lessen the need for animal testing. What's brought all this to the fore are major technological advances in NAMs and a push by regulators and funders globally for the expanded use of these methods in research.

But instead of asking whether ‘to NAM or not to NAM?' when considering the use of anything as a research model, the question should be: ‘Does the model I am using faithfully represent the biological system I am studying?'

NAMs and animal models offer distinct, often complementary insights into the workings of complex in vivo biological systems. For well-defined, narrow applications, such as in toxicology, or when researchers are wanting to assess a specific biological process or disease mechanism at the molecular, chemical, cellular or organ level, NAMs are proving highly useful. Currently, however, no NAM can model how a specific gene functions in a person, how an organ or the entire body works or how a disease progresses.

All models — whether they are NAMs or inbred mice — should be updated, refined or replaced as tools and data emerge that allow researchers to better match models to the human system they are trying to investigate.

Experimental technologies, such as the gene-editing tool4 CRISPR–Cas9, have made it easier for researchers to design animal models that more faithfully recapitulate human biological processes or phenomena. Targeted genome editing in mice5, for instance, has shown how some human genes have different effects in men and women6, and how some have different effects at different life stages7. It has also uncovered cases of genetic pleiotropy, in which a single gene influences multiple traits8,9. Future advances will probably improve animal models even further.

Moreover, for all models, the quality and usefulness of the information generated will depend on a host of factors that are extraneous to the model itself.

NAMs are increasingly being touted as a solution for the limited translatability of findings from preclinical research to the clinic10. On average, 86% of drug candidates fail in clinical trials10, and some of these failures have been linked to the use of animal models11.

But problems with translatability can stem from factors other than the physiological differences between species12,13. For instance, the disease models could have been oversimplified, or the group sizes made too small, or the animals being tested might not have been assigned to the treatment groups in a sufficiently random manner. Many of these issues could apply equally to studies involving NAMs.

A massive cloud outage stemming from Amazon Web Services' key US-EAST-1 region, its hub in northern Virginia, near the US Capitol, caused widespread disruptions of websites and platforms around the world on Monday morning. Amazon's main ecommerce platform and other properties, including Ring doorbells and the Alexa smart assistant, suffered interruptions and outages throughout the morning, as did Meta's communication platform WhatsApp, OpenAI's ChatGPT, PayPal's Venmo payment platform, multiple web services from Epic Games, multiple British government sites, and many others.

The outages stemmed from Amazon's DynamoDB database application programming interfaces in US-EAST-1, and AWS said in status updates that the problem was specifically related to DNS resolution issues. The “domain name system” is a foundational internet service that essentially acts as an automatic phonebook lookup to translate web URLs like www.wired.com into numeric server IP addresses so web browsers show users the right content. DNS resolution issues occur when DNS servers aren't accurately connecting these dots and, to keep with the phonebook analogy, are providing the wrong numbers for a given name, or vice versa.

“Based on our investigation, the issue appears to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-EAST-1,” AWS wrote in status updates on Monday. Shortly after, the company added: “If you are still experiencing an issue resolving the DynamoDB service endpoints in US-EAST-1, we recommend flushing your DNS caches.”

An AWS spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked for details about the nature of the failure. DNS resolution issues can be malicious—known as DNS hijacking—but there is no indication that Monday's AWS outages were nefarious.

“When the system couldn't correctly resolve which server to connect to, cascading failures took down services across the internet,” says Davi Ottenheimer, a longtime security operations and compliance manager and a vice president at the data infrastructure company Inrupt. “Today's AWS outage is a classic availability problem, and we need to start seeing it more as data integrity failure.”

Problems began around 3 am ET. By 5:22 am, AWS had applied “initial mitigations” that were starting to take effect. At 6:35 am, Amazon said that it had fully addressed the underlying technical issues but that “some services will have a backlog of work to work through, which may take additional time to fully process.”

AWS has suffered other large-scale outages, including a major incident in 2023. Reliance on central cloud services from giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Services has, in may ways, improved cybersecurity and stability around the world by creating a baseline of guardrails and best practices for all customers. But this standardization comes with major trade-offs, because the platforms become a single point of failure for large swaths of critical services.

“Failures increasingly trace to integrity,” Ottenheimer says. “Corrupted data, failed validation or, in this case, broken name resolution that poisoned every downstream dependency. Until we better understand and protect integrity, our total focus on uptime is an illusion.”

In the early 2010s, nearly every STEM-savvy college-bound kid heard the same advice: Learn to code. Python was the new Latin. Computer science was the ticket to a stable, well-paid, future-proof life.

But in 2025, the glow has dimmed. “Learn to code” now sounds a little like “learn shorthand.” Teenagers still want jobs in tech, but they no longer see a single path to get there. AI seems poised to snatch up coding jobs, and there aren't a plethora of AP classes in vibe coding. Their teachers are scrambling to keep up.

“There's a move from taking as much computer science as you can to now trying to get in as many statistics courses” as possible, says Benjamin Rubenstein, an assistant principal at New York's Manhattan Village Academy. Rubenstein has spent 20 years in New York City classrooms, long enough to watch the “STEM pipeline” morph into a network of branching paths instead of one straight line. For his students, studying stats feels more practical.

Forty years ago, students inspired by NASA dreamed of becoming physicists or engineers. Twenty years after that, the allure of jobs at Google or other tech giants sent them into computer science. Now, their ambitions are shaped by AI, leading them away from the stuff AI can do (coding) and toward the stuff it still struggles with. As the number of kids seeking computer science degrees falters, STEM-minded high schoolers are looking at fields that blend computing with analysis, interpretation, and data.

Rubenstein still requires every student to take computer science before graduation, “so they can understand what's going on behind the scenes.” But his school's math department now pairs data literacy with purpose: an Applied Mathematics class where students analyze New York Police Department data to propose policy changes, and an Ethnomathematics course linking math to culture and identity. “We don't want math to feel disconnected from real life,” he says.

It's a small but telling shift—one that, Rubenstein says, isn't happening in isolation. After a long boom, universities are seeing the computer-science surge cool. The number of computer science, computer engineering, and information degrees awarded in the 2023–2024 academic year in the US and Canada fell by about 5.5 percent from the previous year, according to a survey by the nonprofit Computing Research Association.

At the high school level, the appetite for data is visible. AP Statistics logged 264,262 exam registrations in 2024, making it one of the most-requested AP tests, per Education Week. AP computer-science exams still draw big numbers—175,261 students took AP Computer Science Principles, and 98,136 took AP Computer Science A in 2024—but the signal is clear: Data literacy now sits alongside coding, not beneath it.

“Students who see themselves as STEM people will pursue whatever they think makes them a commodity, something valued in the workplace,” Rubenstein says. “The workplace can basically shift education if it wants to by saying, ‘Here's what we need from students.' K–12 will follow suit.”

Amid all this, AI's rise leaves teachers in a difficult position. They're trying to prepare students for a future defined by machine learning while managing how easily those same tools can short-circuit the learning process.

Yet Rubenstein believes AI could become a genuine ally for STEM educators, not a replacement. He imagines classrooms where algorithms help teachers identify which students grasp a concept and which need more time, or suggest data projects aligned with a student's interests—ways to make learning more individualized and applied.

It's part of the same shift he's seen in his students: a move toward learning how to interpret and use technology, not just build it. Other educators are starting to think along similar lines, exploring how AI tools might strengthen data literacy or expand access to personalized STEM instruction.

At the University of Georgia, science education researcher Xiaoming Zhai is already testing what that could look like. His team builds what he calls “multi-agent classroom systems,” AI assistants that interact with teachers and students to model the process of scientific inquiry.

Zhai's projects test a new kind of literacy: not just how to use AI but how to think with it. He tells the story of a visiting scholar who had never written a line of code yet used generative AI to build a functioning science simulation.

“The bar for coding has been lowered,” he says. “The real skill now is integrating AI with your own discipline.”

Zhai believes AI shouldn't be treated as an amalgamation of STEM disciplines but as part of its core. The next generation of scientists, he says, will use algorithms the way their predecessors used microscopes—to detect patterns, test ideas, and push the boundaries of what can be known. Coding is no longer the frontier; the real skill is learning how to interpret and collaborate with machine intelligence. As chair of a national committee on AI in science education, Zhai is pushing to make that shift explicit, urging schools to teach students to harness AI's precision while staying alert to its blind spots.

“AI can do some work humans can't,” he says, “but it also fails spectacularly outside its training data. We don't want students who think AI can do everything or who fear it completely. We want them to use it responsibly.”

That balance between fluency and skepticism, ambition and identity, is quietly rewriting what STEM means in schools like Rubenstein's. Computer-science classes aren't going away, but they're sharing the stage with forensics electives, science-fiction labs and data-ethics debates.

“Students can't think of things as compartmentalized anymore,” Rubenstein says. “You need multiple disciplines to make good decisions.”

AI isn't coming—it's here. Today's STEM students aren't fighting it; they're learning to read it, question it, and use it. The new skill isn't coding the machine, but understanding its logic well enough to steer it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Zohran Mamdani, the Internet's Mayor","https://www.wired.com/story/the-big-interview-podcast-zohran-mamdani/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Zohran Mamdani is, quite literally, everywhere.

The 34-year-old New York state assemblyman, who in recent months has ascended from relative political anonymity to become the presumptive winner of New York City's November mayoral race, has already graced the covers of Time, New York, Vanity Fair, and The Nation, among other publications. He's sparred with newscasters on CNN and Fox News, riffed with Stephen Colbert, and bantered like his life depended on it with the hosts of The View.

Mamdani's ubiquity didn't start with print pages or broadcast interviews. Much of that conventional media exposure, and Mamdani's growing celebrity, is a collective byproduct of one single element of his mayoral campaign: a really, really good social strategy. One of Mamdani's first viral videos, a 2024 supercut of short conversations between the assemblyman and New York–based Trump voters, laid the groundwork for a subsequent mayoral campaign built on clever, conversational clips. See: Very Cold Mamdani, emerging from a polar plunge in the Atlantic Ocean with a vow to freeze rent on rent-stabilized apartments. See also: Sneakers Mamdani, walking the length of Manhattan to advocate for accessible politicians; Citi Bike Mamdani, responding to a bystander's howl of “Communist” before pedaling off as cameras roll; or Red Rose Mamdani, spoofing The Bachelor while wooing New Yorkers with promises of an equitable future. Yes, the #ZaddyZohran TikTok hashtag is nearly as prolific as the candidate who inspires it.

But as Mamdani acknowledged during a recent sit-down at his campaign's spartan Manhattan headquarters, his outsized ubiquity also has its downsides: There's the ire of President Trump, who has denounced Mamdani as “a 100% Communist lunatic,” threatened to arrest him, and, should the front-runner topple Andrew Cuomo in November, deploy the National Guard to New York City. Then there's the risk of violence against Mamdani or his campaign staff; it's a concern that increased markedly following the recent assassination of far-right activist Charlie Kirk, and, for Mamdani, means “I'm never alone now.”

But for someone as everywhere as Mamdani, hunkering down in the secure confines of an office can only last so long. Forty-five minutes, to be exact, before our interview concludes and Mamdani (security detail in tow) gamely joins WIRED's photographers on a bustling Manhattan street, posing inside a yellow cab and walking to and fro on the sidewalk. It would be an understatement to say that passersby took note. They did take selfies—at least five in fewer than 10 minutes. They also took campaign materials, seemingly so inspired by a mere glimpse of Zaddy Zohran that they were compelled to join his 80,000-strong army of volunteers. And, in typical New York fashion, they did all of this with no semblance of personal shame, screaming Mamdani's name from the open windows of office towers and cars; hooting at him from across the street and down the block.

It remains to be seen whether Mamdani as mayor can satisfy these starstruck locals, along with his thousands of volunteers and hundreds of thousands of presumed voters—not to mention the many millions more following along online. For now, Mamdani is embracing the life of a newly minted internet darling. After one last wave has been proffered, to a particularly loud fan shouting from a window across the street, the candidate and his team duck back inside their nondescript office building. Up the elevators and, presumably, on to the next interview.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: We always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. Are you ready?

ZOHRAN MAMDANI: I'm ready.

What is your screen time average in a given week? Don't lie to me. It's too early in the interview for that.

I'm gonna be honest, I haven't looked at it, but mostly out of fear of what it could be.

It's extremely elevated.

Elevated is a very kind word.

What is your internet guilty pleasure?

TikTok.

Same.

It's been quite concerning. Now, a lot of my algorithm is AI videos of Jake Paul speaking Punjabi.

Sounds like quite a guilty pleasure to me. If you could design one civic app for New Yorkers, what would it do?

I'd say an app that distills how to vote, where to vote, all the information that you need on voting, because there's still a lot of New Yorkers that don't know the general election is coming up. They have early voting starting. They have the voter registration deadline on October 25. It should be one simple place to go.

You would think, wouldn't you?

I feel that way about a lot of politics.

You met your wife on Hinge. Any tips?

Continue to have hope.

Just to be clear, I am married.

[Laughs] OK.

But for anyone else, you say, “Have hope.”

I wish you a happy marriage.

We're doing great. Thank you. What is one tech tool that you actually find helpful in your day-to-day work? What do you use?

It's very old-fashioned, but my alarm is very useful. I could not function without that alarm.

What time were you up this morning?

I was up at 7:30 am.

Oh, not too early.

Yeah, every now and then you get one of those.

Is technology making democracy stronger or weaker?

I think in its current use, weaker. But I don't think that's an innate aspect of technology.

If you could have dinner with any tech founder, living or dead, who would it be?

I would like to have dinner with Huge Ma. He created something called TurboVax, which was a portal that took publicly accessible information about vaccine appointments and made it much easier for New Yorkers to actually sign up at the peak of Covid. As an elected official, I was recommending to my own constituents that they not use the government website to find their appointments and find where they could actually get a test. I recommended they use TurboVax instead.

Kudos to you for not saying Steve Jobs, because that's what most people go for. OK, let's jump in—before you were an extremely online mayoral candidate, before you were a state assembly member, a community organizer, you were a kid, and you were a kid who grew up with the internet. Can you talk a little bit about some of your formative digital experiences? Were you an early adopter?

My parents didn't let me watch TV on weekdays. I have a distinct memory of the beginning of Hulu, where you could watch TV on your computer, and thoroughly enjoying the loophole that created for my young childhood. “Early adopter” I think would be giving myself a little too much credit. But I played quite a few computer games, especially FIFA, SimCity, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Championship Manager, which then became Football Manager. That kind of introduced me to the world of chat rooms around games, things like that.

At least some of those seem relevant to your future political aspirations.

I also have my memories of the birth of iTunes and the free song of the week, and having an iPod. Before that, having a jog-proof Sony Walkman.

These were some of the memories that kind of informed the way I saw technology in the world.

In college you organized for Palestine, and you continued to do organizing work after that. I'm curious about how you approached digital activism as opposed to IRL activism and interaction. Is one approach better for achieving certain goals? Did you see them working in tandem?

I think, to be honest with you, that the digital aspect was quite underdeveloped at that time. It was a part of it, but it was more kind of perfunctory than it was adding a distinct utility to the way in which we organized. Even in high school, my sense of politics was Facebook wall debates going back and forth.

You know, people are still having them.

Wishing them the best.

Yeah, me too.

In college I stopped using Facebook for a few years. I would only keep an account to keep the Bowdoin [Students for Justice in Palestine] Facebook page going. It rarely, if ever, transformed the world that we were actually living in.

Sure.

It was just a way to share information. I'm sure we'll talk about this more, but the most exciting part of this campaign, as it pertains to social media, has been the use of it to not only reflect the world that we live in, but to also transform that same world. That was something that I had not arrived at in my early years.

Like all of us who grew up online, you have a digital footprint. Much of which has been picked over. It's been used to make fun of you. It's been used to attack you. I read a piece over the weekend that quoted some experts saying anyone running for mayor should really scrub their digital profile. Did you?

Clearly not?

Clearly not.

Can you believe if I did? The worst scrub of all time.

Do you fire whoever was responsible for that? Do you ever wish you had? Do you ever wish that less of you as a 21-year-old was out there now that you're running for mayor of New York City?

You know, I haven't spent too much time on it. Frankly I think too much of politics has become artificial, has become the creation of a self that is actually divorced from the way in which you grew up in the world. Actually being able to show who you've been over a period of time, the growth, the consistency, all of these things at the same time, I think, is also something that reflects what many people go through in and outside of politics. Yet within politics, it's almost as if we want to create a snapshot of who you are in this moment, and tell people to extrapolate it.

That's who you've always been.

Who you've always been.

One of your earliest videos was you talking to Trump supporters about their vote. Obviously, the campaign on social media has been a meteoric success. It has been one of the foundational stories of this entire campaign. But take us back in time, back to before you were even polling at 1 percent. Where did that social media campaign come from?

It's funny you mentioned the 1 percent because we were recently looking at that poll and I was quite literally tied with “Someone Else.” Not even a name.

Oh, it literally was “Someone Else”?

All the candidates. Then me, tied with Someone Else.

Literally. Anybody else? Anyone else.

Shout out to Someone Else. We beat you, man.

Yeah. Good for them.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at a mayoral debate in New York on October 16, 2025.

By the time I ran for state assembly, especially with congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's run in 2018 and the way in which her launch video so captivated people and distilled her politics into something that could be shared with everyone, the idea of having a launch video for social media was becoming more and more well established. There was a moment soon after my election where we started to think about what it could look like to use videos in a non-electoral capacity, to use them in a legislative advocacy capacity to try and take that same kind of approach as if it was a campaign.

Mm-hmm.

One of those approaches was with the campaign we started called Fix the MTA. We made this big launch video with this duo called Melted Solids, who continue to work on the campaign today. It's this launch video that looks to speak about the MTA and distill the three key ways that we were going to transform the MTA.

If I look back at it, it didn't reach that many people. But it was this moment in which we thought there could be more than just the approach and the model that we've seen. Since then, there have been a number of other politicians who continue to utilize these mediums in different and innovative ways. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most clear examples. City Council member Chi Ossé was someone who was also using short-form media, built for TikTok and Instagram. It was really taking issues that would previously only be of concern to those pre-existingly plugged into the politics of this city and making it of a far larger interest.

As we were thinking about all that, I had a meeting with Anthony, who's one member of the duo, with Deb, of Melted Solids. We met at Pye Boat Noodle in Astoria, just by where I live. I was talking to him about wanting this campaign to be one that didn't just better the other candidates in terms of our use of digital, but really owned that medium and tried to do something different in the manner in which we used it and investing in it early at a level that I think most consultants would tell us was not the right move to make. Yet we decided we're gonna make two highly produced videos every month, and we're gonna supplement that with our own videos that we take with an iPhone here and there.

You've executed a lot of very fun stunts on social media during this campaign. Do you have a favorite? Do you have one that was the most fun, that you think was the most effective?

One of the first ones that really broke through was when I did the Polar Bear plunge.

It's very unpleasant to watch.

It was very, very cold. I think specifically shooting the rest of that video after I'm out of the water, just dripping cold …

Oh yeah.

… trying to speak about the nine mayoral appointees on the rent guidelines board. That was quite fun. It was quite literally me and Andrew Epstein, who ran our entire comms operation for the primary and now is running our entire digital operation for the general, and his iPhone. It's me in a $30 suit from the thrift store on Steinway. Deb from Melted Solids helped cut it. It became one of the most watched things we put out. And it cost us such little money. It cost us far more in terms of invention. I think also a willingness, frankly, to put yourself out there in all different kinds of ways. Many of which are embarrassing.

Speaking of embarrassing, your opponents. Namely, New York mayor Eric Adams before he dropped out. Andrew Cuomo. They have made valiant efforts to find the same success on social media that you have found. What's it been like to watch that?

What I like about Eric Adams' approach to social media is it's distinct to Eric Adams. You wouldn't confuse his video for mine. It's not an imitation of my video. It's very much Eric Adams.

It sure is.

I mean, the one where he's getting stuff done, but he doesn't seem to do anything …

Right.

… is incredible.

He is making a smoothie at 9:00 am but it's 11:00 …

But the clock behind …

… is incredible.

I could not script that. My favorite one of his is the one with the Michael Bay–Linkin Park meme.

Yes.

“What I've Done.” And it's like “POV: You're the mayor,” but it's on him. So it's either a misuse of POV …

… or a bold new format. Exactly.

I did start listening to “What I've Done” by Linkin Park a lot after watching that video. I do credit the mayor for that.

Andrew Cuomo's use of social media, it feels a little more of a reflection of, I just got beat by a guy who uses social media, so let's try and get this show on the road.

There you go.

I do miss the half-cut sleeves that he had in the relaunch video.

Bring those back, Andrew. You still have time.

Please.

One of the consequences of your approach on social media, I would argue, is its own success. You are extremely famous online, which in the year 2025 means you are just famous, right? My family lives in Canada, they all know I'm interviewing you today. You are known to millions of people outside of New York City, outside of even this country. Outside of the voters you are courting. How have you had to adapt to that level of notoriety?

I think there are some logistical adaptations. You'll see we make a lot more videos in this office now.

Sure.

Part of that is just because we don't have enough time to make them outside anymore because of what making them outside means now. And part of that is a beautiful thing where people are stopping you and saying hello, because one of our many hopes from the beginning of this campaign was that we could break out of this bubble.

What I've really been overjoyed by is the blossoming of the video team that we have. There's a real tendency when you're successful with something to just continue to do that again and again and again. I have a very bad habit with food where if I like one dish, I'll just eat it until I'm sick of it.

Mm-hmm.

What's been so lovely is to work with a team whose hunger is undimmed by the success of that initial format. It would be very easy to just continue to make direct-to-cameras every single day. But they have the inventiveness of How do we stay consistent with our message, but continue to reinvent the medium and the way in which we're using this? That's something that is both exciting and also necessary as part of our political project. We cannot rest on our laurels.

You've been on the cover of Time magazine and New York magazine, among others. You've done The Late Show, The View, CNN, MSNBC. I'm here from WIRED. We are the third Condé Nast publication to publish an interview in the last month. I have to imagine the editor-in-chief of Glamour is somewhere outside. Do you worry about overexposure?

I don't really think about it. I defer to my comms team to decide on questions of exposure or overexposure.

Assuming that you take office, how does your use of social media change? What does it look like to go from campaigning on social media to governing and thinking about these platforms as tools of governance rather than tools to galvanize an electorate?

Well, I'm gonna make the Adams videos.

Well, obviously. You're clearly inspired.

It's POV. You're the mayor of New York City. I'm getting stuff done. I'm gonna get the clock …

… and it just always says 11:00.

Yeah, it's just always 11. He has left us a model.

We'll kind of wrestle with it, but I think social media is often discussed as a way in which you can escape the world. What's been exciting is to be part of a team that's looking to use it as a way to tell the stories of that world and then to transform it. The use of the medium has allowed us to build a campaign that now has more than 85,000 volunteers, so many of whom first engaged with the campaign through a video that they saw, or a tweet, or a photo.

We recently put out a request for submissions for a sticker, and we had hundreds of artists send in their submissions. We had thousands of people vote on them. The other day the winning artist came into the office, and it was so lovely to meet this man and get a sense of who he was, the design that he made. None of this would've been possible without social media.

Mm-hmm.

Our scavenger hunt brought together about 5,000 people or so from across New York City with a premise that we just shared online. Now here they were in person.

The other day I was at a paper-shredding event that we had in the Bronx, and a woman came over to me and she was confiding in me about an issue that her parents were facing. At the end of her telling me her story, she mentioned that she first met me at the scavenger hunt. These are the ways in which social media can actually transform the world around us.

Right.

That's why I don't think that there's an innate positive or negative with social media; it depends on how you use these tools. In governing, it has to continue to be a tool that speaks to as many New Yorkers as possible, because today so many more New Yorkers are getting their news or their sense of self, or their sense of their city, from the social media that they use. To ignore that is to ignore reality. So we have to be not only present there, but we have to be thinking about how do we treat these forms of media with the seriousness and the legitimacy that they deserve?

I don't think you can divorce the political approach to social media from the political approach to young people. There's so often a condescension about both the medium and the people themselves. That it doesn't require that kind of time and study and approach, when in fact it requires just as much if not more. If you show that, then people are willing to engage with you. If you just treat young people as you would anyone else with the same concerns, the same stakes, the same consequences.

If you prep for that Instagram video in the way that you would for a print media interview, you'll see that there is the possibility of reaching far more people.

New York City mayoral candidate, Democratic Zohran Mamdani, leaves NBC Studios after the debate with independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa in New York on October 16, 2025.

You talked about shooting more videos in the office as opposed to out on the sidewalk for good reason. You are extremely visible. You are a person of color, you are a self-described Democratic socialist. You're Muslim. You hold values and positions, whether on Gaza or the LGBTQIA community, that are anathema to large segments of this country.

I don't need to tell you that political violence has risen in this country, markedly in recent years. You've been yelled at on the street, you've been on the receiving end of death threats. So has your staff. I'm curious, particularly following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, have you thought differently about your safety and your exposure? How do you think about the risk of violence? How does that change your campaign? How does it change, ultimately, what that means for you as mayor?

I haven't let it change the way in which I move through the city that I love. I have to also take every precaution, not only for myself, but frankly for my staff and the team that are around me, because these threats that are being made, they're not just threats on myself, as you've said, they're threats on my team, and the fact is that I'm never alone now.

So if there is a threat to me, it's also to those who are in my immediate proximity. There are things that I used to do that were instinctual, you know? If I just missed the train, I would hop on a Citi Bike and bike as fast as I could to the meeting. Now I have a detail with me. Now I have a team around me.

Now it also just means a little bit more of a negotiation and intentional planning around the use of whatever means by which I'm getting around this city.

But that just means you have to take that extra time. It doesn't mean that you stop taking the train, you stop biking, you stop taking the bus. I think the way that you move around the city, it influences the way in which you see the city. Too often if you're riding around only in a car with tinted windows, the only New Yorker you might see is a reflection of yourself.

Right.

That is part of what leads to politicians who do not engage with the public in the manner that they should. My not only hope and dream, but my commitment, is to live in the city as New Yorkers live in it. To take the train, to take the bus, to ride a bike. You will not feel the pain of the slowest buses in the United States until you ride that bus.

You know, me sitting on the M57, going 4.9 miles an hour to a press conference, is a great reminder to myself and everyone around me as to why we're fighting to make buses fast and free. I think these are the kinds of reminders you need. So that you don't get separated from the people that you're actually looking to serve.

A big area of focus for WIRED this year has been documenting the relationship between leaders in the tech industry and President Trump. Some of those same leaders are people who are not thrilled about the prospect of you as New York's mayor. Why do you think technology leaders—and I use that a little bit as a proxy for business leaders writ large—have moved so far to the right? How do you bring them back?

I had a number of meetings over the summer, and have continued to, with business leaders, and there was one week where I had a meeting with the Partnership for New York City, hundreds of top CEOs, and the next day I had a meeting with those specifically within the tech sector. One thing that I found fascinating in that meeting with the tech sector is that there are a lot of parallels in the ethos that drives that sector, and the kind of politics that we espouse. An ethos where you are hungry, you are unwilling to accept a status quo, and you are interested in both innovating, and frankly disrupting, the style of the politics or the business approach that you see in front of you.

I think that, to me, has provided a real building block for a number of the relationships we've been building over these last few months with a number of leaders within the tech industry because we are looking to bring excellence into public service and to build upon the excellence that exists and also to deliver that which has been denied. Part of that means looking at the current state of city government and reckoning with that which has failed.

Mm-hmm.

It is sad, to say the least, that we have allowed the language of efficiency and fraud and waste to become bywords of right-wing politics or Elon Musk's DOGE, when in fact any progressive politics worth its salt—that's focused on working people—has to be concerned with the quality of life for those same working people, with the efficiency of the services you're delivering to them, with the fact that there cannot be any tolerance for fraud or waste in the pursuit of delivering those services.

I think that opens up the possibility of working together on a number of these things. I've been honestly surprised in the openness that many have had. Now, there will be some who oppose this campaign. Absolutely. Sure. But I will always leave the door open to anyone and everyone to both explain the positions that I have, and also to make clear that my vision of success for this city is a success where everyone stays and that includes business leaders. That includes the workers who are working at those businesses and that there's room for others to join us.

You've been asked a lot about ICE, and the National Guard coming into New York City. In the last few weeks, Apple and Google have been on the receiving end of a lot of coverage because they have taken down several ICE-tracking apps. These are apps in their stores that allow individuals to notify their communities when ICE is spotted in a given neighborhood. The Trump administration has been very vocal in their disapproval of this kind of product. What do you make of that decision by these tech companies?

I think it's the wrong decision, and I think what we're seeing across this country is the terrorizing of people, and it's not simply something that is happening in cities far off from the one that we're sitting in.

I spoke to a pastor in East Flatbush who told me about a congregant approaching him after services and saying that she'd been served a deportation order.

She had no one to go with her to 26 Federal Plaza. He went with her for the hearing with the judge. The judge asked her in this hearing, “Are you wearing the clothes that you are ready to leave in? Have you told your family you'll be deported today?” And she starts to break down crying.

Over the course of the hearing, the judge decides to, in fact, provide her with [Temporary Protected Status] protections, but the ICE agents outside do not care, and so the pastor has to send some of the Court Watch activists outside to distract those agents. Send another person who's there to run to grab the elevator, and then takes this woman under his arm and runs her into the elevator, smuggling her out of a federal building for her own safety.

That's what ICE is in the city and across this country. Whether we're talking about a priest standing outside of an ICE facility being shot with a beanbag in the head, or whether we're talking about the ways in which people are being treated all in the name of law enforcement.

It is a betrayal of those very words. There is a clear need for everyone across this country to both understand the authoritarianism that we are seeing and use every single tool we have to ensure that we're standing up for everyone.

WIRED is ostensibly optimistic about the future. Your campaign has been very optimistic. I would argue, as WIRED's editor in chief, that optimism in this moment looks a little bit different than it did a few years ago. Optimism to me right now is, maybe the National Guard doesn't invade New York City. What does optimism look like to you right now?

I think it means not losing sight of the examples of a better world that we see each and every day. There is an immense amount of work to do to build the world that we deserve, but we'd be doing it a disservice if we didn't see the ingredients of it around us already. Even amidst these horrific acts of cruelty, you will see New Yorkers—you will see Americans—show that which we wish were reflected on a far larger scale, show that which we wish were embedded within the structures of politics of this country.

Those are the opportunities for us to build something new. Amidst all of the talk of New Yorkers being people who have no time for others, I also find that we are a kind people. We are people in a rush, we have places to go. But in the same subway station that you'll find in violation of ADA compliance, you will see a New Yorker who is trying to help a young mother carry her stroller down the stairs. You will see a New Yorker looking to help others in those moments where structures have failed them. I think those are the examples I hold onto as ones that can actually deliver us to the world that we want.

Fast forward to November. You've won the mayoral election. What's your first post?

I'm very tempted to say the Eric Adams video, POV you're the mayor.

You leave us with those parting words.

It could be, as we say, inshallah.

We may find out.

Thank you, Linkin Park.

At the end of August, the AI company Anthropic announced that its chatbot Claude wouldn't help anyone build a nuclear weapon. According to Anthropic, it had partnered with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to make sure Claude wouldn't spill nuclear secrets.

The manufacture of nuclear weapons is both a precise science and a solved problem. A lot of the information about America's most advanced nuclear weapons is Top Secret, but the original nuclear science is 80 years old. North Korea proved that a dedicated country with an interest in acquiring the bomb can do it, and it didn't need a chatbot's help.

How, exactly, did the US government work with an AI company to make sure a chatbot wasn't spilling sensitive nuclear secrets? And also: Was there ever a danger of a chatbot helping someone build a nuke in the first place?

The answer to the first question is that it used Amazon. The answer to the second question is complicated.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers Top Secret cloud services to government clients where they can store sensitive and classified information. The DOE already had several of these servers when it started to work with Anthropic.

“We deployed a then-frontier version of Claude in a Top Secret environment so that the NNSA could systematically test whether AI models could create or exacerbate nuclear risks,” Marina Favaro, who oversees National Security Policy & Partnerships at Anthropic tells WIRED. “Since then, the NNSA has been red-teaming successive Claude models in their secure cloud environment and providing us with feedback.”

The NNSA red-teaming process—meaning, testing for weaknesses—helped Anthropic and America's nuclear scientists develop a proactive solution for chatbot-assisted nuclear programs. Together, they “codeveloped a nuclear classifier, which you can think of like a sophisticated filter for AI conversations,” Favaro says. “We built it using a list developed by the NNSA of nuclear risk indicators, specific topics, and technical details that help us identify when a conversation might be veering into harmful territory. The list itself is controlled but not classified, which is crucial, because it means our technical staff and other companies can implement it.”

Favaro says it took months of tweaking and testing to get the classifier working. “It catches concerning conversations without flagging legitimate discussions about nuclear energy or medical isotopes,” she says.

Wendin Smith, the NNSA's administrator and deputy undersecretary for counterterrorism and counterproliferation, tells WIRED that “the emergence of [AI]-enabled technologies has profoundly shifted the national security space. NNSA's authoritative expertise in radiological and nuclear security places us in a unique position to aid in the deployment of tools that guard against potential risk in these domains, and that enables us to execute our mission more efficiently and effectively.”

Both NNSA and Anthropic were vague about the “potential risks in these domains,” and it's unclear how helpful Claude or any other chatbot would be in the construction of a nuclear weapon.

“I don't dismiss these concerns, I think they are worth taking seriously,” Oliver Stephenson, an AI expert at the Federation of American Scientists, tells WIRED. “I don't think the models in their current iteration are incredibly worrying in most cases, but I do think we don't know where they'll be in five years time … and it's worth being prudent about that fact.”

Stephenson points out that much is hidden behind a barrier of classification, so it's hard to know what impact Anthropic's classifier has had. “There is a lot of detail in the design of implosion lenses that go around the nuclear core,” Stephenson says. “You need to structure them very precisely to perfectly compress the core to get a high yield explosion … I could imagine that being the kind of thing where AI could help synthesize information from a bunch of different physics papers, a bunch of different publications on nuclear weapons.”

Still, he says, AI companies should be more specific when they talk about safety. “When Anthropic puts out stuff like this, I'd like to see them talking in a little more detail about the risk model they're really worried about,” he says. “It is good to see collaboration between AI companies and the government, but there is always the danger with classification that you put a lot of trust into people determining what goes into those classifiers.”

For Heidy Khlaaf, the chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute with a background in nuclear safety, Anthropic's promise that Claude won't help someone build a nuke is both a magic trick and security theater. She says that a large language model like Claude is only as good as its training data. And if Claude never had access to nuclear secrets to begin with, then the classifier is moot.

“If the NNSA probed a model which was not trained on sensitive nuclear material, then their results are not an indication that their probing prompts were comprehensive, but that the model likely did not contain the data or training to demonstrate any sufficient nuclear capabilities,” Khlaaf tells WIRED. “To then use this inconclusive result along with common nuclear knowledge to build a classifier for nuclear ‘risk indicators' would be quite insufficient and a long way from legal and technical definitions of nuclear safeguarding.”

Khlaaf adds that this kind of announcement fuels speculation about capabilities that chatbots don't have. “This work seems to be relying on an unsubstantiated assumption that Antrophic's models will produce emergent nuclear capabilities without further training, and that is simply not aligned with the available science,” she says.

Anthropic disagrees. “A lot of our safety work is focused on proactively building safety systems that can identify future risks and mitigate against them,” an Anthropic spokesperson tells WIRED. “This classifier is an example of that. Our work with NNSA allows us to do the appropriate risk assessments and create safeguards that prevent potential misuse of our models.”

Khlaaf was also less excited about the partnership between the US government and a private AI company. Companies like Anthropic are hungry for training data, and she sees the US government's broader rush to embrace AI as an opportunity for the AI industry to acquire data it couldn't get elsewhere. “Do we want these private corporations that are largely unregulated to have access to that incredibly sensitive national security data?” she says. “Whether you're talking about military systems, nuclear weapons, or even nuclear energy.”

And then there's the precision. “These are precise sciences, and we know that large language models have failure modes in which they're unable to even do the most basic mathematics,” Khlaaf says. In 1954, a math error tripled the yield of a nuclear weapon the US tested in the Pacific Ocean, and the government is still dealing with the literal fallout. What might happen if a chatbot did nuclear weapons math wrong and a human didn't double check its work?

To Anthropic's credit, it says it doesn't want a future where people are using chatbots to play around with nuclear weapons science. It's even offering its classifier to any other AI company that wants it. “In our ideal world, this becomes a voluntary industry standard, a shared safety practice that everyone adopts,” Favaro says. “This would require a small technical investment, and it could meaningfully reduce risks in a sensitive national security domain.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The FTC Is Disappearing Blog Posts About AI Published During Lina Khan's Tenure","https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-removes-blog-posts-about-ai-authored-by-by-lina-khan/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

In late July 2024, Lina Khan, then the chair of the US Federal Trade Commission, gave a speech at an event hosted by the San Francisco startup accelerator Y Combinator in which she positioned herself as an advocate for open source artificial intelligence.

The event took place as California lawmakers were considering a landmark bill called SB 1047 that would have imposed new testing and safety requirements on AI companies. Critics of the legislation, which was later vetoed by California governor Gavin Newsom, argued it would hamper the development and release of open source AI models. Khan called for a less restrictive approach and said that, with open models available to them, “smaller players can bring their ideas to market.”

In the days leading up to the event, Khan's staff published a blog on the agency's website emphasizing similar talking points. The piece noted that “open source” had been used to describe AI models with a variety of different characteristics. The authors instead suggested adopting the term “open-weight,” meaning a model that has its training weights released publicly, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, or reuse it.

The Trump administration has since removed that blog post, two sources familiar with the matter tell WIRED. The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine shows that the July 10, 2024, FTC blog titled “On Open-Weights Foundation Models” was redirected on September 1 of this year to a landing page for the FTC's Office of Technology.

Another post from October 2023 titled “Consumers Are Voicing Concerns About AI,” authored by two FTC technologists, now similarly redirects back to the agency's Office of Technology landing page. According to the Wayback Machine, the redirect occurred in late August of this year.

A third FTC post about AI that was authored by Khan's staff and published on January 3, 2025, titled “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm,” now leads to an error screen that says “Page not found.” According to the Wayback Machine, that blog post was still live on the FTC's website as of August 12, but by August 15 it had been removed from the internet. In the original post, Khan's staff had written that the agency was “increasingly taking note of AI's potential for real-world instances of harm—from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.”

It's not clear why the blog posts were removed from the internet. An FTC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Khan, through a spokesperson, declined to comment.

Former FTC public affairs director Douglas Farrar tells WIRED he was especially surprised that the open weights blog was removed, given the agency's role as a key AI market regulator. “I was shocked to see the Ferguson FTC be so out of line with the Trump White House on this signal to the market,” he says, referring to newly appointed FTC chair Andrew Ferguson.

The Trump administration's AI Action Plan from July argues that “we need to ensure America has leading open models founded on American values” and “the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models.” (The FTC did not respond to questions about whether these deletions represent a shift in policy.)

Several advisers working for the Trump administration on technology issues, including David Sacks, special adviser to the White House on AI and crypto, and Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy adviser to the White House on AI, have also advocated for open source AI, framing it as a critical means for the US to maintain its technological dominance.

Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, the FTC has removed hundreds of blogs and business guidance for the tech industry published during Khan's tenure, WIRED previously reported.

In March, the FTC removed some 300 posts related to AI, consumer protection, and the agency's lawsuits against tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. One post titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” offered guidance to tech companies about how to avoid building deceptive AI chatbots. The blog post had won an award from the Aspen Institute in 2023 for its accessible descriptions of artificial intelligence.

An FTC source told WIRED in March that removing public blog posts “raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act,” which require government agencies to preserve records that have administrative, legal, or historical value and make them accessible to the public. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership placed “warning” labels on business directives and other guidance published during previous administrations that it disagreed with.

More than 200 posts and statements authored by Khan herself were still available on the FTC's website at the time of publication. This includes a September 2024 blog on enforcement actions the agency took against allegedly deceptive AI schemes, a 2024 joint statement from the FTC and other groups on competition in the market for generative AI foundation models, and remarks from a 2023 roundtable on generative AI, in which Khan said the agency was “looking closely at how AI can turbocharge fraud” and “entrench the dominance of the firms that control necessary raw inputs,” among other harms.

Matas Buzelis was in a situation every professional basketball player dreads.

In a recent game, Buzelis, the 6′ 10′′, 20-year-old small forward entering his second season with the Chicago Bulls, came down on another player's foot after leaping. This sickening scenario often means an ankle injury is about to occur, especially for players like Buzelis with a lengthy history of them dating back to his high school years.

“I felt my ankle starting to go,” Buzelis recalls via email.

And then … it didn't. Buzelis played on. And he gives the credit to a new ankle protection technology currently spreading around the NBA.

Buzelis is one of a number of NBA players who, in the last few years, have begun using “adaptive” ankle brace tech from a company called Betterguards. The new approach to ankle protection is headlined by a seat-belt-like “locking” mechanism around the outside of the ankle, combined with a level of fit and comfort that's previously been impossible to achieve with bulky ankle braces. The company touts impressive numbers for both ankle injury prevention and recovery scenarios, claiming over two thirds of the NBA's teams have ordered BetterGuards for their players.

They've got NBA trainers excited, too—so much so that Betterguards and the National Basketball Athletic Training Association recently partnered up. The NBA will be an incubator of sorts, allowing some of the world's best athletes to have a direct hand (foot?) in improving this still-young technology. The eventual goal is to make a real dent in one of the most common injuries not just in basketball, but in the broader sport and general populations—and perhaps to eventually apply similar sorts of technology to other common injuries.

“You could fill up Madison Square Garden 10 times a week with the number of ankle injuries in the US alone,” proclaims Betterguards CEO and managing director Tony Verutti.

He's right, or at least close. WebMD estimates an average of 25,000 Americans sprain their ankle every day (MSG's capacity is around 20,000). Either way, the point stands.

These injuries are an even more acute issue in the NBA. One study found that 33 percent of all NBA players sustained an ankle injury during a recent five-year period, 55 percent of which led to absences of between two and 10 games. Injury tracking site Hashtag Basketball lists ankle sprains as the single most common malady in the league in the past 15 years. Innovations in ankle injury prevention have been few and far between despite their prevalence, with most of the industry still focused around bulky braces or tape- and sleeve-based products that offer limited protection.

Vinzenz Bichler, Betterguards founder and current chief innovation officer, grew weary of the limited orthotics and support options after breaking his ankle three separate times over a decade ago. As a bioscience student in Berlin, he knew there had to be a more adaptable way to brace the ankle. Over a period of years, Bichler and a growing team of biomechanical engineers, scientists, and researchers designed and continually refined what they now call their “ankle stabilizer” product. A finalist appearance at the 2022 iteration of NBA Launchpad, a yearly event highlighting emerging basketball tech, really put BetterGuards on the map.

The ankle stabilizer functions like an artificial lateral ankle ligament, but with a crucial difference in the world of ankle injuries: It reacts faster than the human body.

Multiple studies indicate it takes our brains between 80 and 170 milliseconds to recognize an ankle beginning to roll, often much too late to react and prevent injury. But Betterguards claims its stabilizer reacts in 22 to 32 milliseconds, commonly fast enough to stop a sprain or a more serious injury.

“As [Betterguards will] tell you, let's create a seat belt for the ankle,” says Barnett Frank, director of performance science for the Utah Jazz. Frank, known as one of the NBA's most tech-forward trainers, is centrally involved with the NBATA's Betterguards incubator program.

It's a common line from BetterGuards proponents and the company itself, and it's easy to see why. A car's seat belt typically has plenty of give when pulled slowly and deliberately; yank it suddenly, though, and it locks up.

The same concept applies to the ankle stabilizer, which uses what the company calls “micro-hydraulic” material that's designed to remain flexible during most basic athlete movements. But if the ankle suddenly begins to turn, the stabilizer (also called a “check ring”) locks into place.

The stabilizer inside the brace.

Betterguards claims this approach yields 40 percent better protection than traditional ankle braces and tape, and does so without impacting other parts of the body.

“A lot of braces that are really rigid, it will move the force to the knee or to the hip,” Verutti says, an effect that simply relocates the injury risk.

Betterguards was involved in multiple studies to validate that its brace isn't causing the same issue. (Multiple NBA trainers surveyed for this story said that while they don't necessarily doubt this research, they'd like to see more to confirm it.)

The real kicker, though, is the stabilizer's ability to provide that protection without sacrificing comfort, something prior ankle brace products mostly failed at.

“I always hated ankle braces, because a lot of the braces I tried before were really stiff and bulky,” Buzelis says. “BetterGuards are totally different. They really feel more like a sock when you're wearing them … I can cut, jump, move side to side, and do everything I need to do out there without feeling restricted.”

Buzelis says he's worn the brace for every practice and game since even before entering the NBA. He recommended them to multiple teammates, including Bulls point guard Josh Giddey, who also became a user. The list of notable NBA players using them also includes brothers Franz and Mo Wagner, Austin Reaves, Aaron Nesmith, Jalen Johnson, and TJ McConnell.

The brace is often worn by players recovering from an ankle injury. Again, it replaces the rigidity of previous braces, which Verutti says hurt the recovery process.

“It actually makes the ankle weaker,” he says, claiming that well over half of all people with ankle injuries suffer residual problems within 18 months as a result. “What you need is movement. That's what's strengthening all of your ancillary ligaments and tendons.”

Recent research seems to support Verutti's claim, showing a faster return-to-play timeline for athletes using BetterGuards compared with a control group. In a league like the NBA, results like that have a tangible financial value.

“Ankle sprains are the number one time-loss injury in the NBA every year,” says Eric Waters, director of player health and performance for the Chicago Bulls. Waters says several Bulls players, including Buzelis, are big fans of BetterGuards. “You're saving, for us, millions and millions of dollars of games lost to injuries.”

Frank and Waters are among several team trainers with multiple players who use the products regularly. Through the incubator program, they've entered into a sort of feedback loop with the company, which offers rapid prototyping from a new manufacturing facility in Croatia. When a player requests a tweak, they can test out a revised product within a week or two. Players and trainers get all the benefits of this new approach to ankle protection; Betterguards gets a population of elite athletes to offer feedback on its products.

The ultimate goal, for both the company and several NBA trainers, is to help this tech become more recognizable and accessible at every level of sport and activity, from the best basketball players in the world to your everyday trail runner.

Trainers surveyed for this story think the ankle might be only the beginning. Perhaps a brace could be created to stop hyperextension of the knee with a similar check ring approach. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL, better known as the Tommy John ligament) have become an epidemic in Major League Baseball in recent years; Waters hypothesizes a sleeve could use the same kind of mechanism to protect pitchers. He even mentions the Achilles tear, arguably the most severe semi-common injury across all sports. The NBA had a league-record seven such injuries last season, prompting commissioner Adam Silver to announce a convened panel of experts to probe the injury.

Waters explains that Achilles tears typically take place during a “false step” planting of the foot at a steep angle athletes typically don't reach. Combined with enough force, the Achilles can rupture. “If you can attenuate the force a certain amount of newton-pounds at the end ranges, you could potentially prevent Achilles tears,” he says.

CEOs of companies at this stage often make grand proclamations regarding future plans, and Verutti plays the part to a degree.

“My goal is to make this a piece of nonnegotiable sports equipment,” he says. “You put it on with your socks and shoes.”

In this case, though, it's the people outside the company banging the drum loudest for the technology's future potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","An AI Read My Angry, Threatening Email. Its Response Was a Game Changer.","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/an-ai-read-my-angry-threatening-email-its-response-was-a-game-changer-179967.html?rss=1","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:10:31 GMT","

A recent experience fundamentally changed my relationship with artificial intelligence (AI), transforming it from a novel curiosity into an indispensable professional tool.

Like many business disputes, it began with a letter from an attorney. The letter was misleading, accusatory, and, in my view, defamatory. My reaction was instantaneous and visceral: I was furious. I immediately sat down and hammered out a response, channeling all my indignation into a multi-page, point-by-point rebuttal that was technically accurate but dripping with sarcasm and anger. I felt a fleeting sense of satisfaction and was ready to hit “send.”

Thankfully, a cooler head — a digital one — prevailed. On a whim, I opened Google's Gemini Pro. I first fed it the attorney's letter and asked for a dispassionate analysis of its strategy and potential weaknesses. Then, I uploaded my own angry draft and asked for a critique.

The AI's response was a splash of cold water. It politely pointed out that while my arguments were valid, my tone was inflammatory, and my judgment was clearly clouded by emotion. My letter, Gemini explained, would not de-escalate the situation or lead to my desired outcome. Instead, it would almost certainly provoke an equally aggressive response that could lock me into a costly and draining legal battle.

Then, I gave Gemini a new prompt: “Acting as a senior legal strategist, rewrite my response to be powerful, firm, and professional, with the primary goal of resolving this dispute quickly and favorably.”

The letter it produced was a revelation. The AI was concise, surgically precise, and devoid of emotion. It dismantled the other party's position not with sarcasm, but with calm, irrefutable logic. The result was a far more powerful and effective document than anything I could have written in my emotional state. It was a stark lesson: AI, used correctly, isn't just a tool for generating content; it's a tool for enhancing judgment.

Let's talk about how AI can steady our decisions under pressure, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld game console.

My experience is a microcosm of the revolutionary potential AI holds for improving nearly every aspect of professional work. The key is to stop thinking of it as a magic answer machine and start treating it as a team of incredibly fast, infinitely patient, and entirely unemotional advisors and assistants.

For correspondence, AI is a game-changer. Before sending any important email or letter, you can use it as a tone-checker and strategist. Prompts like, “Review this email for clarity and tone. Is it professional? Is it likely to achieve my goal of [state your goal]?” can provide invaluable feedback, catching phrases that might be unintentionally ambiguous or aggressive.

For preparing papers and reports, AI is the most powerful research assistant ever created. It can help you brainstorm outlines, summarize dense academic papers or financial reports, and identify potential gaps in your arguments. You can feed it your data and ask, “Based on this data, what are three potential counterarguments I should address in my report?”

This ability to play devil's advocate helps you create far more robust and complete work. It allows you to move faster from a blank page to a high-quality draft, freeing up your valuable time to focus on the high-level tasks of critical thinking, editing, and strategic refinement.

As powerful as these tools are, they come with a significant risk: AI can be a confident and convincing liar. In the world of AI, this is known as “hallucination,” where the model generates plausible-sounding but entirely fabricated information.

The most infamous examples of this come from the legal world, where attorneys have faced sanctions and severe professional embarrassment after submitting briefs to courts that cited non-existent legal cases and fictional precedents created by an AI.

Here is the cardinal rule of AI: You are the CEO of the final product. The AI is an intern; you are the editor-in-chief, and you are responsible for every word. Avoiding these traps requires a disciplined approach to how you prompt and use the technology:

Just as you wouldn't rely on a single human advisor for every issue, you shouldn't rely on a single AI.

The leading models — like Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and OpenAI's ChatGPT — each have unique strengths and “personalities” based on their training data and architecture. The most effective way to use them is in concert. Think of it as an intellectual assembly line.

First, you might use Gemini for its creative brainstorming and ability to generate a strong initial draft.

Then, you can take that draft to Claude, known for its nuanced understanding of complex language and its more cautious, thoughtful responses, with a prompt like, “Act as a skeptical editor. Review this text and identify any weak arguments, logical fallacies, or areas where the tone is inappropriate.”

Finally, you could take the revised version to ChatGPT for a final polish and check for conciseness.

By using multiple AIs to critique and refine each other's work, you create a final product that is far more polished and robust than any single model could produce on its own.

AI is not an autopilot for your career, but it is the most powerful copilot ever invented.

My encounter with that attorney's letter taught me that its greatest strength isn't its ability to write, but its ability to think — or, more accurately, to simulate a dispassionate, logical thought process that can expose the flaws in our own.

When we are too close to a problem, too invested emotionally, AI can provide the objective perspective we need.

By learning to prompt effectively, verify relentlessly, and leverage multiple models, we can transform AI from a simple tool into a true partner in judgment, enabling us to produce higher-quality work faster and with greater strategic insight than ever before.

For decades, the portable gaming market has been largely synonymous with one name: Nintendo. From the monochrome marvel of the original Game Boy to the genre-defining Switch, Nintendo has consistently defined what on-the-go gaming could be.

Meanwhile, giants like Sony and Microsoft, despite their dominance in the home console arena, have historically struggled to carve out a significant niche. Sony's PSP and PS Vita, though technologically ambitious, struggled to achieve Nintendo-level ubiquity, hindered by proprietary media formats and a lack of sustained first-party support.

After the Vita, Sony stepped away from dedicated handhelds to focus on PlayStation and remote play features. Microsoft, meanwhile, never pursued a handheld console at all—its strategy leaned instead toward cloud gaming and Xbox Game Pass streaming on mobile devices.

This historical imbalance, however, is being challenged by a new wave of powerful handheld PCs. Leading the charge into the latter half of 2025 is our Product of the Week: the ROG Xbox Ally X, which was released last week.

Developed in collaboration with Xbox and ASUS — and powered by custom AMD Ryzen hardware — this device isn't just another incremental upgrade. It's a bold statement, combining cutting-edge engineering with a clear understanding of modern gamers' expectations for uncompromised performance, wherever they play.

At the heart of the ROG Xbox Ally X lies the formidable AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor. This isn't just a powerful chip; it's a marvel of mobile engineering that integrates a robust CPU and a high-performance RDNA 3 graphics architecture.

This AMD ecosystem advantage is crucial, allowing for seamless optimization and a level of graphical fidelity that truly blurs the lines between a dedicated handheld and a full-fledged gaming PC. The “AI” in its name hints at future-proofing, with integrated neural processing units (NPUs) poised to enhance game performance and potentially power new AI-driven experiences as software evolves.

When it comes to raw power and performance, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a legitimate powerhouse. While it won't entirely eclipse the very latest Xbox Series X console in every metric, it delivers a stunningly close experience for its form factor. Games that previously required a tether to a TV and console can now be enjoyed on a vibrant, high-refresh-rate display with impressive frame rates and visual settings.

This level of parity is a monumental achievement, essentially offering a highly optimized, portable Xbox experience in your hands. Battery life, a perennial concern for portable devices of this caliber, has also seen significant improvements. Asus has clearly invested in optimizing power consumption alongside beefier batteries, allowing for extended gaming sessions that don't constantly demand a power outlet.

Design-wise, the ROG Xbox Ally X takes cues from its namesake, the Xbox controller. The ergonomics are superb, feeling comfortable and intuitive even during marathon gaming sessions. The button layout, joystick placement, and trigger feel are instantly familiar to any Xbox gamer, making the transition seamless. Asus has prioritized a premium feel, utilizing high-quality materials that convey both durability and sophistication.

The $999.99 price, while premium, positions it competitively against other high-end handheld PCs, offering a compelling value proposition given its performance and integrated software experience. A no-compromise portable gaming console isn't going to be cheap, but this is still far cheaper than a good gaming PC rig and far more portable.

So, who is the ROG Xbox Ally X best for? As a holiday or birthday gift, it's an absolute dream for the dedicated Xbox gamer who wants to take their entire library on the go without compromise. It's perfect for students, frequent travelers, or anyone with limited access to a dedicated gaming setup. It's also an ideal companion for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, transforming their subscription into a truly portable library.

Is it a game-changer? Absolutely. The ROG Ally X doesn't just push portable gaming forward — it shatters the notion that handhelds must compromise on performance. It marks a true maturation of the handheld PC market, delivering a polished, powerful experience that rivals home consoles. Its success sends a clear signal to Sony and Microsoft: there's real demand for high-fidelity gaming that fits in your backpack.

This product embodies innovation, addresses a long-standing market gap, and delivers on its promises with exceptional performance and design. It's not just a gadget; it's a statement about the future of gaming — untethered, uncompromised, and incredibly exciting. The ROG Ally X is the kind of device that makes you rethink where and how you play your favorite games, and it's my Product of the Week.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon Web Services is showing “significant signs of recovery” after a major outage early Monday that impacted sites and services including Facebook, Snapchat, Coinbase and Amazon itself — reviving concerns about the internet's heavy reliance on the cloud giant.

The problems began shortly after midnight Pacific in Amazon's Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) region. In an update shortly after 2 a.m., AWS blamed a DNS resolution issue with DynamoDB, meaning the internet's phone book failed to find the correct address for a database service used by thousands of apps to store and find data.

OpenAI's ChatGPT was among the sites impacted, The Verge reported. Check-in kiosks went down at LaGuardia Airport, with lines starting to form earlier this morning, the New York Times reported. DownDetector showed problems for financial apps like Venmo and Robinhood, gaming services such as Roblox and Fortnite, the Signal messaging app, and productivity tools including Slack and Canva.

In an update at 3:35 a.m., Amazon confirmed that the core DNS issue was “fully mitigated,” reporting that most services had recovered and were operating normally. 

However, AWS said it was still working through a backlog of requests for Lambda, its serverless computing platform. It also warned that some customers would see increased error rates when trying to launch new instances in its core cloud computing service, EC2.

Update: As of 6 a.m., Amazon reported it was making progress on the remaining issues with EC2. The company said new instance launches were succeeding in some data centers, and it was applying fixes to the rest. AWS also confirmed it was successfully processing the data backlog for its EventBridge and Cloudtrail services, with new events being delivered normally.

US-EAST-1 is AWS's oldest and largest cloud region, a popular nerve center for online services, which has made it an Achilles heel for the internet over the years. Major outages originating from this same region also caused widespread disruptions in 2017, 2021, and 2023.

The latest outage suggests that many sites have not adequately implemented the redundancy needed to quickly fall back to other regions or cloud providers in the event of AWS outages. 

Update: At 8:43 a.m., Amazon said it “narrowed down the source of the network connectivity issues,” blaming the root cause of the outage on an “underlying internal subsystem responsible for monitoring the health of our network load balancers.” It said it was throttling requests for new EC2 instances as it worked on recovery and mitigations.

A new law that took effect in July makes Washington the first state in the nation to require companies to notify the state Attorney General about certain mergers and acquisitions that already trigger federal antitrust filings.

The goal of the legislation is to give state regulators an earlier look at deals that could affect competition. Some states, including Washington, already have similar requirements for specific industries such as healthcare. But the new law applies to any sector — including tech. 

“Washington is a trailblazer for the rest of the nation in adopting a premerger notification law,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “This will allow state antitrust enforcers to protect consumer interests in an even more effective way.”

Vishal Mehta, an attorney at K&L Gates who specializes in antitrust law, said the legislation continues a trend of states taking a more active role in merger oversight. 

“The main purpose is so state enforcers can have a seat at the table earlier in the process, particularly with respect to transactions that have some sort of local nexus,” Mehta said.

The law could impact Seattle startups and acquiring companies. While attorneys don't expect it to discourage acquisitions, it could slightly slow timelines and give state regulators more leverage to review transactions.

For most acquirers, it's an extra compliance step that could extend timelines rather than a deterrent, said Jessica Pearlman, a corporate attorney with K&L Gates. “The business case for a deal is still going to exist,” she said.

Still, Mehta said companies should evaluate how their transactions could impact local competition, particularly if both parties have a significant presence in Washington. 

Under the law, companies that file federal Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) premerger notices must also send an electronic copy to the Washington Attorney General's Office if they meet any of three criteria:

The filing must be made at the same time as the federal HSR submission. There's no filing fee, but penalties for non-compliance can reach $10,000 per day.

The Washington law mirrors one recently enacted in Colorado, and is based on the Uniform Antitrust Premerger Notification Act, crafted by the Uniform Law Commission. That model legislation explicitly encourages information-sharing among states that adopt similar rules.

The requirement itself is straightforward, but lawyers say questions remain about what happens next as more states adopt similar legislation — particularly around data-sharing and confidentiality.

Mehta said it remains to be seen whether state enforcers will focus on particular sectors such as tech or private equity. It may vary from state to state, depending on the political and economic priorities of particular state governments, he said.

Washington's push for earlier oversight follows several high-profile battles involving state antitrust authority. In 2019, Washington joined other states in suing to block the Sprint–T-Mobile merger, which ultimately went through. More recently, the state successfully challenged the proposed Kroger–Albertsons merger, which was abandoned after a Washington court ruled against it.

The new rule adds to growing list of compliance and reporting requirements for businesses in Washington, including a sales tax expansion on digital services and increases to the business & occupation (B&O) tax, both passed by lawmakers this year.

The massive outage that hit Amazon Web Services early Monday and took down several major sites and services was due to an internal issue within the cloud giant's infrastructure. 

In a new update Monday at 8:43 a.m. PT, Amazon said the root cause of the outage was an “underlying internal subsystem responsible for monitoring the health of our network load balancers.”

The outage impacted everything from sites including Facebook, Coinbase, and Amazon itself, to check-in kiosks at LaGuardia Airport. 

Amazon said it was seeing connectivity and API recovery for AWS services.

Dr. Aybars Tuncdogan, an associate professor at King's College London, said it serves as warning sign for a potentially more disruptive situation.

“If a comparable vulnerability were deliberately targeted by malicious actors, the damage would be far worse,” Tuncodgan said.

The problems began shortly after midnight Pacific in Amazon's Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) region, which is AWS's oldest and largest cloud region, a popular nerve center for online services. Major outages originating from this same region also caused widespread disruptions in 2017, 2021, and 2023.

In an initial update, AWS said the outage was related to a DNS resolution issue with DynamoDB, meaning the internet's phone book failed to find the correct address for a database service used by thousands of apps to store and find data.

The latest outage suggests that many sites have not adequately implemented the redundancy needed to quickly fall back to other regions or cloud providers in the event of AWS outages.

Tuncodgan said the deeper issue is “tech monoculture” in a global infrastructure with little diversity in platforms or providers. 

“It's like agricultural monoculture — when everything relies on a single strain, one disease can wipe out entire plantations, because they all have the same genetics,” he said. 

He said that while customers can design redundancy themselves, the providers can also develop different competing infrastructures within their own ecosystems.

“This incident will likely be resolved quickly,” he said. “However, unless we rethink the architecture (that is, we decentralize and diversify), we should expect more outages of this scale, whether from glitches or targeted attacks.”

AI voice startup WellSaid Labs is doubling down on its niche of enterprise customers and regulated industries — hoping that a more judicious, behind-the-scenes approach will pay off for its business in the long run even as flashier rivals draw widespread attention and controversy.

The company, based in Bellevue, Wash., launched a new version of its text-to-speech AI voice platform Monday with redesigned Studio software and its next-generation Caruso voice model, promising better workflows, improved audio quality, and fine-tuned controls, among other features.

Unlike open voice-generation models that scrape public data, WellSaid's system is trained exclusively on licensed voice actor recordings, a closed-model approach that it says respects intellectual property and appeals to sectors such as healthcare, legal, and finance. 

WellSaid's latest release is a pivotal moment for the company — the result of years of internal research now coming to market in a form that refines its focus on business and institutional users, said Chris Johnson, WellSaid's chief product and technology officer, in an interview.

“We put our stake in the ground in being the best solution for enterprises in the market,” Johnson said. “A lot of these innovations accrue to making that a reality for us.”

WellSaid, which spun out of Seattle's AI2 Incubator in 2019, works with large enterprise customers including LinkedIn, T-Mobile, ServiceNow, and Accenture.

The company made an impression on the public in 2023 when NPR's Planet Money used WellSaid's technology to create a synthetic version of former host Robert Smith's voice — a near-perfect replica that surprised listeners and showed both the promise and potential challenges of realistic AI audio.

But WellSaid has struggled at times to break into the larger industry conversation. The challenge was underscored by its absence from a CB Insights market map of leading voice-AI startups — topped by buzzy ElevenLabs, which has been at the center of controversy over the use of its technology to make fake AI voices of public figures and others.

WellSaid executives say they're hoping to correct that specific oversight, but the challenge reflects a broader pattern among enterprise AI companies, particularly those in the Seattle region — which often emphasize trust, governance, and regulatory scenarios in a tech culture still captivated by headline-generating Silicon Valley experiments and consumer apps.

The company employs about 70 people, down slightly from a year ago, according to LinkedIn data.

WellSaid has seen some turnover in its executive suite, including three CEOs in less than two years — starting with founder Matt Hocking, then Brian Cook, and now Benjamin Dorr, who succeeded Cook earlier this year after serving as chief financial officer. 

“Every voice is connected to a real person, and that person receives royalties from the revenue that's generated on WellSaid,” Dorr said on a recent episode of the Master Move podcast. “I think the things we do right by our voice actors allow us to do right by the enterprises that choose us, and I don't think everyone else can say that.”

OpenEvidence, a tool that doctors and nurses have likened to ChatGPT for medicine, plans to announce a $200 million raise at a $6 billion valuation, The New York Times reports. 

The fresh funds come three months after the startup raised a $210 million round at a $3.5 billion valuation, a testament to the intense investor interest in industry-specific AI applications. 

Trained on medical journals from JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine, the OpenEvidence platform helps users quickly get answers to existing medical knowledge to help treat patients. Verified medical professionals can access OpenEvidence's tool, which is supported by advertising, for free.  

OpenEvidence has grown quickly since its founding in 2022. Its number of clinical consultations per month has nearly doubled to 15 million since July, per the Times.  

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Thrive Capital, Coatue Management, Bond, and Craft.  

TechCrunch has reached out to OpenEvidence for comment.

Creative design giant Adobe is beefing up the products it offers businesses to include custom generative AI models. 

Adobe launched Adobe AI Foundry on Monday, a new offering that allows enterprises to work with the company to build custom generative AI models trained on their branding and intellectual property.

The foundry's custom models, which can produce text, images, video, and other mediums like 3D scenes, are built off Adobe's Firefly family of AI models. These Firefly models were launched in 2023 and have been trained entirely on licensed data. Adobe's foundry service then fine tunes these models for each customer using their intellectual property. 

The foundry service pricing is based on usage, as opposed to by seat like many of Adobe's other products.

Hannah Elsakr, a vice president of generative AI new business ventures at Adobe, told TechCrunch the foundry service was a natural expansion of the company's enterprise AI products — and customers were asking for more customization.

“This is elevating a lot of the capabilities we already had,” Elsakr said. “The enterprise has asked us to come in and advise us, help us, partner with us, be our premier creative marketing AI partner on this.”

Since Adobe released its Firefly models in 2023, enterprises have used them to create more than 25 billion assets.

Elsakr said these custom models will help brands be able to better keep up with their advertising campaigns. A customer could create an ad campaign for a product once and use a custom Adobe model to help generate the same ad for different seasons, languages, or formats.

“It's highly personalized,” Elsakr said. “We've been talking about personalized commerce for so long, but generative AI and Firefly make it possible to put the brand in the hand of the consumer in an on-brand way.”

Despite the capabilities of the new tools, Esakr said Adobe is not trying to replace human creatives by any means and rather just give them better versions of the tools they were already using to create their content.

“Our stance is humanity is at the center of creativity and that can't be replaced,” Elsakr said. “We have been for decades in the business of providing creative tooling that helps uplift narrative, telling storytelling, your ability to envision and execute your creative vision. Firefly and foundry are just the next evolution of giving you tools in the toolkit that elevate your ability to tell a story.”

Oura announced on Monday that it's launching a new redesigned app experience and a “Cumulative Stress” feature. The company also shared that it's pursuing FDA clearance for blood pressure features that give users a likelihood assessment of hypertension. 

The redesigned Oura app introduces more personalization with three main tabs. The “Today” tab surfaces the most relevant insights for daily decisions, and the “Vitals” tab provides at-a-glance views of things like sleep, stress, and cardiovascular trends. The “My Health” tab offers insights into the user's long-term well-being, highlighting strengths, trends, and opportunities for proactive care. The tab also includes “Habits” and “Routines” sections to show the impact of daily actions.

The app redesign also brings enhanced menstrual cycle insights, including a 12-month view of period and fertile window predictions, up from the previous one-month view. 

The new Cumulative Stress feature helps users understand how their bodies accumulate and respond to chronic stress over time. It provides a stress measurement based on the past month of data and is updated weekly. A person's Cumulative Stress is determined by five factors: sleep continuity, heart stress-response, sleep micro-motions, temperature regulation, and activity impact.

“It's much more than just tallying the hours spent in stressful periods,” Oura VP of Consumer Software Product, Jason Russell, told TechCrunch. “It's actually measuring different bodily functions indicative of cumulative stress taking a toll on your body. So things like how your heart rate and heart rate variability respond after a period of stress is indicative of cumulative stress. Your thermodynamics. How you regulate temperature overnight, how continuous your sleep is. Whether you experience what we call sleep, micro-motions, so not just big movements during sleep, but twitches. There are little signatures that would be indicative of your body experiencing high cumulative stress.”

The new feature will roll out globally in the coming weeks.

On the road to developing an FDA-approved blood pressure feature, Oura announced that it's introducing a new Blood Pressure Profile study to explore how the company can identify early signs of hypertension by passively tracking key signals in the background.

Oura received approval from the Institutional Review Board for the study, which is launching in experimental hub Oura Labs in the U.S. later this year. Users who are part of the study will be notified of their current likelihood of hypertension by combining Oura Ring data with a short check-in questionnaire on family history, medication, and lifestyle habits. They will receive an assessment that lets them know if they have no signs, moderate signs, or major signs of hypertension.

Members with strong signs will be encouraged to seek professional medical care. The algorithm will also track changes over time, prompting periodic reviews throughout the study, Oura says. 

Monday's announcement comes a week after Oura raised $900 million in fresh funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Co., with participation from new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.

It also comes as Oura recently launched its Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection, its first-ever charging case, and a new Health Panels feature that lets members schedule blood work directly in the Oura app.

X is launching a marketplace for inactive handles that will allow Premium subscribers to request and purchase usernames. The marketplace will offer both free and paid options for requesting or acquiring eligible handles. Rare handles could be priced at anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, X says. 

“Priority” handles refers to usernames that often include full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations. These handles are free to request for Premium+ and Premium Business subscribers. If a user's request is approved, X will transfer the handle to them for free. However, if a user cancels or downgrades their subscription, their old handle will return to their account after a 30-day grace period.

X notes that examples of “Priority” handles include usernames like @GabrielJones, @PizzaEater, and @ParadoxAI.

The launch of the new marketplace will allow X to boost revenue through direct payments. It will also potentially increase interest in its Premium subscription offering, as it continues to deal with a struggling ads business.

The social network says not all requests are approved and that requests are usually reviewed within three business days. Once a request is approved, the user's old handle is reserved and won't be given to anyone else.

“Rare” handles include short, generic, or culturally significant names. These handles won't be available through standard requests and will instead be offered through public drops and direct, pre-priced purchases available by invitation only. 

For public drops, multiple people can apply for the handle. X says selection is based on a user's past contributions on the platform, their intended use of the handle, and their engagement and reach on the social network. 

As for direct purchases, pricing is based on number of factors, such as popularity of the word, character length, and cultural significance. Once purchased, the user gets to keep the handle even if their Premium subscription ends.

Examples of “Rare” handles include usernames like @Pizza, @Tom, and @One.

X explained on a help page that it's launching the marketplace instead of releasing inactive handles at once for anyone to claim because it wants to prevent bot spam or misuse, noting on that the marketplace “allows for fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”

If a user has a specific inactive handle in mind that isn't on the marketplace, they can “Register” their interest to add the handle to their Watchlist. It it becomes available, X will notify them.

An outage affecting web hosting giant Amazon Web Services (AWS) has taken out vast swathes of the web, including websites, banks and some government services.

Amazon said on Monday morning that the outage had been “fully mitigated” and that most services are returning to normal after an hours-long stretch during which much of the internet could not load. 

The internet giant blamed the outage, which began around 3 a.m. on the U.S. east coast, on DNS, a system that converts web addresses into IP addresses so that customer apps and websites can load.

While some glitches can resolve quickly, DNS issues can sometimes take longer to resolve.

Several major apps were not working. Coinbase, Fortnite, Signal and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazon's own services, including its Ring video surveillance products.

Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market.

Amazon did not give a reason for what caused the outage. 

Before this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant Crowdstrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal.

Prior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world's largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam and the PlayStation Network.

Spotify is introducing a new feature that will let users follow venues to get updates and details on concerts scheduled to take place there.

Venues you follow are saved in your library, and you can browse them to see event calendars, information on scheduled concerts, and announcements. Users can also filter upcoming shows at venues by genre.

The company is also updating its live event feed daily instead of weekly to provide the latest event updates.

As before, users can tap on upcoming shows to book tickets via the listed ticketing partner. Spotify experimented with selling tickets itself in 2022, but hasn't talked about expanding that business since. The company currently partners with ticketing platforms like Live Nation and Ticketmaster instead to sell tickets directly from an artist's page. 

Earlier this year, the company released a new weekly updated playlist called “Concerts Near You,” which lists 30 songs from artists performing around users' locations, along with details about their next show. 

Spotify's rivals are also concentrating on improving live event discovery on their platforms. In February, SoundCloud partnered with Ticketmaster and Live Nation to let artists list upcoming shows on their pages.

I would strongly argue that there is nothing great about Jenkins. It's an unholy mess of mouldy spaghetti that can sometimes be used to do achieve a goal, but is generally terrible at everything. Shit to use, shit to maintain, shit to secure. It was the best solution because of a lack of competition 20 years ago, but hasn't been relevant or anywhere near the top 50 since any competition appeared.The fact that to this very day, nearing the end of 2025, they still don't support JWT identities for runs is embarrassing. Same goes for VMware vSphere.

Rent laws vary widely: some states set a fixed dollar cap, others a percentage, and a few use only “reasonable” language that's open to interpretation. Many renters and landlords have no easy way to check what's actually allowed without reading the statutes themselves.This project compiles those laws into an instant calculator. Enter rent amount, due date, payment date, and state — it shows the lawful late fee limit, grace period rules, and citation.It started as a curiosity after seeing conflicting answers online. The goal is transparency, not advocacy; all data is drawn from current state statutes.The app is lightweight, built in Replit, and runs entirely client-side. I'd be interested in feedback on legal interpretation consistency, data sourcing, or UI clarity.

They do that enough times, and all of a sudden now speeding is legal because no one was charged with speeding, but with ""driving with an invalid instrument"".This would basically get rid of the ""easy plea downs"" and basically make fighting against the book the norm.IRL example:I once pulled out of my driveway and passed a stopped school bus (with lights on, but no stop signs extended) on a divided highway (barrier between my side of the road and theirs), a cop saw me do that, went around the barrier and pulled me over a couple minutes later. I was charged with something that was going to instantly take my license away.I went to my local courthouse on the designated day, the prosecuter brought me in and told me he would drop the charges to failure to stop at a stop sign. I said I didn't pass a stop sign, and that the bus didn't have them extended, just stopped with lights on, across a highway from me.Prosecutor said, that I'm allowed to argue that in front of a judge along with paying some large sum, and potentially lose my license, or take a point, and pay $150 today and be done with it.I chose the latter.

Do you have a source for this because I'm not convinced. Maybe a small portion do but the majority face no penalties. When I was in college the number of questionably legal homes for rent was insane, but I didn't have time to go after them. A friend of mine did and won, but it required a lot of time. Most of the time the landlord does what they want and the renters don't have the resources to go after them.You make it sound like it's the renters who take advantage of the landlords but most of the time it's the landlords who do whatever they want. The ones who stopped paying rent probably were doing so legally because a lot of them were forced to not work.

Landlords naturally (e.g., by the nature) have the upper hand because they have the desired thing - the rental.Tenants often have the legal upper hand, but the whole job of the landlord (even good ones!) is to work out which tenants know how to play the game and not rent to them.

Everyone also wants to pay as little as he can, too.Fortunately, as long as there are many buyers and many sellers, the market tends to find efficient prices.  When there is a monopoly or a monopsony, though, prices get out of wack.

If you don't increase your prices with inflation, your business will not be sustainable in the long term.

Not everybody everybody. Some people want to charge/pay/receive the maximum reasonable amount. Where ""reasonable"" is informed by social norms. The existence of so many amoral corporations, and sociopathic individuals running them, has absolutely skewed social expectations though.Such people are certainly less common, but they do exist (anecdata of one, me)Homo economicus does not actually exist.

Tons of kids aren't taught that, some of them start businesses, and they may struggle to make ends meet (or at least to thrive like they could be) because raising prices to market rates feels so unfair to them that they won't do it unless prodded to and told it's ok by someone else (and they still might not)I definitely am not convinced market-rate-is-ethical-and-fair is natural thinking for most people, or the kind of thing they want to do.(I've been the one telling people they should raise prices and I still can't shake the feeling that it's kinda wrong…)

Because it seems like the normal default for humans is that ""fair"" means when I sell something I take the highest offer I can get, but when I buy things the seller should give me the lowest offer he can while meeting his expenses or he is being ""greedy.""

Could you kindly ELI5 me what is wrong with QT licensing model?

reply

In every major Qt release, there's a handful of super useful but kind of niche widgets which aren't released under open source licenses, presumably as a sales tactic as buying licenses gets you these widgets and sometimes that is cheaper than building them yourself, but unless you need these, you probably don't care about this.Although my experience attempting to buy licenses from Qt is about a decade out of date now, the way it roughly worked was you paid a per-seat-per-year fee to get a developer license or build-machine license.  Then you bought bundles of deployment licenses, and the bigger the bundle then the lower the cost per license.  If you are buying a bundle of a few thousand devices then you pay more per license than if you're buying a bundle of a few million.  Either way, it is a significant chunk of cash you have to front to get your block of licenses and normally embedded projects are EXTREMELY sensitive to per-unit costs.

In many ways this mirrors building/adopting dev tooling to help your (human) junior engineers, and that still feels like the good metaphor for working with coding agents. It's extremely context dependent and murky to evaluate whether a new tool is effective -- you usually just have to try it out.

1) Beyond basic tests: You're right to be skeptical. This is best for quick exploratory testing during local development (""does my new feature work?""), not replacing your test suite. Think ""scriptable manual testing"" - faster than writing Playwright manually, but not suitable for comprehensive CI/CD test coverage.2) Data privacy: Screenshots stay local in /tmp, but console output and page content Claude writes tests against are sent to Anthropic. This is a local dev tool for testing with dummy data, not for production environments with real user data. Same privacy model as any AI coding assistant - if you wouldn't show Claude your production database, don't test against it with this.

MCPs themselves may provide access to tools that are either deterministic or not, but the LLM using them generally isn't deterministic, so when used by an LLM as part of the request-response cycle determinism, if the MCP-provided tool had it, is not in a feature of the overall system.SKILLS.md relies on a deterministic code execution environment, but has the same issue. I'm not seeing a broad difference in kind here when used in the context of an LLM response generation cycle, and that's really the only context where both are usable (MCP could be used for non-LLM integration, but that doesn't seem relevant.)

Competition to deploy commercial brain-computer interfaces is heating up.

Science Corporation—a competitor to Neuralink founded by the former president of Elon Musk's brain-interface venture—has leapfrogged its rival after acquiring, at a fire-sale price, a vision implant that's in advanced testing,.

The implant produces a form of “artificial vision” that lets some patients read text and do crosswords, according to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine today.

The implant is a microelectronic chip placed under the retina. Using signals from a camera mounted on a pair of glasses, the chip emits bursts of electricity in order to bypass photoreceptor cells damaged by macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss in elderly people.

“The magnitude of the effect is what's notable,” says José-Alain Sahel, a University of Pittsburgh vision scientist who led testing of the system, which is called PRIMA. “There's a patient in the UK and she is reading the pages of a regular book, which is unprecedented.”  

Until last year, the device was being developed by Pixium Vision, a French startup cofounded by Sahel, which faced bankruptcy after it couldn't raise more cash.  

That's when Science Corporation swept in to purchase the company's assets for about €4 million ($4.7 million), according to court filings.

“Science was able to buy it for very cheap just when the study was coming out, so it was good timing for them,” says Sahel. “They could quickly access very advanced technology that's closer to the market, which is good for a company to have.”

Science was founded in 2021 by Max Hodak, the first president of Neuralink, after his sudden departure from that company. Since its founding, Science has raised around $290 million, according to the venture capital database Pitchbook, and used the money to launch broad-ranging exploratory research on brain interfaces and new types of vision treatments.

“The ambition here is to build a big, standalone medical technology company that would fit in with an Apple, Samsung, or an Alphabet,” Hodak said in an interview at Science's labs in Alameda, California in September. “The goal is to change the world in important ways … but we need to make money in order to invest in these programs.”

By acquiring the PRIMA implant program, Science effectively vaulted past years of development and testing. The company has requested approval to sell the eye chip in Europe and is in discussions with regulators in the US.

Unlike Neuralink's implant, which records brain signals so paralyzed recipients can use their thoughts to move a computer mouse, the retina chip sends information into the brain to produce vision. Because the retina is an outgrowth of the brain, the chip qualifies as a type of brain-computer interface.

Artificial vision systems have been studied for years and one, called the Argus II, even reached the market and was installed in the eyes of about 400 people. But that product was later withdrawn after it proved to be a money-loser, according to Cortigent, the company that now owns that technology.

Thirty-eight patients in Europe received a PRIMA implant in one eye. On average, the study found, they were able to read five additional lines on a vision chart—the kind with rows of letters, each smaller than the last. Some of that improvement was due to what Sahel calls “various tricks” like using a zoom function, which allows patients to zero in on text they want to read.

The type of vision loss being treated with the new implant is called geographic atrophy, in which patients have peripheral vision but can't make out objects directly in front of them, like words or faces. According to Prevent Blindness, an advocacy organization, this type of central vision loss affects around one in 10 people over 80.  

The implant was originally designed starting 20 years ago by Daniel Palanker, a laser expert and now a professor at Stanford University, who says his breakthrough was realizing that light beams could supply both energy and information to a chip placed under the retina. Other implants, like Argus II, use a wire, which adds complexity.

“The chip has no brains at all. It just turns light into electrical current that flows into the tissue,” says Palanker. “Patients describe the color they see as yellowish blue or sun color.”

The system works using a wearable camera that records a scene and then blasts bright infrared light into the eye, using a wavelength humans can't see. That light hits the chip, which is covered by “what are basically tiny solar panels,” says Palanker. “We just try to replace the photoreceptors with a photo-array.”

The current system produces about 400 spots of vision, which lets users make out the outlines of words and objects. Palanaker says a next-generation device will have five times as many “pixels” and should let people see more: “What we discovered in the trial is that even though you stimulate individual pixels, patients perceive it as continuous. The patient says ‘I see a line,' “I see a letter.'”

Palanker says it will be important to keep improving the system because “the market size depends on the quality of the vision produced.”

When Pixium teetered on insolvency, Palanker says, he helped search for a buyer, meeting with Hodak. “It was a fire sale, not a celebration,” he says. “But for me it's a very lucky outcome, because it means the product is going forward. And the purchase price doesn't really matter, because there's a big investment needed to bring it to market. It's going to cost money.”  

During a visit to Science's headquarters, Hodak described the company's effort to redesign the system into something sleeker and more user-friendly. In the original design, in addition to the wearable camera, the patient has to carry around a bulky controller containing a battery and laser, as well as buttons to zoom in and out. 

But Science has already prototyped a version in which those electronics are squeezed into what look like an extra-large pair of sunglasses.

“The implant is great, but we'll have new glasses on patients fairly shortly,” Hodak says. “This will substantially improve their ability to have it with them all day.” 

Other companies also want to treat blindness with brain-computer interfaces, but some think it might be better to send signals directly into the brain. This year, Neuralink has been touting plans for “Blindsight,” a project to send electrical signals directly into the brain's visual cortex, bypassing the retina entirely. It has yet to test the approach in a person.

October's big horror movie, Black Phone 2, has opened strong for Blumhouse, and took home #1 at the box office.

Per Deadline, the sequel to Universal's 2022 horror hit made $42 million worldwide, with $26.5 million of it coming from North America. Both takes are slightly above the respective $23.3 million (domestic) and $35.8 million (global) of its predecessor's start, and give Blumhouse a much-needed win after its earlier horror flicks in 2025 like M3GAN 2.0 and Wolf Man underperformed.

Directed again by Scott Derrickson and starring much of the first film's cast—Ethan Hawke, Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, and Miguel Cazarez Mora—Black Phone 2 sees Hawke's child-abducting Grabber dead, but terrorizing the kids who defeated him via another black phone stationed at a kids camp. The first movie was based off a short story by Joe Hill, but the story for this one is wholly original, and reception to this sequel has been generally positive.

Meanwhile, Tron: Ares fell 65% in North America, adding another $11.1 million for a new domestic total of $54.6 million. Disney's legacy threequel didn't fare much better internationally; it earned another $14.1 million, but did not land at all with Chinese audiences in its debut weekend. With its new $103 million global total, it's looking likely that the series won't have much of a future going forward. As for Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, Netflix hasn't shared any box office numbers yet, but that tune may change as its limited (and slightly confusing) release expands to other theaters next weekend.

Speaking of “next weekend,” we've got Yorgos Lanthimos' comedy flick Bugonia, Tina Romero's Queens of the Dead, and Chris Stuckmann's horror debut Shelby Oaks all hitting theaters on October 24. Halloween weekend doesn't have any genre films, but November 7 has Predator: Badlands.

Mark Ruffalo explains why it's taken so long to make a new Hulk movie. Get a look at Amazon's latest Batman spinoff. Plus, Terry Gilliam plans a new project to be his last. Spoilers, assemble!



During a recent interview at the Sitges Film Festival (via World of Reel), Terry Gilliam stated he's eager to direct The Defective Detective—a script he wrote over thirty years ago—as his last film. The story concerns “a detective who enters a surreal dream world through the imagination of a young girl.”

I'm now more interested in a script I wrote thirty years ago for Paramount. There are new people at the studio now, and I have a new agent in Hollywood, and I'm trying to move the project forward […] I'd like to direct it before I die. It's called The Defective Detective and it should be my last film.

Deadline reports James Badge Dale, Matty Matheson, and Imogen Poots will star alongside Chase Sui Wonders, Sophie Wilde, Stanley Simons, Young Mazino, and Stephen Root in October, a “Halloween fugitive thriller” at A24 from Green Room director Jeremy Saulnier.

During her recent appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen (via Screen Rant), Bette Midler revealed she's read the script for Hocus Pocus 3 and “a lot of it” was “brilliant.”

They sent a script and a lot of it was brilliant. So, I got very excited, and now we're trying to figure out what it is and how it's going and where it's going to be and how much it's going to cost.

Mark Ruffalo discussed what's holding back a solo Hulk movie in a recent interview with GQ.

Yeah, I'd love to have a solo Hulk movie. I don't know if you know the story of that, but it's not really owned by Marvel; it's a Universal property. I don't know if it'll ever really come to be, honestly. We keep talking about it, what it would be. There's been so many Hulk movies already, it's like, does anyone really want another one? But I'd love one, and I do think the audiences would be into it if we could crack the nut of it.

If there's one thing that's become abundantly clear this year, it's that smart glasses are on their way, and by “on their way,” I mean they've pretty much fully arrived. Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, its first pair with a screen, are on shelves as I type these words, and rumors suggest that Samsung and Apple will soon follow. But just because smart glasses seem to be fully embarked on their journey from test labs to your eyeballs doesn't mean everything is figured out. There are still tons of questions about how smart glasses work, one of the main questions being, how do you, uh, use them? The answer? Wearables, of course.

One of the wildest parts of the Meta Ray-Ban Display isn't even the glasses; it's the wristband that comes with the glasses. Meta's Neural Band, as the company has dubbed it, is an electromyography (EMG) wristband that can read the electrical signals in your arm and fingers and then translate those signals into inputs on the device. Swipe your thumb on a clenched fist, and it navigates like a cursor in the glasses UI. Pinch your index finger and thumb together, and it's like left-clicking on a mouse. As novel as smart glasses are, the Neural Band feels even more groundbreaking.

And while Meta's wristband is the most notable of that crop of smart glasses-focused wearables, there are already lesser-known versions cropping up, and one of my favorites is the smart ring. Thicker AR glasses like those made by INMO are opting for a similar input method that uses a touch-sensitive smart ring that can detect thumb swipes to achieve a similar effect as Meta's Neural Band, allowing you to navigate glasses UI with just your fingers.

While less high-profile than Meta's wristband, researchers are already finding ways to iterate on the smart ring companion, like this version from researchers at Tokyo University called the picoRing mouse, which uses just 2% of the power of regular Bluetooth to deliver a month's worth of battery life. There are still limitations here, obviously, since the researcher's solution requires that the smart ring be coupled with a wristband that acts as a relay for the inputs. Needless to say, rocking two wearables is less than ideal for most people, but the message is still clear: additional hardware is the method of choice for controlling smart glasses, and it might not stop at wristbands and rings.

While rumors leading up to Meta's annual Connect conference didn't exactly materialize, there are credible rumblings that Meta is working on its own smartwatch. That prospect would be a bit of a snooze if it wasn't for Meta's keen interest in smart glasses. As lots of people have pointed out (including myself), a smartwatch feels like a viable way to control your smart glasses, and while it may not be sensitive or advanced enough to navigate smart glasses with screens in them, it could act as a controller for an entirely different crop of smart glasses without screens, like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.

Now, how a smartwatch works for controlling glasses is anyone's guess, but that's kind of the point. Clearly the glasses form factor is forcing wearables into uncharted territory, and wristbands and rings might just be the start. That could all change after the first company figures out hand and eye tracking in a device that small (my money is on Apple). Let's be honest, as cool as body-reading wearables are, just being able to wave your hands or pinch your fingers to navigate like you can on Apple's Vision Pro feels like a much more intuitive solution. But for now, it looks like wearables are doing the heavy lifting, and I for one am pretty curious to see where all that weirdness goes.

GTX branding suggests early pre-RTX engineering sample


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Reddit user has managed to get their hands on a rare prototype of Nvidia's GeForce GTX 2080 Ti GPU. According to photos posted by u/RunRepulsive9867, the card resembles a Founders Edition model from Nvidia's Turing generation, featuring a silver finish and dual cooling fans. Interestingly, the prototype is branded “GeForce GTX” instead of “RTX,” suggesting that it may have been an early engineering sample produced before Nvidia finalized its decision to introduce the RTX branding to emphasize its ray tracing capabilities.

As per the Reddit post, u/RunRepulsive9867 found the unique GPU inside a PC they purchased from Facebook Marketplace for $500. After some tests, the owner of the card verified its specifications using GPU-Z, which confirmed that it was indeed an RTX 2080 Ti internally, but equipped with 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, compared to the 11GB found on the retail version. It also featured a wider memory bus and higher bandwidth, along with increased ROPs (Render Output Units) and TMUs (Texture Mapping Units), though there was no mention of dedicated RT (Ray Tracing) cores.

Last month, we covered what appears to be the very same prototype when another Reddit user, u/Substantial-Mark-959, managed to get a faulty unit of the same card. The GPU was eventually fixed using a Founders Edition BIOS and modified drivers to function properly. Once operational, the card revealed the same specifications, including the 12GB of VRAM with a wider 384-bit memory bus that pushed total bandwidth to 672 GB/s. Unfortunately, the original Reddit post has been deleted.

Judging by its specifications, it's possible that Nvidia initially experimented with a more powerful TU102 configuration before finalizing the retail RTX 2080 Ti design. Alternatively, the card may have been part of early testing for a potential Titan or workstation variant that never saw the light of day. Engineering samples and prototypes like these don't usually make their way into the public as such units are mostly used for internal hardware validation, driver testing, and early performance benchmarking. Their existence is usually secured behind non-disclosure agreements or scrapped before official launch, which makes these working units valuable pieces of hardware for enthusiasts and collectors.

An ongoing issue


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Amazon Web Services (AWS) has confirmed it is tracking a massive issue that has rendered large parts of the internet unusable. AWS says it has identified and fixed the main issue causing the disruption, but it could be some time before all affected services are back to normal.

A not-infrequent occurrence, Amazon confirmed at around 3 AM ET that it was "" increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region,"" adding around 90 minutes later, ""We can confirm significant error rates for requests made to the DynamoDB endpoint in the US-EAST-1 Region.""

At 5 am ET, AWS stated, ""We have identified a potential root cause for error rates for the DynamoDB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. Based on our investigation, the issue appears to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-EAST-1. We are working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery. This issue also affects other AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region. Global services or features that rely on US-EAST-1 endpoints such as IAM updates and DynamoDB Global tables may also be experiencing issues. During this time, customers may be unable to create or update Support Cases. We recommend customers continue to retry any failed requests. We will continue to provide updates as we have more information to share, or by 2:45 AM.""

AWS is the infrastructure underpinning much of the online world; as such, the outage is causing a cascade of issues online, with many users unable to access a wide range of services.

U.S. users of Downdetector are reporting issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Amazon, Alexa, Ring, Robinhood, Max (HBO), Chime, Venmo, Epic Games, McDonald's, Fortnite, Lyft, Hulu, Disney+, Roku, Signal, and carriers including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. PC gaming platform Steam, as well as online forums like Reddit, are also impacted.

Popular banking apps and tools like Zoom, Pokémon Go, PlayStation Network, and more are also struggling, as are some AI services such as Perplexity.

AWS stated at 5:20 am ET that it had applied initial mitigations and was observing signs of recovery, adding moments later, it was seeing ""significant signs of recovery."" Despite this, AWS says there is a backlog of queued requests to work through, so it may take some time for services you're trying to use to fully recover.

At 6am ET, AWS confirmed, ""We continue to observe recovery across most of the affected AWS Services. We can confirm global services and features that rely on US-EAST-1 have also recovered. We continue to work towards full resolution and will provide updates as we have more information to share.""

A paper presented at SOSP 2025 details how token-level scheduling helped one GPU serve multiple LLMs, reducing demand from 1,192 to 213 H20s.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Alibaba Cloud claims its new Aegaeon pooling system reduces the number of Nvidia GPUs required to serve large language models by 82% during a multi-month beta test inside its Model Studio marketplace. The result, published in a peer-reviewed paper presented at the 2025 ACM Symposium on Operating Systems (SOSP) in Seoul, suggests that cloud providers may be able to extract significantly more inference capacity from existing silicon, especially in constrained markets like China, where the supply of Nvidia's latest H20s remains limited.

Unlike training-time breakthroughs that chase model quality or speed, Aegaeon is an inference-time scheduler designed to maximize GPU utilization across many models with bursty or unpredictable demand. Instead of pinning one accelerator to one model, Aegaeon virtualizes GPU access at the token level, allowing it to schedule tiny slices of work across a shared pool. This means one H20 could serve several different models simultaneously, with system-wide “goodput” — a measure of effective output — rising by as much as nine times compared to older serverless systems.

The system was tested in production over several months, according to the paper, which lists authors from both Peking University and Alibaba's infrastructure division, including CTO Jingren Zhou. During that window, the number of GPUs needed to support dozens of different LLMs — ranging in size up to 72 billion parameters — fell from 1,192 to just 213.

While the paper does not break down which models contributed most to the savings, reporting by the South China Morning Post says the tests were conducted using Nvidia's H20, one of the few accelerators still legally available to Chinese buyers under current U.S. export controls.

Alibaba says the gains came from two main techniques: Packing multiple models per GPU, and using a token-level autoscaler to dynamically allocate compute as output is generated, rather than reserving resources at the request level. In benchmarks, Aegaeon beat the goodput of ServerlessLLM and MuxServe by margins ranging from 1.5 times to 9 times.

Whether those savings translate outside Alibaba's stack remains to be seen. Alibaba Cloud's paper does not specify the exact network fabric used in the beta test, but we know the company offers its own eRDMA elastic RDMA network and has a record of building highly‑integrated GPU serving stacks, suggesting the results may depend on an optimized, vertically integrated environment.

Regardless, the result is likely to attract interest from other hyperscalers looking to stretch scarce accelerator fleets as inference demand continues to spike.

Musk likens Grok 5 to Deep Blue and calls for a coding face-off.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Elon Musk has proposed a public coding contest between xAI's Grok 5 and former OpenAI research lead Andrej Karpathy, comparing it to the 1997 showdown between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue. Karpathy declined, saying he'd rather collaborate with Grok than compete against it.

The challenge came in response to a clip from Karpathy's recent interview on the Dwarkesh Podcast, where he argued that AGI is likely still a decade away and described Grok 5 as trailing GPT-4 by several months.

Musk, who has said Grok 5 has a 10% and rising chance of reaching AGI, took that as an invitation: “Are you down for an AI coding contest,” he posted on X, tagging Karpathy directly.

You make a lot of great points, especially that children should learn the tools of physics early. Are you down for an AI coding contest or whatever form of competition you'd like for Andrej vs Grok 5, a la Kasparov vs Deep Blue?October 18, 2025

Karpathy replied that his contribution would “trend to ~zero” in such a matchup, and emphasized that he sees current models more as collaborators than adversaries.

The idea of a formal model-versus-human coding contest is not far-fetched. DeepMind earlier this year said Gemini 2.5 solved 10 of 12 problems under ICPC World Finals conditions, placing it at a gold-medal level. Both OpenAI and DeepMind have now achieved perfect 12/12 scores on the same benchmark using GPT-4 and GPT-5. These problems are drawn from university-level algorithm competitions, judged for both correctness and runtime performance, and run within strict resource and time constraints.

Earlier this year, a Polish programmer beat OpenAI's custom model in a 10-hour head-to-head final at the AtCoder World Tour Finals, prompting speculation that it may be the last human win at the highest level. That contest was tightly controlled and fully transparent.

If Musk wants Grok 5 to be taken seriously in that class, he'll need to subject it to the same conditions. The Deep Blue comparison only works if the match is measurable. That means fixed-length contests using a public problem set, identical access to tooling and compute, and no external inference or human assistance. The results would need to be scored independently and published in full.

Karpathy's decision not to participate reflects a broader shift in the way machine learning practitioners talk about performance. Rather than staging head-to-head contests, many are now focused on how well models can accelerate human output. But competitive programming still offers a clear and well-defined benchmark. And so far, Grok has yet to post a score.

If xAI wants to demonstrate parity or superiority, a formal run on ICPC-grade tasks would be the obvious place to start.

Rog Xbox Ally's pricing has been a point of contention.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Rog Xbox Ally launched to solid reviews this past week, with many praising its performance capabilities in a vacuum, while criticizing the cost and questioning how much of an Xbox product this really is. Well, we now know that at least when it comes to pricing, Microsoft gave free rein to Asus to ask what it felt was right for the hardware. In a new interview with Variety, Xbox President Sarah Bond detailed how the company developed the Xbox Rog Ally with Asus, along with teasing next-gen hardware to come.

Xbox is one of three players in the mainstream console market, alongside PlayStation and Nintendo. These three differentiate themselves from PC by offering an integrated package that has a much better value proposition. For instance, even today, the PS5 hardware for ~$500 is a great deal, considering similar performance would likely cost you more on PC. That's what makes the Xbox Rog Ally a wild card, because it isn't exactly affordable — $599 for the base unit and $999 for the Xbox Ally X is a bold demand.

""That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices,” said Sarah Bond, confirming that the company relied on Asus' experience in handhelds to get to the final price. While early leaks hinted at a $549 price for the base model and $899 for the upgraded Ally X, it turned out to be even more expensive when Microsoft officially unveiled the pricing, causing an uproar in the community.

Despite the steep costs, the more expensive Rog Ally X sold out on the Microsoft Store when pre-orders opened, and sales have been consistent, according to Xbox itself, with Sarah recalling, ""The reaction was overwhelming demand for the device... I feel really good about the value that we're giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware."" That's certainly a controversial statement that many won't agree with, especially considering how weak the Z2A-powered standard Xbox Ally is. It's more expensive than even a Series X but performs only slightly better than last-gen's Steam Deck in many tests.

Bond also hinted at Microsoft's next-gen hardware, which she says is in the prototyping and design stage. She said Microsoft's partnership with AMD would provide an opportunity to innovate and bring gamers a choice. Beyond rumors, we only have speculative fiction to gossip over, so let's just hope that Magnus (the name of the APU it's said to be using), being a mainline Xbox console, is more competitively priced when it arrives.

Despite the setbacks, Xbox and Asus have cooked up a competent handheld that, if it weren't for the pricing, would've been a slam dunk like the Steam Deck. Not to mention that such a partnership could yield cheaper, more attractive options in the future, now that the existing Rog Ally platform has already been utilized once.

Local residents near a Mexico data center built by Microsoft last year have been complaining of a range of negative utility and health effects that they're attributing to the data center itself, according to the New York Times. They've highlighted several incidents of water shortages, power outages, and even stomach bugs, with some local schools forced to close temporarily.

Though causation does not imply causality and the individual incidents are isolated and not necessarily linked, the reports of problems have escalated in the last year since the data center complex in Queretaro was opened. The NYT report cites Dulce María Nicolás, a resident and mother of two from the nearby town of Las Cenizas, who claims water outages have lasted weeks and led to school cancellations. Víctor Bárcenas, who runs a local health clinic, claims that because of power outages he attributes to the data centers, one of his patients couldn't be treated locally and had to be rushed to a hospital over an hour away.

Bárcenas also claimed that a recent lack of clean water even led to a bout of hepatitis spreading rapidly over the summer of 2025.

In Viborillas, a town near the data centers, Elizabeth Sánchez and her neighbors now have such frequent water shortages that they pay regular fees for private water trucks. She also said that due to power outages, they'd had to throw out lots of spoiled food, and that a surge had recently damaged her daughter's computer.

Microsoft has denied claims that its data center is responsible: “We looked deeply and found no indication that our data centers have contributed to blackouts or water shortages in the region,” said Bowen Wallace, Microsoft corporate vice president for data centers in the Americas. “We will always prioritize the basic needs of the community.”

Mexico's national power company has attributed power outages to lightning strikes and stray animals, rather than data center overuse.

The local director of industrial development for the Querétaro region, where many of Mexico's data centers are located, Alejandro Sterling, downplayed concerns.

“Those are happy problems,"" he said. “Not for the people that suffer it, but for the development of the place.” He went on to describe data centers as ""using"" lots of water, rather than wasting it.

Sterling also claimed an ambitious growth plan was now playing out in Mexico, with the local area set to build out over 1.5 gigawatts of new data center infrastructure over the next five years. This giddy approach to AI hardware expansion has been aped elsewhere in the world, with Europe and the UK both announcing major data center projects in recent months.

Over the last few years, the interest in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs has skyrocketed for not only their use in treating type 2 diabetes, but as a weight loss aid. 

While some GLP-1 medications, like Ozempic and Mounjaro are designed to treat diabetes and have been prescribed off-label to help people without diabetes lose weight, others like Zepbound and Wegovy are prescribed for weight loss. 

As of 2024, researchers estimated that about 12% — or one in every eight adult Americans — had ever taken a GLP-1 medication. And from 2019 to 2024, the percentage of adults prescribed a GLP-1 to treat obesity rose from 0.30% in 2019 to 2.05% in 2024, an increase of 586.7%. 

Currently, the most common delivery system for GLP-1 medications are through pre-filled injection pens used for four weeks. 

“The way these meds are delivered is through a pen that delivers a certain amount of medication each week — it's a single pen that delivers multiple doses,” Mir Ali, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, explained to Medical News Today. “So each time they use the pen, it gives them the dose that's required.”

However, many GLP-1 users have noticed that after their four expected doses, there's still medication in their injection pen, providing them with possibly a fifth dose, or what's been coined the “golden dose” by GLP-1 users. 

But is this fifth dose safe to use? If not, then why is there extra medication in the pen to begin with? And how should you dispose of any medication left in the pen?

MNT spoke with four experts to get the right answers to these questions. 

Earim Chaudry, MBBS, chief medical officer at U.K.-based digital health provider Voy, says the “golden dose” refers to a small amount of liquid left in the injector pen after taking the four prescribed doses. 

“Each Mounjaro pen contains 2.4ml officially with a small extra overfill for priming,” Chaudry gave as an example to MNT. “Each dose uses 0.6ml — just enough for four, accurate, pre-measured doses of Mounjaro. That leaves a small amount of liquid behind.” 

“The leftover liquid is not a bonus dose — it's a deliberate overfill — a standard medical practice built into the pen to ensure complete delivery of each injection and account for any small variances in delivery,” he said. 

When asked if it's safe for GLP-1 users to take the potential remaining fifth dose in an injection pen, Chaudry said the short answer is no as it can come with serious risks. 

“This leftover volume is a built-in buffer, not a usable dose,” he continued. “The associated risks include underdosing — the leftover liquid is not a full, measurable dose which can reduce the effectiveness of treatment. (Or) overdosing — without dose control, patients may inject too much, increasing the risk of side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.” 

Hans J. Schmidt, MD, chief of bariatric surgery and director of the Center for Weight Loss and Metabolic Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, agreed about it not being safe to use the “golden dose.”

“Medical experts do not recommend this and the (Mounjaro) drug maker has warned that the process of ‘breaking into the pens' is not clean and could put users ‘at risk of harm including' infection due to potential bacteria, an abscess, (and) if an abscess is left untreated, it could progress to sepsis.”

And Ali said as the GLP-1 injector pens are normally designed to stay sterile for only four weeks. 

“[I]f you're going to use an additional dose a week later, you may not have the same sterility as the first four doses. There's some risk of introducing bacteria into your system using a pen that's been out longer than recommended.” — Mir Ali, MD

According to news reports, the potential risks associated with using the remaining medication in the pen as a fifth dose has reportedly spurred Eli Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro, to redesign its injector pen to eliminate the extra liquid.

“All medications, regardless of the class or subtype, have been standardized based on respective dose titration and its application related to the safety, efficacy and intended mechanism of action as they were researched and investigated,” added Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight. “In other words, manipulating a prescription outside of the intended use or extending it may cause safety concerns and consequences unaccounted for in research studies.”

If it's unsafe to use any leftover medication in the pen after four weeks of injections, GLP-1 users may wonder what's the safest way to dispose of it. 

“It's a pen with a needle, so it's supposed to be disposed of in a sharps container,” Ali said. “But the medication itself, as long as it's in the pen, it's not going to cause a problem. It's just if people are using it, there's potential hazards to using that additional medication in there.” 

“Once the four pre-measured doses have been administered, used pens, including any remaining liquid, should be disposed of safely,” Chaudry detailed “Unscrew and discard the needle into a sharps disposal container. The needle must never go into household waste. After removing the needle, discard the empty pen in a sharps container or household waste. Dispose of the needles in a sharps container.” 

“According to the manufacturer (of Mounjaro), the KwikPen contains an extra solution to allow for the ‘necessary priming before each injection' in addition to delivering the four full doses. The manufacturer's instructions say to discard the pen after four doses or 30 days after its first use, regardless of any remaining liquid.”— Hans J. Schmidt, MD

If there's more medication in a GLP-1 injector pen than what you need for four doses, some users may think increasing their dosage will help them lose weight faster. 

Not so, Ali said. 

“The way the meds are designed, you start at a lower dose and gradually work your way up,” he detailed. “And the reason for that is the side effects seem to be more dose-related and that gives your body time to adapt to the side effects. So patients who advance too quickly to a higher dose typically have more severe side effects and may not be able to tolerate the medication.”

“The idea of a ‘golden dose' may be tempting for patients, but safety must come first. The leftover liquid in the pen is not a secret fifth dose, and trying to use it can lead to inaccurate dosing, contamination and serious side effects. If patients feel unsure about their current dose, or find that it isn't working as expected, they should speak to a clinician. Self-adjusting can lead to underdosing, overdosing or side effects, and the health risks associated with these.” — Earim Chaudry, MBBS

And Richard emphasized the importance of people using GLP-1 medications to work closely with their healthcare team, including a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), and fully follow instructions for use related to any prescription medication.

“When an individual goes rogue it can be a real safety concern — so also understanding why may be necessary,” she continued. “Are they financially limited and trying to make it last longer? Do they understand the dosing instructions? Are they health literate with the possible side effects, risks or outcomes of this additional dose?”

“I would encourage our readers to think: Let's be smart, strategic, and savvy when using some of these tools, but prioritize safety,” Richard added.

In older adults undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia, receiving S-ketamine was associated with a reduced risk for postoperative delirium within the first 3 days after the procedure. The level of pain and the need for rescue analgesia were lower in patients receiving S-ketamine than in those receiving a placebo.

“S-ketamine can reduce risk of [postoperative delirium] in elderly patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia. However, generalizability of these findings may be limited due to the study's setting,” the researchers reported. 

The study was led by Youzhuang Zhu, MD, PhD, of the Shandong Provincial Key Medical and Health Laboratory of Anesthesia and Brain Function at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University in Qingdao, China. It was published online on October 14, 2025, in Anesthesiology.

The number of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty with neuraxial anesthesia was small. The postoperative analgesia protocol followed routine practices of the center, which may differ from other guidelines. The lack of routine sedation in the placebo group does not reflect real-world clinical scenarios. The findings may not apply to other settings due to the single-center design and specific setting.

This study was supported by grants from the Youth Research Fund of Qingdao University, Intramural Research Program of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao Key Medical and Health Discipline Project, Qingdao Leading Discipline Program in Medicine and Health, Shandong Provincial Medical and Health Science and Technology Guidance Project, and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation.

 October 20, 2025  

A large proportion of the population has abdominal obesity despite a normal BMI, and these individuals are at increased cardiometabolic risk, two new studies found. 

In a global cross-sectional study published on October 17, 2025, in JAMA Network Open, more than 1 in 5 adults with a normal BMI had abdominal obesity. In these individuals, abdominal obesity was consistently associated with hypertension, diabetes, high total cholesterol, and high triglycerides, with some differences by global region. 

“Individuals with normal BMI but abdominal obesity are often overlooked for appropriate interventions…. We believe it is important to use both BMI and waist circumference together rather than in isolation to provide a more complete and accurate assessment of cardiometabolic risk in clinical settings,” lead author Kedir Y. Ahmed, MPH, PhD, research fellow of rural public health at the Rural Health Research Institute, Orange, New South Wales, Australia, told Medscape Medical News. 

Ahmed added that this recommendation aligns with a 2020 published consensus statement recommending that waist circumference be included as a vital sign in clinical settings. 

The other study, published on October 15, 2025, also in JAMA Network Open, aimed to examine the impact of the recent Lancet Commission obesity definition on obesity prevalence, using data from the US-based All of Us (AoU) cohort. Overall, more than one quarter of the AoU population did not have obesity by the traditional race-based BMI cutoffs but did have at least two elevated anthropomorphic measurements: waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and/or waist-to-height ratio. The authors termed that phenomenon “anthropomorphic-only obesity.” 

Here again, “anthropometric-only obesity has significant morbidity associated with it, both for diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” lead researcher Steven K. Grinspoon, MD, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital metabolism unit, Boston, told Medscape Medical News. 

Of note, Lancet Commission lead author Francesco Rubino, MD, told Medscape Medical News that the report did not advise defining obesity without regard for BMI. “The Commission's framework allows the use of two additional anthropometric measures to confirm excess adiposity, but not at any BMI level. We emphasized that BMI should still be used as a screening tool, not alone as diagnostic of excess adiposity, unless the BMI is above 40. We said that confirmation of obesity requires clearer evidence of excess adiposity, particularly for those with BMI 30-40… [W]e are not recommending the classification of normal-BMI individuals as having obesity.” 

Ahmed and colleagues used data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Stepwise Approach to Surveillance of Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factors survey datasets from 2000 to 2020, with surveys from 91 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean region, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific region. The survey population totaled 471,228 people aged 15-69 years, of whom 57.8% were female and 42.2% male. 

The global prevalence of abdominal obesity — defined as a waist circumference ≥ 80 cm for nonpregnant females and ≥ 94 cm for males — was 45.4%, ranging from 31.4% in Southeast Asia to 61.6% in Europe. 

Among those with a WHO-defined normal BMI of 18.5-24.9, 21.7% had abdominal obesity, ranging from 15.3% in the Western Pacific region to 32.6% in the Eastern Mediterranean. By country, the highest prevalence was 58.4% in Lebanon and the lowest was 6.9%, in Mozambique. 

Overall, abdominal obesity was associated with higher odds of hypertension across all regions (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 vs no abdominal obesity), while abdominal obesity with a normal BMI was also associated with significantly greater odds of hypertension globally (OR, 1.29). 

Similarly, both abdominal obesity overall and abdominal obesity with normal BMI were associated with diabetes across all regions (OR, 2.30 and 1.81, respectively), elevated total cholesterol (OR, 1.49 and 1.39, respectively), and elevated triglycerides (OR, 1.60 and 1.56, respectively), each with a few statistical exceptions by region. 

“Relying solely on BMI may be insufficient to identify those high-risk individuals and provide timely interventions,” Ahmed and colleagues concluded. 

In their population-based longitudinal cohort study, Grinspoon, first author Lindsay T. Fourman, MD, and colleagues examined data from 301,026 individuals in the AoU database, of whom 61% were female and 39% male. They were racially mixed, with just over half (53.2%) being White. Using traditional BMI-only criteria, 42.9% had obesity, while another 25.9% had anthropomorphic-only obesity. The prevalence of the latter entity was significantly higher in males than in females (32.5% vs 21.7%) and in people older than 70 years (78.3%). 

Compared with individuals who had both BMI meeting traditional obesity criteria plus at least two elevated anthropomorphic measures, those with anthropometric-only obesity were older (median age 54 vs 60 years, respectively; P <.001), were more commonly male (34.7% vs 48.9%, respectively, P <.001), and had higher educational status and income. 

Anthropometric-only obesity increased with age, from 26.9% of the total group with obesity aged 18-29 years to 52.9% of those aged 70 or older. 

The risk for incident type 2 diabetes was highest among the individuals who had both BMI-defined obesity and anthropomorphic obesity (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 3.95) compared to those with neither of these condition, while that risk was still elevated in the anthropomorphic-only group (AHR, 2.12). The risks for cardiovascular events (AHR, 1.81 and 1.55, respectively) and all-cause mortality (AHR, 1.22 and 1.20) were similarly elevated in both groups. 

Grinspoon told Medscape Medical News that the findings suggest a role for medications that reduce visceral adiposity without significantly altering weight. One such agent is tesamorelin, a synthetic growth hormone analog approved for the treatment of HIV lipodystrophy. “Maybe there are types and categories of drugs that could be used more to move fat around than reduce it altogether in this now apparent sub population of people.” 

Ahmed's study was funded by the Commonwealth of Australia, represented by the Department of Health. He has no further disclosures. Grinspoon reported receiving personal fees from Marathon Asset Management LP and Exavir Therapeutics during the conduct of the study and grant support from Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc,, Gilead Sciences, Inc,, and Viiv Healthcare. Rubino has received research grants from Ethicon (Johnson & Johnson), Novo Nordisk, and Medtronic; consulting fees from Morphic Medical; speaking honoraria from Medtronic, Ethicon, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, and Amgen; has served (unpaid) as a member of the scientific advisory board for Keyron and a member of data safety and monitoring board for GI Metabolic Solutions; is president of the Metabolic Health Institute (nonprofit); and is sole director of Metabolic Health International and London Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (private practice). Fourman has received grant support from Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA and personal fees from Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA and Theratechnologies.

Oncology care access across the US is at risk, particularly for patients living in rural areas, according to a new report from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Access to care is likely to become more limited, the report found, because patient demand is growing as the number of available oncologists is poised to decline outside of metropolitan areas — with much of the current workforce nearing retirement.

The report, published in JCO Oncology Practice, offers an important glimpse into the future of cancer care, said coauthor Manali I. Patel, MD, MPH, immediate past chair of ASCO's Health Services Research Committee.

“We're seeing a convergence of factors: A growing older population and a projected increase in cancer cases are putting pressure on an unevenly distributed oncology workforce,” Patel stated in an ASCO press release. “Our data identifies significant ‘cancer care deserts,' particularly in rural communities, where 11% of older Americans live without a practicing oncologist.”

Coauthor David Chism, MD, has worked in several rural communities in eastern Tennessee and seen firsthand the challenges posed by a dwindling oncology workforce.

“Many patients in these regions have limited resources, making it difficult for them to travel long distances or take time away from work,” Chism, of Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, Tennessee, told Medscape Medical News. He noted that the increasingly complex nature of cancer treatment — particularly the expanding use of novel immunotherapies — compounds the problem.

Based on Medicare billing data and trends at the national, state, and county levels, the investigators found that although the number of oncologists increased between 2014 and 2024 (from 12,267 to 14,547), the number per 100,000 population aged 55 years and older decreased from 15.9 to 14.9.

In 2024, 38 states had fewer oncologists per capita than in 2014, and most of those states faced limited rural workforce coverage.

Further, although 89% of Americans lived in counties with practicing oncologists, 68% lived in areas where at least 25% of those oncologists were nearing retirement age. Meanwhile, early-career oncologists were half as likely as later-career oncologists to work in rural areas or areas with high cancer risk — including above-average rates of cancer mortality, smoking, obesity, social vulnerability, lack of insurance, and lack of broadband internet access.

In fact, by 2037, nonmetropolitan areas are projected to meet less than one third of their demand for medical and hematology oncologists. Conversely, metropolitan areas are projected to fully meet their demand, the investigators said.

These findings are striking, they noted, given that new cancer cases in North America are projected to increase 56% by 2050 — highlighting the pressure this could place on an already strained workforce.

For its part, ASCO said it “will continue to monitor national and local developments in the oncology workforce” and will look to these findings to inform gaps in cancer care, including advocating for policy solutions.

As Patel put it, the findings underscore a “growing need for proactive solutions — like incentivizing practice in underserved areas and expanding telehealth — to help ensure that geography doesn't limit a person's access to quality cancer care.”

Chism agreed. “ Without national and state incentives — for example, medical school loan forgiveness — these communities are particularly vulnerable,” he said.

A study of neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) at two level IV NICUs identified competing tasks, poor coordination, frequent interruptions, limited ancillary support, and staff shortages as primary contributors to NNP workload. Good team rapport and experienced staff helped mitigate workload. 

“By identifying specific workload barriers for workload management, this study highlights key areas for potential targeted interventions to reduce NNP workload in NICUs,” the authors wrote. “It also reveals the facilitators within NICU NNP teams that frequently help alleviate their workload.”

The study was led by Lamia Alam, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. It was published online on September 2, 2025, in Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting.

This study had a qualitative observational design, which was not validated against objective workload or outcome measures.

The study was funded by a grant from Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Durvalumab administered after chemoradiotherapy was effective and was associated with prolonged overall survival and progression‑free survival in patients with unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a real-world multicentre study found.

""CODAK demonstrates the effectiveness of durvalumab following CRT [chemoradiotherapy] in a real-world UK cohort of patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC,"" the authors wrote, adding that ""rwOS [real-world overall survival] at 12 and 24 months was consistent with the PACIFIC trial, and rwPFS [real world progression-free survival] at 12 months was comparable."" ""Overall, the results of CODAK support evidence from other observational studies indicating that, in real-world clinical practice, the PACIFIC regimen is an effective SOC [standard of care] for patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Kevin Franks, Leeds Cancer Centre, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, England. It was published online on October 09, 2025, in Clinical Oncology.

Retrospective data collection might have missed information. Tumour responses were not evaluated according to a standard protocol. This study documented adverse events only if they resulted in treatment interruption or discontinuation. The timing of adverse events was not analysed, making it unclear whether adverse event-related interruptions correlated with treatment duration.

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today, we're going to talk about unexplained dyspnea. 

This is a common complaint we all see on a day-to-day basis, whether it's pulmonary, internal medicine, cardiology, inpatient, or outpatient. These patients have undergone almost every test they could think of, whether it's pulmonary function tests (PFTs), CTs, chest x-rays, stress tests, or even sleep studies. 

When none of these have diagnosed our patient, then we can send them for a CPET, or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Essentially, this is a stress test of both the heart and the lungs at the same time. 

It checks the aerobic activity within our patients as to when and how quickly it becomes anaerobic activity. It also checks ventilatory efforts, and also combines the oxygenation between the ventilation to see where the downfall is. 

This also checks heart rate and pulse oximetry, similar to a cardiac stress test; however, there's a component of PFTs drawn into this cardiopulmonary exercise test.

This can tell us if the shortness of breath is usually coming from something pulmonary related, cardiac related, or even if it's just deconditioning or frailty. This can also tell us about neuromuscular disorders and how the body is functioning through metabolism.

A major review shows that what we eat may significantly influence pelvic floor outcomes, offering new hope for improving sexual function and incontinence through dietary intervention rather than solely physical therapy or medication.



Review: Healthy dietary patterns improve sexual function and incontinence symptoms: systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary patterns and dietary interventions. Image Credit: Oksana Mizina / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers collated and reanalyzed scientific data from 31 studies to investigate the role of dietary interventions in pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) outcomes, including sexual dysfunction and incontinence. The review aimed to address this rising global concern, potentially improving the quality of life (QoL) for millions.

Review findings revealed that healthy, anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, particularly the Mediterranean diet, are significantly associated with improved sexual function and reduced incontinence symptoms, while pro-inflammatory diets were linked to increased PFD risk.

Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is an umbrella term for a complex set of conditions (e.g., sexual dysfunction and incontinence) and is an anatomical condition characterized by weak, damaged, or uncoordinated muscles in the pelvic floor, leading to urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic pain, constipation, and pelvic organ prolapse.

PFD is an unexpectedly globally prevalent condition often hidden by social stigma. Its symptoms, including urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or orgasmic dysfunction in women, can significantly impair patients' QoL, often requiring clinical interventions to improve outcomes and restore functional normalcy.

While lifestyle modifications are often leveraged as the first-line treatment in addressing PFD diagnoses, the conversation surrounding these interventions has historically been dominated by physical therapies (e.g., Kegel exercises). However, a growing body of literature suggests that diet may play a pivotal role, given its link to chronic inflammation and metabolic health. Notably, anti-inflammatory diets have previously been linked to better sexual function, while high salt intake is known to worsen overactive bladder symptoms.

Unfortunately, despite these hypotheses, clinical investigations of the topic remain fragmentary, often focusing on single nutrients rather than the synergistic effects of whole dietary patterns. Consequently, a large-scale, systematic synthesis is needed to understand the true impact of diet on PFD.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to address this knowledge gap and inform future PFD interventions by synthesizing all high-quality existing evidence on the topic. The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a gold standard for such reviews.

The review comprised a thorough, custom search-directed scrutiny of several public scientific repositories (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) for studies published up to August 2024 (total identified = 493). Studies were screened (title, abstract, and full text) to identify those meeting review criteria and targeted five evidence-based dietary patterns: the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet, the healthful Plant-Based Diet Index (hPDI), and both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory diets (total screening and selected = 31).

Notably, 14 studies (eight cross-sectional studies, three prospective studies, and three randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) provided sufficient quantitative data to be pooled into a new meta-analysis, allowing for the statistical calculation of the overall effect of these diets on sexual function and incontinence symptoms.

The present systematic review elucidates clear and compelling evidence linking diet and pelvic floor health. Overall, healthy dietary patterns were associated with significant improvements in both sexual dysfunction and incontinence symptoms.

When independently analyzing sexual dysfunction, both the Mediterranean diet and general anti-inflammatory diets were significantly associated with a reduced risk. The pooled data from cross-sectional studies showed that healthy diets reduced the odds of sexual dysfunction (OR = 0.69). Data from prospective studies reinforced these findings, demonstrating a significant improvement in sexual function scores (Standardized Mean Difference, SMD = -0.60). However, high statistical heterogeneity was observed among prospective studies (I² = 87%), prompting a sensitivity analysis. When two Esposito trials were excluded, the effect remained positive but more modest (SMD = -0.25), indicating greater consistency. Benefits were most pronounced in individuals with metabolic syndrome, suggesting that endothelial and inflammatory mechanisms may play a key role. The hPDI did not consistently show improvement, indicating that diet quality alone may not guarantee benefit without anti-inflammatory properties.

When analyzing incontinence data, results were more nuanced. Pro-inflammatory diets (high Dietary Inflammatory Index scores) were strongly associated with increased urinary and fecal incontinence risk. The cross-sectional data confirmed that adhering to a less inflammatory diet reduced the odds of incontinence (OR = 0.77, p < 0.0001). The DASH diet was also shown to be effective in alleviating lower urinary tract symptoms, an observation attributed to the diet's low salt content. However, in prospective analyses, the overall effect on incontinence was not statistically significant (SMD = -0.17), suggesting that improvements may be mediated through weight loss and reductions in intra-abdominal pressure rather than direct inflammatory pathways.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis provide the most robust information to date that healthy, anti-inflammatory diets, especially the Mediterranean diet, can serve as a valuable tool in managing pelvic floor dysfunction. The findings strongly support integrating dietary counseling into clinical practice for PFD, particularly for patients who also have metabolic risk factors like obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the authors emphasize that most included studies were observational, limiting causal inference, and residual confounding, especially from BMI, cannot be excluded.

While the observational nature of many included studies and variations in their design limit the causation and generalizability of the review, it provides a strong scientific basis for recommending diet as a non-pharmacological strategy to improve pelvic floor health.

A quick handgrip test could do more than measure muscle power; it might predict who's most at risk of obesity-related diseases long before symptoms appear.

Study: Handgrip Strength and Trajectories of Preclinical Obesity Progression: A Multistate Model Analysis Using the UK Biobank. Image credit: Microgen/Shutterstock.com

The obesity epidemic is overtaking the world, driven mainly by unhealthy lifestyle choices. Its association with multiple long-term adverse health outcomes highlights the urgent need to identify predictors of obesity that could guide preventive strategies. A recent study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism examines the value of handgrip strength in predicting the progression of preclinical obesity.

Obesity was formally recognized as a disease in January 2025, in a consensus statement published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. Preclinical obesity refers to elevated anthropometric (related to the body shape) obesity markers but without functional impairment due to obesity.

Preclinical obesity can progress to clinical obesity, characterized by metabolic dysfunction and a higher risk of death. It is unclear how this progression is affected by muscle strength.

The body mass index (BMI) is the most common measure used to diagnose obesity. However, it fails to distinguish between lean mass overall and muscle mass vs. fat mass, though these play very different roles in health. Athletes, for instance, may have a high BMI due to their muscle hypertrophy but are not obese.

The BMI also fails to specify the site of fat distribution, even though visceral fat deposition is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic dysfunction, unlike other sites. Moreover, BMI-based obesity diagnoses do not capture many obese phenotypes. In many young and middle-aged adults, total body fat percentage more accurately describes obesity than BMI, even among those with normal BMI.

Visceral obesity is linked to muscle weakness, increased odds of physical disability, chronic disease (including CVD), and death. Muscle strength and function thus reflect obesity-related health consequences much better.

Again, low handgrip strength predicts a higher risk of death over the age of 50 years, independent of obesity (as defined by the BMI). Conversely, BMI-defined obesity or overweight has sometimes been found to show protective associations against mortality among people over 70 years. Thus, BMI alone is not a helpful marker of obesity risk.

The data came from the UK Biobank. Both BMI and any of 18 signs of obesity-related dysfunction were identified, such as signs of raised intracranial pressure, CVD, apnea, chronic fatigue, heart failure, hypertension, kidney disease, and chronic severe knee pain.

The current study attempted to capture the association of handgrip strength with the transition from preclinical to clinical obesity. This group was identified by the presence of a high body mass index along with one of the following measures in excess:

Three models were used to track handgrip strength trajectories from the baseline to decline in function or death. The first model tracked three transitions, from the baseline to the first obesity-induced dysfunction, then to double dysfunction, and finally to all-cause death. The second tracked it to the first dysfunction and then to all-cause mortality. The third model progressed from baseline to death, without any obesity-related dysfunction in between.

The muscle-to-weight ratio (MWR) was defined as the ratio of total thigh fat-free muscle volume to body weight, while the lean-to-weight ratio (LWR) was defined as the ratio of total lean mass to body weight. These were based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), respectively.

Finally, the researchers analyzed how grip strength was related to the risk of developing obesity-induced dysfunctions and of death.

There were 8,163 deaths over the mean follow-up period of 13.4 years. The risk of progression across the stages of preclinical obesity was reduced with each standard deviation (SD) of increase in handgrip strength.

The greatest reduction in risk was found in the first model, in the progression from baseline to first dysfunction, where the risk dropped by 14% per SD handgrip strength increase. For the second progression, the risk dropped by 8%, and by 13% across the third transition.

In the second model, similar decreases were seen in the two progressions. Even without any dysfunction, grip strength predicted a 9% lower risk of progressing from baseline to all-cause mortality (the third model). 

When compared across tertiles, the highest grip strength tertile was protective in all models. The strongest effect was on the transition between double dysfunction to death from all causes, where the risk dropped by 23% per SD increase in handgrip strength.

These findings corroborate earlier research that indicates muscle strength is more accurately related to body composition than BMI. Muscle strength is lower with visceral obesity, while increased grip strength is associated with better glucose and lipid regulation.

Interestingly, MWR was more strongly associated with a reduced risk of preclinical obesity progression than DXA data, indicating that the latter may underestimate aging-associated muscle loss.

The underlying mechanisms of the association of better health with increased grip strength in people with high BMI could include the link between grip strength and reduced body fat percentage, since fat deposition is the driver of obesity-related dysfunctions. On average, individuals with higher grip strength also showed lower levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline.

Skeletal muscle secretes myokines, molecules that help regulate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Reduced muscle strength might disrupt these protective pathways. However, these mechanisms were proposed as potential explanations rather than directly tested in this study. Additionally, the authors mention that low muscle strength may parallel reduced bone density, which has been associated in previous studies with cardiovascular risk.

For the first time, this study showed that

Increased grip strength was significantly associated with a decreased risk of obesity-induced dysfunctions progression and multiple-cause mortality.

However, as an observational study, it does not prove causation.

Future studies should validate these results and extend them to other models of obesity. These findings suggest that building up muscle strength may be an early intervention to prevent the progression of preclinical obesity. These results apply to individuals with preclinical obesity at baseline and may not generalize to other populations.

A new study from Spain reveals that babies born to mothers exposed to higher air pollution levels in pregnancy show signs of slower brain myelination, a subtle but telling shift in how early brain wiring unfolds.

Study: Unraveling the impact of prenatal air pollution for neonatal brain maturation. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in Environment International suggests that prenatal exposure to air pollution is linked to delayed maturation in the newborn, likely associated with a slowing of the rate of myelination.

The developing brain is highly vulnerable to injury by environmental factors, including air pollution. This can cause neuropsychiatric disorders, which are among the significant causes of disability worldwide.

Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 µm or less (PM2.5) is often used as a pollution indicator because it originates in so many different sources of pollution and contains a spectrum of pollutants, including potentially toxic elements and essential trace metals such as iron, copper, and zinc. It is easily inhaled, and the particles can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, causing adverse effects on the brain.

Prenatal PM2.5 exposure impacts fetal development. Conversely, it exposes the fetus to essential micronutrients like copper, iron, and zinc, all of which promote gestational white matter myelination. Little is known about the outcome of these opposing exposures on the brain, mirroring the complex fetal response to pollution.

For instance, offspring of women exposed to particulate matter of the PM10 variety had larger brain ventricles and cerebelli. The opposite was true of NO2 exposure, though both are pollutants. Opposite effects have been reported with other brain areas.

Myelination is an important marker of brain maturation. It involves the formation of myelin sheaths around the axons of the neurons. The myelin sheath speeds up nerve conduction and shapes brain circuitry. Myelination begins from the basic pathways of the brain and progresses to higher circuits, which is reflected in the individual's behavioral development.

Air pollution exposure before birth causes changes in the brain's white matter, including its myelin content and structure. This led to the current study, which examined PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy as a predictor of newborn brain myelination.

The study sample comprised 93 newborns born at three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain, between 2018 and 2021. Their prenatal PM2.5 exposure was modeled, separately for the embryonic and late fetal phases. The newborn brain was imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 29 days of postnatal life.

The infant's age at the time of the MRI was linked to brain volume and overall myelination, indicating the ability to record short-term neonatal brain development. However, this association was not found for cortical myelination.

Increasing prenatal PM2.5 exposure in early pregnancy was associated with a lower cortical myelinated white matter content. In late pregnancy, it was linked to lower overall myelination. There were no associations with brain volume. This suggests that the brain cortex and deep white matter may respond differently to chemical pollution in early developmental stages.  

This pattern was also observed with trace element exposure, though the associations weakened or disappeared when adjusted for confounding factors.

The findings suggest a delay in early myelination following exposure to air pollution in the prenatal period. However, since myelination is a dynamic process whose rate varies with age, brain region, and the availability of nutrition, this observation does not necessarily indicate a harmful or permanent effect on the fetus.

In fact, one prior study indicates that slower but more sustained white matter myelination is found in children with higher cognitive skills. The apparently slower maturation occurred during the first year of life, while a catch-up phase occurred over the next year.

Again, the placenta may protect the fetus from certain pollutants, which simultaneously allows essential elements to pass through.

Women exposed to air pollution in pregnancy had babies with lower white matter myelination in the newborn period. Reduced cortical myelination was specifically associated with higher PM2.5 exposure in early pregnancy, but global myelination declined with later exposure. These findings suggest a potential delay in neonatal brain maturation.

Significant associations were not found for iron, copper, or zinc in PM2.5, though the observed trends were in the same direction.

The authors noted that:

This study underscores the impact of environmental factors on neonatal brain development and the importance of stringent air quality policies.

The cognitive outcome of delayed neonatal white matter myelination remains unknown. Thus, the study also underlines the importance of longitudinal research to understand how prenatal air pollution affects long-term behavior and intellectual development.

Where you live could shape how your brain ages, with neighborhood inequality and environmental stressors leaving measurable biological traces linked to Alzheimer's disease.

Study: Associations of place-based social determinants of health with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Image credit: Bored Photography/Shutterstock.com

A new study published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Behavior & Socioeconomics of Aging reveals that individuals living in neighborhoods with higher levels of social vulnerability, environmental injustice, and socioeconomic disadvantage are associated with biological patterns linked to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

Place-based social determinants of health are nonmedical factors within a person's physical environment and community. These elements play a vital role in shaping an individual's health, functioning, and quality of life.

The basic social determinants of health include socioeconomic status, healthcare access, education access, healthy food availability, housing quality, violence, racism, discrimination, social support networks, and many more. Addressing these factors can improve health, reduce inequalities, and promote quality of life.

Existing evidence has linked these factors to cardiometabolic health and cognition. An association between the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and cortical thickening in Alzheimer's disease-specific brain regions has also been observed in individuals with unpaired cognitive functioning. ADI, a composite measure of social determinants of health, is used to measure socioeconomic disadvantages at the neighborhood level to identify communities with higher risk of adverse health outcomes.

Despite potential involvement of place-based social determinants of health in determining cognitive health, it remains largely unknown whether these factors influence vital biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

In the current study, researchers from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine aimed to investigate the associations of three composite measures of place-based social determinants of health, including ADI, the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and the Environmental Justice Index (EJI), with neuroimaging and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in more than 600 Black and White participants aged 54 years or above.

SVI is used to measure the preparedness of a community to respond to a disaster, and the EJI is used to measure the cumulative impacts of environmental burden.

The study reported that the scores of all three social determinants of health indices were higher among Black participants compared to those among White participants. This finding indicates that Black participants live in regions with higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage, social vulnerability, and environmental injustice.

The analysis of the association between these indices and Alzheimer's disease and dementia biomarkers revealed that among Black participants, higher SVI and EJI scores are associated with higher variability in cerebral blood flow in the brain gray matter; higher ADI scores are associated with lower cerebral blood flow in the gray matter, and higher ADI and SVI scores are associated with lower cortical thickness.

Among White participants, the analysis revealed a modest negative association between SVI scores and glial fibrillary acidic protein, a plasma biomarker of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

The study findings suggest that place-based social determinants of health are moderately associated with less favorable Alzheimer's disease and dementia biomarkers among Blacks or African Americans, but not among Whites.

The study analysis comparing participants with and without cognitive impairments reveals that higher neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with lower cortical thickness among participants with dementia. Similar negative associations have been observed between social vulnerability and environmental injustice and cortical thickness among participants with mild cognitive impairments. However, these associations were absent among participants without cognitive impairment.

The observed associations between place-based social determinants of health and neuroimaging biomarkers only among Black participants indicate that place-based distribution of resources and opportunities may differentially impact biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and dementia based on racialized identities and experiences.

The study used three indices that capture a broad range of place-based social determinants of health, including social characteristics related to income, education, and housing, household characteristics, transportation, racial and ethnic minority status, and environmental characteristics (pollution, toxic waste disposal sites, and chronic disease burden). These determinants may partially capture the effects of structural racism, indicating that the observed associations may partially be influenced by structural racism.

The study findings suggest that social vulnerability may be associated with brain health and that this measure could help identify neighborhoods where monitoring social determinants of health may have a significant impact. However, only some of the observed associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons, and further replication is needed before drawing firm conclusions.

Overall, the study findings highlight the need for further research to examine the impact of structural racism on biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and dementia in more racially, ethnically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse cohorts.

Interventions targeting elements of structural racism and the inequitable distribution of place-based social determinants of health are needed to improve outcomes of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Grassroots initiatives and policy efforts must address these determinants in neighborhoods with higher disadvantage, social vulnerability, and environmental injustice to reduce risk and progression and improve outcomes of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

The study could not investigate the impact of long-term exposure to social determinants of health on the tested biomarkers. Similarly, it remains uncertain whether early-life and mid-life exposure to these determinants affects later-life levels of Alzheimer's disease and dementia biomarkers. Future studies with longitudinal life-course residential data are needed to address these limitations.

Although yogurt is often praised for its nutrient profile, this review reveals that its real-world impact on adult bone strength remains minimal, highlighting the need for rigorous trials using well-defined yogurt formulations.



Review: Impact of yogurt consumption on bone health markers in adults with or without osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: siamionau pavel / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers evaluated the effects of yogurt intake on bone health in adults.

Yogurt is a coagulated dairy product obtained from milk fermentation by the symbiotic action of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Despite highly similar biochemical compositions of yogurt and milk, the former offers unique nutritional benefits due to the metabolic activity of these bacteria, which can synthesize vitamins and other biologically active compounds.

In adulthood, bone formation slows while bone resorption increases, which may gradually lead to bone mass loss, resulting in fragility fractures. Calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus are essential for bone health and physiology. Yogurt is a good source of protein, potassium, calcium, vitamins, zinc, and selenium, many of which are known to augment bone health and growth.

The higher levels of vitamins K and B and enhanced mineral ionization in yogurt compared to milk have led to suggestions that yogurt may help improve and sustain bone health. However, current evidence on the effects of yogurt intake on bone health is inconsistent, with neutral and positive associations reported across studies. Moreover, there are limited systematic reviews on yogurt intake and bone health.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of yogurt on bone health in adults. First, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1970 and 2023, with an updated PubMed search conducted through December 31, 2024. Eligible studies included adults without or with osteoporosis and examined yogurt intake compared to placebo, non-fermented dairy counterparts, no yogurt intake, or standard osteoporosis treatments.

Observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and non-randomized interventions were eligible. Titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were screened, followed by deduplication and full-text reviews. The team extracted data on study characteristics, yogurt intake and dosage, population demographics, intervention duration, and exposure. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias.

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was adopted to examine the certainty of evidence. Further, the team performed a random-effects meta-analysis when measurements were adequately homogeneous. Two separate meta-analyses were conducted; one included studies reporting hazard ratios, and the other pooled continuous femoral bone mineral density (BMD) using standardized mean difference, as no eligible interventional trials were ultimately identified.

Literature search identified 1,302 records, of which only 12 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion, corresponding to 14 studies. Selected studies were observational in design and comprised different adult populations, including postmenopausal females, and assessed endpoints such as fracture risk, BMD, and bone turnover markers. Only one study specifically investigated yogurt intake, while others assessed yogurt intake as part of a broader milk category or total dairy food intake.

Most studies were conducted in the United States (US), followed by Europe and Asia. However, US studies included populations from only two independent cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study and Framingham Original Cohort and its derivative cohorts. Two studies reported that yogurt intake was significantly associated with improved BMD, bone-related biomarkers, and osteoporosis risk.

Specifically, one study found a protective effect on radius osteoporosis risk in high-frequency consumers of yogurt compared to non-consumers, and another study found higher femoral neck and total hip BMD in females with the highest intakes of yogurt compared to those with the lowest intakes. Further, one additional study indicated a weak association between yogurt consumption and protective effects on hip fractures.

In meta-analyses, no significant associations were observed between yogurt intake and hip fracture risk at reported consumption levels. However, yogurt intake had a significantly positive effect on femoral BMD, albeit its magnitude was clinically negligible (SMD ≈ 0.009), indicating minimal impact on skeletal health. The methodological quality of included evidence was considered satisfactory to support meta-analysis conclusions, but the certainty of evidence for BMD and hip fracture risk was low, largely due to reliance on observational data, hazard ratios close to unity, and the absence of dose-response relationships. Importantly, none of the included studies characterized yogurt products in terms of fat content, fortification, or viable bacterial cultures, limiting mechanistic interpretation.

While most studies indicated a positive trend of yogurt intake on bone health, the evidence was insufficient to support that yogurt intake helps in BMD improvements or fracture prevention in adults. High-quality RCTs are required to clarify the effects of yogurt intake, especially in those with or at risk for osteopenia or osteoporosis.

Future research must incorporate standardized, well-characterized yogurt products to determine whether live cultures or formulation differences contribute to any potential benefits. Overall, the efficacy of yogurt as a strategy to enhance bone health is not fully substantiated by current evidence.

While often promoted for health benefits, low-calorie diets may carry hidden inflammatory risks, as genetic evidence reveals a subtle link to psoriatic arthritis unseen in vegetarian and gluten-free patterns.



Study: Causal Relationships Between Popular Diets (Low-Calorie, Vegetarian, and Gluten-Free Diets) and Inflammatory Skin Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study. Image Credit: Fuss Sergey / Shuttertock

In a recent study published in the journal Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology, researchers investigated the possible causal relationships between three popular dietary patterns (vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-calorie) and common inflammatory skin diseases (such as psoriasis and acne).

Their findings indicate that low-calorie diets could increase the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis, with a modest effect size (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.10, p=0.008). While gluten-free and vegetarian diets were not linked to any of the studied inflammatory skin diseases, further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Inflammatory skin diseases like acne, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and atopic dermatitis (AD) are chronic conditions involving immune dysregulation and inflammation, impacting patients' quality of life and mental health.

Despite advances in treatment, recurrence and chronic symptoms remain common, prompting interest in lifestyle-based interventions, particularly diet.

Popular dietary patterns like low-calorie, vegetarian, and gluten-free diets have gained attention due to perceived health benefits and growing media promotion.

Low-calorie diets may improve metabolic health and longevity, vegetarian diets provide antioxidants and fiber, and gluten-free diets help individuals with gluten-related disorders. However, poorly balanced diets can cause nutritional deficiencies that negatively affect skin health. 

Previous clinical studies exploring diet–skin disease links have produced inconsistent results due to confounding factors and methodological limitations. Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses genetic variants as proxies for exposures, offers a more reliable approach to assessing causal relationships while minimizing bias and reverse causation.

Researchers followed established reporting guidelines and used an MR design based on three core assumptions: genetic variants must be associated with the exposure (diet type), independent of confounders, and affect the outcome (skin disease) only through that exposure.

The exposures were three diet types (vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-calorie), and the outcomes were four inflammatory skin diseases (acne, psoriasis, AD, and PsA). Genetic data for the diets were obtained from the UK Biobank (64,949 participants), while disease data were sourced from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including up to 462,933 samples.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with each diet were selected as instrumental variables, with only SNPs showing F-statistics above 10 included to ensure strength and validity.

Due to limited genome-wide significant variants, a relaxed significance threshold (p<5×10⁻⁵) with linkage disequilibrium clumping was applied, and MR-PRESSO was additionally used to conduct a global test for pleiotropy and identify potential outlier SNPs.

Five MR methods were applied, namely inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode, with IVW as the main analytical approach.

Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were assessed using methods such as Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger intercept.

The MR analysis using the IVW method found that a low-calorie diet had a statistically significant association with an increased risk of developing PsA (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.10, p=0.008).

In contrast, vegetarian and gluten-free diets were not linked to a higher or lower risk of PsA. No significant causal relationships were found between any of the three diets and the other inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, acne, or AD).

Although heterogeneity was observed in the vegetarian diet–psoriasis analysis, a multiplicative random-effects IVW model was applied and confirmed no significant association. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots, indicated no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or major bias.

The authors emphasized that the observed association was small, and that limited statistical power and potential measurement limitations in dietary phenotypes may have reduced the ability to detect subtle effects. No correction for multiple testing was applied, underscoring the need for caution.

This study is the first to use MR to explore causal relationships between popular dietary patterns and inflammatory skin diseases.

The findings indicate that a low-calorie diet may slightly increase the risk of psoriatic arthritis, while vegetarian and gluten-free diets show no significant effects on psoriasis, acne, or atopic dermatitis.

The authors suggest that prolonged calorie restriction might trigger nutrient deficiencies affecting immune balance and inflammation, possibly explaining the elevated PsA risk. This finding contrasts with common expectations that calorie restriction is uniformly anti-inflammatory, highlighting the complexity of dietary effects.

Key strengths include a genetically informed design that minimizes confounding and reverse causation. However, limitations such as lenient SNP selection thresholds, low statistical power, self-reported dietary data, potential sample overlap, absence of multiple-testing correction, and limited ethnic diversity restrict the generalizability of the findings.

Additionally, the small effect sizes and lack of multivariable adjustments mean results should be viewed as preliminary. 

Future studies with larger, more diverse samples, better-defined dietary measures, and multivariable or mediation analyses are needed to confirm causal pathways. In conclusion, while the study suggests a possible link between low-calorie diets and PsA, these findings remain exploratory and require validation before informing dietary recommendations.

A new study using continuous glucose monitors and wearable trackers uncovers a surprising twist in pregnancy health. This shows that more daily movement could mean higher overnight blood sugar, challenging assumptions about exercise and glucose control.

Study: Daytime physical activity and nighttime glucose levels in individuals with pregnancy hyperglycemia: linking wearable activity trackers to continuous glucose monitoring. Image credit: Thanakorn.P/Shutterstock.com

Pregnancy hyperglycemia increases the risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies and of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life. Effective glucose control mitigates these risks. A recent feasibility study, published in Frontiers in Endocrinology, explores how blood glucose levels during the night (midnight to 6 AM) vary with the level of daytime physical activity or sedentary behavior, in women with pregnancy hyperglycemia.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational glucose intolerance (GGI) are both classed together as pregnancy hyperglycemia. In most patients with high blood glucose levels, the therapeutic goal is to achieve good control of daytime glucose levels. This is often because of the difficulty of measuring nighttime glucose levels.

However, the commonly used morning fasting glucose measurement reflects the nighttime glucose level. Nocturnal hyperglycemia, typically defined as elevated glucose between 12-6 AM, has been linked to LGA births and the need for pharmacologic treatment during pregnancy. Increased fasting glucose concentrations are linked to LGA babies and to the future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The practical difficulties of tracking nocturnal glycemia are largely overcome by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). CGM is unique in its ability to evaluate 24-hour blood glucose variations. The development of wearable tracking sensors that monitor 24-hour movement patterns is an advance that, combined with CGM, offers “a powerful, scalable means to assess the dynamic interplay between health behaviors and glucose regulation.” 

The current study was a secondary analyses of a feasibility trial on the combined use of CGM and continuous movement devices in this patient population. The scientists performed a secondary analysis of the data from both types of devices, seeking to identify associations between them.

The study included 13 patients at about 31 weeks of pregnancy. They were monitored for a week with the Dexcom G6 CGM and the ActiGraph Insight Watch (a continuous movement device). The former records interstitial glucose levels every five minutes. In this study, the nighttime values collected by CGM were included.

Physical activity was graded as light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary behavior (SED). A model converted the activity data into metabolic equivalents of task (METs) for the periods during which the individual wore the monitoring device. At least 600 minutes of valid recording on the activity monitor was required for inclusion in the analysis.

Nighttime glucose levels were graphed to show the percentage of total recording time when the mean glucose concentrations remained in the normal range, and the area under the curve (AUC) was derived.

Most participants were White, with a median of 61 minutes of MVPA vs 456 minutes (7.6 hours) of SED. In this cohort, the median for mean nighttime glucose levels was 91, while glucose values remained in range 85% of the time. Thus, the percentage of time in range (%TIR; 60–99 mg/dL) was 85%.

Values falling outside the range were mostly those that were above 99 mg/dL, with <1% of test values being below range.

After adjusting for gestational age and device wear time, the researchers found that the mean glucose concentration increased by 0.86 mg/dL with each ten-minute addition to total MVPA. Similarly, an increase in AUC of 313 mg/dL occurred with this level of increase in MVPA. Similar trends were absent with LPA or sedentary behavior.

These findings contradict current evidence from daytime readings, where increased physical activity reduces blood glucose levels in individuals with hyperglycemia. This requires further research into the altered interaction of hormonal and physiological changes in pregnancy with activity patterns, especially as sedentary behavior or light physical activity did not predict nighttime glucose levels.

One possible reason for this unexpected finding is that people who move more vigorously during the daytime may eat more afterwards, especially carbohydrates. This hypothesis could not be tested due to the lack of accurate dietary data. Future studies should use objective dietary assessments to identify how this affects the interaction between physical activity and blood glucose control.

Another possibility is that the participants had disturbed sleep, which adversely affects blood glucose regulation. Either way, it is important to validate and address this pattern because high nighttime glucose levels increase LGA risk, and are more likely to predict severe hyperglycemia and future diabetes risk

This is the first study to combine CGM and activity sensors to explore associations between nighttime blood glucose levels (rather than daytime glucose monitoring) and daytime behavioral patterns. This adds precision to the association.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of combining these technologies to provide data that could guide tailored adaptive feedback systems.

Improvements in glucose and activity monitoring technology hold great promise for improving scientific and clinical understanding and supporting the development of personalized, data-driven glucose management tools during pregnancy.

Future research should include a larger sample size, besides continuous dietary and sleep assessments, coupled with CGM and behavioral monitoring.

The authors suggest that using phone cameras to record meal and self-reported data, could capture 24-hour lifestyle patterns more effectively. This would shed light on the complex interrelationships of sleep, dietary factors, biological rhythms, and glucose regulation in pregnancy.

ATLANTA (Oct. 20, 2025) — Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team training camp to be held from October 22-30 at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center, home of the 2025 NWSL Shield winners Kansas City Current. The latter part of that camp – from Oct. 27-29 – will be held concurrently with the senior USWNT's visit to Kansas City for its match against New Zealand on Oct. 29 at CPKC Stadium. The U.S. U-20 WNT will attend that match.

This camp will be the first for new U.S. U-20 WNT head coach Vicky Jepson, who comes to U.S. Soccer after a long stint at Tottenham Hotspur where she served as first team senior assistant head coach and for a period, as interim head coach.

The age cut off for the 2026 FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2006. This roster is made up equally of players born in 2006 (12) and 2007 (12) and features seven NWSL players, one NWSL player out on loan, three players from the USL Super League, one from Canada's Northern Super League, ten college players and two youth club players. Zoe Matthews of the Houston Dash is currently playing in Spain with Dux Logrones.

Forward Sealy Strawn of Dallas Trinity FC is a University of North Carolina commit who was named the 2024/25 USL Super League Young Player of the Year. She has one goal this season for Dallas. Midfielder Ashlyn Puerta has scored seven goals for Sporting JAX so far this season.

Five of the seven NWSL players – Trinity Armstrong (San Diego Wave), Katie Scott (Kansas City Current), Mary Long (Kansas City Current), Ainsley McCammon (Seattle Reign) and Kennedy Fuller (Angel City FC) – played in the 2024 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, and Kansas City Current forward Alex Pfeiffer would have if not for a knee injury. The three Kansas City Current players will of course get the convenience of training at their home facility. Fuller has scored four goals so far this season for ACFC, good for third-best on the team.

The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will take place next year in Poland from Sept. 5-27. The USA is one of 12 nations to already qualify for the tournament, doing so at the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship last June. The tournament will feature 24 countries.

Goalkeepers (3): Charlotte Burge (Carolina Ascent FC; Virginia Beach, Va.), Pepper Escher (UMass; Brewster, Mass.), Kealey Titmuss (Penn State; Grand Blanc, Mich.)

The Latest | Oct 20, 2025

U.S. Soccer announced Monday its roster for the United States Under-20 Women's National Team training camp, which includes three Kansas City Current players. Forwards Mary Long and Alex Pfeiffer along with defender Katie Scott will participate in the camp from Oct. 22-30 at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center, the KC Current's training site.  

Both 18 years old, Long and Scott have been regulars on the U-20 circuit since the beginning of this year. At just 17, this is Pfeiffer's first call-up at the U-20 level. They are three of seven National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) players at this camp. 

The latter part of the upcoming U-20 camp – from Oct. 27-29 – will be held concurrently with the senior U.S. Women's National Team's visit to Kansas City for its match against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The U.S. U-20 WNT will attend that match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium purpose-built for a professional women's sports team. It will be the USWNT's first-ever visit to CPKC Stadium. Limited tickets are still available for purchase HERE.  

Players at the U-20 training camp will continue to vie for a spot on the roster for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Poland. The Stars and Stripes qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup after finishing among the top four at the 2025 Concacaf U-20 Championship in Costa Rica in June. Long totaled three goals and an assist – including a brace against Puerto Rico – at the Concacaf Championship while Scott netted a goal and donned the captain's band during a group stage match. Long also had a goal and an assist vs. Costa Rica.  

Long was a vital component of the USA's bronze-medal performance at the 2024 FIFA U-17 World Cup where she played in all six matches and earned a start in five. She scored against South Korea in addition to adding an assist and drawing a penalty against Colombia during the group stage. She scored twice in a friendly against Brazil during her first national team call-up for a training camp in preparation of the U-17 World Cup in 2024. 

Pfeiffer has trained and competed with the national youth program at the U-15, U-16 and U-17 levels since 2022. She won the 2022 Concacaf U-15 Championship before helping her U-16 squad claim the 2023 French Mondial World Cup. She began playing with the U-17 squad as a 15-year-old and scored a hat trick in a September 2023 friendly against Japan, one month before becoming the youngest player to ever sign with the Current. 

Scott first hit the international scene with the U.S. U-15 National Team. She helped that group win the 2022 Concacaf U-15 Championship before leading the U-16 team to the French Mondial World Cup title the following year. During her time with the U-17 team in 2024, Scott earned gold at the Concacaf U-17 Championship and bronze at the FIFA U-17 World Cup. Her first international goal came against Panama in the opening match of the Concacaf U-17 Championship.

The U.S. U-20 WNT will attend that match.

Winder, a native of North Logan, Utah, is having a stellar freshman campaign for Utah State. She has started all 16 matches for one of the Mountain West's top defensive units, ranking second on the team in minutes played with 1,404 of a possible 1,440. The Aggie defense is limiting opponents to 0.81 goals per game, on pace for fifth-best in program history, while posting seven shutouts. USU opponents are averaging just 2.8 shots on goal per contest this season.

This camp will be the first for new U.S. U-20 WNT head coach Vicky Jepson, who comes to U.S. Soccer after a long stint at Tottenham Hotspur where she served as first team senior assistant head coach and for a period, as interim head coach.

The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will take place next year in Poland from Sept. 5-27. The USA is one of 12 nations to already qualify for the tournament, doing so at the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship last June. The tournament will feature 24 countries.

UP NEXT

Utah State (6-5-5, 3-1-3 MW) will remain on the road this weekend as it travels to face San Diego State on Sunday, Oct. 19, at 1 p.m. (MT). The match will be streamed on Mountain West Network.

Gio Reyna (left) and Folarin Balogun Getty Images

With international duty over for another month, European soccer's American stars were back on club duty over the weekend and experienced fluctuating fortunes.

It went well for Folarin Balogun in Ligue 1, but Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie have more questions to answer.

Welcome to this week's USMNT Player Tracker.

Advertisement

Folarin Balogun needed to start showing signs of his true capabilities.

With his status as the USMNT's starting striker fading and players such as Josh Sargent and Haji Wright — both enjoying resurgent seasons in England's second-tier Championship — breathing down his neck, it was high time he returned to scoring ways for club and country if he wanted to give himself a chance of going to the 2026 World Cup as the main man, as he was at the Copa America a year earlier.

So he will look back at the two most recent USMNT camps, where he scored twice in the four games, and his improvement with Monaco as a timely revival.

Last season was largely one to forget for the 24-year-old on the domestic front as persistent injuries reduced him to just 13 Ligue 1 appearances across the 34 fixtures (six of them starts) and four goals.

Despite his own injury issues, Sargent managed 15 goals (and five assists) for Norwich in the same campaign, and has scored five in 10 games this time. At the same level, Wright rode his own injury travails to hit 12 goals in 20 league appearances for Coventry in 2024-25 and has started the current campaign on fire — eight in 10 matches, putting him top of the division's scoring chart.

So it was essential for Balogun that he started firing over the water in French football.

Momentum is key, and he built on his most recent USMNT strike — in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador — and responded to Wright's brace against Australia four days later by coming off the bench to score in Monaco's 1-1 draw away to Angers on Saturday.

The New York-born forward was the only USMNT player to play a significant part for his European club as domestic leagues resumed this weekend after this latest international window, with most being benched by their coaches to ensure their full recovery following those friendlies in Texas and Colorado and the long-haul journeys back across the Atlantic.

Introduced as a 62nd-minute substitute at Raymond Kopa stadium, Balogun had only been on the field for 10 minutes when he took advantage of a Takumi Minamino deflection to score emphatically from inside the box.

On a weekend when Haji endured a rare blank in Coventry's 2-0 home win against Blackburn and Sargent only managed one shot on target as Norwich lost 1-0 to visitors Bristol City, it was advantage Balogun in what will remain a fascinating race to become top pick to lead the U.S. line going into the summer.

He is one of the Premier League's best left-backs and a major asset for the USMNT. So seeing injury-hit Antonee Robinson stalled on a combined 61 minutes of top-flight football for Fulham this season, including just 10 since the end of August, and missing altogether once again for their defeat by Arsenal on Saturday, will be a concern.

Having travelled to the national camp for this month's games — Pochettino conceded Robinson had “a minor problem with his leg, a bit of pain”, which prevented him playing a full part — the left-back was unavailable again back in Europe as the injury problems mount up for Fulham coach Marco Silva.

The west London club have now lost three league games in a row, with Robinson's absence for 260 of those 270 minutes against Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Arsenal keenly felt. “When we're talking about a player like Robinson, for example, you know the impact that he's had in the last two or three seasons in all aspects of the game,” Silva told reporters in the build-up to the latter defeat.

Given the 28-year-old is trying to work his way back from knee surgery in May, it seems he needs more time to fully recover from the operation and any related fitness issues.

There is plenty of time for him to return and recapture his best form before the World Cup begins in June, of course, so nobody will be panicking yet. But both club and country have missed those trademark marauding runs and attacking contributions.

“He's still young. It's not like playing in Gladbach is worse for him. Maybe it's better for him because he'd play more games and that's very important for him.”

That was former Germany international turned LA Galaxy forward Marco Reus' stance on Gio Reyna after the American departed Borussia Dortmund for fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach over the summer. Speaking to ESPN, Reus added: “I trust in him and I see a very good player in him. You'll see good games from him this season.”

His words had a familiar ring. So often it's about potential with Reyna; what he will show when he gets chances, how he just needs games. And it is of course true that, at 22 (23 next month), he is still young and has time on his side.

But in this crucial period ahead of the World Cup, his move to Monchengladbach is yet to yield those crucial minutes, or tangible proof that he can become a consistent performer.

Left on the bench for Friday's visit to Union Berlin, Reyna came on after an hour and finished Gladbach's 3-1 defeat with only a stoppage-time yellow card to show for a low-key performance.

Chris Richards has been building a convincing body of work to underline his credentials as one of the first picks for Pochettino in next summer's tournament. That three-man central defence under Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace has brought the best out of him, and he has become a key performer for the south London side.

But the Palace back line were severely tested on Saturday during their 3-3 draw at home against Tyler Adams' Bournemouth, and Richards was reminded of the perils of opponents blessed with searing pace.

That's what Antoine Semenyo has, and he used it to get the better of the American, leaving him second-best in a foot race in the buildup to Bournemouth's second goal, which gave them a 2-0 half-time lead.

Being so exposed can be a mental hurdle for a defender, but Richards showed the resilience to redeem his display by winning a corner ahead of Palace's added-time equaliser.

He was not alone in making mistakes. Palace captain and fellow centre-back Marc Guehi also made a rare error leading to a goal, but Richards and company kept going to ensure they have still lost just once this season across 13 matches in all competitions.

After his recent goal against Wolfsburg, Noahkai Banks made his second consecutive start in Germany's Bundesliga for Augsburg in the 1-1 draw away to Koln on Saturday. It is no mean feat for an 18-year-old to be starting games in defence at such a high level, and he played a solid 85 minutes.

Weston McKennie's yo-yo club fortunes continued as he was back on the bench as Juventus suffered a surprise 2-0 defeat at Como. McKennie eventually came on in the 77th minute, just before Como doubled their lead, and although he tried to make a difference with three passes into the final third, Juventus are now winless in four Serie A matches.

It never rains for embattled Sheffield Wednesday and Ethan Horvath in the English Championship, it pours. The goalkeeper, on loan from fellow second-tier side Cardiff, was sent off in second-half stoppage time on Saturday for clattering Charlton's Isaac Olaofe outside the box. It meant defender Liam Palmer had to go in goal as the clock ticked down on a 2-1 away defeat for financially-stricken Wednesday, who now do not have a senior 'keeper available for their midweek home game against high-flying Middlesbrough with Horvath suspended. Academy kid Logan Stretch, 18, may make his debut.

Midfielder Aidan Morris will hope to be back in the visitors' line-up for that one, after starting their 2-1 defeat of Ipswich on the bench. Morris started against Ecuador and featured as a substitute against Australia, which was played in the early hours of Wednesday UK time, so was rested for the Friday night fixture, only coming on for the final 20 minutes, but will want to pick up where he left off with Middlesbrough just a point behind Wright's table-topping Coventry.

Mike Penders is currently on loan at Strasbourg, but he spent some time with the Chelsea first team during the summer.

Penders linked up with his parent club at the Club World Cup and was a member of the squad that went on to win the competition.

However, the goalkeeper did not play a single minute of football in America and has since joined Strasbourg for the season.

Penders did not impress the French media with his latest display in Strasbourg's 3-3 draw with Paris Saint-Germain.

With Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen being Chelsea‘s first-choice and second-choice goalkeepers during the 2024/25 season, Penders did not get an opportunity at this year's Club World Cup.

However, the 20-year-old still appeared to enjoy his time at the tournament and had some very positive things to say about his teammates.

In a recent interview with Het Laatste Nieuws, Penders said: “It was good to tag along and get to know the group. You get a sense of the high level of training during those five weeks. All the guys were pretty friendly, too. How do you approach that? You come in, shake everyone's hand. I'm the kind of person who immediately starts talking.

“Ultimately, you realise they're all just great guys. Every dressing room is a bit similar, you know. You have a group of Spanish speakers, a group of English people. You end up playing cards together.”

Once the Belgian returns to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea are expecting big things from him.

The feeling at Cobham is that Penders will be Chelsea's No.1 one day. It means that either Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen is likely to depart west London at some point.

While Penders did not have a great game against PSG as he went on to concede three goals, the former Genk man is still having a bright campaign at Strasbourg.

In seven Ligue 1 appearances, Penders has been able to keep three clean sheets. He also has a save percentage of 70%, which is fairly good.

Ultimately, if Penders maintains his form throughout the season, Chelsea should keep the Belgium Under-21 international at the club next term and give him an opportunity.

He can compete with Sanchez to be No.1, while Jorgensen is loaned out or sold. The Denmark international has not looked convincing during this campaign.

Jorgensen really struggled against Lincoln City, for example, a League One side.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

The 2026 Fifa World Cup and other major international soccer tournaments will be fully licensed in the Football Manager video game series following a landmark deal between developer Sports Interactive (SI) and world soccer's governing body.

Next summer's tournament in North America will be the first to be covered by the multi-year partnership, with SI releasing a dedicated international management module in a future update to the game, which launches on 4th November.

Official kits for all 48 participating nations will be featured in the game, as will authentic broadcast graphics for the game's fully revamped match engine. The deal also includes the Fifa Club World Cup and the Fifa Women's World Cup, with women's soccer included in the series for the very first time.

“Revealing this partnership with Fifa is an incredibly historic moment for the studio,” said Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson.

“Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. 

“To be able to do that with the support of Fifa with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we're delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. 

“And this is just the start of our relationship – stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond.”

The deal marks the first time a Fifa competition is included in a video game since the organisation's high profile split from EA Sports. It is unclear whether the 2026 World Cup will be licensed to any simulation title, with reports earlier this year linking 2K Sports to the licence.

Football Manager 26 is considered to be the most significant release for the long-running series in a generation, with SI shifting from a proprietary game engine to the more advanced Unity platform which is widely used across the industry.

It has proved, however, to be a challenging transition, with last year's release cancelled due to concerns about the quality of the game and the need to give developers more time.



Football Manager has not traditionally been reliant on flashy graphics and third-party intellectual property, but advances in technology and the growing profile of the series mean SI has become more involved in licensing agreements.

Football Manager 2026, for example, will also be the first time the Premier League is officially represented, while a deal with Uefa for the Champions League is in place.

This deal with Fifa is a significant moment for the studio as it embarks on its new era.

As for Fifa, it will be delighted to have at least some gaming presence ahead of the World Cup next year having so far failed to replace EA Sports in the simulation space.

The split with EA was a financial blow but it also denied Fifa a valuable source of engagement that would have been hugely beneficial to the Club World Cup this past summer.

While Football Manager isn't a like for like replacement, it's a welcome step in the right direction and exposes Fifa's IP to a brand new audience.

Home > News > Zabiri Risked Everything to Help Morocco Win U-20 World Cup

The 20-year-old didn't have an easy path to the U20 World Cup.  

Rabat – Yassir Zabiri made history in the U20 World Cup final. The Moroccan striker scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Argentina, giving Morocco its first FIFA World Cup title at any level. He ended as the tournament's top scorer and the man of the match in the final. 

The 20-year-old didn't have an easy path to the U20 World Cup. His club, Famalicão in Portugal, didn't want to release him for the tournament – insisting that he instead stay and play in the league. But, Zabiri pushed back. He told Morocco's coach, Mohamed Ouahb, that he was going to join the team no matter what.

Zabiri made a promise to coach Wahbi: he would help Morocco win the World Cup and become the top scorer, no matter the cost. 

“Zerhouni fought until the end to join us, but his club refused. He insisted on being present, and at the last moment, he told me he would try again and went to convince his coach, along with the club captain. The coach of Famalicão threatened him with losing his place in the team, and he replied that he would return as a world champion and the team's top scorer, and if that happens, he deserves it.” coach Mohamed Ouahbi said in a press conference.  

With his five goals, Zabiri broke Mohsine Yajour's record of three goals from the 2005 U20 World Cup in the Netherlands becoming Morocco's all-time top scorer in the history of the tournament.

A revamped ‘international management module' will be added to Football Manager 26 next year

Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has signed a multi-year partnership with FIFA.

The deal will bring official FIFA competitions to the game, including the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.

This includes the addition of FIFA World Cup 26 in Football Manager 26, including the official kits of all 48 teams (once they've been confirmed) as well as official broadcast graphics and tournament branding.

When it's released on November 4, Football Manager 26 won't feature international football management (except for FM26 Mobile on Netflix) and will be focused solely on club management.

However, Sports Interactive says a revamped ‘International Management module' will be added to the game in a content update next year, ahead of FIFA World Cup 26 taking place.

Football Manager 26 will be available in four different versions when it's released. The ‘main' Football Manager 26 will be available on PC on November 4 via Steam, the Epic Games Store and the Windows Store, and will be available on PC Game Pass.

A streamlined version called Football Manager 26 Console will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, also on November 4, and will also be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

— Football Manager (@FootballManager) October 17, 2025



Football Manager 26 Touch, which is made with touchscreens in mind, will be released on Apple Arcade on November 4 alongside the other versions, with a Nintendo Switch version following on December 4.

Finally, Netflix subscribers will get Football Manager 26 Mobile, which appears to be an update of the previous FM24 Mobile, and will be the only version of the game not switching to the Unity engine.

The last Football Manager game was Football Manager 2024, which was released back in November 2023. After multiple delays, Football Manager 25 was officially cancelled in February 2025, with Sega and developer Sports Interactive saying its focus would shift to the next game in the series.

The latest instalment will mark the game's shift to the Unity engine, as well as the official Premier League license and the addition of women's football for the first time.

Real Madrid and France legend Zinedine Zidane reportedly sees just one European club as being on the same level as Los Blancos – and it's not Barcelona.

Zidane, 53, has, without doubt, already etched his name into the history books of Real Madrid.

As a player, he lit up the Santiago Bernabeu with elegant midfield play, helping the side win six trophies - one Champions League, one Intercontinental Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one La Liga title, and two Spanish Super Cups – between 2001 and 2006.

On the international stage, he featured in France's 1998 World Cup-winning side, scoring twice against Brazil in the final, as well as playing in the Euro 2000-winning team, which triumphed over Italy.

Advert

After retiring from playing in 2006, Zidane embarked on a career in coaching, firstly taking charge of Real Madrid's youth setup before making the step up to manage the senior team in 2016 until 2018.

‘Zizou' then returned in 2019 before leaving once more in 2021; since then, he has been without a managerial role.

And despite having managed at a senior level for a combined four years, the Frenchman still managed to guide Los Blancos to 11 trophies - two La Liga titles, three Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, and two FIFA Club World Cups – over his two reigns as Real boss.

Advert

It has been widely reported that he is earmarked for the France job, with current manager Didier Deschamps set to take a step down following the 2026 World Cup.

But which club does Zidane put on the same level as his beloved Madrid?

Given Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United's success over the past century, you'd be forgiven for thinking Zidane named one of the aforementioned teams, but, according to a ‘close friend', it is another club that the 53-year-old puts on the same level as Madrid.

Speaking to Source 1, relayed by Foot Mundo, in 2024, a close friend of Zidane explained how he would “go back to Juventus” having played for the Turin club between 1996 and 2001, as well as possibly considering “the French national team or Bayern Munich” as future destinations.

Advert

“He sees Bayern like Real Madrid: an institution, a club with a great past and excellent working conditions,” the source reportedly said.

“The two clubs have many similarities in the way they work. In this sense, he has never rejected this idea.

“Zizou works like a German. He is goal-oriented, structured and very detail-oriented.

Advert

“In this sense, he would undoubtedly fit well. But if the Munich leaders want to bring him in, they must give him sporting power and respond to his wishes.”

It must be noted that it is highly unlikely that Zidane will coach Bayern in the near future, given the fact current head coach, Vincent Kompany, helped the Bavarian side win the Bundesliga in 2024/25 with the six-time European champions currently six points clear at the top of the German league after seven matches so far this term.","{'href': 'https://www.sportbible.com', 'title': 'SPORTbible'}","soccer"

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Nigeria will not be going ahead with planned friendlies against Venezuela and Colombia in the USA next month, after the Super Eagles qualified for the World Cup playoffs which take place in Morocco at the same time.

The NFF had announced the two games last month, with the Super Eagles scheduled to play Venezuela on November 14 at the Shell Energy Stadium in Houston and Colombia on November 18 at Citi Field in New York.

Tickets for both games were already on sale, but a top NFF official told ESPN at the time that the games were conditional on the team's World Cup fate, and would only proceed if Nigeria avoided being drawn into the CAF World Cup playoff round, either by qualifying directly for the World Cup, or failing to make it entirely.

Last week, the Super Eagles beat Benin Republic to qualify for the World Cup playoffs, which take place from November 13 to 16, and officials told ESPN that the friendlies had now been shelved.

""We had a clause in the contract for the games covering this eventuality, if we qualified for the playoffs,"" an official told ESPN. ""So we will not be going ahead with the matches any more.

""Our goal is to concentrate on the playoffs now and qualify from Africa and then focus on the intercontinental playoffs.""

Also qualified for the CAF playoffs are Cameroon, Congo DR and Gabon.

Nigeria, on 41, are the highest-ranked of the four teams in the Africa playoffs. They will play Gabon, who are the lowest-ranked team at 77. The winner of that encounter plays the winner of the other semifinal between Cameroon (ranked 54) and Congo DR (ranked 60) for Africa's sole ticket to the intercontinental playoffs in Mexico in March.

For Nigeria, the playoffs would also serve as early preparation for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. The Super Eagles, runners-up at the 2023 tournament in Ivory Coast, begin their Group C campaign against Tanzania on December 23 in Fez before facing Tunisia and Uganda.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

We look at who could be a part of the future player pool.

The 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup is over, and the United States exited in the quarterfinals for the fifth straight time. Despite the disappointing loss in that quarterfinal to eventual champions Morocco, the United States still showed a lot of promise in defeating New Caledonia and France in the group stage and Italy in the Round of 16.

The USMNT may be in the middle of its final stretch of preparations before they co-host the 2026 World Cup, but it's not too early to take a look beyond that tournament to see who could factor into the player pool for the next cycle. The U-20 World Cup is a great way for some of the younger talent to get real experience in an international competition and for coaches to evaluate how they would look on future national teams.

The USMNT U-20s had a few standout performers during the U-20 World Cup. While none of these players are in line to be called in before next summer's World Cup, we take a look at four players who could be a part of the USMNT during the next cycle.

Benjamin Cremaschi - Midfielder, Parma

Benja Cremaschi is the U-20 player that is probably best destined to wind up on the USMNT. He made his USMNT debut in a September 2023 friendly against Oman and has three senior national team caps to date. However, as an 18-year-old on the national team that rose quickly through the ranks, he needed some more experience. He's received that as a member of the 2024 Olympic team, where he made two appearances as the youngest member of the American squad that exited in the quarterfinals. Now, he was called upon to be one of the leaders of this U-20 team as they competed in the U-20 World Cup, and that he did. Benja Cremaschi scored 5 goals and added 2 assists, outpacing three other players to win the Golden Boot.

Cremaschi will likely get a shot to re-enter the USMNT player pool after the end of the World Cup next summer. His recent move from Inter Miami to Parma will be a big boost to his confidence if he can get some consistent playing time to continue his development.

Niko Tsakiris - Midfielder, San Jose Earthquakes

A lot of people who didn't know Niko Tsakiris' name before the start of the U-20 World Cup know his name now. He scored two goals during the tournament, including one against Italy in the Round of 16. The San Jose Earthquakes midfielder could find an opportunity to work himself into the senior national team mix next fall if he can continue to progress and build upon the good things he did at the U-20 World Cup. San Jose just missed out on qualifying for the MLS Cup Playoffs, but 2026 can be a pivotal year for the 20-year-old as he hopefully has a breakout season for his club to get that senior national team call-up.

Nolan Norris - Defender, FC Dallas

Nolan Norris had a pretty good performance at the U-20 World Cup. The FC Dallas defender had a brace against New Caledonia in the opening match, and helped the team to 2 clean sheets. He now gets back to Dallas in time for the MLS Cup Playoffs. As a defender, Norris will have a shot to compete in the next cycle if he can continue to improve. Hopefully his experience in Chile at the U-20 World Cup will allow him to elevate his game to the next level. He will need to get stronger to compete with international level strikers on defense, but you can see the upside when he's on the field.

Cole Campbell - Forward, Borussia Dortmund

Cole Campbell is someone Dortmund fans hope is the next great American to feature at the club. The 19-year-old scored two goals at the U-20 World Cup, and while he didn't have the best performances up top for the United States, he has a real chance to factor into the next cycle. Getting onto the field for Dortmund will help his confidence and his development immensely, and playing in the Bundesliga has traditionally been a boost for Americans. If he can get some consistent playing time, we will see Cole Campbell in a camp after the World Cup is done.

The U-20 World Cup is always a tournament where you can see the promise of tomorrow's international stars. The hope is that some of these players from the United States squad will continue to improve and one day we will see them on the field as part of the next generational wave of American talent to represent the USMNT.

A revamped ‘international management module' will be added to Football Manager 26 next year

Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has signed a multi-year partnership with FIFA.

The deal will bring official FIFA competitions to the game, including the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.

This includes the addition of FIFA World Cup 26 in Football Manager 26, including the official kits of all 48 teams (once they've been confirmed) as well as official broadcast graphics and tournament branding.

When it's released on November 4, Football Manager 26 won't feature international football management (except for FM26 Mobile on Netflix) and will be focused solely on club management.

However, Sports Interactive says a revamped ‘International Management module' will be added to the game in a content update next year, ahead of FIFA World Cup 26 taking place.

Football Manager 26 will be available in four different versions when it's released. The ‘main' Football Manager 26 will be available on PC on November 4 via Steam, the Epic Games Store and the Windows Store, and will be available on PC Game Pass.

A streamlined version called Football Manager 26 Console will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, also on November 4, and will also be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

— Football Manager (@FootballManager) October 17, 2025



Football Manager 26 Touch, which is made with touchscreens in mind, will be released on Apple Arcade on November 4 alongside the other versions, with a Nintendo Switch version following on December 4.

Finally, Netflix subscribers will get Football Manager 26 Mobile, which appears to be an update of the previous FM24 Mobile, and will be the only version of the game not switching to the Unity engine.

The last Football Manager game was Football Manager 2024, which was released back in November 2023. After multiple delays, Football Manager 25 was officially cancelled in February 2025, with Sega and developer Sports Interactive saying its focus would shift to the next game in the series.

The latest instalment will mark the game's shift to the Unity engine, as well as the official Premier League license and the addition of women's football for the first time.

Inter Miami CF proudly congratulates forward Mateo Silvetti for his remarkable performance at the FIFA U-20 World Cup, where he helped guide Argentina to a second-place finish. La Albiceleste fell 2-0 to Morocco's U-20 side in the tournament's final.

Silvetti, who joined Inter Miami during the summer transfer window, had a breakout tournament, playing a pivotal role in Argentina's deep run to the championship match. The young attacker scored three decisive goals, each coming in critical knockout-stage moments.

His first goal came in the Round of 16 against Nigeria, sealing Argentina's 4-0 victory and passage to the next round. In the quarterfinals, Silvetti once again struck late, netting the final goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico that secured Argentina's spot in the semifinals. Then, in a hard-fought battle against Colombia, he came off the bench at halftime and delivered the match-winning goal that sent Argentina to the World Cup final.

In the championship match, Silvetti was subbed-on in the 33rd minute after Argentina conceded two early goals. Despite his energetic performance and Argentina's relentless efforts, the team ultimately fell short as Morocco claimed the title.

Silvetti will now return to Inter Miami CF training as the team prepares for its first-round playoff clash against Nashville SC this Friday, October 24 at 8 p.m. ET at Chase Stadium.","{'href': 'https://www.intermiamicf.com', 'title': 'intermiamicf'}","soccer"

The last time Manchester United won at Anfield, Great Britain was still in the European Union, Donald Trump was best known as the presenter of The Apprentice and Leicester City were top of the Premier League. Marcus Rashford had not yet played a first-team game, Arne Slot had not yet entered management and Ruben Amorim was seeing out his playing career in Qatar.

United fans probably thought they would have to wait a little longer for that run to end given their team's miserable opening to the season and Liverpool's imposing start to their title defence, but the Red Devils produced their best performance since the 2024 FA Cup final to win 2-1 on Sunday and remind themselves what it's like to win at the home of your biggest rivals.

Harry Maguire was the man responsible for United winning at Anfield for the first time since a Wayne Rooney strike sunk a Liverpool team in the infancy of Jurgen Klopp's tenure back in January 2016. The defender - who should have scored the decisive goal in last season's fixture - headed home to restore the lead United had established in the second minute through Bryan Mbeumo before Cody Gakpo equalised late in the second half.

Gakpo had hit the woodwork three times before scoring and really should have equalised again with a free header, but he was not the only Liverpool forward who underperformed as Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz all disappointed, be it by missing big chances or failing to create much danger in the first place.

While Slot was left cursing his side's profligacy and for falling behind so early in the game, meaning they played into United's hands, the visitors deserve credit for how they frustrated the champions and refused to let them play how they wanted. The result was also hugely significant for Amorim as it gave him the back-to-back Premier League wins he has craved in his 11 months in charge.

And while the United coach was not quite willing to bask in the glory of the victory and admitted his side had enjoyed some luck, he saw further signs that his team are willing to fight for him and for themselves: ""It was a great win, not a very well played game from our part but a great spirit and that is the only thing I can ask.""

GOAL US unpacks the main storylines from the international break and World Cup qualifying in The Euro XI

Goodbye, international break. Welcome back to the real soccer. The slate of games after international competition are always a little odd: slower, tactically clunkier. It seems as if everyone is still trying to find their feet. 

The result, so often, is a sense of drama and jeopardy. And if you subscribe to that theory, then this was an excellent weekend of evidence. Liverpool lost to Man United at home (which is a weird sentence). Ange Postecoglou got sacked after 39 days (a predictable sentence). And Como are the best story in European football (a charming sentence).

Elsewhere, El Clasico looks pretty intense, and it's still a week away. Man City are maybe back for real this time. And La Liga, in general, is just fed up with everything.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Mikrut honouring his late father with career-best tennis","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/mikrut-challenger-2025-feature","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:38:16 GMT","

Luka Mikrut is living out his childhood dream while honouring the memory of his late father.


The 21-year-old, who is “playing the best tennis of his life”, recently climbed to a career-high No. 159 in the PIF ATP Rankings, in part thanks to his two ATP Challenger Tour trophies earned in the past three months. He also reached the Valencia Challenger final in his most recent outing, extending his run to 19 wins in his past 22 matches.


However, Mikrut is doing it without his father, Mijo, who passed away in 2023.


“He had bad cancer,” Mikrut told ATPTour.com. “He was sick for one year. When they first found out what it was, they told him maybe one or two months. He pulled it out to one year. But it was very hard. Those situations really hit hard. 


“Even before he died, he was really sick and when you are younger, you don't think about it. But when this happens in the family, you start to think about this stuff a bit and it's not easy.”


Mikrut fondly recalls the days he and his father travelled to tournaments together, with Mijo meticulously handling every detail, from organising the coaching plan, booking flights and more. Now, Mikrut is handling that aspect alone. Mikrut's life on the road has not been the same without his father, whose absence he deeply felt while competing shortly after his passing.


“One day it was his funeral and the next day I went to a tournament and I played the day after,” said Mikrut. “I had no chance to do anything.”


There was a moment last year when the emotions came rushing back.


“When I was playing Davis Cup for the second time, I was there and at one point it just hit, ‘He doesn't know it's Davis Cup time, it's in Croatia',” Mikrut said. “It hits hard.”


But to understand Mikrut is to know his resilience. A fitting quote from his favourite movie, Rocky V, is even etched on his right bicep: ""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep moving forward.""


Those words are a source of strength for Mikrut, who said that tattoo was the most painful of the seven he sports.


“Every ink drop was worth it,” he said with a laugh. “Sometimes I remember it and it gets me going, gets me hyped and gives me some extra energy you need to win. You see Rocky in every movie, he is getting beaten a lot and somehow he wins it. Sometimes, actually very often, it's like that in tennis.”




A native of Split — Croatia's second-largest city — Mikrut began playing tennis aged five. His tennis-fanatic grandmother owned videotapes and DVDs of classic matches of Roger Federer, Pete Sampras and others. Mikrut's mother owned a DVD shop in the 2000s. Though DVDs are largely forgotten, those tennis films hold a special place in Mikrut's heart.


“It's a bit nostalgic. I used to watch that all day and since I was young I would put the [headband] around my head and imitate that I'm Federer,” Mikrut said. “I don't watch it anymore, but we still have the player and the tapes. I have one video of Federer and Agassi at the US Open, I don't know which year, but I used to watch it all day, every day.”


Mikrut honed his game at Tennis Klub Split, a renowned breeding ground for Croatian talent that has produced stars including Goran Ivanisevic and Mario Ancic. Dino Prizmic, a contender for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF also trained there. There is a proud tennis legacy in Split, the hometown of the late Nikola Pilic, who passed away in September.


“We are not a big country, there's not many of us in tennis compared to other countries like Italy, France or the United States, but we are doing good results,” said Mikrut.

The champion of this year's Como and Braga Challenger events, Mikrut received congratulatory texts from the former No. 2 Ivanisevic following his triumphs. Mikrut idolised Federer and countryman Ivanisevic as a child.


“[Goran] was the first Croatian to win a Grand Slam,” Mikrut said. “He is some inspiration because you have a guy from your city win on the big scene and you can see that you can do it yourself.”


Mikrut cannot quite pinpoint what has sparked his sudden rise — a surge of more than 200 spots in the PIF ATP Rankings over the past two months — but one thing is certain: every step forward is a way to make his father proud.


“He always pushed me and I always liked to hear from him that he was proud,” Mikrut said. “And I believe he would be very proud now.”

What does it take for a frame to deliver a devilish combination of pace and spin?ByJon LeveyPublished Oct 20, 2025 copy_link

Jon Levey answers your Gear Q&A. Email your question to tennis.comproshop@gmail.com.From my experience, ""tweener"" frames weighing around 300 grams, are the most powerful. However, when reading racquet reviews of these frames I often see that testers seem to miss the ""heavy penetrating"" shots that only heavier racquets seem to generate. So, what type of racquet produces the ""heaviest"" shot?—AlexAlex,In reviews on this site, I'm certainly guilty of using this shorthand without clearly defining it. The traits of a heavy ball are open to interpretation, but it's essentially a shot that carries a wicked combination of speed and topspin that make it more onerous to return; all that rotation feels like there's extra weight on the ball and it takes greater effort to turn it around. If one gets above your shoulders it can seem like you're hitting a brick.

It's different than a shot that only has a lot of pace. That kind of ball can travel through the court quickly, but doesn't carry as much “substance” at contact—it doesn't fight your racquet quite the same way. It needs the accompanying spin to make it heavy. That means you need significant racquet head speed to whip the face up and through contact. When that is combined with stiff polyester strings designed for spin, the ball compresses on the string bed, giving more of an opportunity to put work on it.Basic physics tells us that along with acceleration, mass is the other part of the force equation (f=ma). So, if you're swinging two racquets at the same speed, the heavier one will normally deliver the more forceful ball. (The weight distribution and stiffness of the frames can disrupt this assumption). The sticking point is whether swing speed slows significantly because of the additional weight. It may not seem like much, but for some players an extra five grams placed toward the top of the frame can feel like strapping a piano to the racquet's back.

It may not seem like much, but for some players an extra five grams placed toward the top of the frame can feel like strapping a piano to the racquet's back.

Yet for players accustomed to heavier frames, going down in weight can be equally disruptive. Players who typically use a 315 gram (or more) racquet unstrung, can sometimes find a 300 gram model too whippy and underpowered. Their stock swing doesn't generate the same velocity and penetration. Instead of getting the racquet in motion and letting the mass take over, they need to channel Andry Reblev's aggression to make up the difference.This can cause timing issues and inconsistent contact. As a result, the racquet may slow down in order to center the ball more repeatedly. Meaning shots won't have quite the same pop and heaviness. Under these circumstances, adding a little more weight to frame is a better option than figuring out how to constantly swing it with massive acceleration. Hence, the old adage of a player using the heaviest racquet they can comfortably swing.Another possible reason for the discrepancy, and why lighter frames are tagged with the more powerful label, is because heavier frames are often designed to enhance precision and control.This usually means more flexibility, thinner beams, smaller head sizes and less inherent power, especially outside the sweet spot.Users of these frames typically have the mechanics to consistently make pure contact and provide most of their own pace, so they don't want much assistance from the racquet. But a lighter, stiffer tweener frame is more forgiving and will offer more help when the stroke or impact isn't clean. Consequently, it can play more powerfully.

Can you deliver a heavy ball with a lighter frame?Absolutely. And the truth is, the difference between 300g and 305g frames can be difficult to detect. As we've seen in the pro ranks, lighter frames are becoming more of the norm. They are swinging stiffer racquets with less weight faster to produce power and spin. Swingweight—how heavy the racquet travels through the air—has become the more important metric. Finding the right balance between rapid acceleration and just enough heft is the key.For some players, more mass does translate to a heavier shot. But it's a not a requirement. As long as you're generating the requisite swing speed to compensate for the lower static mass, there's no reason a lighter frame can't carry serious weight.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen's dominant display over the United States Grand Prix weekend has closed the points gap to Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri even further.

Max Verstappen has declared ""the chance is there"" to secure a fifth Formula 1 World Championship after his dominant victory in the United States Grand Prix helped slash Oscar Piastri's points lead at the top of the standings.

Leaving Zandvoort in August, Verstappen trailed Piastri in the Drivers' Championship by a seemingly unassailable 104 points. Four weekends later the Red Bull man is now  just 40 points behind the championship leader courtesy of three Grand Prix wins and a Sprint victory.

The United States Grand Prix weekend was a prime example of the dominant form that Verstappen has display of late as the four-time World Champion led every lap in both the Sprint and Grand Prix, and he faced only a fleeting challenge in the opening laps of the former.

“It was an unbelievable weekend for us,” said Verstappen after claiming Grand Prix victory. “I knew that the race was not going to be super forward.

""If you look at the whole race, the pace between myself and Lando [Norris] was really close. Just in that first stint was where we made the difference, and I could eke out a bit of a gap, which is basically what we kept to the end.

“It wasn't easy to manage the tyres for most of the stints, but we kept it in the lead and I'm just incredibly proud of everyone to be able to deliver a weekend like this.”

Verstappen's progress in the championship was aided by the Lap 1 retirement of both McLaren drivers in the Sprint, while Norris' battle for second with Charles Leclerc throughout the Grand Prix allowed a gap to appear in the opening stages on Sunday. Piastri lacked pace throughout the weekend in Austin and could only finish fifth.

Other than ruling out his title chances at the Spanish Grand Prix, Verstappen has remained relatively quiet on the topic, although McLaren has consistently warned that he remains a significant factor.

However, after hearing his display described as “a champion's drive”, Verstappen was asked directly if he now believes that the chance is there for a fifth consecutive title.

“Yeah, for sure,” he answered. “The chance is there. We just need to try to deliver these weekends to the end of the year, so yeah, we'll at least try whatever we can.

""It's exciting, and I'm just very excited to the end.”

Formula 1 now moves on to Mexico City next weekend with Verstappen, Norris and Piastri set to do battle once again as the Drivers' Championship fight heats up.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen has claimed his fifth Grand Prix win of the season at the United States Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver taking victory ahead of Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc.

Max Verstappen has claimed a dominant victory at the United States Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver converting pole position into a commanding win while Lando Norris beat Charles Leclerc to second place in a thrilling duel between the pair.

It had been a strong start to the race for Verstappen, the Dutchman holding the lead from pole position while the rest of the field got through Turn 1 much more cleanly than during Saturday's action-packed Sprint.

Though questions remained in the early stages over strategy choices, all of the field opted for a one-stop plan – and this worked smoothly for Verstappen, who remained in P1 after his stop. And while he had to nurse his soft tyres home in the latter stages, the reigning World Champion crossed the line with a margin of 7.959s to seal his fifth Grand Prix triumph of the season.

Behind him, a close fight played out between Norris and Leclerc, a scrap that firstly unfolded in the early stages after Leclerc got ahead of the McLaren at the start. With the two going head-to-head again in the final laps, Norris eventually made a move stick to take a valuable P2, leaving Leclerc to round out the podium in third.

Lewis Hamilton added to Ferrari's points haul in fourth place – a position he just held onto despite seemingly suffering a puncture on the final lap – while championship leader Oscar Piastri brought a tough weekend to an end by taking fifth.

Race results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES UNITED STATES GRAND PRIX 2025

Mercedes' George Russell followed in sixth, ahead of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda and the Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg. Ollie Bearman scored points on Haas' home soil in P9, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso completing the top 10.

Liam Lawson just missed out on points for Racing Bulls in 11th, as did the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll in 12th. Kimi Antonelli embarked on a recovery drive to 13th, the Mercedes driver having dropped backwards early on in the race following a collision with Williams' Carlos Sainz.

The other Williams of Alex Albon claimed P14, followed by Haas' Esteban Ocon (P15) and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar (P16). Franco Colapinto took P17 for Alpine – after ignoring a team order to hold position behind team mate Pierre Gasly – while Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto was sandwiched between them in P18.

Sainz was the only retiree of the day, having pulled off track following his aforementioned clash with Antonelli. And in terms of the standings after the race in Austin, Verstappen is now just 40 points away from Piastri in the Drivers' Championship, while Norris is only 14 points adrift of his team mate.

After two exciting days of action at the Circuit of The Americas – featuring a highly eventful Sprint followed by a busy Qualifying later on Saturday – it was time for the paddock to shift their attentions to Sunday's United States Grand Prix.

That aforementioned Qualifying saw Verstappen clinch a 47th career pole position, with Norris proving his closest competitor in second, while championship leader Piastri had a trickier day after ending the session in P6.

With that dramatic Turn 1 from Saturday's Sprint still fresh in everybody's minds, questions remained over how the pack would tackle the first corner this time around as Sunday's start time neared. One thing for certain is that the drivers would again be racing in warm conditions, with a track temperature in the range of 44 degrees Celsius.

One small change to the starting order prior to the race getting underway saw Stroll demoted to P19 after serving a five-place grid penalty – handed out following a collision with Ocon in the Sprint – while Hadjar would line up at the very back, having not set a time due to crashing out of Q1 in Qualifying.

Once all 20 cars had assembled on the grid and the tyre blankets were removed, it was revealed that most of the field would start on the medium tyre for the 56-lap event. The exceptions, however, were Leclerc, Bortoleto and Stroll on the soft compound, while Ocon, Albon and Hadjar had opted for the hard.

With the formation lap completed, the five lights went out to get the United States Grand Prix underway – and while Verstappen launched away cleanly to hold the lead, Norris lost out to Leclerc after the Monegasque took a wide line through Turn 1.

Behind them, Piastri defended hard against Russell into that first corner, the Australian managing to get himself up into P5 – dropping Russell to sixth – while Hamilton had also gained a position in P4. Further back, the yellow flags were thrown as Albon went off at the rear of the pack after seemingly colliding with Bortoleto, before rejoining in last place.

Tsunoda was the biggest winner at the start, the Red Bull driver moving up four places to run in P9, while Sainz had climbed up to P8 after overtaking the Haas of Bearman. Meanwhile Verstappen had already started to extend his lead, the Dutchman running three seconds clear of Leclerc by Lap 5.

As those opening five laps played out, Leclerc not only dropped back from Verstappen but increasingly found himself under pressure from Norris, with the McLaren driver just 0.5s behind. Elsewhere, Norris' team mate Piastri was also trying to chase down a Ferrari in the form of Hamilton.

On Lap 7, Sainz attempted a move on Antonelli into Turn 15 – but contact occurred between the pair, sending the latter into a spin while Sainz pulled off the track, his Williams seemingly too damaged to continue on. This resulted in the deployment of the Virtual Safety Car, with Albon taking the opportunity to pit while Antonelli had dropped down to P18.

As the VSC came to an end on Lap 9, Verstappen continued to lead by more than two seconds from Leclerc, while Norris had dropped back slightly from the Ferrari. Hamilton and Piastri remained in fourth and fifth, with the latter radioing in that he was “concerned about the front left” tyre.

Norris went on to voice the same issue, leading to questions over whether McLaren could opt for a two-stop strategy. Elsewhere, the Antonelli and Sainz incident – which will be investigated after the race – had promoted Hulkenberg and Alonso up into the top 10.

With 14 laps gone, Verstappen was now four seconds clear of Leclerc, but Norris had again got himself on the tail of the Ferrari. “Track limits for Norris,” Leclerc reported as the McLaren closed to just half a second behind.

Just one tour later, Norris went side-by-side with Leclerc through several corners – and while there was hard but fair racing between the pair, the Briton was unable to make the move stick. All of this had allowed Verstappen to break away further, extending his lead to 6.7s.

After briefly dropping back, Norris had once again closed in on Leclerc by Lap 19. Another attempt to get past followed – only for Leclerc to again close the door. Further back, Antonelli was trying to climb back through the field, the Mercedes driver chasing down Ocon in a battle for P15.

Amid the ongoing Norris and Leclerc scrap, Norris was told to pit to overtake – but the call seemed to be a bluff, with the McLaren staying out on track. In less welcome news for the papaya squad, the British driver was shown a black and white flag for exceeding track limits.

While Norris was not happy to hear about that, he had something to smile about on Lap 21 after finally overtaking Leclerc at Turn 12. Leclerc then faced pressure from team mate Hamilton, the Ferrari pair very nearly making contact as they fought for P3 – only for Leclerc to then pit, swapping his soft tyres for the medium compound.

As Leclerc returned to the track in ninth place, Verstappen was now 11 seconds ahead of Norris, who was followed by Hamilton, Piastri, Russell, Tsunoda, Bearman, Hulkenberg, Leclerc and Alonso. With the halfway mark of the race edging closer – and most of the frontrunners having yet to pit – there was still plenty of action to come at COTA.

“Tyres are becoming tricky,” Verstappen told his race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase on Lap 27, with the response being that the conditions were starting to change. Elsewhere, Leclerc had climbed to P7 after overtaking Hulkenberg and Bearman, while Antonelli – the fastest man on track – was up to P13.

Much speculation remained over strategies, with many teams seemingly keen to extend the first stint for as long as possible before switching to the soft tyre on a one-stop call. Tsunoda, pitted on Lap 30 for the soft rubber, while Piastri did the same one lap later, returning to the track in seventh.

Next to stop was Hamilton, the seven-time World Champion emerging ahead of Piastri in sixth. Verstappen, meanwhile, had seen his lead marginally cut into – before Norris dived into the pits on Lap 33, rejoining in third on the soft tyres behind Russell after a slightly slow stop.

Verstappen made his all-important visit to the pits one tour later – emerging back in the lead – while Russell soon followed, returning to the track in P6. With everybody now having pitted, the order at the front had shaken out as Verstappen, Leclerc, Norris, Hamilton, Piastri and Russell.

Just behind those lead six cars, Bearman dropped to P9 after a lunge on Tsunoda triggered contact between the pair, sending the Haas into a spin and briefly bringing out the yellow flags. Hulkenberg was sandwiched between them, while Alonso completed the top 10.

Up ahead, it looked like a second round of Norris vs Leclerc was coming up, with the Briton closing to within 0.7s of the Ferrari by Lap 38. Meanwhile two more drivers had been shown the black and white flag for track limits, that being Bortoleto in P19 and Albon in P16.

Within a few laps, Norris had dropped back from Leclerc – and promptly radioed in that he was struggling with his tyres, news that would undoubtedly please the Scuderia. But Verstappen also looked to be nursing his own tyres, meaning that his lead was not extending but holding steady at 6.8s.

As the final 10 laps approached, Norris was told that he still had “really strong” pace despite his tyre struggles, while team mate Piastri's difficult weekend at COTA seemed to be continuing, the Australian not making ground in P5 as he remained some seven seconds back from Hamilton.

Further back, Antonelli – another driver to have been shown the black and white flag – had made another overtake on Ocon for P13, while the fight for the final points-paying position was heating up, with Lawson and Stroll both chasing down Alonso.

While only a few tours were left, several potential battles started to pick up again. Norris was back on the tail of Leclerc as he tried to grab P2, and Russell had brought his gap from Piastri down to 2.9s.

After making an attempt into Turn 1, Norris bided his time through the lap before finally making it past Leclerc into Turn 12. “Keep the pressure on, he has three strikes,” Leclerc was encouraged by his race engineer, referencing Norris' earlier track limits warning.

Despite this, Leclerc soon dropped back from the McLaren, the Monegasque seemingly struggling for grip, while Russell's challenge on Piastri looked to have fallen away. Meanwhile Colapinto was asked to hold position behind Alpine team mate Gasly at the rear of the pack – an order that the Argentinian ignored to move up into P17.

There were no such dramas for Verstappen, however, who took the chequered flag with a margin of 7.959s from Norris, while Leclerc had to settle for third at a track where he claimed victory back in 2024.

Hamilton faced a tense moment on the final lap, with the Ferrari driver appearing to have picked up a puncture – allowing Piastri to start closing in. The Briton just did enough to hold on to P4, however, with Piastri one second back as he crossed the line in P5.

Russell ended a relatively quiet day in sixth, while Tsunoda, Hulkenberg, Bearman and Alonso completed the top 10. Lawson's challenge for the final point on offer fell away, the New Zealander ultimately taking P11 ahead of Stroll in P12.

Antonelli's drive back through the field saw him take 13th place, the Mercedes driver followed by Albon, Ocon, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bortoleto and Gasly. Sainz, meanwhile, was the only driver to record a DNF in Austin.

“It was an unbelievable weekend for us,"" said Verstappen. ""I knew that the race was not going to be super forward. If you look at the whole race, the pace between myself and Lando was really close. Just in that first stint was where we made the difference and I could eke out a bit of a gap, which is basically what we kept to the end.

“It wasn't easy to manage the tyres for most of the stints, but we kept it in the lead and I'm just incredibly proud of everyone to be able to deliver a weekend like this.”

In a double header sequence, F1 moves from Austin to Mexico City for the Mexico City Grand Prix, which takes place on the weekend of October 24-26. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Yuki Tsunoda was irked by perceived blocking from Liam Lawson in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, leading him to accuse the Racing Bulls driver of causing such instances ""on purpose"".

Yuki Tsunoda has hit out at Liam Lawson for “always doing something on purpose” after complaining of being blocked by the Racing Bulls driver in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix.

Tsunoda and Lawson have been involved in a number of skirmishes this season, after Red Bull switched the pair after two weekends, promoting the former to partner Max Verstappen ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix weekend while the latter dropped back down to the junior squad alongside Isack Hadjar.

Their previous flashpoints included an earlier incident this weekend in Sprint Qualifying, when the two battled through the first corners in a failed bid to set a last-gasp time.

Added tension exists with speculation that the two are battling for a single seat on the 2026 grid, with rumours that Isack Hadjar will join Red Bull and Formula 2 driver Arvid Lindblad could make the step up to F1 with Racing Bulls.

“With Lawson, it's just the usual story,” said Tsunoda when asked about the potential on-track blocking incident involving the New Zealander.

“He's always doing something on purpose, and it's b*******, so it's him. I don't care about him, to be honest.""

Tsunoda, who will start the United States Grand Prix in 13th – one place behind Lawson – was further irked by blocking from one of the Alpine drivers, although he brushed this off as “maybe just miscommunication from their side”.

He added: “I think, without that, I would have been in Q3. So far, I just can't have normal Qualifying. It's really frustrating but it is what it is.”

On the other side of the fence, Lawson was left bemused by his rival's comments when asked.

“I've absolutely no idea what he's talking about,” he said. “I think traffic is always a little bit tough around here, to be honest. But this weekend it has been something that we've all been dealing with. We got hit real bad yesterday in sector one.

“I can't possibly think where I could have been to be in front of him, but it's just one of those things.”

Racing Bulls have shown strong pace across the weekend so far, but a heavy crash for Hadjar in Q1 and Lawson's Q2 exit leaves plenty of work to be done on Sunday if the team is to add to its points haul.

Of his final effort, Lawson added: “We had a very fast car, we just got hit by a massive gust of wind at the start of the lap and then, from there, you're trying to make up lap time.

“It sucks. The car has been very, very quick. Unfortunately, it's just one of those things. We're all dealing with it, but we get hit at different points and unfortunately, it's cost us quite a lot of lap time.”

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

The Circuit of The Americas delivered another spectacular event as Max Verstappen closed even further on the Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri.

The United States Grand Prix weekend served up another entertaining affair as Max Verstappen's dominant performance further ignited the thrilling battle for this year's Drivers' Championship title.

As Verstappen's star shone brightly at the Circuit of The Americas – the Red Bull man claiming victory in the Sprint and the Grand Prix – the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri had a relatively off weekend by the Papaya team's high standards this year.

With all eyes lasered in on the ever-shrinking points gaps at the top of the Drivers' standings, here are all the key moments from Austin...

Max Verstappen had already been on a good run of form when F1 touched down in Austin for the United States Grand Prix weekend, having collected two Grand Prix victories across the last three rounds.

This had brought his deficit to championship leader Oscar Piastri down to 63 points with six events remaining – but a near-perfect outing in Austin has reduced that gap even further, setting up a thrilling title fight as the 2025 F1 season nears its conclusion.

Verstappen laid down a gauntlet early on by grabbing pole in Friday's Sprint Qualifying, while he avoided the chaos that unfolded behind him on Lap 1 of Saturday's Sprint – a melee that eliminated both McLarens – to seal another win.

Pole position for the Grand Prix followed, and from there the Red Bull driver was unstoppable in Sunday's race, leading cleanly away off the line before stretching out his advantage in the opening laps.

While he had to nurse his tyres to the finish, Verstappen still crossed the line some 7.959s ahead of Lando Norris in second. With Piastri ending the event in fifth, the result means that Verstappen is now just 40 points adrift in the Drivers' standings.

The four-time World Champion declared afterwards that “the chance is there” for a fifth consecutive title, adding that he and the team will “try whatever we can”. One thing's for sure – the fight is well and truly on.

While the weekend at the Circuit of The Americas could hardly have gone any better for Verstappen, it proved to be a much trickier one for McLaren.

The squad had attracted attention on Thursday's media day after stating that Norris would face “repercussions” for his first-lap contact with Piastri last time out in Singapore, though they opted not to reveal the nature of this.

However, the focus soon switched to their fortunes on the track in Austin. After losing out on pole for the Sprint to Verstappen, Norris and Piastri lined up in second and third respectively – but both were dramatically out on the opening lap after a collision into Turn 1, a nightmare outcome for the Teams' Champions.

Each car was repaired in time for Qualifying a few hours later, and Norris again had to settle for P2 behind Verstappen. Piastri, meanwhile, admitted he “didn't feel comfortable” in the session after taking P6.

Sunday's race was not entirely straightforward for either driver. Norris was overtaken by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc at the start and then faced two battles with the Monegasque throughout the Grand Prix, meaning that the Briton's eventual result of P2 was hard-fought.

Further back, Piastri struggled to make ground and crossed the line in fifth. The Australian conceded that McLaren “need to try and understand why the pace was lacking this weekend” – and while his lead has been reduced in the championship, he insisted that his “mentality hasn't changed” ahead of the final five rounds of the campaign.

Ferrari's weekend in Austin certainly had its highs and lows, with Friday marking the low point for the Scuderia at a venue where they claimed a triumphant 1-2 last year. Leclerc had a gearbox problem in the sole practice session, severely limiting his running, before both he and Hamilton were left dejected following Sprint Qualifying.

With the pair towards the back of the top 10, Leclerc said Ferrari were ""so far behind now"" while Hamilton described the car as ""very, very tough to drive.""

However, Ferrari's weekend soon picked up. After finishing fifth in the Sprint, one place behind Hamilton, Leclerc qualified for the Grand Prix in third, but grew concerned on the grid when discovering that he was the only driver in the top 15 starting on soft tyres. However, this paid off as he was able to jump Norris at the start and engage in a race-long battle for the position.

Although he dropped back to third in the closing stages Leclerc was still happy with his podium because ""it has been a tough second part of the year"".

Hamilton followed his team mate home in fourth place, completing a 27-point haul for Ferrari on Sunday and moving them to within seven points of Mercedes in the Constructors' Standings.

More important for the seven-time World Champion, however, was a growing feeling that he is “finally getting on top of the car”.

The Circuit of The Americas always sees the stars come out to play, and the 2025 edition was no different. Actor Matthew McConaughey, golfer Ian Poulter as well as Olympic and Paralympic gold medal-winning duo Tara Davis-Woodhall and Hunter Woodall all took in the paddock, while Adele was seen posing with the drivers in the Mercedes garage.

The United States Grand Prix also saw the first Grid Gig, with Drake Milligan performing on the grid before the cars exited the pit lane to head on sighting laps. Keeping with a musical theme, singer Shaboozey also waved the chequered flag.

On Sunday, it was also confirmed that COTA will remain a fixture on the F1 calendar through until 2034. With interest in the championship continuing to rise in the United States, and the Austin venue proving ever-popular with fans worldwide, there will be plenty more exciting events to come at the circuit.

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen took a record breaking seventh victory in the United States to heap pressure on McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in the Drivers' Standings.

Max Verstappen dominated the United States Grand Prix as he took a lights-to-flag victory to significantly close the gap in the Drivers' Standings.

The four time World Champion was untouchable in Austin, as he led every lap in both the Sprint and Sunday's Grand Prix. Entering the weekend 63 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri, this margin was slashed to 40 as the Australian could manage only fifth place.

With his victory, Verstappen became the first driver to win seven Grands Prix in the United States. It was his fourth in Austin.

Lando Norris was involved in a race-long battle with Charles Leclerc and, after dropping behind at the start, completed his move for second place on Lap 53. Lewis Hamilton was fourth, missing out on a first podium for Ferrari.

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

The United States Grand Prix produced not only a memorable race, but also a treasure trove of top trivia to dive into.

A Sprint win, pole position and a dominant Grand Prix victory – the numbers looked all but perfect for Red Bull's Max Verstappen in Austin. But don't be fooled, there were plenty of other fascinating figures generated by Sunday's showdown at the Circuit of The Americas. Here's our round-up of the best…

•	Verstappen has scored 119 of a possible 133 points in the last five Grand Prix weekends.

•	Verstappen finished 1m 12s behind the race winner in Hungary, just six races ago.

•	Verstappen is now 40 points off the championship lead. That deficit was 104 points only four races ago.

•	This was the fifth consecutive Grand Prix to be won from pole this season, with the winning driver leading 281 out of 294 laps in that time.

•	Verstappen now has 122 career podium finishes, tied with Sebastian Vettel for third on the all-time list.

•	This was Verstappen's fifth consecutive podium finish (he only scored five podium finishes in the first 14 Grands Prix this year).

•	Norris has reduced the championship deficit to team mate Oscar Piastri to 14 points.

•	Charles Leclerc – P3 for Ferrari – has now completed a full year without a race win (his last victory was Austin 2024).

•	Hamilton has never scored fewer than five podium finishes in an F1 season (he has zero podium finishes in 2025).

•	Piastri took P5 and has had no podium finish in any of the last three Grands Prix (22 points scored).

•	Mercedes' George Russell finished in P6 – the same position he achieved when starting from the pit lane in the 2024 race.

•	Yuki Tsunoda's P7 for Red Bull was his best-ever result at the Circuit of The Americas.

•	Tsunoda has scored 16 points in the last three race weekends (he managed just 12 in the first 16 race weekends this year).

•	Carlos Sainz's DNF for Williams was the only retirement of the race, after he took third in Saturday's Sprint.

•	With team mate Alex Albon finishing P15, it was Williams' first pointless Grand Prix since Hungary.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

After twice battling with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Lando Norris took second place in the United States Grand Prix.

Lando Norris was content with second place in the United States Grand Prix, the McLaren driver admitting that there was “not a lot more we could have done” on a day where he won out in a “tough” battle with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.

After lining up alongside polesitter Max Verstappen on the front row of the grid, Norris initially lost out to Leclerc at the start, leaving him with his work cut out as he chased down the Monegasque in the opening stages.

A close fight unfolded between the pair, with Norris eventually making an overtake stick into Turn 12 on Lap 21. But it was not quite over there, as the duo found themselves in another scrap for P2 during the final laps of the race, Leclerc having ended up ahead of Norris again after the pit stops phase.

While both drivers seemed to be struggling with their tyres, Norris was able to find a way past the Ferrari just a few laps from the finish, allowing him to take a hard-fought second place.

Reflecting on the battle – and his race as a whole – after jumping out of the car, the McLaren driver joked that he “finally” overtook Leclerc in the end, adding: “It took long enough. It was a good battle with Charles, he fought hard, and it was tough.

“We did everything we could. I thought we kind of had it in an easier way after the overcut. I expected a slightly easier second attempt to get through, but it wasn't the case.

“Charles drove a very good race, it was fun, and good battles. So I have to take second. There's not a lot more we could have done.”

During his duel with Leclerc, Norris' race engineer Will Joseph at one stage told him to cool his tyres before making another attempt at an overtake.

Looking back on this, Norris explained: “Out of the box when the tyres are the freshest, you want to push because you have the best chance, but it's also when the tyres are at their hottest. So when I had my first try, I started to really struggle with the tyres and Charles was probably already in the consistent point.

“So I backed off quite a bit for a few laps, went again, and it worked. Good strategy, some good driving, and a fun race.”

Norris' result means that he has closed the gap in the World Championship standings down to just 14 points from team mate Oscar Piastri – who ended the race in fifth – while Verstappen's victory has put the Red Bull driver only 40 points behind the Australian.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Lewis Hamilton believes things are finally beginning to gel at Ferrari, with a pair of strong performances across the United States Grand Prix weekend.

Lewis Hamilton expressed relief after a strong weekend at the United States Grand Prix left him feeling that he has “finally” made a much-needed breakthrough with Ferrari.

The seven-time World Champion may not have achieved his goal of a maiden podium with Ferrari at the Circuit of The Americas, but a pair of fourth place finishes across the Sprint and Grand Prix marked an uptick in performance following a recent dip in results.

“I'm finally feeling like I'm on top of the car,” said Hamilton. “I think we still have some improvements we could make. We can definitely extract more, particularly on my side, because Qualifying wasn't as good as I had hoped and the start wasn't great.

“There are always areas to improve, but it's positive going into the next race, so I hope we can have an even better weekend.”

After dropping back from Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc in the opening stages on Sunday, Hamilton recovered and passed his team mate for third shortly before Leclerc, who had started on soft tyres, pitted.

Going longer relegated Hamilton back to fourth, and he was unable to close the margin for a second time, but a strong team result of third and fourth closed the gap to Mercedes in the Teams' Championship, leaving the 40-year-old satisfied with his work.

“We can definitely take a lot of positives,” he added. “Just the way we have extracted points this weekend – given we haven't upgraded the car, we are still somehow just there or thereabouts.

“I got a bad start, managed to still get a good Turn 1, which then recovered the start. I was kind of in the fight at the beginning and got Charles before his stop but lost a bit of time there to Lando.

“After my stop, I came out so far behind, so the strategy wasn't ideal, but a perfect result in terms of points for the team.”

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen cruised to victory in Sunday's United States Grand Prix, but could Lando Norris have made his life more difficult without getting stuck behind Charles Leclerc?

Max Verstappen's United States Grand Prix win was resounding, but Lando Norris showed that with a slightly different set of circumstances he could have been fighting the Red Bull driver for that victory.

Although Norris had qualified only second to Verstappen, over 0.35s slower, the way the Circuit of The Americas induces heavy thermal degradation of the rear tyres was expected to play to the key strength of Norris' McLaren in the race.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

He may not be in contention for race wins of late, but you just can't keep this man off the F1 rostrum...

A superb start from Charles Leclerc lifted him from P3 to P2 in Austin - and a masterclass in defensive driving kept the Ferrari man there for much of the afternoon, despite the best efforts of a marauding Lando Norris.

Ultimately Leclerc had to give best to the McLaren's superior pace, but that didn't stop you recognising a drive of supreme class as the Monegasque secured the final podium place. Here's how the voting broke down…

Charles Leclerc - 35%
Max Verstappen - 18.2%
Lando Norris - 8.9%
Lewis Hamilton - 7.8%
Yuki Tsunoda - 6%

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Circuit of The Americas for the United States Grand Prix.

Verstappen led off the line and from there was not troubled once as he sailed to a fifth win of the season. It was the perfect weekend for the Dutchman, who grabbed both pole positions and the Sprint victory as well. But crucially, the Dutchman cut his gap in the Championship down to 40 points, after taking 23 points out of Piastri across the weekend. Tsunoda made it two cars in the points after a strong drive from P13 on the grid. He made a great start, but had one dicey moment when battling Bearman midway through. He just about managed to avoid the spinning Haas, and grabbed his second-best Grand Prix finish of the year.

Max Verstappen, 1st

“It was a perfect weekend and I think the start was key today. The pace wasn't magic but we got a good start on the first stint and Charles got in the middle of myself and Lando which helped a lot and as soon as Lando was in clean air he was very fast. We just did the best we could and tried to manage our tyres in the best way possible even though they were overheating a bit. This performance was exactly what we need until the end of the season to fight for the title. The Team has done a great job, I'm having fun and it's exciting for everyone. The performance of the car has been better and we need to keep the momentum going. We really maximised everything with the points and we need to continue having these perfect weekends until the end of the season. I am very happy to win again.”

Yuki Tsunoda, 7th

“Today was a great start and lap one once again, the first few laps were good, I had nice pace and managed to overtake a lot of cars. I enjoyed both races and had good confidence. I have scored points in both races this weekend so, overall, the weekend was positive. The pace today was ok, I could have maybe done a slightly better job with that, in the second stint especially. I have to keep scoring the points in the next few races and improve on the short runs in particular, as we have been struggling there. That has to be the focus now, I have to work on that and put it all together for the short run for Mexico and beyond.”

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""This has definitely been our strongest weekend in a long while. On a burning hot track, where we have found it tricky here in the past, Max kept extending the gap to his opponents in every session. If you see how tight it was on Friday, even though he was on pole for the Sprint, and then today, it was a substantial improvement. Once again, I want to thank everyone at the track and those back at base, who have been taking risks in terms of pushing everything to the limit, it's uncomfortable, but the work they are doing is unbelievable and it's paying off. They have unlocked so much from the car. We never took anything for granted, ultimately finding more and more performance as the weekend progressed. Max is driving at an incredible level and keeps raising the bar. We are going to continue with our approach for the upcoming races, starting by seeing how we can put the best possible car on track in Mexico. Yuki also enjoyed a strong weekend, especially today when he made up six places in the race, bringing home some useful points to add to those he scored in the Sprint yesterday. Finally, thank you and congratulations to our partners Mobil and Mobil 1 as we celebrate our 75th win together. It's been a strong and successful partnership and we look forward to celebrating many more together.""

Norris lost out to a soft-shod Leclerc off the line, and was forced to play the waiting game behind the Ferrari in the opening stint. He eventually made his way through after some entertaining wheel-to-wheel racing, but by then Verstappen had pulled too much of a gap for the lead to be challenged. Norris had to have a second go at Leclerc after overcutting the Ferrari, and got past a second time to boot as he grabbed a well-earned rostrum. As for Piastri, he gained a place at the start but from there struggled for grip on both his medium and soft tyres. He briefly looked like he might challenge Hamilton ahead, but faded to finish fifth as he saw his Championship lead cut to just 14 points.

Oscar Piastri, 5th

""A bit of a tricky race. Similar to yesterday, I was struggling for pace. We gained one spot, which was positive, but it was hard to make any progress from there. Not the weekend we were looking for, but we'll review and bounce back next weekend.""

Lando Norris, 2nd

""It was an interesting race today, and a good battle with Charles [Leclerc]. However, it took a little too long to get by and, as a result, we had to settle for second. It was tough, but the strategy was good, and it worked out well in the end. Full focus now switches to Mexico and doing the best job I can there.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

""We struggled to fully realise the potential of the car this weekend after a disappointing Saturday, so while we were able to secure a podium and some good points, it felt like we under-delivered compared to our potential.

""On Lando's side, the battle with Leclerc meant that he wasn't able to close down Verstappen and challenge for the win. This is something we believe the car was in contention for, and also reaffirms that we can continue to be in the position to fight for victories after some difficult races on circuits that suit our competitors more.

""Looking at Oscar's race, the pace wasn't there today, and he wasn't able to make the progress we had hoped for after a strong start. This is something that we will now review as a team and make sure we come back stronger next week.

""Overall, it wasn't the weekend we wanted. We always aim to come away with a 1-2, and this isn't something we achieved. We must now refocus, improve from our learnings and build on the positives before aiming to have a better weekend in Mexico.""

Leclerc was the only car in the top 10 to start on the soft tyre. That risk paid off, as he made his way past Norris through Turn 1. The Ferrari man then did well to keep his soft tyres alive, as he battled with Norris for lap after lap. He did not put a foot wrong in defence, but did eventually lose out to the McLaren man. On the mediums, he also lost out to Norris later in the race when the pit stops played out, but still managed to score his first podium since Belgium. Hamilton started on the mediums like the majority. He ran fourth for most of the race, and just did not quite have the pace to challenge Norris and Leclerc for the podium at the end.

Charles Leclerc, 3rd

""I'm happy with our weekend. We made a very good recovery, from starting out with an issue in FP1 which put us on the back foot, to making progress in Sprint Qualifying and the Sprint race, delivering a solid qualifying, and being rewarded with a podium after staying focused on the job.

""We were on a more aggressive strategy today, so my target was to gain positions at the start. Arriving on the grid as the only car on the Softs looked risky, but ultimately, it paid off.
Our team did a good job and we will push to keep this momentum as we head into the final rounds of this season.""

Lewis Hamilton, 4th

""It's been a productive Sunday overall. Today's race was a strong result for the team and we gained some good points. My first stint was encouraging, and I was in the fight for third, but after my pit stop the gap to the top three became too difficult to close.

""As a whole, the weekend has been a positive one. It showed the progress we're making as a team and confirmed there's still more potential to unlock in the SF-25. Thank you to all the fans here, who brought incredible energy all weekend.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""It's great to be back on the podium with Charles and to have Lewis in fourth place. It's good for them and great for the team. It's extra motivation for everyone for the rest of the championship. I'm particularly happy with how we were able to fight back after a very difficult start to the weekend. The progress came from fine tuning the car and focussing a lot on the tyres. If you don't get them in the window you can lose five or six tenths and that's what happened to us on Friday. So, I'm proud of the team and how they reacted. Today, the pace was there and we decided to be aggressive with the strategy with Charles to try and be P1 going into the first corner and it worked in part as he gained one place. But now our focus must switch to being back on track on Friday in Mexico and try again.""

Russell found himself squeezed at the start, and lost out to both Hamilton and Piastri. From there he ran sixth, briefly looking like he might chase down an ailing Piastri before running out of tyre life. Antonelli had a more eventful time of it in Austin. He was solidly in the points before colliding with Sainz, who tried to send one up the inside into Turn 1. The resultant spin and trip into the gravel dropped the teenager to last place, but he did well to keep his medium tyres going and stay on the planned strategy. On the softs, he climbed back through the field but could not recover to the points.

George Russell, 6th

""I thought before the race that it was likely wherever we exited turn one would be the place we finished. That was due to the expected level of degradation and similar pace of the front-running cars. That is exactly how it played out and, sadly for us, we lost positions at that first corner. I made a good start but got boxed in behind Lando (Norris), and Lewis (Hamilton) and Oscar (Piastri) were able to overtake me around the outside. From there, it was a lonely race to P6.

""We turn our attentions straight to Mexico now. It is a very different circuit to here in Austin and the altitude creates its own level of challenge. Hopefully we can have a better race there than we did today and fight back in the fight for second in the Constructors' Championship.""

Kimi Antonelli, 13th

""That was a frustrating race from our side. I felt good in the car early on, as I have done all weekend, and was looking forward to trying to gain some positions from P7. Unfortunately, that wasn't to be. I tried to leave some space for Carlos (Sainz) at turn 15 as I saw him coming. I managed to do so but we still made contact and that put an end to any realistic chance of scoring good points today.

""It was a disappointing day, but we move forward. We head straight to Mexico now, and we have a chance to bounce back straight away. I'm hopeful we can do so as the Constructors' Championship is close, and every point is going to matter.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""Not every race can be a classic and that was the case today. There were small pace differences between the top cars today and that, along with the challenge of managing surface tyre temperatures when following closely, made overtaking almost impossible. Unfortunately for us, George lost two positions at turn one and dropped to P6. Kimi was spun around early in the race meanwhile, so we were always playing catch up. I think we had the necessary pace in the car to finish on the podium but once you are behind, there was no chance to pass.

""We've got another race next week in Mexico and we will be looking to perform more like we did in Singapore than we have here in Austin. Both Ferrari and Red Bull have regained ground on us in the Constructors' today, so it's important we put in a stronger performance in Mexico City. It's going to be a great battle all the way to the flag in Abu Dhabi.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""Our race was played out in the very early stages today. George was unfortunate to lose two positions when he got boxed in at turn one whilst Kimi was spun around at turn 15 a few laps later. Those setbacks cemented our finishing positions on a disappointing afternoon. That was due to the difficulty in following the car ahead whilst keeping tyre surface temperatures under control. That was an issue faced by the whole field, but it made regaining positions incredibly challenging.

""Fortunately, we have the opportunity to bounce back immediately. We will dust ourselves down and look to perform more strongly in Mexico City. The battle for second in the Constructors' Championship has tightened up once again after today but we're excited to try and build our advantage once again next week.""

Many would argue Hulkenberg deserved points after his brilliant Sprint Qualifying performance, and he eventually got his hands on four of them in the Grand Prix. He managed to keep out of trouble at the start unlike yesterday, and was running ninth when he spied the chance to sneak past Bearman who was nursing some dusty tyres. The German took his opportunity, and came home eighth. Bortoleto was much further down the order after tangling with Albon on the opening lap and then two-stopping on his way to the flag.

Nico Hulkenberg, 8th

“I'm really happy to finish the race with points. We've shown great pace all weekend, right from FP1. With the incident in the sprint yesterday, we didn't get the chance to show what we could do, so it felt great to have another shot today. The race was clean, well-executed on multiple fronts, and we were determined to make the most of it. The whole team deserves this result for the work they've put in. Now onto Mexico!”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 18th

""It's been a rather uneventful race for me. We possibly could have done something different under the Virtual Safety Car, but starting from the back always makes things tough, especially if you do not have a big advantage on those in fronts of you, which was the case today. Overall, it's been a challenging weekend. Still, I want to thank the team for the work done throughout the sessions, listening to my feedback and trying to get me in the best possible position to perform. We'll take the learnings from this weekend, understand what we could have done better, keep our head up and move onto the next one.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“An outstanding performance by Nico all weekend. It makes you wonder what the story might have been if turn one in the Sprint had gone smoothly too. He was a class act — composed, fast, and faultless in very tough conditions. On the other side of the garage, it was a frustrating afternoon for Gabi. We missed an opportunity under the Virtual Safety Car and with an equipment issue causing a slow first stop that set us back. We tried an aggressive strategy late on, but it didn't quite pay off. Two very different stories this weekend: one to celebrate and one to learn from. But that's racing, and we move forward to Mexico with plenty of encouragement for everyone involved.”

Bearman delivered points for Haas on what was a strong weekend for the youngster despite a few mistakes along the way. He was running solidly in the top 10 when he tried a move on Tsunoda, only to claim the Red Bull man moved under braking. That sent Bearman onto the dirt, where he lost control and spun. Instead of challenging for seventh, he finished ninth as a result of that moment but still grabbed his second points finish in a row after a P9 in Singapore. Ocon had a tougher day after being one of three drivers to start on the hard compound, which proved the least quick strategy call in the end.

Esteban Ocon, 15th

“It was a very tough afternoon, to say the least. I gained three or four positions in Turn 1, and then lost them all in the first couple of laps really because of sliding with no grip on the hard tyre. From there on, the pace was okay but we couldn't recover what we lost in that first 25 or 30 laps. It's quite clear to us why it was such a hard weekend, the high-speed section was incredibly hard so we had to drop a lot of aero balance which cost us in other places – we need to review. It's good for the team that we got two points from the race today.”

Oliver Bearman, 9th

“Heading into this weekend, if you'd told me I'd cross the line P8 in the Sprint, and finish P9 today – I would've been very happy. On the face of it, it was a good weekend and we got some good points for the team, but it was clear there was more out there. Regarding the incident with Yuki (Tsunoda), I felt it was very dangerous and against the spirit of the regulations. Although I avoided a crash, I lost two positions so it's a shame, and it's disappointing as it's clear I had more pace today.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“Firstly, I want to congratulate everyone's hard work for bringing this update to the track, because we needed it and it worked. The way we raced this weekend, is thanks to that. We all feel slightly disappointed finishing P9, which is the amazing thing because the best result we could've had today was P7. We look ahead now to the next race, we need to bring Esteban up – he's struggling a little bit with a certain feeling in the car, but you can see the potential is there. I don't see any reason, if we address that, why we can't get both cars into the points. It's a good thing we can look at doing that straightaway again next weekend in Mexico.”

Alonso lost out at the start and dropped out of the top 10. But he found himself back in the points after Sainz and Antonelli collided, and from there looked assured of scoring as he kept himself out of trouble. Stroll had a more eventful race as he rose up the order from a lowly grid slot. A skirmish with Bortolato and Albon at the start could have cost him, but instead he went on to pull off some great overtakes but fell just short of picking off Lawson.

Fernando Alonso, 10th

""We started tenth and finished there, so we come away with one point in the end. We didn't really have the pace to fight for anything more than P10 and it seems we had a bit more performance in Qualifying than in the race. It wasn't the most exciting day for me, and we were open to various strategies, but it was a standard one-stop race. We'll go again in Mexico and see if we can fight for points there.""

Lance Stroll, 12th

""Today was a fun race – we made our way through the race attacking with some good overtakes and picked up a couple of positions. We were close to getting to the points, but it was always going to be tricky from where we were starting – we did the best we could. The car was feeling good today and became a bit more alive with the change of wind direction. So a positive Sunday considering yesterday and now looking ahead to Mexico next week.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""We had similar pace to the cars around us in a very tight midfield. Lance raced well from P19 and delivered some great overtakes to finish P12. Another strong opening stint on the Softs [28 laps] brought him up the order as he chased down Liam [Lawson]. It's hard to race here in these hot conditions so it was good to see Fernando score a hard-fought point. Saturday was very challenging so a huge thanks to the garage and the factory for their efforts to get the car race ready. There is still plenty to fight for in the final five races starting in Mexico next week.""

Hadjar started from the back of the pack following his Qualifying crash yesterday. As such he opted for the hard tyre, but this soon proved to be the wrong strategy and cost him plenty of time in what was a difficult race. As for Lawson, he fought hard to get into the points but ultimately fell just short of challenging Alonso for P10 despite running in the Spaniard's DRS. He did manage to hold Stroll at bay though, in a good defensive effort.

Isack Hadjar, 16th

“That was the race I expected today, starting from the back. I haven't shown real pace so far this weekend, and our strategy was to go for a long first stint and hope for a safety car. There are a few things we need to understand with the car, we've been strong most weekends this year, but we had a ride issue that we need to figure out and make sure it doesn't happen again. I still had some good battles on track and learned a lot, so there's plenty of momentum to carry into Mexico.”

Liam Lawson, 11th

""I gave the race everything I could but didn't have the strongest start as I was boxed at Turn 1. That place probably cost us a point, however overall the pace wasn't strong enough today. It's very hard to overtake here and Aston had control of us throughout the race by being both in front and behind. It's frustrating as there have been points available throughout the weekend which we missed out on, but we'll take our learnings into Mexico next weekend.""

Alan Permane, Team Principal

“A tough afternoon to finish off what has been a difficult weekend for us all round; we simply didn't have the pace we've had in recent weeks and the pace we expected to have. We will of course spend time analysing where we could have done better and where we went wrong.

The beauty of F1 is that we'll be back on track again in 5 days' time, so we get a chance to put things right quickly. Mexico is a standard weekend format at a track both drivers know well, and we see some of the highest top speeds of the season. It presents a unique challenge where we run the biggest front and rear wings of the season, but due to the high altitude we generate the least downforce of the season. We will work hard on preparation this week and I'm very sure we will get ourselves back into Q3 and back into the points!”

Sainz could not repeat his Sprint heroics at COTA, failing to make it double points in Austin. He had a good start and was fighting with Bearman early on but, after making his way past the Haas, he tried a move on Antonelli into Turn 1. The Spaniard looked to try and pull out of it but instead locked up and hit the Mercedes. The contact was enough to force Sainz to park up and retire, while he was also handed a five-place grid penalty for the next race in Mexico City. That left Albon to fly the flag for the team, but his first lap included a spin after he was tagged by Bortoleto. By the time he caught up to the pack, he knew he was in for a long afternoon.

Alex Albon, 14th

""A frustrating day. We started on the hard tyre, which is usually a good option when the track is this hot, but we had no grip and effectively did another stop early in the race. We actually had good pace, but it was a bit scrappy at times and we just weren't clicking in the corners. This weekend I didn't feel like I was in rhythm with the circuit, but at least we came out of the Sprint with a few points and some key learnings. Next time out in Mexico we just need to tidy a few things up and hopefully have a smooth weekend.""

Carlos Sainz, DNF

""It's a shame to end the race that way as the car had great pace today. I had done a similar move on Bearman some laps before, so I tried that inside line with Antonelli into turn 15. He opened the line and then closed the door more abruptly than what I was expecting, I tried to react by slamming on the brakes to avoid contact but it was too late and we touched. I was behind so I accept my part of fault and ultimately it's a shame as it cost the race for both of us. We were quick, so it hurts not to convert it into more points today but we'll bounce back for Mexico next week.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""Part of the reason why I'm in motorsport is you can have some fantastic days with the highest highs, and then just 24 hours later, you can walk away with nothing, as we are today. And that's the reflection of Austin. What's positive to me is we have really strong car pace, and that's one item that we'll carry through for the remainder of the season. But it just highlights that we have to qualify both cars in position towards the point-scoring end of the grid, and we need to ensure we're fighting through the field without contact or incident. I'm sorry for both Carlos and Kimi, both had good race pace today and I'm confident would have scored points, but it is just a part of racing that, as you're trying to overtake through different sections, contact may happen. The stewards have decided to hand Carlos a 5 place grid penalty, there was a sensible conversation however the guidelines are fairly clear on fault allocation. We will come back fighting in Mexico.""

Alpine might have a headache on their hands in Austin, after their drivers got into an on-track squabble for the lowly positions. Gasly found himself only just ahead on track thanks to a slow pit stop, but on older soft tyres to his team mate. The team asked Colapinto to hold station, but instead he threw his car up the inside of Turn 1. It was a great overtaking move and the duo just about avoided contact, but it was not exactly what the team asked for. It remains to be seen what happens next at Alpine.

Pierre Gasly, 19th

“It's been a disappointing afternoon where we fundamentally lacked performance. Today, we were just too slow. The first stint felt good, I was on the back of Liam [Lawson] in a train of cars and it felt like everything was being managed quite well. Then we pitted onto Softs, had a slow pit-stop, and everything just fell apart from there to the end of the race where I was in a lot of traffic. We have many things to review as a team as it has been very difficult for us to be competitive on Sundays. We will work on it and we go again in Mexico City next weekend.”

Franco Colapinto, 17th

“A tough day and a tough weekend in general for us as a team. On my side, it's not been too smooth and I have generally struggled a lot with the car. We learned a lot session by session and the aim is to just try and be stronger each time we are on track and we will have another chance to do that in Mexico City next weekend. We will keep working hard as a team and just try to find those improvements. At the end, I had slightly fresher tyres than Pierre and saw Gabriel [Bortoleto] attacking. I wanted to keep him behind both of us, so it is something we will discuss as a team and learn from moving forwards.”

Steve Nielsen, Managing Director

“As a team we have a lot to review across the board from this weekend. While our level of competitiveness is still far from being able to score points, it was encouraging to make a small step forward relative to recent events looking at the weekend as a whole. Today, like a lot of teams, we had to adapt our strategy based on the conditions and what we saw on track with the Hard tyre not looking to be a favourable race tyre. On Pierre's side, we covered an undercut threat to box onto Softs, a little earlier than we wanted, and then had a slow pit-stop, which we will review and rectify. Franco was able to extend his Medium run to have a tyre delta towards the end of the race where he caught up to Pierre. We gave the instruction for the drivers to maintain position as we were managing fuel with both cars and the added variable of the number of laps remaining with the leaders in close proximity. As a team, any instruction made by the pit wall is final and today we are disappointed that this didn't happen so it's something we will review and deal with internally.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“Today the teams decided to keep their options open at the start, using mainly the medium tyre on the grid, which is the most flexible starting point for a number of different strategies. Leclerc stood out among the top 10, being the only driver to opt for the soft, which gave him an initial grip advantage that paid off.

The early VSC period allowed a few extra laps on both the soft and the medium, with the medium compound in particular showing consistency that was perhaps greater than anticipated. A positive influence on that was the asphalt temperature, which was lower than yesterday, and track evolution. These combined factors allowed the first stint to be stretched for as long as possible.

As a result, the medium-hard strategies that were initially envisaged inevitably turned into a theoretically more audacious strategy once the halfway point of the race had been reached. A succession of pit stops round about lap 30 saw the red tyre used for the final stint on nearly all the cars.

With the rear tyres not reaching maximum wear, the drivers were able to maintain a competitive pace without having to manage them, also thanks to the setups selected by the teams. Congratulations to Max Verstappen, who continues to fight for the title, and to Charles Leclerc for choosing a different strategy to get onto the podium.""

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Carlos Sainz will face a grid drop of five positions at the next race he participates in – that being the Mexico City Grand Prix – after being deemed at fault for a collision with Kimi Antonelli in Austin.

Carlos Sainz has been hit with a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Mexico City Grand Prix after being deemed at fault in a collision with Kimi Antonelli during Sunday's race in Austin.

Sainz had been battling with the Mercedes of Antonelli in the opening stages of the event, before attempting an overtake into Turn 15 on Lap 7. Contact occurred between the two cars, with Antonelli spinning off track before rejoining further down the order.

Moments later Sainz pulled off track, making the Williams driver the only retirement of the race, while Antonelli finished in 13th place. It was confirmed that the incident would be investigated after the United States Grand Prix.

The stewards heard from both drivers along with their respective team representatives and, after determining that Sainz was to blame, opted to hand the Spaniard a drop of five grid positions at the next race he participates in, as well as putting two penalty points on his licence.

A document released after the hearing reads: “Car 55 attempted an inside overtake on Car 12 at Turn 15 and a collision between the two cars occurred at the apex.

“The driver of Car 55 maintained that he had expected the driver of Car 12 to leave him space at the apex but Car 12 turned in early and Car 55 locked brakes when it became clear that a collision was unavoidable.

“He suggested that the Driver of Car 12 ought to have anticipated an overtake attempt by Car 55 and left space to avoid contact. However, at no point prior to the apex was the front axle of Car 55 alongside or ahead of the mirror of Car 12.

“Therefore, according to the Driving Standards Guidelines, Car 55 had not earned a right to be left space at the apex. The Stewards therefore determine that the Driver of Car 55 was predominatly to blame for the collision and a penalty is applied accordingly.

“As the driver to be penalized did not finish the race a grid penalty equalling a 10 seconds time penalty is imposed.”

This means that Sainz will serve his penalty at the Mexico City Grand Prix, which takes place in just a few days' time on the weekend of October 24-26.

Reflecting on the incident after the Grand Prix, Sainz said that the clash “looks a lot worse from the outside than what it felt from the inside” and labelled the outcome to his race “a shame”.

Antonelli, meanwhile, stated: “I don't think he was going to make the corner anyway, and I tried to avoid hitting the apex just to give him a bit more space, but I ended up getting taken out. It's a shame, but we move forward.”

He joins an already star-studded slate with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, starring as Elphaba (aka the Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda (or Glinda the Good), respectively. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Colman Domingo secretly joined the cast of Wicked: for Good, as none other than the voice of the Cowardly Lion.


	The movie and actor's Instagram accounts shared the news Monday, after Jon M. Chu last week made headlines when he teased a big-name actor attached to the role. Domingo joins an already star-studded slate with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande playing Elphaba (now known as the Wicked Witch of the West in the second film) and Glinda (or Glinda the Good), respectively. 




	The Cowardly Lion is one of a few new characters introduced in Wicked: for Good that hail from the mainstay story of The Wizard of Oz. The Tin Man, Scarecrow and Dorothy's appearances have all been teased in the beginning of Wicked and subsequent teasers for the sequel. None of the actors who stepped into those roles have been revealed yet.

Wicked: for Good marks the first time Elphaba and Glinda will officially cross paths with the beloved Wizard of Oz quartet in Chu's set of films. Following suit with the events of the original Broadway musical, the second movie will merge timelines with that of the 1939 film amid Dorothy's arrival to Oz.


	Adding to the high-profile cast, Jonathan Bailey also stars as Prince Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard. Both Erivo and Glinda were nominated for Oscars for their portrayal of the beloved witches, as the original 2024 film earned a total of 10 Academy Award noms and two wins.  

	











	The forthcoming second Wicked film flies into theaters Nov. 21., and will pick up following the events of the first movie.

Reedus chats with THR about the end of season three, speaking from the set of the fourth and final season.


							By

[This story contains spoilers from the season three finale of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, “Solaz Del Mar.”]


	After 15 years in the zombie apocalypse trenches, Daryl Dixon is approaching the end of the line. Luckily for Walking Dead fans, the character Daryl Dixon and the show Daryl Dixon are two different things altogether.




	The third season finale of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon has now come and gone, leaving only one more season of the Norman Reedus-starring spinoff of the flagship series. Does that mean we're reaching the end of Daryl's story altogether? Almost certainly not, as there are numerous other avenues where the fan-favorite crossbow slinger could appear, from existing shows like The Walking Dead: Dead City to any number of as-yet unannounced projects.

	Still, the imminent conclusion of this iteration of the character hangs heavy over Reedus; while fans are busy processing the events of season three's finale, in which Daryl and Carol (Melissa McBride) watched their latest attempt to return home go up in literal flames, Reedus himself is in the thick of filming the final stretch of Daryl Dixon season four, now well underway on location in Spain.“We're on episode six of season four,” he tells The Hollywood Reporter, speaking after a whirlwind trip home from Spain, following a whirlwind night shoot. “We're getting really close.”In other words, it's not time to break out the celebratory can of hot dogs just yet, as Daryl and Carol haven't spent their last night in Spain, despite what they imagined for themselves as season three came to an end Sunday night. But it's time to start planning which condiments we're going to use at the very least. Below, Reedus talks to THR about the journey of Daryl Dixon, from the recently concluded season three to the soon-to-be-concluded filming of season four.


	***


You're getting close to the end. How does that feel? Clearly we're here to talk about the end of three, but it has to feel surreal that you're simultaneously close to the end of the show in real time.












	Yeah. There's a David Bowie quote that goes something like, “What do you think your last words are going to be before you die?” And he said they would be, “But, but, but!” (Laughs.) And that's kind of how I feel. Is it shaping up in ways that you expected? Is it surprising you, the final stretch?


	You know, it's different. This show has always coincided with my life a bit. With season four, Daryl really goes inside [himself], and so, I'm inside, too. I'm in my head a lot, especially for the episode we're filming now. It's filling my head with the future, the past and the present of this character.


There's this moment in the season three finale where Daryl and Carol are chatting, and Daryl talks about feeling the need to run away every time he finds himself feeling at home. I can imagine in some ways that connects with you, having played Daryl for 15 years now.


	It's trippy. There's always more story you can tell, but this incarnation of what we're doing is wrapping up in a perfect way. It's answering all of these reasons why and what all of it has meant, and what have we done to get here? What are the mistakes we made to get here? And what can we do to have a better life for ourselves? So it's all very trippy, what we're working on right now. There's a lot of internal fact-checking that I'm doing, and that the character is doing, and watching things happen around me that I never expected.


	That's the beauty of the spinoff. Someone asked me recently, when I was doing season one, would I have thought about what I was doing in season four? And we just didn't do it that way. There's no season in the future already written when we're working on the first. It's created organically as we go along. I don't even think South Park can do that. They see what's happening in the world and create from it. So I would hate to do this show any other way. We organically come up with ideas for storylines as we're filming.


	That conversation you mention came out of a last-minute insert I'd come up with alongside [showrunner David Zabel and executive producer Jason Richman]. I knew some of where we could be heading in season four. And this sort of felt like a precipice; the going-off point for season four. We have some stories to deal with that we started in seasons one and two. For me, and for Daryl, that was a big turning point, that conversation on the beach. 


It's juxtaposed with some glimpses of Daryl's childhood we see throughout the season, with flashbacks to Merle (Michael Rooker) and the abuse he suffered back at his original home.












	Yeah. There's so much momentum on shows like these, that it can often be hard to find the space to slow down and think about that pre-apocalypse life. 


But when you do stop for those kinds of things, you can't help but remember how hard Daryl's life has been from the very beginning. There was never a soft point for him. So for him to even open up in this way with Carol and think about his life in this way marks huge progress since we first met him in the woods of Georgia.


	That's a huge point that we're in right now, a huge subject of what we're filming. Especially the episode we're doing at the moment.


Speaking of conversations between Daryl and Carol, there's one I really appreciated earlier in the season: Daryl and Carol making it extremely, abundantly clear they've never hooked up. Good to have it in canon!


	I have to give it up to David Zabel for that. Because there was a time when some people might have written for the show who would read Twitter, and then it was like they were writing for Twitter. I could pick out those moments sometimes. But David, he isn't part of that world. “I can do something different,” he said. 

	











I just want to be sure…Daryl and Carol didn't eat that last can of hot dogs yet, right?Right. We haven't eaten them.


Chekhov's Hot Dogs are still alive for the final season?


	Yeah, but I fucking hate those hot dogs. (Laughs.) I would barf if I had to eat that. The can's dented, too! There's gotta be some botulism in there.


Great premise for the next spinoff!(Laughs.) It's not going to be good when we open those up.

New data from Antenna suggests that subscribers ditched their Disney offerings at twice the rate of the prior month.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Jimmy Kimmel‘s short-lived suspension from ABC may have had a significant impact on Disney+ subscriptions, according to new data from the subscription analytics firm Antenna, which tracks subscriptions and viewership data for major streaming services.


	Antenna on Monday released numbers showing that monthly churn rates for Disney+ and Hulu surged from 4 percent and 5 percent in August to 8 percent and 10 percent in September, respectively. The doubling of cancelation rates stood out in a streaming landscape where churn rates typically remain somewhat consistent.

	Disney+ churn rates had been steady at around 3-4 percent per month consistently this year, with churn rates at Hulu hovering at 4-5 percent per month. Peacock saw churn rates stable in the 6-8 percent range, Paramount+ in the 5-7 percent range, and HBO Max in the 6-9 percent range. Netflix is king of the hill, with a consistent churn rate of only 2 percent per month. Disney had been second, until September that is.


	A source notes, however, that the pending cancelations subsided quickly, and that while people tend to be loud when dropping a service, they often quietly return afterward. Ratings for Kimmel's show have also soared after the move.


	The Antenna data also carries some asterisks, a Disney source notes. It is not clear how Antenna views upgrades or downgrades as part of Disney's wholesale business, and that the numbers appear higher than Disney's internal data. It's also not clear how many subscribers left because of Kimmel and how many left because of planned price hikes that were announced amid the drama.

	











	The elevated churn came amid Kimmel's suspension from his ABC late night show over a somewhat ambiguously worded on-air comment on the Sept. 15 edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live! about Charlie Kirk's assassin that could easily be read as suggesting the suspect was a MAGA conservative — despite evidence to the contrary. The quote went viral, sparking plenty of online backlash.


	ABC ultimately returned him to the air after less than a week, but his suspension sparked enormous outrage, with many users on social media urging followers to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. In fact, Kimmel's friend, the influential SiriusXM host Howard Stern, said on his show that he had canceled Disney+ in protest of the move by Disney.


	The data from Antenna is the first real sign that the protest may have had an impact on Disney's bottom line, though we may never actually know for sure how impactful it was. As THR noted, due to the timing of billing cycles, protest cancelations may not be reflected in Disney's next earnings report, and the company will stop reporting subscriber numbers in the following report in a previously announced decision.


	Still, the new data suggests that churn doubled, which would be consistent with a loss of around three million subscribers.

Dan Wall, the ticketing giant's top corporate and regulatory affairs lawyer, skewers the FTC lawsuit in a feisty letter to two U.S. senators.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



	In the wake of last month's Federal Trade Commission lawsuit, Ticketmaster has announced a major policy change, telling lawmakers that the company plans to bar fans and brokers from operating multiple accounts on its platform. Ticketmaster also plans to shut down its long-criticized TradeDesk ticket uploading application and start requiring ticket brokers to hand over their Social Security numbers in order to sell tickets on Ticketmaster's resale platform.


	The change is outlined in a detailed, 10-page letter to Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), dated Oct. 17, by Live Nation executive vice president Daniel M. Wall. The letter from the company's top corporate and regulatory affairs lawyer responds to a congressional inquiry about the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit, joined by seven state attorneys general, accusing Ticketmaster and Live Nation of anti-competitive behavior and BOTS Act violations.


	Wall's message is clear: the FTC's case “presents a distorted view of the facts and the law.” He argues that the government's claims are based on “novel and expansionist” interpretations of the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act, and that Ticketmaster — not its competitors — has done more than anyone to combat scalping and fraud.


	From the outset, Wall positions Live Nation as an ally of consumers, not an adversary. Wall opens by assuring the senators that the company shares their “commitment to supporting artists and fans and protecting the integrity of the live entertainment industry.” The FTC's complaint, he argues, targets the one company that has “indisputably done more than anyone else in the industry to fight the bad actors.”


	One of the most serious allegations in the FTC complaint is that Ticketmaster “coordinated with ticket brokers” to obtain inventory and profit from resale fees. Wall calls that claim “categorically false.”


	He argues that the FTC has confused the long-standing industry practice of brokers maintaining multiple accounts — a holdover from the physical-ticket era — with illegal conspiracy. “That ticket brokers have been allowed to maintain multiple accounts is true; calling that conspiracy is specious,” Wall writes, emphasizing that Ticketmaster does not secretly transfer tickets to scalpers or relax enforcement of ticket limits “for financial gain.”


	The letter frames the issue as one of historical practice, not misconduct, noting that secondary marketplaces like StubHub, SeatGeek and Vivid Seats rely on broker inventory for 80–100% of their listings. In Live Nation's view, allowing brokers multiple accounts may be a legacy practice worth reforming — but it's not a crime.


The TradeDesk Controversy


	The senators' letter had echoed FTC concerns over TradeDesk, Ticketmaster's inventory management platform, which regulators claim facilitated large-scale ticket harvesting. Wall calls that portrayal “plainly false.”


	According to the letter, TradeDesk does not purchase tickets and has no bot functionality. Instead, it's a logistics tool for brokers to track and price their listings across multiple marketplaces. “It is one of numerous inventory management systems,” Wall writes, citing StubHub's TicketUtils, Vivid Seats' SkyBox, and independent tools like Automatiq as comparable software.


	Still, in a notable concession, Live Nation says it will be “removing TradeDesk's concert ticket management functionality from the market” to avoid “reputational harm.” Wall acknowledges that users will simply migrate to other systems, but the move appears designed to blunt political criticism and show that Ticketmaster is serious about reform.


	Wall also announced a major change to the company's rules about how many accounts a user is allowed to operate. The company's current policy, as of August 2025, explains that “each [Ticketmaster] account must be linked to a unique individual and contain up-to-date information,” noting that the company “may restrict the number of accounts you can create.”


	Going forward, Wall explains, Ticketmaster will now limit every entity — including professional resellers — to a single verified account. Each resale account will require a unique taxpayer ID, and excess accounts will be canceled. Wall says Ticketmaster will deploy new AI tools and identity verification to identify fake or duplicate accounts and remove unauthorized users. Ticketmaster already blocks more than 99% of 25 million daily signup attempts, Wall claims.


	Ticketmaster will also expand its anti-bot systems that currently block 200 million bots per day, with new tools for artists to conduct “post-onsale ticket sweeps” to cancel fraudulent purchases. Finally, Wall reiterates that Ticketmaster will work with artists to ensure more tickets go to fans, citing programs like Artist Sign Up, Smart Queue and Face Value Exchange as examples of consumer-friendly innovation.


	The company presents these initiatives as proof of good faith — an effort to show lawmakers that Live Nation is addressing the same problems the FTC claims it's ignoring.


	Wall rejected arguments that Ticketmaster was “turning a blind eye” to bot activity because the company profits from fees on both primary and secondary sales. Wall dismisses the theory as “nonsensical,” arguing that resale revenue accounts for less than 2% of Live Nation's total revenue and that its resale market share is below 20%. “Our incentives are plainly to favor artists and fans,” he writes.


	The letter also takes aim at the FTC's use of a 2018 internal email suggesting that Ticketmaster “turns a blind eye as a matter of policy.” Wall claims the agency misquoted the message out of context — noting that the author was actually complaining about an internal compliance “wall” separating Ticketmaster's primary and resale operations, not advocating for lax enforcement. The FTC, he writes, “picked nine words out of context and changed the policy those words addressed to create that misimpression.”


A Broader Fight Over the BOTS Act


	At the core of the dispute is how the BOTS Act — a 2016 law co-sponsored by Senator Blackburn — should be interpreted. The FTC claims Ticketmaster violated the act by allowing brokers to circumvent ticket limits. Live Nation argues the law was never meant to criminalize multiple account ownership but to target technological circumvention — i.e., using bots or scripts to bypass anti-fraud systems.


	“The FTC's case is based on a fundamentally novel and expansionist view of the BOTS Act,” Wall writes, accusing regulators of “writing ‘technological controls' out of the statute.” In his view, only those who use or control software to circumvent security measures — not every broker with extra accounts — can violate the act.


	Ironically, Wall notes, Live Nation itself has advocated for expanding the BOTS Act to explicitly outlaw automated ticket-buying tools, suggesting that the company supports stronger anti-bot laws — just not this interpretation of them.


	Wall closes by expressing support for the bipartisan MAIN Event Ticketing Act, which aims to expand the BOTS Act and improve reporting of bot attacks. But he warns that requiring ticketing companies to report every instance of circumvention could overwhelm the system: “Attempted circumvention… happens constantly and at enormous scale.”


	Instead, he urges the FTC to focus on enforcement — going after the “purveyors of ticket harvesting technology and their customers” — rather than imposing new reporting mandates on companies like Ticketmaster.


	The letter is more than a rebuttal — it's a strategic document. By framing the issue as a technological and legislative problem, Live Nation is shifting the fight from antitrust to cybersecurity and betting that policymakers care more about fighting bots than wading into a complex breakup case. At the same time, Live Nation's decision to sunset TradeDesk and impose stricter account rules shows that the company recognizes the political cost of perception. Even if the FTC's case falters in court, the public narrative around “collusion with scalpers” could prove damaging in Congress.


	For now, Live Nation's message to Washington is simple: we're not the villains — we're the ones fighting them.

	Steve Knopper



	In mid-October, just below The Zombies‘ re-recorded 1960s classic “Time of the Season” and Tame Impala‘s new indie hit “Dracula,” a curious track landed at No. 10 on Billboard‘s Rock Digital Song Sales chart. “You Got This,” built on a chanting “don't quit like this/hold your ground” chorus and Nickelback-style vocals, scored 1,000 download sales and 294,000 streams in a week, and it has nearly 3,700 TikTok comments, including from a bearded man about to undergo cancer surgery and a widow looking for a sign from her late husband. “‘You Got This' was the phrase he ALWAYS said,” she posted.


	Who is this inspirational new rocker? Unbound Music, which has posted more than 120 tracks on TikTok over the past year, adds a disclaimer: “All songs have AI elements in them.” It's not unusual for AI artists to hit the charts — Xania Monet, an AI artist whose lyrics come from a Mississippi-based songwriter, went Top 10 on R&B Digital Song Sales for two straight weeks in September and No. 22 on overall Digital Song Sales. What is harder to understand is why these artists are selling so many tracks online in addition to all the streaming.


	There may be a simple explanation: Creators find digital-download files to be cleaner source material for training generative AI systems than recordings based on Spotify or Apple Music streams. And AI creators look for successful AI tracks so they can follow similar blueprints. “That's what's driving the sales, is the experimenting and curiosity behind it,” says Ahmed Kordofani, who goes by Chord of Annie, a London producer who “humanizes” AI tracks. “People can use existing AI-generated tracks to train AI to do a better job. You can use that downloaded track to make something grander, even bigger.”


	Many of the charting AI artists have mysterious origins — nobody responded to a DM through Unbound Music's TikTok account. But “You Got This” is one of several likely AI and AI-enhanced artists hitting sales charts in recent weeks. Enlly Blue's “Through My Soul” landed at No. 15 on the latest Rock Digital Song Sales chart, with 1,000 downloads and 224,000 streams in a week, according to Luminate; and ChildPets Galore's “The Only Thing I Can Take to Heaven” peaked at No. 14 on Christian Digital Song Sales in mid-August and has racked up 305,000 Spotify streams and nearly 600,000 YouTube views since July. “AI has been booming these days, and a lot of people have been using AI to enhance or generate new songs,” Kordofani says.


	In addition to the chart activity, Billboard‘s charts team has identified several apparently AI-enhanced tracks that have sold an unexpected number of downloads, suggesting real people, not just online bots designed to boost streaming data, are fans of the music. That may be due in part to lingering iTunes habits from Christian and country consumers, among others. About 5% of overall music fans reported purchasing a download from Apple or Amazon stores in 2024, according to a MusicWatch survey, compared to 9% of country fans; 23% of Christian-music listeners reported listening to digital-music files, compared to 18% of listeners overall. 


	“Country fans are much more likely to still be buying downloads. The Christian genre is smaller, but they're still more likely to be listening to things from iTunes or Amazon,” says Russ Crupnick, Music Watch Inc.'s managing partner. “One could make the argument: If there's a lot of AI falling into those genres, and they're available on downloads, and those [listeners] are more likely to fall into downloads as well as streaming — you can tie all those bows together.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: There's more bleeding red neon than imagined coming out of Disney‘s Tron: Ares. Deadline has learned from sources that the third chapter in the 43-year-old video game matrix protagonist story actually cost $220 million net, not the reported $170 million-$180 million that was floated out there.


	This means that the Jared Leto-Greta Lee-Jeff Bridges light cycle movie is headed for a $132.7 million loss after all ancillaries, that is if its final global gross smacks dead into a wall at $160 million. The Joachim Rønning-directed movie counted through its second weekend as of Sunday a running worldwide cume of $103 million, with a 67% second-weekend domestic plummet of $11.1M.

	











	At a $160 million box office threshold, Tron: Ares triggers $72.2 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, $37.6M in global home entertainment, close to a $100M in global home television, with an extra $5 million from airlines for a total of $214.8M in revenues. Put this up against the $220 million net production cost shot with Vancouver, BC tax credits, a $102.5M global P&A spend with stunts at San Diego Comic-Con, touring light cycles, a laser light Nine Inch Nails laser-light concert at the Los Angeles premiere that closed down Hollywood Boulevard, $10.8M in others costs and $14.2M in residuals, which gets you to total costs of $347.5M. That gets us to a $132.7 million loss.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Exclaimed one astute talent rep on why it was game over for Tron: Ares at this October's box office: “There was no specific vision, to be honest. The idea that Disney would spend a quarter of a billion dollars on a Jared Leto film that is a franchise that hasn't worked in four decades is insane.”

	











	While we've told you the shortcomings with this Disney reboot swing and miss — i.e., the finite appeal of the Tron franchise (it bombed when it first came out in the 1980s, gained cult status on home video, and had an OK revival in 2010 a year after the first Avatar making $400M) and the limited draw of non-Star Wars and some non-Star Trek sci-fi movies overall (such fare typically opens in the $24M-$40M range; anything over $50M or even $100M is far and few between) — ultimately Tron‘s faulty battery was its screenplay. Great screenplays overcome great historical hurdles; read Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean proved pirate movies can work, and more recently, Denis Villeneuve followed another pricey, finite sci-fi fan reboot that flopped in 2018's Blade Runner 2049 ($185M cost, $92M domestic, near $278M worldwide gross and also starring Leto) by proving post-Covid that there was heart and chills in Frank Herbert's Dune series (combined global gross of $1.1 billion). The latter IP had sunk like quicksand 41 years ago with a domestic take of $31.4M.


	So, don't blame former Disney production head and Tron: Ares producer Sean Bailey for doing his job, championing a franchise revival (duh, it's those events that work theatrically), carefully. Tron: Legacy‘s box office haul was an improvement definitely upon the original, though not Avatar spectacular. That 2010 movie was early proof of the talents of filmmaker Joseph Kosinski, who would later deliver unto the world Top Gun: Maverick and F1. Hence, a sequel because of Legacy‘s alright results wasn't rushed to the screen. Originally, the third Tron was conceived as a sequel to Legacy, with Kosinski returning alongside the characters played by Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund. The notion of Tron coming into our world ala Ares was always part of the third chapter, I'm told.


	However, I hear that Rønning wanted a different script for the film other than the Jesse Wigutow one that Disney pushed to greenlight. The filmmaker, who can deliver character-driven stories at a low budget ala the Oscar nominated Kon-Tiki and Young Woman and the Sea, as well as Disney commercial fare such as Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was lobbying for Ford v. Ferrari‘s Jez Butterworth. At the end of the initial shoot, we hear that Oscar-nominated Captain Phillips screenwriter Billy Ray had to step in to deliver pages to fix various parts of Tron: Ares, that work amounting to less than a month's worth of reshoots.


	Many would like to throw tomatoes at Disney for the casting, that there's zero audience attraction for the likes of Leto, Lee, etc. First, despite tabloid headlines about Leto, such noise doesn't factor into moviegoers' decisions to buy or not buy a ticket; it could be argued most were not even in the know of the June Air Mail exposé on his alleged behavior. Tron is the star at the end of the day. Had the fan faithful declared it was a better movie than the last, perhaps we'd see an expansion of the audience and some box office momentum, rather than falling short of its $40M domestic opening projection with $33.2M.


	Moviegoers gave Tron: Ares the same CinemaScore as Tron: Legacy, a B+, which indicates there was no reason to have any FOMO. Definite recommend was an OK 57% on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak; a score in the mid-60s- to 70-percentile range indicates a hopeful tentpole has electricity. Tron: Ares was older skewing with 70% over age 25, indicating both the Gen-X and Legacy millennial fans showed up. However, as far as making new fans, Tron: Ares had little appeal from the 13-17 crowd who showed up at 6%. While the core Gen X Tron fans gave Tron: Ares a very high 71%+ definite recommend, the 18-24 set gave it the lowest of any demographic at 44%. Not good.

	











	Even with Tron being the headliner, when we look at the remake of Dune, there was something undeniable for audiences in watching Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet in what is a Byzantine IP. Natch, yes, there is something to be said about star appeal, but there are few who can open a film, and typically IP is enough for studios' execs to sleep soundly at night. Still, a Tron reboot with someone bigger than a  star of House of Gucci and Morbius could have worked. But again, the blip with Tron: Ares remains its story.


	“The franchise is dead” was the emphatic proclamation about Tron: Ares after it failed on opening weekend. Let's take that with a grain of salt. First, those close to the project believe that ultimately Tron: Ares was an advertisement for the Disney theme park rides (also one of the catalysts for Tron: Ares being made, versus say any Disney+ viewership of previous Tron movies). In any given day at the Shanghai theme park and Walt Disney World in Orlando, next to Pirates of the Caribbean ride the Tron ride is the one with the biggest lines.


	Second, with any of these sci-fi franchises, even when they stumble, there's a gap in years between bombs and improved-upon revivals, i.e., 1997's Alien Resurrection ($16.4M domestic opening, $47.7M domestic final, $161.3M worldwide) and 2004's Alien vs. Predator ($38.2M domestic opening, $80.2M domestic, $177.4M global, Fox's most profitable movie that year with 16 million DVDs sold and $93M pure profit), Tim Burton's poorly received 2001 Planet of the Apes and 2011's start of a new trilogy Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and so on. Let's face it, even Superman looked like he was gone after the last two Christopher Reeves movies Superman III (a zany Richard Pryor comedy with a final global of $80.2M) and 1987's Superman IV: Quest for Peace ($30.2M global), and Bryan Singer's bloated-budget 2006 Superman Returns ($391M off a $204M net cost). But this past summer we had James Gunn's Superman which is one of the highest-grossing movies of all time for the DC superhero at a near $616M.


	It's fair to say that time heals all franchise wounds. However, we can't say that about Tron: Ares this time around.

I know plenty of people, myself included, who refuse to see this movie specifically because Leto is the principal.

Exactly this. I didn't want to see it because of him and nearly everyone else I know raised him as a deciding factor.

As a visual person and designer, the two Tron sequels lost their appeal when the went for the “realistic” approach with the visuals. They made the grid boring. Things look like everyday life, just with some Illumi-Wire attached here and there. The light cycles look like motorcycles with some lights attached.

You know you've lost some of the cool factor when cosplayers at Comicon can replicate your looks perfectly, and you have contestants on “America's Got Talent” putting on better illuminated-costume performances than your jillion-dollar movie? Throwing lights on a boring leather-ish costume and calling it a day doesn't cut it anymore; it's become passé.

Where is the creativity and playfulness? The grid wasn't supposed to be like the real world – it was trying to imagine the interior world of a machine with electrons zipping along circuits, computer code logic, etc. The normal rules of the human world did not apply. 

Why lean into realism (other than ease of filming and cost), when you've been given the opportunity to be imaginative and do something new?

As a family, we all watched Tron and Legacy back to back this week, then went to see ARES in the Glasgow IMAX. That was definitely the way to go. ARES is NOT a bad movie. It references and marries both the previous movies in a good way, and it's a great joy ride all by itself. I'm in the habit of ignoring ‘reviews' and making up my own mind. Glad I did so again, and it's a pity that more filmgoers havn't done the same.

I for one enjoy the Tron franchise but immediately wrote the film off when I saw Leto as the lead. And I agree with others that the marketing failed.

The issue wasn't the movie, it's what critics have been comparing it to. It wasn't supposed to be anything but nostalgia of a cult favorite.
We've seen user go to the grid and we were teased in “Legacy“ about programs in “the real world”.  So now that vision has been made. Honestly Disney should fire its advertising department. I'm hoping we get a real vs. digital world clash with “End of line” or “Game Over”.

Associate Editor, TV


Netflix and Chernin Entertainment have set the new drama series Kennedy, which will explore the triumphs and tragedies of the Kennedy family. Michael Fassbender (The Agency, Black Bag) has been cast as patriarch Joe Kennedy Sr.


Kennedy is based on Fredrik Logevall's book JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century, 1917-1956, and will be showrun by Sam Shaw (Manhattan, Masters of Sex) and directed by Thomas Vinterberg (Festen, The Hunt), with all three set as executive producers.


	According to the official logline, the eight-episode series will reveal “the intimate lives, loves, rivalries, and tragedies that shaped the most iconic dynasty in modern history, and helped create the world we live in today. Beginning in the 1930s, the first season charts the improbable ascent of Joe and Rose Kennedy and their nine children, including rebellious second son Jack, who struggles to escape the shadow of his golden boy older brother.”

	Kennedy Sr. led the political Kennedy dynasty with his wife Rose, the parents of President John F. Kennedy, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward “Ted” Kennedy among a total of nine children. While heavily into the world of politics, their business and personal lives intersected with Hollywood across multiple generations.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Before helping to launch the political careers of his three sons, Joe Kennedy had a high-profile government career of his own. He was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be the the first chairman of the SEC (1934-35), the first Director of the United States Maritime Commission (1936-38), and U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom (1938-40) during the early years of World War II.

	











	The announcement of the Kennedy series follows Netflix's success with the historical drama series The Crown, the acclaimed six-season telling of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. The series received 24 Emmy Awards from its total 87 nominations, including Best Drama Series for Season 4 in 2021, and multiple acting awards. Additionally, the streamer explored the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the German series The Empress in 2022. Led by Devrim Lingnau in the titular role, the cast began work on the show's third season earlier this fall.


	In addition to Shaw, Vinterberg and Logevall, executive producers are Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping and Kaitlin Dahill for Chernin Entertainment, Eric Roth, Lila Byock, Anya Epstein, Dustin Thomason and Anna O'Malley.


	Fassbender currently stars in the Showtime series The Agency: Central Intelligence in the leading role of Brandon Colby. Up next, he will be seen in Hope, the film written, directed and produced by Na Hong-jin in which he stars alongside his wife Alicia Vikander, to be released next year.


	He is perhaps best known for his work in the Alien franchise film Prometheus, set before the original Alien film released in 1979; playing Steve Jobs in the eponymous biopic from Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle; and starring as Magneto in four X-Men franchise films.

One wonders what else there is to tell about the Kennedy's back in the day, but like the Windsors, the Kennedy's are forever interesting to American audiences.  Have to admit, I'll watch it!

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Ahead of next month's American Film Market, Alliance Media Partners (AMP) has signed up survival horror The Hatchery as worldwide sales agent.


	Currently in early pre-production, the ocean-set film has Terrifier star Jenna Kanell attached in the lead role.


	The synopsis reads: “Eight women awaken in darkness inside a cargo container with no memory of how they got there. Captives of a human trafficking ring, their fight for survival turns even more desperate when a violent storm hurls their container into the ocean. Stranded at sea, they band together against the odds — until one of them begins to change. Her wounds heal unnaturally fast, her strength grows monstrous, and the others realize the truth: she's not just a victim, but the product of a horrifying experiment. Trapped with a predator, survival takes on a whole new meaning.”

	“We're thrilled to be partnering with Howard and the team to bring The Hatchery to AFM,” said Anthony Buckner, AMP's Head of Sales, Acquisitions, and Distribution. “This is a high-concept horror which shines a light on sensitive issues in a way that global audiences can easily relate to. We're excited to be able to share it with international buyers in Los Angeles.”


	Howard J Ford commented: “This project is going to be raw and terrifying – I want audiences to feel trapped in that container with these women as the tension builds and then explodes. Our team will deliver a film that shocks, thrills and stands out. Strap in – it's going to be a wild ride!”

	











	Kanell, who also works as a stunt performer, played one of the leads in 2016 slasher film Terrifier, which has gone on to become one of the biggest breakout horror franchises of recent years. Other credits include Renfield and Bad Boys: Ride Or Die.

	While director Edgar Wright and star Glen Powell were ready to cross the starting line for Paramount Pictures' forthcoming The Running Man adaptation, the latter had to wait for approval from author Stephen King.


	Though the Baby Driver director offered the Chad Powers star the lead role, the duo had to wait for an official green light from King, who penned the 1982 dystopian thriller novel on which the film is based.


	“Edgar offered me this movie, and I was like, ‘Yes.' I'm like, ‘Let's go…' And then, like, later that night [Edgar says], ‘By the way, like, you have to be approved by Stephen King. He's gonna watch Hit Man tonight,” Powell recalled at a New York Comic Con panel, per People.

	The Twisters star continued, “And so I had to wait overnight for Stephen King to watch Hit Man and hope that I still had the role in the morning. It's terrible.”

	Of course, King “loved” the film, Powell said, meaning he could go on to portray Ben Richards, a working-class father who, in the near future, is forced to compete in a deadly reality show to save his ailing daughter. The top-rated televised program features contestants who must survive for a month while being hunted by professional assassins.


	And while Powell needed approval, so did helmer Wright, recalling the nail-biting experience of sending over a first draft of the script he co-wrote with Michael Bacall. “Stephen King read the screenplay before we started filming, and you know, Stephen King, he's like the most famous English teacher in history … I was like, ‘This is so nerve-wracking to have to hand in our homework to [him]. But he loved the screenplay, and so it was great.”

	











	Wright noted the film will pay “homage” to not only the source material, but also the original 1987 film adaptation starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the titular role, though he added his take is “more faithful to the book” than the previous iteration.


The Running Man, initially slated for a Nov. 7 release, will debut theatrically a week later to take advantage of Imax screens.

There have been some pretty terrible Stephen King adaptations in the past, like The Lawnmower Man. It's understandable that King would want more control over media based on his work. (To be fair, adaptations are not easy. One of the worst Stephen King adaptations was Maximum Overdrive, by first-time director Stephen King.)

I would include the first Running Man. It is peak 80s Arnie cheese, and on some level I love it for that. But as an adaption of the original story it's not much more than the title and high concept. One hopes the new version only vaguely ‘pays homage' to that one.

I would have said no

Sounds like King has WAY too much power.

🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♀️

Hard disagree.

UPDATE: Hundreds of websites and apps which went offline temporarily in North America and Europe on Monday morning following an outage at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center in North Virginia appeared to be functioning as normal as the U.S. woke up.


	Earlier in the day, Amazon Services such as Amazon Music, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa went down or suffered slowdowns, alongside messaging apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Snapchat as well as entertainment and game sites including IMDb, Disney+, Fortnite,  Roblox and Wordle among many. 


	In its latest update at 7.29am PDT related to the data center outage, AWS, which provides cloud services to thousands of businesses worldwide, said the situation was improving but gave no reason for the cause of the problem.

	“We have confirmed multiple AWS services experienced network connectivity issues in the US-EAST-1 Region. We are seeing early signs of recovery for the connectivity issues and are continuing to investigate the root cause,” read the message.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In the backdrop, e-commerce experts said that the resumption of connectivity was just one part of the story, warning that Monday morning's outage would likely have longer-term consequences for businesses operating on the web.


	“When AWS sneezes, half the internet catches the flu. Outages like this cause frustrated users but also trigger a domino effect across payment flows,” said Monica Eaton, Founder and CEO of e-commerce services provider Chargebacks911 and Fi911.

	











	“What I expect now is a spike in ‘I never got my service' or ‘I was charged twice' claims. Many of those won't be fraud, just confusion. But confusion is the number one driver of chargebacks. If merchants sit back and wait for disputes to roll in, they will bleed revenue unnecessarily.”


	She urged online businesses to get ahead of the curve by running duplicate charge sweeps, pushing out proactive notifications to affected users and issuing prompt refunds to impacted customers.


	“The outage will end long before the disputes do. Any business that treats this as a one-day incident is already behind. Downtime happens, but silence and slow responses are what cause real damage.”


	Ismael Wrixen, CEO of  digital commerce platform ThriveCart said the outage should serve a wakeup call for all operators in the space.


	Today's outage isn't just an ‘East Coast AWS' problem; it's a reminder that 100% uptime is a myth for everyone. The internet runs on shared infrastructure. The real story isn't just that AWS had a critical issue, but how many businesses discovered their platform partner had no plan for it, especially outside of U.S. hours. This is a harsh wake-up call about the critical need for multi-regional redundancy and intelligent architecture.” 


Previously at 1.50am PDT: Hundreds of online services went temporarily offline across North America and Europe on Monday morning amid suggestions that the problem was linked to an outage at an Amazon Web Services data center in North Virginia.


	Alongside Amazon services such as Amazon Music, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa a slew of other websites and apps also suffered problems, including Signal, Life360, Roblox, Zoom, Fortnight, IMDb, and Disney+ among many.


	The issue appeared to be linked to a severe outage at an AWS facility in North Virginia, but it has yet to be confirmed if this is the sole cause of wider issues, which were reported both in North America and Europe.


	AWS first reporting “increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services” just after midnight PT, with its latest message at 1.26am PT, saying the issue was ongoing.


	“We can confirm significant error rates for requests made to the DynamoDB endpoint in the US-EAST-1 Region,” read the message.


	“This issue also affects other AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region as well. During this time, customers may be unable to create or update Support Cases. Engineers were immediately engaged and are actively working on both mitigating the issue, and fully understanding the root cause. We will continue to provide updates as we have more information to share, or by 2:00 AM.” 


	Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, was one of the first to point to the AWS outage at the cause of the problem, with a post on X saying: “Perplexity is down right now. The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it”.


	The issue first started hitting the news as people woke up in Europe to discover a number of websites and apps were not working.


	Monitoring sites such as Downdetector started to report a spike in issues for multiple sites and apps at around 8am UK time (midnight PT).


	Beyond entertainment and media sites, a number of banking sites were also impacted including the UK's Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Bank and Halifax as well as cryptocurrency site Coinbase. The latter put out a statement saying all funds were safe.


	The incident has echoes of an outage at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike in July 2024, which impacted 8.5 million Window devices worldwide, disrupting airlines, banks and government services at an estimated cost of $10b overall.

	











	The exact cause of the outage has yet to be ascertained

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Task's gentle yet intense finale ties up some emotional loose ends","https://www.avclub.com/task-season-1-finale-recap-a-still-small-voice","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

I'm curious to know how HBO and Brad Ingelsby settled on seven as the number of episodes for this season of Task. In some ways, it feels like the season could have benefited from a more standard eight-to-10-episode run, which would have allowed the series to expand on the Brandis family history (it's crazy to cast Mireille Enos for one brief flashback scene), flesh out the Grasso chapter of the crime saga, and round out some of the underdeveloped supporting characters. As the season comes to a close, there's still so much more I want to know about so many of its key players.

And yet, in other ways, I think the series could have benefited from a more condensed five or six episode run that cut out the Grasso chapter altogether and really anchored this story around Tom and Robbie, with the Dark Hearts as a background threat to drive the plot forward. While the action and violence that happens in this finale is tense and visceral, it lacks the same emotional drive as last week's forest shoot-out. That action sequence was thematically rich. This episode's big Maeve vs. the Dark Hearts showdown is impressive on a technical level and incredibly tense to watch in the moment, but a little less impactful as a climax to the season. (Even Perry's visit to Maeve's house back in “Vagrants” had way more meat on its bones in terms of her family's connections to the motorcycle gang.)

Still, as Tom puts it to Kathleen, “Wisdom is knowing what to overlook.” And Task has been such a unique addition to the prestige-TV landscape, that I'm inclined to overlook some of the bumpier moments in this finale. Is it insane that Perry left his monogrammed chain on Eryn's body after he killed her? Yes. Does it make any sense that Grasso kept Ray's burner phone rather than switching it out with the decoy one in the evidence locker? No. 

Yet when I think back on Task, I suspect that what will linger with me won't be the plot holes, but the unexpectedly gentle tone this intense show has found for itself. This is an episode where a surprise apartment shoot-out and a conversation about dog walking both feel equally impactful. And that's an impressive balancing act. 

The big theme of “A Still Small Voice” is about the importance of speaking the truth, even when it's messy and unfinished and might get you in trouble. And, to its credit, this is one of the few crime shows I've watched where characters seriously consider turning themselves over to the cops rather than simply running for as long as they can. Maeve did that with Sam and she considers doing it with the one-million dollars that Robbie left her as well—at least until her arcade co-worker suggests she should at least try to keep it for herself. (Amen, girl!)

Grasso also plans to turn himself in after Lizzie's death proves to be the straw that broke the camel's back for his two-year stint as a Dark Hearts informant. Despite how intense his conversation with Tom was last week, Grasso's pretty eager to do the right thing here. In fact, one of the clunkier elements of “A Still Small Voice” is how quickly it rushes Grasso out of morally grey territory and into an overtly sympathetic place. He gets a single mom sister and two adorable nephews he's been selflessly supporting with the Dark Hearts money. And after Dorsey's attempt to frame him goes violently wrong (a great scene!), he literally drives to Maeve's house while bleeding out from a gunshot wound in order to warn her that the Dark Hearts are coming to take her money and potentially kill her family. 

In some ways, there's been a sort of karmic balance to who lives and dies this season. Cliff, Tom, and—to a lesser degree—Eryn died for the hubris of trying to bite off more than they could chew with their get-rich-quick/revenge scheme. Instead of listening to Cliff's gut instinct, they went through with an ambitious burglary and eventually lost their lives for it. Grasso, however, does enough to earn redemption and survive his gunshot wound. He's left with guilt and (presumably) a prison sentence but still very much alive. And Maeve—perhaps the purest, most sympathetic character on the show—gets to live thanks to her guardian angel Donna and some quick, if reckless, thinking from Harper. She even gets to keep the money, after Tom agrees to look the other way.

Perry's death, meanwhile, takes on the sheen of a Greek tragedy. He's killed by his surrogate son after killing his surrogate daughter. Yet even as he's bleeding out from a gruesome stab wound, he's still trying to save Jayson's life—warning him that the Dark Hearts mother club is coming to kill him. That Jayson eventually dies at Grasso's hand also fits the sort of karmic circle the show has going. And, if you squint, I suppose Aleah's karmic reward is getting to work through some of the trauma of her past abuse by taking down a giant Dark Hearts goon who's trying to choke her to death. 

Still, it's a little hard to square that sense of moral justice with the death of poor, doomed Lizzie. I guess you could say Lizzie suffered the tragedy of trying to prove her heroism without understanding her limits. But it mostly feels like she died to give Grasso something to avenge. If anything, though, I think leaving Lizzie alive to process Grasso's dirty-cop reveal would have been more interesting than killing her off to motivate his face turn. As is, she winds up feeling weirdly forgotten in this finale, even though her death was such a major event last week. 

Which isn't to say that Task hasn't had some compelling female characters—including Kathleen as a great successor to the Mare Of Easttown vibe. I also love the way these past few episodes have depicted Sara and Emily's slowly thawing relationship. Tom's impulsive decision to honor his wife's memory and take Sam in as a foster kid becomes an act of healing for the whole Brandis family.

Seeing Sam's innocent excitement at getting to decorate his own room or his sweet request that Tom stay with him until he falls asleep serves as a reminder that Ethan and Emily were once just young, vulnerable foster kids that Tom, Susan, and Sara excitedly welcomed into their family. If Task is in some way a show about generations, then Sam's arrival allows Tom, Sara, and Emily to look at their experiences through a new, gentler lens—one where Sara proudly recalls her little brother finding a lost neighborhood dog and Tom remembers that Emily is still just a kid who needs a parent, not someone he should be leaning on to take care of him. 

That all builds to the standout scene of the finale: Tom writing and reading a family statement at Ethan's sentencing hearing. It's not a literal confession, but it's an act of speaking the truth in order to remove the shame of it. Ethan did something horrible. But he was also dealt an incredibly unfair hand in life, both with his intense disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and with a pandemic that cut him off from the only medication that could quiet the dangerous voices in his head. Tom doesn't know what to do with that; he can't say what punishment Ethan does or doesn't deserve. But he does decide that he wants to keep his son in his life. Whenever Ethan is released from prison, Tom will have his room waiting for him.

It's a beautiful sequence, all the more so because the episode doesn't go for the cheesy, predictable route of having Tom put aside his prepared statement and give some perfect off-the-cuff speech. Mark Ruffalo plays the reality of Tom reading the letter in court, only going for the emotional jugular when Tom pauses to ask Ethan to look at him so he can offer forgiveness, love, and freedom from shame. 

I also love that even after all the sweet scenes of Tom bonding with Sam, the show doesn't just have Tom adopt him. Sam may have helped the Brandis family heal, but he also deserves a home where his healing can be the full priority. Father Daniel (another character I would have liked to learn more about) helps Tom realize that. And the show ultimately ends on a hopeful—but not quite “happily ever after”—note.

The last thing we see is Tom repainting Ethan's room, symbolizing the fresh start of a new chapter whenever Ethan returns. Instead of being beholden to the dynamics of the past, they'll build a new future together—although, as Maeve tells Harper, there's power to remembering the past too. Before the Prendergrasts take off for their own new future, Maeve takes a photo of Harper in front of the home that played such a seismic role in their lives. The past doesn't have to define us, but it's still a part of our story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Chair Company's darkness starts to seep out","https://www.avclub.com/the-chair-company-recap-season-1-episode-2","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:30:00 GMT","

I got worried when Natalie Trosper told her father that he's good at talking to people in “New Blood. There's 5 Rons Now.” Even for a show as early in its run as The Chair Company is, hearing about a character's defining traits is never as effective as seeing those traits displayed onscreen. And between his awkward interactions with waitstaff, bubble-necklace blow-up at Douglas, and inability to keep an unknown assailant from wailing on him with a lead pipe, the series premiere didn't show us that Ron Trosper is good at talking to people. And besides, Ron is a character played and co-created by Tim Robinson, and historically those aren't factors that make for an effective communicator. A loud, amusing communicator, maybe, but not someone who's going to be able to talk his daughter's future in-laws into forsaking a wedding-venue deposit to move the festivities to a haunted barn. (Now the “haunted barn” part does sound like Tim Robinson.) 

This isn't the only description of Ron we hear in “New Blood. There's 5 Rons Now.” Later on, after his zeal to reach a peddler of complicated-patterned shirts nearly gets his co-worker Jamie (Glo Tavarez) killed, the newly spiritually awakened, self-described bad driver tells Ron that there's a darkness to him—but also a light. That sounds a little more on the money. The Chair Company's second episode eventually displays its protagonist's powers of persuasion, in ways that also demonstrate the light that Julie notices. Even Ron himself would like us to know that he's a good guy, all evidence to the contrary. But the episode also draws much of its power, and its humor, from a darkness, one that both taunts and beckons toward Ron as he seeks to unwind the inconsequential mystery of why his greatest professional triumph was followed by an inconsequential embarrassment.

Because even when its funniest gags arrive in the sketch-comedy like packaging of a children's detective kit (tiny plastic fedora included) mistaken for the real deal or an upsettingly vulgar comedy routine, The Chair Company is following some tried and true structures. For their return to narrative TV, Zach Kanin and Tim Robinson are telling their own version of the classic hero's journey. At this point, Ron has heeded the call to adventure, and he's venturing into the unknown. Building on the peek beneath the surface that Ron's visit to the Tecca plant gave us, “New Blood. There's 5 Rons Now” provides a closer, longer look at all the weird worms wriggling around down there. It's a stark, hilarious contrast to his comfortable reality. And it feels like we're still only getting introduced to it.

We've met our first representative of this shadow realm, though: Mike Santini (Joseph Tudisco), the for-hire goon who smacked Ron upside the head last week. Played with nervy edge by Tudisco, Mike feels like the grimy id that Ron masks with his smiling phone-call voice and put-together TV news appearance—the darkness that slips out when he's dealing with the worst pillow in town or the text and email spam from the menswear boutique loyalty program he was duped into joining. Dealing in shopping bags full of flip phones and handguns, Mike is both a type in a broader pop-cultural sense and within the fictional universes of The Chair Company's creative braintrust. He's gangster-coded, but played by an experienced-yet-relatively-obscure actor whose most prominent gangster role is Italian Mobster in Grand Theft Auto IV, an obvious tough guy who's also given to strange tastes in fashion and what he listens to when driving. In another timeline, you can almost see him being played by the late Biff Wiff. 

Ron's immersion in Mike's world gives us a lot to laugh about, too. The soundtrack to their ride to meet Jim X—attributed to, if the captions on my screener are accurate, Wazy Wayne's—is a prime Robinson/Kanin non sequitur. Ludicrously profane and utterly inappropriate for the scenario, it's made all the funnier by the fact that Mike is really into it. And I absolutely lost my mind during the visit to Jan's Cafe, the rowdiest lunch spot this side of the Grouch diner from Follow That Bird! The Chair Company disorientation machine works overtime in that scene, the volume of the audio and the food-throwing behavior of the patrons (not to mention the fire that erupts in the kitchen) painting a picture of danger well before Mike shows his face. 

As much as the energy at Jan's, combined with the pitstop at Tamblay's, smacks of a Dan Flashes redux, they contribute to the comedy of contrast that the show is building. There's the relative quiet of Ron's existence before the chair incident versus the largely self-imposed noise of life afterward, the alarming sounds in the house and the unknown jogger that make the cold open feel so off-kilter, the muscular-metal riffage of Ron's post-Tamblay's rage clashing with the soft-rock return to the homestead, the burner phone vibrating within the Yeti mug.

It's something that Ron isn't ready to face yet, hence his bailing from the Jim X confrontation to the safety of game night. It hasn't taken The Chair Company long to create a sense of unease. Its cinematic technique has a lot to do with that, but so does the way that a POV like Ron's can blow unrelated, minor inconveniences way out of proportion. I feel like it's already conditioned me to look askance at any new information the conspiracy plot introduces—when Mike told Ron his name, my first thought was “I bet that's not his real name.”

But we can believe in this: Natalie's right about Ron being good at talking to people. And, fortunately, The Chair Company lets Ron show it. Sure, the primary display of that ability is a cliché-ridden heart-to-heart with Tara's dad, a scene whose tenderness would feel off-voice if it weren't for the awkward testing of loose patio stones that precedes it. (The show's sound team is earning their keep here.) But don't let that distract you from the funnier cherry on top of the scene: Ron beaming at the tiny hat attached to Seth's backpack—a father's Amazon misfire successfully passed off as the hot new trend among teens. Eat your heart out, Labubu.   

The type of story The Chair Company is telling, and its sense of humor, live in the push-and-pull between honesty and dishonesty. A line like “I'm just glad it's stupid wedding stuff that I don't care about” is funny because Robinson makes it feel like Ron's true priorities are slipping out—but I think he actually does care about where his daughter gets married, because we're seeing that he cares deeply about a great many things. And if he ever stopped for one second to consider what's actually worth caring about, or whether or not he should keep pressing on to Tamblay's after Jamie is nearly pancaked by an army truck, he wouldn't be making all these messes for himself. He certainly wouldn't be getting intimidating texts seemingly sent from his entryway closet.

Good guy or no, he will not stop pushing into that unknown darkness, and that's good for The Chair Company's viewers and the show itself. It can only benefit the weird little hero's journey Kanin, Robinson, and team are laying out.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's love life is once again making headlines — this time, for his rumored relationship with pop superstar Katy Perry. Photos of Trudeau, 53, wrapping his arms around Perry's waist and nuzzling her neck during a California yacht trip stunned fans and political observers alike.

The pair's public display of affection appeared to confirm months of speculation that they're officially an item. According to insiders, their connection shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.

“Justin has always been thought of as a bit of a mummy's boy,” one source told The Sun. “They both like to shake things up and live life on the edge. As Prime Minister, he had to keep a clean-cut image for years, but after stepping down, he's embracing freedom — something his mother understood all too well.”

Trudeau, who resigned earlier this year after serving as Canada's 23rd prime minister, finalized his separation from his wife Sophie Grégoire in 2023. The couple shares three children. Since then, the former leader's new relationship has sparked conversations not only about his personal life — but also about his family history.

Long before Justin made headlines for his love life, his mother, Margaret Trudeau, was the original “wild child” of Canadian politics. Married to then–Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1971 at just 22 years old, Margaret quickly became known for defying expectations of a political spouse. “I want to be more than a rose in my husband's lapel,” she famously said.

In the 1970s, Margaret's behavior scandalized Canada's political elite. She frequently partied at New York's Studio 54, spent weekends with the Rolling Stones, and was romantically linked to Hollywood figures like Jack Nicholson and Ryan O'Neal. A new biography, The Prince, details her rumored relationships with both Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood while still married to Pierre.

Ronnie Wood wrote in his 2007 memoir: “From the moment I met her, we spent as much time together as possible. We both knew it was something that couldn't have a future, but we shared something special for that short time.”

Margaret later addressed the controversy in her own 1979 memoir, “Beyond Reason,” admitting that her time with the Rolling Stones symbolized her search for freedom.

“In the eyes of the world, my weekend with the Rolling Stones was the freedom trip to end all freedom trips,” she wrote. “To the rest of Canada, it was yet another example of what a wicked wife I had become.”

Her free-spirited nature often clashed with her husband's political life. She later described feeling trapped in her role, saying, “From the day I became Mrs. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, it was like a glass panel was gently lowered into place around me.”

Now, decades later, Justin's relationship with Perry seems to mirror the same rebellious streak that defined his mother's life. Both share a history of breaking boundaries — Margaret in the rock 'n' roll era, and Justin in the social-media-driven spotlight.

“Being photographed on a yacht with a famous pop star is exactly the sort of thing his mother would have done back in the day,” an insider told The Sun.

Yes, I have been biting my cheek not to make a comment about this story, but it seems to occupy a lot of focus lately. So, let's set the record straight. Justin Trudeau is meeting with Katy Perry about his son's interest in the music industry. That's what he told me. He also said it meant nothing; how many guys do know would be able to control themselves over a half-naked lady kissing them!

Trudeau was officially the worst prime minister in the history of a Canada and should be in prison for the remainder of his life . Katy Perry should not claim to be a Christian. She's further from the definition than he is at this point! She should never have had a child!  These people continue to create children that are incapable of making sound, intelligent decisions. Instead, easily being brainwashed into doing the bidding of the evil that's running most of the world. It's a sad sad thing. God will not be mocked much longer.

Julia Lemigova has really been through a lot over the last few years. The “Real Housewives of Miami” star has been a rock of support during her wife's cancer battle, and has been entangled in a handful of Bravo battles as well. She and Martina Navratilova adopted two young boys, a move that has put distance between Julia and her older daughters. 

Fans of the series watched as the season seven reunion shook Julia's world to the core when she decided to share her version of the truth about her real relationship and hookup with Adriana. Now, after the dust has settled, Julia has shared an exciting life update with OK Magazine.

Julia now confirms that she is officially chasing her passion. She is now enrolled in the opera program at Florida International University's School of Music. It was that special RHOM episode where she surprised Martina with an opera performance that unlocked her new goals

“I'm a really curious person. When I started opera two years ago, I hated it when I would hit so many wrong notes. When I got this opportunity on the show (RHOM), I said to myself, ‘I don't want to stop. I want to go back to basics and study it.' Now I'm with 18 and 20-year-old kids studying and taking so many different classes, but I love it. It's exhausting, but I'm working this muscle in my brain, and I've never felt more alive,” explains Julia.

The reality star is also very busy with her children, and the farm animals that she tends to, but she is enjoying this new season in her life.

While the last few years have been filled with bumps and hurdles, Julia feels like she is really thriving now. “I've never felt more inspired to go back to school in this phase of my life. It feels incredibly empowering. It's something I wanted to pursue for a long time, and I'm doing it purely for me.”

“And yes, I'm showing up every day to class in person. When I walk into the classroom, I'm not a Housewife. I'm not a mom. I'm simply Julia, the student. I also want to set an example for my boys to show them that learning never stops.”

Julia's relationship with Martina seems to have endured her admissions of infidelity as well. On Oct. 17, 2025, she posted a photo of the twosome on Instagram, with the caption, “When it's real, you don't need to prove it!”

She told PEOPLE in a new interview that the infidelity and its fallout brought repairing her marriage to the forefront of her life. 

“It made us more committed to repairing what was slightly fractured, and definitely communicate better — because that's where, maybe, the fracture started. And today, we're in a really great place. Our focus is on each other and on our family. My marriage to Martina is the most sacred part of my life. I hurt her, and I take full responsibility for that. But I've asked her for forgiveness and she's forgiven me.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Ben Napier Reveals How His Parents ‘Lost Everything' — Twice","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/ben-napier-parents-lost-everything-hardship/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 01:46:38 GMT","

Ben Napier appreciates all that he has because he intimately knows how it feels to lose it all. During an episode of Sadie Robertson Huff's “WHOA That's Good” podcast on October 15, 2025, the HGTV star and expert woodworker opened up about the hardship his family faced while he was young. 

“Growing up in my house, when I was a little kid, my parents lost everything financially,” he shared, adding that it actually happened twice and revealing how those experiences shaped his outlook on life. 

Sitting next to his wife and “Home Town” co-star Erin Napier, Ben shared on the podcast what he remembers about the first time his parents, Wayne and Bennie Napier, had to start all over when he was young.

He said, “They literally had this old Datsun car because the bank said, ‘That car has no value,' so they let my dad keep it. … One of my earliest memories was riding down the road in this car and the hood flew up and busted the windshield. And my dad's solution was he jerked the hood off the car and threw it in the ditch and kept going. So this is the kind of car we're talking about.”

“Until that point, up until them losing everything, like, my dad was a big farmer,” Ben continued. “It was this weird bank loan situation that is actually an illegal loan. They can't do them anymore and, anyway, he lost everything and he rebuilt it all and then he lost it all again.” 

A post shared by Ben Napier | Scotsman Co. (@scotsman.co)

In June, Ben shared a similar story with Country Living and explained, “The second time he lost everything was when he became a preacher. Or rather, he gave everything up. He was a truck driver and was very successful in a time when you could make a lot of money as a truck driver. He owned an 18-wheeler, a semi. It was probably the only time since being a father that he was financially stable. But he felt this higher calling on his life and gave it all up and sold everything.”

Ben added, “It was impactful for me because, there he was, giving everything up. We sold our farm. We had a house and 10 acres and a barn. Sold his truck, sold his trailers, went back to school and got a degree and then got his master's from Duke University.” 

In 2021, Ben shared on the “Biscuits & Jam” podcast that their family's life changed drastically at that point, explaining, “Growing up, we didn't have a house that we grew up in. My parents are both United Methodist preachers, and anybody who knows anything about the United Methodist Church is the preachers move, and so we lived in several little small towns and big houses, small houses, you know, really dumpy houses and some really great houses.”

On the “WHOA That's Good” podcast, Ben said watching his parents sacrifice for their family and appreciate whatever they had, taught him to appreciate the present and not worry about the future, because sometimes things turn out even better than expected. 

“My perspective on heartache and loss was from watching my parents lose and rebuild and start over and then have a surprise baby late in life when, as far as the world was concerned, they did not need that child. And he was, you know, a miracle situation.” 

In an essay Ben previously wrote for Guideposts, he shared that he was 10 when his mom informed him and his two brothers that a new sibling was on the way. He wrote, “I heard her tell friends that this baby was a surprise. I wondered how that could be if we knew it was coming. Well, our baby brother arrived just as the holidays were beginning, and he was the most awesome gift.”

Ben's ability to stay in the present moment isn't nearly as easy for Erin, who has talked openly about her anxiety. She listened intently during the October 15 podcast as he reasoned, “At the end of the day, everything's going to be okay. Yeah, it's hard. It will be very hard. You will have very hard days.” 

“And for Erin, that is probably her greatest fear is not being prepared and not, like, planning,” he said, to which Erin replied, “Yeah, not seeing it coming — whatever it is.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hallmark Hunk Dishes on ‘Pretty Awkward' Kissing Scenes With Co-Star (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/benjamin-ayres-angel-kissing-scenes-meghan-ory/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:35:56 GMT","

When longtime Hallmark stars Meghan Ory and Benjamin Ayres showed up on the set of their new movie, “A Christmas Angel Match,” they were tasked with portraying angels Monica and Michael, whose mission is to help soulmates on Earth meet and establish a meaningful connection during the holidays.

(Spoiler Alert: If you don't want to know what happens in “A Christmas Angel Match,” please stop reading here.)

In the movie, which premiered on October 19, 2025, there's a plot twist as Monica and Michael are working to get soulmates Daisy and Patrick to connect; the two angels start having unexpected feelings for each other. Given the angels' innocence and sole/soul focus on helping “tenderhearts” — their word for humans — Ory and Ayres decided it would only make sense to act like kids experiencing their first crush. And a first kiss between angels, they realized, had the potential to be “pretty awkward,” Ayres told EntertainmentNow ahead of the movie's premiere.

“Chesapeake Shores” alum Ory and her creative partner, director Christie Will Wolf, co-wrote the script for “A Christmas Angel Match.” Still, Ory and Ayres realized as they arrived on set in Vancouver that they needed to get on the same page about how their angelic characters might behave, especially as they experienced romantic feelings for the first time. 

Ayres told EntertainmentNow, “I was like, ‘Wait, have they ever kissed? We were literally, on our first day of filming, talking through this. I was like, ‘So, these two have never felt love before in this condition, in this way, and they have never kissed!” 

“So that meant we get to have these childlike discoveries,” Ayres continued. “These angels are old and wise, but also childlike. So we were going back to what it felt like to be kids having a crush or their first kiss, trying these different ways of making that believable.” 

In one scene, the two angels get caught under the mistletoe, but are so adorably nervous about potentially kissing that they both pucker up without ever coming close to touching. By the time Monica and Michael feel ready to try again, Ayres said he and Ory felt the scene still needed to be “really innocent” and “magical.”

“We were kind of choreographing how to have it be awkward and sweet, but with feeling,” Ayres said. “We're like, ‘How about this? How about that? Ok, wait, let's try it again.' I think it worked in the end. I hope people love it.”

A post shared by Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel)

Fans had strong feelings about “A Christmas Angel Match” right out of the gate, taking to social media with their reviews, including one who commented on Hallmark's Facebook post about the movie, “Omgoodness Im watching its at the end and Meghan Ory you wrote a great movie. LOVE THIS AND and you did great. Love seeing my Chesapeake Shores People.”

Someone else commented, “I love whimsical Christmas movies like this one. I enjoyed this one a LOT!”

Another fan sweetly shared, “I liked that they addressed the issue of screen time replacing human interaction. The comment that hit me the most was that there is still life or love even in the 70s, as I will hit the big 70 in a few months. I realize I haven't been very forward-thinking.”

One viewer complained that the time Monica and Michael had been angels created too much of an age gap — “Too big of an age difference to match. Come on a 586 year old and a 97 year old?” — but Hallmark Channel's social team adorably replied, “It's only about a 5 year difference in angel years. 😉”

Other viewers were surprised by how different the movie felt from a typical Hallmark romance, even branding it “too silly.” But different was exactly what Ayres told EntertainmentNow they were going for — leaning into the comedy with tongue-in-cheek scenes, amusing puns, whimsical sets and props, and “exploring different ways” to experience and cultivate love.

“A Christmas Angel Match” is available to stream on Hallmark+ and will re-air on Hallmark Channel several times, including on October 21 and October 25 at 10 a.m. Eastern time on both days.

Very cute movie.  Wish you would not have brought the gays in on the picture.  You always seem to work them in some way, somehow???

I do agree.  Hallmark seems to try to hard and to much to incorporate that.  Sad they feel the need in almost every movie.😫

There has to be some kind of happy medium between the JJ Abrams “mystery box” school of publicity and campaigns that overshare every little bit long before a film or series is released. For a moment there, it seemed as if “Wicked: For Good” might have found it, at least in regards to some exciting new casting.

In a recent interview with Deadline, director Jon M. Chu teased the voice casting of the iconic Cowardly Lion. While he didn't tell the trade who would be stepping into the fluffy mane, he hinted it was someone big, explaining that he sent the unnamed star a direct message on Instagram in an attempt to snag them for the part. “I was like, ‘It's not a ton of lines, but maybe you have a little time. I know you're busy. I'll come to you.' He was like, ‘Why the fuck not, let's go!' And then we went ahead and recorded the lines.”

Chu then added: “Man, wait until the red carpet when the actor who gave us the Cowardly Lion's voice steps foot on it. It'll be wild.” Frankly, we would have loved that of reveal. A real surprise! Alas.

On Monday morning, an announcement was made on the “Wicked” Instagram account, with the brand-new “Wicked” star hiding behind a lion stuffed animal before revealing himself and saying: “See you in Oz!” OK, no complaints about the actual casting: it's Colman Domingo! (You can check out the, admittedly very cute, post below.)

The beloved two-time Oscar nominee is no stranger to voice acting: he's also voiced roles in “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Ruby Gilman, Teenage Kraken,” and “The Electric State.” As the iconic big scaredy cat, Domingo will be tasked on a well-loved role and making it his own. 

“Wicked: For Good” will also see the return of stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as Elphaba Throp and Glinda Upland, respectively, as well as Bailey as Prince Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, Marissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp, Ethan Slater as Boq Woodsman, Bowen Yang as Pfannee and Bronwyn James as ShenShen.

The much-anticipated sequel follows the events of the beloved musical's second act (with some necessary expansions), as Elphaba and Glinda's friendship is put to the test as they embrace their new respective identities as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North. 

Universal will release the film in theaters on Friday, November 21.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Task,” especially Season 1, Episodes 6 and 7.]

The crime drama of “Task” all led up to a devastating penultimate episode that included the manhunt for missing 6-year-old Sam (Ben Doherty) coming to an end, a chaotic gun fight in the woods, and the death of Robbie (Tom Pelphrey). While on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, creator Brad Ingelsby admitted he was nervous about how audience's would react to last night's far less action-pack finale.

 










“There's a negative in some way to having such a big explosion [in Episode 6] — that's the high point of action in the show, you're never going be able to replicate that or do anything close to that, and it's still one episode left,” said Ingelsby. “So it did worry me that at the end of that sequence: What are the mysteries? What are the things that people are still trying to solve?”

Ingelsby was conscious that, in his previous HBO series, “Mare of Easttown,” the crime investigation wasn't resolved until the dramatic last 10 minutes of the finale. But the “Task” creator was quick to point out “Mare” was a whodunnit being led by a cop (Kate Winslett) avoiding facing her son's suicide. 

 










“Task,” in addition to being more “Heat” than mystery, was led by an investigator Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo), who comes out of the near-death experience of the investigation ready to confront the family tragedy he had been avoiding. It's an arc thats emotional resolution required the time and space of last night's tear-jerking finale.

“I'm sure there's going to be people who watch the show and go, ‘Man, Episode 6, that was it for me,'” said Ingelsby. “But I hope they do stick around, because the emotional payoffs are quite high.”

When Ingelsby started to develop “Task,” he didn't have even the basic plot points of the cat-and-mouse criminal investigation, what he did know was the beginning and end of Tom's emotional arc, which pivoted on the story of man who lost his faith.

“It's always between A and B, and because if it's a guy who's lost his faith and then has to let his son come home, I know that the story has to take place within those two edges,” Ingelsby said describing how his writing process was shaped by knowing Tom's arc centering on his loss of faith. “If I know where it ends, I know I can't go too far this way or too far this way.”

That's right, Ingelsby went into writing “Task” not knowing the FBI would clash with the Dark Hearts biker gang in Episode 6, but he did know Tom would end up giving that courtroom speech in Episode 7. Ingelsby explained that he wrote Episode 1 very early in the process, establishing how Tom had completely lost his way in the year following the death of wife Susan (Mireille Enos) at the hands of their adopted son Ethan (Andrew Russel). 

 










He then went into writing Episodes 2 through 7, knowing he needed to create an emotional journey in which Tom believably goes from burying his anger in alcohol, to a climatic courtroom scene in which he finally looks Ethan in the eye.

While on the podcast, Ingelsby talked about how Tom was inspired by one of his many Delaware County relatives.

“Some of Ruffalo's character is inspired by my uncle, who was an Augustinian priest for years and years, and he left the priesthood and married a woman. He's not an FBI agent, but my uncle would give last rites in the hospital,” said Ingelsby.

The “Task” creator liked the idea of how being a former priest better equips Tom to receive Robbie at a moment of crisis (the car ride in Episode 5), and comfort him at his moment of death (the car ride in Episode 6) based on having given last rites and his experience dealing people's fear of death at the end. Tom being a former priest also gave his loss of faith, and the subsequent leap of faith he takes in Episode 7, that much more dramatic impact.

Ingelsby is well-aware that audiences are not going to like Tom's decision to allow Sam to be adopted by another family at the end of the series. But that emotional dissonance is part of the point.

 










“I know audiences might struggle with [not keeping Sam], but that was really important to me because when I was writing the story, it's not about keeping Sam, it's about embracing his son and getting the house ready for his son to come home. If Sam's there, it muddies it,” said Ingelsby. “He's really cute and he's a charming kid and he's a great actor, but that's not what the arc is about.”

Ingelsby went on to explain why giving up Sam was key to Tom's arc. “What I liked about that was it was an act of faith, ‘I love this kid. I love being with him. I have to give him up and I have to believe that the family that takes him is going to take care of him,'” said Ingelsby. “Here's a guy that doesn't have any faith in the beginning of the show, and giving up the kid is an act of faith. It's not going to the altar and kneeling, sitting in the pew or going back to the church, it's not that, but it's an act of faith that the kid's going to be okay.”

As discussed above, one of the few things Ingelsby did know about the finale going into writing “Task” was the broad strokes of the Tom's courtroom speech. That said, the scene terrified Ingelsby. “There is a danger that it can be very hokey,” said Ingelsby of the courtoom speech. “I think that I went into it quite nervous, it's a lot of pressure on that speech.”

 










So, what was the key to it not being hokey? Not surprisingly, Ingelsby, a research junkie, found the answer working with “Task” mental health consultant Ariel Stern and reading testimonials of parents and care-givers about the difficulty of caring for a child, like Ethan, with severe mental issues.

“One of the things that stood out to me when I was talking to Ariel, or reading an article, was ‘Weekends were the worst for me as a parent,'” said Ingelsby, quoting a line from Ruffalo's courtroom speech, which came directly from reseach.

For Ingelsby who, like most parents, looks forward to the weekends as the time he gets to enjoy his kids, that line hit hard.

“It just broke my heart hearing that, because  you go through life, you pick up your kid at school, you pass these parents, you have no idea what they're going through and how hard it is. And I wanted Tom to not run from that. I wanted him to acknowledge that it was hard,” said Ingelsby. “I think once we got to acknowledging the hardness of that, then it felt we'd earned the right to [have] some [dialogue], that on its own could be hokey, like, ‘He called me Dad.'”

There is a confessional aspect to Tom's courtroom statement — the theme of confession running throughout the series paying off in this moment. Ingelsby pointed to Tom admitting he didn't wear a name tag to Parents Night, not wanting people to know he was Ethan's father.

 










“He's so honest at the front about saying these things that he did, and the shame he feels, it makes his confession of the joy that much more true, because he's allowed the audience to get close to him,” said Ingelsby. “He showed how vulnerable he is, and then when he says, ‘There was so much joy,' you go, ‘Oh my God, this is his truth.' It allowed you to hold onto that moment. And Mark, he's just so good in that scene.”

The decision for Tom to read from prepared remarks — rather off-the-cuff and from the heart as we've come to expect in these type of scenes — was important for two reasons. One is dramatically obvious: It sets up the powerful moment, where Tom puts down his typed statement to finally make eye contact with Ethan (“Ethan, look at me, son”). But for Ingelsby, the carefully crafted written words also spoke to where Tom is at the final moments of “Task.”

“Like a priest at the podium giving a homily, it just felt like he had taken the time and care,” said Ingelsby. “I always feel like ‘Mare' was a show about a woman who avoided having to face the death of her son. Tom's avoiding having to face what his son has done and his anger is preventing him. And so [it meant something] for him at the end to have been through the craziness of this case, to sit down and take the time to write his thoughts that he's been avoiding, and also to take the burden off of [his daughter] Emily (Silvia Dionicio). That was the act of grace, ‘Emily, I don't want this to be your choice.  I've put you in a tough spot, and I've been avoiding this for a long time now, let me. I now have the strength to shoulder the burden of this.'”

 










Ingelsby didn't want to show us Ethan's homecoming. The breakthrough moment in the courtroom of Tom welcoming him home was the emotional resolution. The idea of having cake and celebrating their reunification months later would be a false note.

Ingelsby did believe the audience needed a moment with Tom just prior to Ethan walking back through the door for the first time since he killed Susan. He liked the simplicity of Tom getting Ethan's room ready and having a quiet moment looking out the window.

“What it meant for me was Tom cleaned, he got his son's room ready, he's readying for his son to return,” said Ingelsby of the last scene. “And he looks out the window and he hears the birds. And it's not that he knows he's going to be OK, it's that he knows it's going to be hard, and it's going to be challenging, but there is a spirit in him that is ready to face what's coming in a way that he was not ready at the beginning of the show.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Rolling Stone Merges With Vibe","https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-merges-with-vibe/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 14:52:37 GMT","

Vibe, the long-running music magazine centring on rap and R&B coverage, will merge with Rolling Stone in a deal announced last week. Vibe staffers Mya Abraham and DeMicia Inman announced as the news broke that their positions had been eliminated. Rolling Stone CEO Julian Holguin said that, as part of the move, Rolling Stone would “level up [its] hip-hop and R&B coverage,” as well as investing in Vibe “across video, podcasts, long-form journalism, social media, and experiential opportunities.”

Datwon Thomas, a longtime Vibe editor-in-chief, has been appointed as a strategic adviser to guide the transition. In a statement to Billboard, he said, “Coming back to Vibe in this role is deeply meaningful to me and I am proud to remain connected to such an iconic brand that has been such a big part of my life. The opportunity to help guide Vibe into the next phase of its growth and continued legacy is an honor.”

Vibe was launched by Quincy Jones and Time Warner in 1993, but has changed hands several times. In 2020, the magazine came under the ownership of Rolling Stone publisher Penske Media Group.

Laid-off staffer Mya Abraham has since announced an R&B-focused podcast and Substack, Play the B Sides. Vibe and Rolling Stone announced that they were hiring a new head of the Vibe brand, a video and podcast host, and an events producer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Jeremy Allen White Covers Bruce Springsteen Classics for New Soundtrack Album","https://pitchfork.com/news/jeremy-allen-white-covers-bruce-springsteen-classics-for-new-soundtrack-album/","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:03:11 GMT","

Columbia Records and 20th Century Studios have announced the soundtrack album for Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere. The soundtrack is out December 5, and it finds the film's star, Jeremy Allen White, covering classic songs by Bruce Springsteen. See the tracklist below.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere centers on the making of Springsteen's Nebraska, so the soundtrack finds White playing tracks from the iconic 1982 album. He does not, however, cover the full album, missing out on “Johnny 99,” “Used Cars,” and “Open All Night.” Instead, the soundtrack album includes two hits from Springsteen's Nebraska successor, Born in the U.S.A.: the title song and and “I'm on Fire.” It also closes with covers of two songs that Springsteen and the E Street Band are known to favor—Little Richard's “Lucille” and John Lee Hooker's “Boom Boom”—and one that the Boss has never performed publicly, Screamin' Jay Hawkins' “I Put a Spell on You.”

Dave Cobb produced Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack). The album includes additional contributions from Jay Buchanan, Aksel Coe, Bobby Emmett, and Greta Van Fleet's Jake and Sam F. Kiszka.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is out widely in U.S. theaters this Friday, October 24. It stars Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen and Jeremy Strong as the musician's manager, Jon Landau.

It's now two straight years that Columbia Records has released a soundtrack album that finds a movie star covering the music of a classic American artist. To go with the Bob Dylan film A Complete Unknown, the label shared a soundtrack featuring Timothée Chalamet's versions of “Mr. Tambourine Man,” “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” “Like a Rolling Stone,” and more.

Two years ago, when Bar Italia began to chafe against their mysterious reputation, they used a courtroom sketch for the cover of “Jelsy,” one of their strongest singles to date.​ Every time I re-listen to The Twits, their sophomore album, this is precisely where I imagine them: stone-faced on a witness stand, saying, Yes, Your Honor, we are normal people. For a while, their slackish alt-rock was buoyed by its icy mystique, a residual coolness from World Music—Dean Blunt's label, which they ditched for Matador in 2023—that clung to them like frost on a leather jacket. Before long, the fog proved suffocating. “I'd rather be known as boring than mysterious right now,” singer-guitarist Jezmi Fehmi told one interviewer. “It was fine for a while but it's got to the point where everything that's written about us is caveated with the word ‘mysterious'.”

Considering their past, this was a daring wager. When Bar Italia first came out, spectrality centered not only their vibe, but their sound: ragtag, bedroomy, and brooding, like recovered files from an excavated iPod. There was perverse pleasure in following this scruffy, semi-anonymous band, whose music was intrinsically about distance—sounding far away, and feeling far away, too. In 2023, a fresh record deal yielded Tracey Denim and The Twits, two albums trapped between bedroom-pop origins and alt-rock aspirations. Two years later, Some Like It Hot stakes a bolder claim than both: clean-cut, well-mixed power-chord music. The problem, and what makes this evolution so underwhelming, is that this new sound is the absolute middle ground of rock in 2025. Fehmi has gotten his wish: No longer are Bar Italia mysterious, but something much worse—monotonous.

Conflictingly, this new album does angle toward an evolution, even if the one it achieves is sterile. Some Like It Hot is named for the classic 1950s love-triangle film, in which two ex-gangsters compete for the affection of a beautiful chanteuse. At their scraggliest, Bar Italia are somewhat similar: two whiny male vocalists and a dainty female lead, playing off one another like vaudeville caricatures. Is this necessarily a defect? To their credit, I recognize Hot as an attempt to smooth things over, including this oddball showmanship—tone down the hysterics, sharpen the production, exchange my-turn-your-turn vocals for harmonies. But I miss the erratic contours of their former sound, which didn't always work, but felt wonderfully unnerving, and a teeny bit haunted, when it did. Granted, “haunted” and “unnerving” sound a lot like other terms they now disavow: “enigmatic,” “mysterious,” “shadowy,” et cetera. Conceptually, their resistance to mystique is commendable. Musically, it just means that instead of spellbinding whirls like “bibs,” we get arena-aspirant squalls like “Fundraiser,” which sounds like you trained an LLM on Oasis and asked it to generate a Bar Italia song.

Ironically, in its militaristic pursuit of fun, Some Like It Hot often winds up feeling deeply rigid—stripped of the spunk and nuance that once made Bar Italia so enchanting. Never have they abused loud-quiet-loud songcraft so excessively, and never has their best writing landed so flatly because of it. The compelling chord structure of “Rooster” is squashed by its predictable singalong chorus; the sly seduction of “Lioness” is undercut the second the fuzzboxes click on. Fehmi and Sam Fenton are immensely talented guitarists—just listen to their other band. Where did the interplay go? The interlocking lead-rhythm lines? In fits and starts, you can tell that this band does, in fact, have two guitarists who play off each other beautifully: Take the chorus of “Eyepatch,” whose jangly charm is vintage Warehouse, or the angsty “I Like My Own Dust,” whose chord-arpeggio tension is borderline asphyxiating. The cool thing about Bar Italia, in times past, was precisely this—tension that didn't always lead to release. Conversely, Some Like It Hot is practically all release, which is unearned, because the necessary tension is often undercooked. Midway through “Omni Shambles,” when frontwoman Nina Cristante lets out a jarring shriek, I really wish I believed her.

Lately, the depressive linchpins of many a “World Music playlist (dragon emoji)” have been in better spirits: Ask Mark William Lewis, or Elias Rønnenfelt, or, hell, Fehmi or Fenton or Cristante themselves. This is not a bad thing, nor is it bad that Bar Italia, a band that once scored terminal bedrot, are trading their mini-amps for full stacks. The issue is that in abandoning their characteristic clutter for cruise-control precision, they've undermined their own years-long effort to seem more relatable and human. In one of the most memorable lines from The Twits, Cristante sings, as if to a jury: “You keep saying that I don't care/If only you could see me now/You would have no doubt.” Two years later? “It's not that I'm in despair,” Fehmi drawls on “I Like My Own Dust,” and it sounds like it. “It's just that I don't care,” he continues, and it sounds like it, too.

Chavela Vargas, the great Costa Rican-Mexican ranchera singer, once asked, “¿Cómo será de bella la muerte que nadie ha vuelto de allá?” (“How beautiful must death be that no one has returned from it?”) At a 2024 residency at the home of Vargas, one of the greatest musicians ever to speak on the subject, Silvana Estrada watched interviews with the late singer and wrote to understand her own grief.

For a musician so thoughtful about her words—and Estrada's signature songwriting is, as ever, full of thoughtful words—the Mexican singer-songwriter's latest album, Vendrán Suaves Lluvias, is often searching for them, doubling back, or abandoning them altogether. On 2022's Marchita, Estrada introduced herself—the daughter of luthiers from the mountains of Veracruz—and her cuatro venezolano with a considered quiet that, in her nimble voice that balances power and softness, has allowed her poetry to speak loudest.

Vendrán Suaves Lluvias is the product of several years Estrada spent navigating multiple griefs: the tedious chaos of romantic heartbreak and the senselessness of violence after her close friends were killed in 2022. There are plenty of quiet moments, long nights of lighting velitas in prayer as life goes on outside, as she sings on “Como Un Pájaro”: “Se entrelazarán las piernas por cariño y por piedad” (“Legs will intertwine for love and pity”). The album finds its way through grief's paralysis with music that even at its stillest never stays still, moving and changing its mind, like people do.

To ground it lyrically, Estrada situates herself in the natural world, where those losses intertwine and live together with her signature gentle touch. “El viento arrastra sus nubes/Así arrastro yo mis penas” (“The wind drags its clouds/The way I drag my sorrows”), she sings on opener “Cada Día Te Extraño Menos,” a confessional about the way time causes the hurt to change, but not disappear. Such ceaseless forward motion, like the contradictions it brings, is written directly into the song: At the end of one chorus, where another verse should arrive, she instead punctuates the song with a laugh.

The wordless moments are often the ones that come closest to touching the sublime. (At album's end, language itself dissolves: In the final minute of the closing “El Alma Mía,” she abandons words in favor of a hummed melody.) Before the cuatro venezolano comes in, “Dime” begins with plaintive clarinets and horns, and then Estrada's own plea, begging certainty of a lover who might stay or go. A dynamic string arrangement from Owen Pallett expands the first riff into a backdrop against which words are only incidental. Motion is the only constant; within it, a new movement begins in the music, and Estrada finds action: “Por todas las flores que arrancaste/Y todos los versos por salvar/Déjame al menos alejarme/Que yo te quiero y te quiero olvidar” (“For all the flowers you uprooted/And all the verses yet to save/At least let me turn away/For I love you and would love to forget you”).

The sadness shifts into a slow-burning anger on “Good Luck, Good Night,” a simmering bolero that luxuriates in the cabaret drama of the moment you decide you also get to be mad. “Pensé que tu cantar/Era tormenta/Era flores/Era fiesta/Melodías de una orquesta…/Que hace llorar,” she sings of a fickle partner (“I thought your song/Was a storm/Was flowers/Was celebration/The melodies of an orchestra…/That draws tears”). Anger is a profound way to feel less alone, and Estrada's languorous “llorar” almost demands to be sung back by a roomful of accomplices—in the mode of the “lloraaar y llorar” that always echoes Vicente Fernández's “El Rey,” and of so many other rancheras and boleros that have drawn blood in crowded bars.

The grief often keeps the room empty. In “Un Rayo de Luz,” Estrada couples spare motifs like a Hopper painting—a ray of light entering an empty room, night falling, the sea wrapped in sighs—with the same conclusion: “Devuélvanme a mis amigos” (“Give me back my friends”). Vargas' words return in reminder: “¿Cómo será de hermosa la muerte que nadie ha vuelto de allá?” Estrada replies: “¿Cómo será de frágil la suerte que siempre elegimos amar?” (“How fragile must our luck be that we always choose to love?”)

Well, how? At a recent album listening event, Estrada explained her invocation of Sara Teasdale's poem “There Will Come Soft Rains” in the album title and in the record itself (and, in translation, with a surer, more solid verb). She describes it as “this realistic feeling of hope”—“a superreal promise” that “softness is going to come somehow.” It just does.

There is no shortage of writing about death or loss. Part of what makes people like Chavela Vargas canonized keepers of the subject in Latin America, songwriters that transcend time and space in cultural memory, isn't knowledge, but a powerful capacity to listen. We are not smarter, faster, or more eloquent than its silence.

And yet some words are still worth repeating. “No te vayas sin saber/Que yo te quiero y siempre te querré,” Estrada sings on the song of the same title (“Don't leave without knowing/That I love you and I always will”). It's an intuitive hope that in an unknowable universe, there are things we do know, and it is our mission to say them out loud.

Lorde and Charli XCX worked it out on the remix live last night, with a surprise performance of their collaborative version of Charli XCX's “Girl, So Confusing.”


	At Lorde's Ultrasound World Tour stop at Kia Forum in Los Angeles Saturday, the singer invited Charli XCX out during the encore. Lorde gave the audience a clue what was coming when she wrote the word “Girl” and underlined it on the palm of her hand, as fan footage shows.

A post shared by Brandon Lance Garnsey (BLG) (@brandonlancegarnsey)


	Appearing on a small platform in the middle of the audience, Lorde started singing the song as a video displayed on the main stage screen showed footage of Charli, who turned out to be on the Kia Forum's main floor. Charli then launched into her first verse. She walked through the audience and made her way to the platform, where the pair performed the Brat and It's Completely Different But Also Still Brat track together, delivering an energized, dance-fueled performance.


	The duo previously performed the remix together during Charli's co-headlining Sweat Tour with Troye Sivan in 2024, and earlier this year, they teamed up to perform it during Charli's appearance at Coachella in April.

	A year after the remix's release, and the song's complicated female friendship narrative, which they address in their confessional collaborative version, continues to resonate not only between the artists and their fans, but with other female artists, too. In September, Hinds, who has been covering the remix version on tour, released a video for their spin on the track.

	











Lorde's tour continues through the U.S. with three more stops — she plays Berkeley tonight before continuing on to Portland and Seattle. She then heads to the Europe and the U.K. She concludes the 2025 portion of the tour with a pair of shows in Brooklyn at Barclays Center on Dec. 16 and Dec. 17.

Robert De Niro, noted critic of Donald Trump, praised the “No Kings” protests over the weekend, saying it's important people “don't let up” because the president “does not want to leave the White House.”


	The actor appeared on MSNBC's The Weekend on Sunday and took the opportunity to speak out against Trump attempting to remain in office for a third term, as well as how Americans are standing up against him. 


	“The original No Kings protest was 250 years ago,” De Niro noted, referring to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. “Americans decided they didn't want to live under the rule of King George III. They declared their independence and fought a bloody war for democracy. We've had two and a half centuries of democracy since then. Often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential, and we fought in two World Wars to preserve it.”


	He added, “Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away? King Donald I. Fuck that. We are rising up again this time. Nonviolently raising our voices to declare ‘No Kings.'”

	De Niro said he was “very happy” to see an estimated seven million Americans turning out for the “No Kings” marches. “We need much more of it going forward, because that's the only thing that the politicians are going to recognize, either face the wrath of Trump or the wrath of the people,” the actor said. “And they have to be more afraid of the wrath of the people and realize this is not good. I better strap on my balls and do something about it.”

	He said of continuing the effort, “We can't let up. Cannot let up on him because he is not going to leave the White House. He does not want to leave the White House. He will not leave the White House. Anybody thinks he, oh, he'll do this, he'll do that. It's just deluding themselves. The Republicans, most of all, because they know, but they're going along with it. It's a classic bully situation. We see it, and there's no other way to face a bully; you have to face him and fight it out and back them off and back him down. That's the only way this is going to work.”


	Americans in all 50 states marches against Trump and his policies on Saturday. The day marked the second iteration of the “No Kings” protests, following a massive effort on June 14. Several celebrities voiced their support for the protests, including John Cusack, who marched in Chicago. “No, you can't put troops on our streets,” Cusack said to Trump, speaking on CNN. “You can't create enough chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act so you can stay in power. We all know what your plan is.” He added, “Go to hell!”

S
unlight is spilling through the wide windows at Wondaland West, Janelle Monáe's rustic creative campus tucked in the hills above Hollywood, when Lucy Dacus takes her place on set. The two artists — in matching navy Thom Browne blazers — are sitting across from each other in worn leather armchairs, poring over the notes they've written down for today's conversation. They are so focused that neither one has noticed the room has fallen silent, until the gentle hum of Dacus' song “Ankles,” from her 2025 album, Forever Is a Feeling (recently re-released in expanded form), flutters through the air.


	Dacus turns pink as she hears her own music and decides to break the silence. She leans forward, eyes lit with curiosity. “Who's on your phone screen?” Dacus asks. Monáe lifts her phone slowly, almost ­reverently. The lock screen glows with a black-and-white portrait of a smoky-eyed Prince. “It's been this for six or seven years now. I don't know if I can ever change it,” Monáe says, bringing the phone closer to their heart.

	











	It's a quiet moment, but a revealing one. Both artists know what it means to hold on to something beloved: an influence, a feeling, a world of their own making. Monáe, with shimmering, sci-fi song cycles and Afrofuturist alter egos, has long built expansive universes in which queer Black liberation isn't a fantasy — it's the foundation. (As just one example, she recently revealed the full lineup for her eeriest Wondaween festival yet.) And Dacus, with slow-burning lyricism and diary-fragment songwriting, constructs entire emotional geographies connected by faith, heartbreak, memory, and grief. For more than an hour, they discuss fear, invention, and the pleasure of letting go in an intimate conversation that is braided with reverence and resonance. They talk as if they've met before — maybe not in this life, but in some shared frequency. But first, Monáe wants to know more about the opening line from Dacus' breakthrough song, “Night Shift,” from her 2018 LP, Historian.

Monáe: “The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit.” What did you mean by that? 


Dacus: You're hoping that something is going to be amazing, and then you get into it and you're like … “This sucks.” There's no chemistry. There's no magic. Disappointing.


Monáe: It is one of the best openings of any song that I can think of right now. 


Dacus: A lot of the times when I'm writing, it's just what happened. Life is poetic. It's just the noticing part. I feel like that must be true for you too. Do you feel like you romanticize or poeticize things? How often are you taking from your life to a song?


Monáe: I do what is best for the protagonist of the album. I see the movie; I see the scene; I see the world. I see what they're wearing. I know what kind of jam they like on their toast. I'm creating this movie in my head, or this scene that I'm dropping into song, and I write a mix of my real experiences with this future version of myself — or this version of a friend or a lover or a family member that I'm creating. I look at lyrics as downloads. Sometimes I don't know what things truly mean — the significance of them, after it's out into the world.


Dacus: Do you ever feel like your own listener? You hear it later and you relate to it how anyone else would?


Monáe: Yes. That's why I loved Historian. I love what you had to say about you being a historian of all the moments: If you don't write it down or take documentation of it, people won't know. I think very similarly, where I can become a patron of my own film. I'm going to go watch the movie just like you guys are, and we're discovering the same things together.

Dacus: I saw your vinyl collection. There's so much classical music. As a kid, I always thought classical music was lame. Like, that's old. But then growing up and [realizing] this is still some of the most inventive, robust music in the world. There's worlds built in classical music without anything other than sound. I hear it in your music so much. 


Monáe: I actually did not listen to a lot of classical music growing up. I didn't start to discover Rachmaninoff and Bach … I got into more scoring and orchestration because of my love of film. When I was deciding what kind of artist I wanted to be, I would listen to a lot of instrumentals. I would listen to the instrumentation of Blade Runner. 


Dacus: Do you do research a lot when you're making music, or do you just go in?


Monáe: So The Age of Pleasure, for instance, my last album, I really studied my community and my tribe, my fam. When we would go out and party, I was like, “What are we listening to? What are we all unanimously on? What vibe, what frequency are we on?” And I wanted to make an album just for us. What does it feel like when Janelle Monáe feels safe? What does it feel like when the people around her feel safe? Black and brown folks, queer folks, when we're not centering chaos, when we're not centering those who don't want to see us smiling and having a good time, what does that look like? What does that sound like?

	











Dacus: You talk about your sexuality and your gender — it just seems to expand over time. You're now expanded to the point of being everything.


Monáe: I see the same thing with you, especially with this latest project, which I love. I loved the video for “Ankles.”


Dacus: Aw, that was so much fun.


Monáe: You in the dress. First of all, you looked so beautiful. But I love this character. I feel like I want to see this character come out in some long-form way.


Dacus: So, you own these parts of yourself, whereas I don't know if I have them. I have to do them to see — acting, or other types of writing.


Monáe: But wait, you studied film?


Dacus: Yeah, I do feel like that is who I am and music is this weird side road that happened.


Monáe: That is so weird. Are we the same?


Dacus: Well, you're a director. You're, like, an auteur.


Monáe: I have not finished writing my thing. I'm in the middle of writing it right now.


Dacus: A screenplay? You don't need to talk about it. But I want to know.


Monáe: Well, yeah. I am writing a screenplay right now.


Dacus: That's so sick.


Monáe: The goal has always been to write, star in, do the soundtrack, produce. A lot of things, I know, but I have to fully realize an idea, and I know that I will not stop until I get this. I wish I had some sort of pipe that I can push in my brain. Because the time that it takes … You have the idea, and to realize it, you gotta talk to all these people. I'm just like, “I see it!”


Dacus: With film, there's so many other people.


Monáe: So many filters. Yeah.


Dacus: That's the thing. I was like, “Man, if I keep doing film, I'm going to have to talk to rich people so much. I'm going to have to convince them they're going to make money on me.” I felt so demoralized. I'm going to hate myself if I contribute to work that I think  is bad for the world. 

“Do not ask me to choke my freedom to make you comfortable. I spent a lot of time unlearning that”


Monáe: Yeah. But I see it in your music videos. I see the tiny nuances. I follow the character. I'm in the world that you built. Even in “Ankles,” I was like, “This makes so much sense.” And even [how] you use words, it's cinematic. And that's a filmmaker.


Dacus: Thanks. An album to me, what makes you not turn it off is thinking about it as a progression through scenes. You have to earn the end of the record. So often, my favorite songs are toward the end of the record because it's like you set up the question and go on the quest and then you arrive at something. Do you ever think about that? Because you have such scenes, actual vibrant settings that you move through. How do you track stuff?


Monáe: I don't lock in to making an album unless I know how I want to start it, the acts within it, and how it's going to end. I need to know the hero's journey.


Dacus: Uh-huh.


Monáe: I need to know the turning point, the call to action, all the things. And I need to get out the messiness of who this person is so you can feel the transformation of them. And once I lock into that, all the songs just flow.… Now, sometimes things are not resolved, and it's a “To be continued.”

	











Dacus: Such is life.


Monáe: Yeah, that's life. Everything does not always pan out. I need to know that, though, before I start mapping.


Dacus: My first girlfriend in college was like, “We're sitting down, and you're watching these music videos.” I remember watching [your] music video for “Q.U.E.E.N.,” with Erykah Badu. It's the best music video to me. I show it to all of my friends. I just love that you're your own guest rapper. The reveal, you're set up for a feature and then you feature yourself. It's amazing.


Monáe: Wow. I'm blushing.… I was reading Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near before we wrote any music for my first album [2010's The ArchAndroid]. That was talking about the Turing test and how when AI can trick you into believing that you're talking to your mother and you're not, that is when the singularity is going to happen. And where we are right now today, the fact that we can talk to [a chatbot] …  You cannot distinguish what is a human voice from AI. It's just mind-blowing how technology moves at this exponential rate.


Dacus: I wanted to ask you about that, because 15 years ago, you have this android life that you're bringing so much heart to. And now, it feels closer than ever that androids are actually going to enter our sphere.


Monáe: Yeah. They're here.


Dacus: I don't know. At least for me, I'm very freaked out. I'm not for it. AI seems like an easy way for people to get out of the dirt and grime of having to coexist.… When actually, it's through the hardness of being with each other that we find the peace and the comfortableness. Part of being comfortable is maybe testing that it's not just happiness all the time. It's getting through disagreements and hardships …


Monáe: In real life.


Dacus: Yeah. It's like you're tearing the little muscles so they get stronger.


Monáe: That's a good song lyric. “You're tearing the little muscles to get stronger.”


Dacus: Take it.


Monáe: I love that. But I feel you. And I am scared too. I'm also hopeful that we will realize, as we have throughout history, that we need each other in real life as well.… Whatever we can do to get our feet in the sand and really connect, I think that will benefit us long term.

	











Dacus: Yeah.


Monáe: I think that our mental health will become much better,  because isolation, too much of it … I'm an introvert. How about you?


Dacus: I'm more of an introvert as time goes on. I've always been a host. Sounds like you throw parties.


Monáe: I do.


Dacus: I used to before I moved here. This is the most introverted I've ever been, living in L.A. I'm from Virginia, and I lived in Philly for a while. The houses I lived in were, like, show houses. I'd come home and someone would be having their birthday party who didn't even live there.


Monáe: For a long time … I grew up Baptist. What'd you grow up?


Dacus: Baptist also.

“It's very important every day to wake up and be like, ‘Is it boy day or girl day?'… I want it all. I don't think you need to choose.”


Monáe: I grew up in church. We could not show skin. There were a lot of women in our family who were violated, so they would say “cover up” as a way to protect yourself from men being attracted to you. And I had to unlearn that. My freedom is important. My bodily autonomy is important, and my freedom cannot be choked so that you cannot have urges to want to rape me or molest me or violate my body.


Dacus: It's not on you.


Monáe: That's not my problem. That's something you need to control.


Dacus: That's a sickness on the other side. 


Monáe: Do not ask me to choke my freedom to make you comfortable. I spent a lot of time unlearning that, and also pushing my boobies down, because it was something that I was made to feel more ashamed of, versus confident within and in celebratory of.


Dacus: Now you're tits-out on the album cover.


Monáe: I guess I'm making up for lost time. I don't know. But I'm also just honoring my body and saying, “I'm sorry.” I'm sorry that I didn't know that it wasn't my fault.


Dacus: That's so powerful.


Monáe: Talk me through some of the things you had to tell yourself, too. Because like me, we both can do tuxedos and suits, in our Thom Browne — be fully clothed and comfortable. I feel sexy in a suit. I feel sexy in a birthday suit. What was going through your mind when you were visually thinking of the iconography for your look? Were you scared? 


Dacus: For being more masc?


Monáe: For just going between — I say water and rock. Soft and hard. Being nonbinary, I think of it in energy.


Dacus: I feel this deeply. If I was told “You have to be one way forever,” I would be like, maybe life's not for me. It's very important every day to wake up and be like, “Is it boy day or girl day?” Or on tour, especially if we do two nights in the same city. I'll have boy night, girl night. In the “Ankles” video, I have this big gown, and that obviously feels like a costume because it is one, but whenever I'm doing a really feminine look, I feel like I'm putting on a costume, but for fun. And then I feel more myself in more traditionally masculine clothes. But I want both. I want it all.


Monáe: And you have it all.


Dacus: I don't think you need to choose. Even if the words don't follow. For some people it's really important to find the words, and for me, it's more important to find the inhabiting. That took a while. As you're saying, growing up Baptist, I didn't grow up with a ton of examples of people who I would describe as free. If I ever saw one out of the corner of my eye, they'd be vilified. Or not even just vilified, but made fun of. And you're like, “I don't want to be a pariah. I'll keep in my lane.”

	











Monáe: I was with a friend, and we played this game. There are four energies in the car. One is fear. One is ego. One is spirit. One is sexuality. Who's driving? Who's riding shotgun? And which two are in the back seat?


Dacus: Fear has got to get to the back seat, but it's so often driving. Or maybe passenger princess is fear. I think when you love your life, fear comes in. The more I love my life, the more I feel I have things to lose.… Forever Is a Feeling is a lot about falling in and out of love and having love just wreck your psyche. It changes your life whether you're ready for it or not. And it's just this preemptive feeling of loss. And I also did want to make some happy songs. I think they're important. I want to get old and hear that I felt this way.


	That's the other thing. I'm thinking about time constantly, and I'm weirdly always thinking about my deathbed and how I want for everything I've made to have made me proud. I just want a document, like Historian, of having felt this way, because I want to remember what it was like.


Monáe: I love that. One of my biggest fears is not really my transitioning out of here, but the people I love. 


Dacus: That's my biggest fear: people that I love leaving without peace.


Monáe: Yeah. It's something I don't think anybody ever gets used to.


Dacus: For lyric writing, I'll think out albums five, six, seven. Every year, I have a thing [on my phone] called “various bits”: 2023, '24, '25 — every lyric idea, I put in there.


Monáe: That's so smart. See, mine is song concepts.… This was so magical and wonderful and so peacefully inspiring and creatively fulfilling to be in your presence, and talking with you and being able to just tell you in person how much I love you.


Dacus: I can't believe you're saying this to me. That's what's crazy. I've been a fan for so long. Please keep making great music. You don't have to, but it seems like you have a lot of plans.


Monáe: I feel like we're supposed to make movies, too, and we will. I am speaking that into the future.


Dacus: It is supposed to happen.

	











Monáe: As a futurist.


Dacus: I'm really excited for you.


Monáe: I can't wait till you do your first movie. I see it. You can do it all, and you will.


Dacus: I really want to.

	As the holiday season approaches, Cardi B is leveling criticism against the Trump administration for making cuts to essential food assistance programs including SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that will be slashed by nearly $187 billion over the next 10 years. The rapper also expressed frustration towards those who criticized her appearance at a rally Kamala Harris hosted in Milwaukee ahead of the 2024 election, stating that the wrong parts of her speech went viral.


	“People are complaining that they have taken away food stamps. Mind you, Thanksgiving is next month. No turkey for some of y'all, very interesting,” Cardi said during a Spaces session on X. “And I find this so funny, because these are the type of things that I was trying to warn y'all that's gonna happen in the Trump administration, but y'all didn't care. All y'all cared about is that I called him Shrump.”


	She added: “Thank God I wrote my speech down in my fucking phone. But whatever the fuck I said, I meant that shit. Whatever the fuck I wrote down in my phone, I made my research on it so I could share it to the fucking world. Whether I have an accent or not, it went viral.”

	During her speech in Milwaukee, Cardi read from her phone after the teleprompter stopped working. Among her talking points were concerns that “the cost of food and the cost of living is too high,” but also hope that Harris recognized the urgency of our economic state. Under the Trump administration, she continued on X, conditions have only worsened. 

	











	“You all consider me rich, right? I'm a millionaire. The taxes of living has become high for every goddamn thing, everything has become high,” Cardi said. “Everything been rising up, from the prices of fucking Fashion Nova and Shein to Chanel and all of that shit, because the tariffs are so fucking expensive.” 


	At the rally, Cardi slammed Trump as being “a man who cares only about making himself rich and cutting taxes for his billionaire friends,” telling the crowd, “Today is your wallet, tomorrow he'll be conning you out of your healthcare rights.” She added that he was also “hustling” people by prompting them to buy his line of sneakers, including a pair printed with an image from the July 2024 assassination attempt. 


	When Cardi released her album Am I the Drama? in September, she apologized for “asking y'all to buy my album and this is how the economy is right now.” On a livestream, she shared additional concerns about housing costs, adding, “I don't know how people are surviving.”

	In June, celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Zayn Malik, and Sheryl Crow have signed an open letter from Feeding America urging Congress not to approve the massive cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP that are baked into Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Act.


	In their letter, Feeding America said that an estimated 15.5 million children and 7.2 million seniors rely on SNAP and Medicaid to “make ends meet.”

Sombr has responded to criticism he received from a concertgoer who apparently “hated” his show at Anthem in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, so much so that she recorded a nearly nine-minute TikTok video, which has since gone viral. 


	“I thought I was chronically online, but it's just come to my attention that there's a TikTok drama going around because a 25-year-old attended my concert and was basically complaining that there were too many tweens there, I was making too many brain-rot jokes, and she just thought it was a cringe concert,” Sombr began in his response.

rant


	Sombr's response came a few days after the fan posted her video, in which the 25-year-old began by cautioning anyone planning to attend an upcoming show of his to “not spend your money on a Sombr concert.” She went on to explain that while attending his Washington, D.C., show, she was shocked to find his fan base was primarily comprised of “tweens,” said she did not enjoy his jokes, and described a segment of the concert called the “Sombr Dating Show,” where he brought audience members onstage to call their exes. She also criticized him, claiming he said “super vulgar stuff about getting his dick sucked” while onstage, and asked his fans to “bark for me” — behavior she felt was inappropriate given his young audience.

	











	She added, “It just doesn't seem like he knows how to entertain. He's maybe too young. Maybe he has to grow into it. I don't know. Dancing was terrible, singing was terrible.”

idk what i expected but it was certainly not that 


	While she referred to the experience as “a nightmare,” she admitted that the other members of the audience appeared to love it, with one fan apparently saying, “This is my generation's David Bowie.” She then said, “I'm so sorry, slender man? We're picking him, we're picking the weird dancing dude?” whom she likened to Napoleon Dynamite and added that the show was “cringe.”

	In his response, Sombr accused her of “body shaming” him, saying that “it's kind of started a massive body-shaming hate train directed towards me on a lot of videos of me on the internet right now.”


	He went on to say, “I totally respect people having opinions, but I am a 20-year-old artist, freshly 20. And if you're 25 years old and you're going to come to my concert and not expect people younger than you to be there, when I, the artist, am five years younger than you, it's just a skill issue.”


	As far as his jokes, Sombr said that people who go to his concerts would be familiar with his online presence, adding, “I've never uttered a serious word in my life.” Plus, he said he spends “five minutes” making jokes at his shows, while the rest is music.

      BRITTANY CHAIN, US SENIOR REPORTER




A private firm contracted by the United States military has taken responsibility for the mysterious objects seen flying above New Jersey last November.

The sightings sparked mass hysteria and concerns over the existence of UFOs after footage went viral of unidentified objects lighting up the night sky.

But a private contractor revealed at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August that they had launched the objects to 'test out their capabilities,' according to NYPost.

'You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,' an employee of the unnamed contractor allegedly told a crowd at the event.

According to a source at the summit, the employee went on to claim there was no need to disclose their work to the public because they had a private government contract.

The company reportedly offered a live demonstration of their manned aerial craft, which had an unconventional appearance.

Sharing details of the demonstration, which went for about 30 minutes above Fort Rucker in the controlled airspace, the source said:  'When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it.

'Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.' 

In a short 13 second clip posted to social media in November 2024, a white light blinked in the sky before suddenly vanishing, leaving onlookers stunned. 

In the footage, which was shot close near Atlantic City, family members were heard discussing what they witnessed before the object suddenly disappears.

'It just vanished!' one said. 'I just watched it through the telescope.'

Some 964 sightings of flying objects were logged in the state between November 19 up until December 13, according to statistics collected by the state's Office of Emergency Management.

Former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman had warned that the drones lighting up multi-state skies may be a 'classified exercise.' 

She told Fox News Live that the drone sightings were 'extremely unsettling,' and shared her theory that they may be part of a technology 'test' orchestrated by the federal government. 

Ballman said: 'Now in terms of who is behind this, seeing the statements that have been made by John Kirby, who has said that these objects are not operating illegally.

'Coupled with the several op-eds that have been out there in the last 24 hours about the need to look at our detection systems, [it] makes me think perhaps this is actually a classified exercise to test either evasion technology or detection technology in urban areas.'

White House National Security spokesman John Kirby had confirmed the aircraft were not foreign.

'We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus,' Kirby said.

'The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they're working closely with the state and local law enforcement to provide resources using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin.'

He said the agencies used 'very sophisticated electronic detection technologies' but  'have not been able to corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.'

'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft being operated lawfully,' he said.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

A United Airlines pilot was left covered in blood and forced to make an emergency landing after a mystery object smashed into the plane's windscreen.

The captain was flying at 36,000ft as he transported passengers between Denver and Los Angeles on Thursday (16 October) when he was likely left with the shock of his life, as something hit the windscreen, sending glass flying and injuring those inside the cockpit.

Fortunately, despite his arms being left bloody, the pilot was still able to land the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane safely in Salt Lake City, not far from the neighbouring state where they originally took off from.

United Airlines said: “On Thursday, United flight 1093 landed safely in Salt Lake City to address damage to its multilayered windshield.

Advert

“We arranged for another aircraft to take customers to Los Angeles later that day and our maintenance team is working to return the aircraft to service.”

Graphic images have shown off the state of the pilot's arm and also the huge dent that was put in the windscreen, although it's not yet confirmed if they are connected to this particular incident.

It also remains unclear exactly what struck the plane but given the height they were travelling at, there is mounting suspicion that it could have been something from space.

This seems all the more likely given the US Secretary of State spoke honestly about the existence of unidentified flying objects recently, while shocking footage was also released to the public, showing a missile in the United States striking a suspected UFO.

In a trailer for the documentary The Age of Disclosure, Marco Rubio said: ""We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities - and it's not ours.""

Congressman André Carson added: ""These are otherworldly things that are performing manoeuvres that haven't been seen.""

However, given a missile didn't even seem to damage a UFO, the object that struck the plane is likely to have been something far smaller, such as some debris or even a minuscule meteor from space - as you would imagine an alien spaceship would have probably done far more damage.

But even then, more likely is still far from likely at all, as the Federal Aviation Administration has previously estimated the probability of space debris causing serious injury to a commercial airline passenger as less than one in a trillion.

Planes more often collide with birds or pieces of hail at lower altitudes but it is unlikely that these things would have hit the aircraft while it was cruising close to 40,000ft.

Passengers were able to reach their destination after a six-hour delay, with local media suggesting that the original plane remains grounded in Salt Lake City as engineers try and fix it up, while also trying to figure out exactly what caused this unfortunate damage.

United Airlines told LADbible: ""On Thursday, United flight 1093 landed safely in Salt Lake City to address damage to its multilayered windshield. We arranged for another aircraft to take customers to Los Angeles later that day and our maintenance team is working to return the aircraft to service.""","{'href': 'https://www.ladbible.com', 'title': 'LADbible'}","other"

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a message from President Donald Trump on the source of drone sightings reported over New Jersey.

A private aerial contractor has reportedly taken responsibility for the swarms of mystery drones that wreaked havoc over New Jersey's skies last year. 

Speaking at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker, Alabama, in August, the unnamed company allegedly revealed during a panel that their manned aerial craft was to blame for the scare across New Jersey's skies, an attendee told The New York Post. 

""You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,"" an employee of the unnamed contractor reportedly said, according to The Post.

The unnamed company reportedly told attendees at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit that their aircraft was behind the mystery drones in New Jersey last year, according to The New York Post.  (iStock)

The admission reportedly came as the company conducted a live demonstration of the 20-foot aerial craft's unique flight movements as it sped through the skies with its four wings. 

""I thought it was the military testing something out on the other side of the base,"" the individual said while detailing their first impressions of the aircraft, according to The Post. 

The company claimed their aircraft was performing exercises to ""test out their capabilities"" over New Jersey in November 2024, The Post reported. The operations were reportedly not required to be disclosed to the public due to the company's government contract.

""It feels like it's a UFO because it defies what you're expecting to see,"" the source said, adding that there was an ""uncanny valley feeling"" as the aircraft quietly soared through the sky for a demonstration. 

""When it turned, you almost completely [lost] sight of it,"" the individual told The Post. ""Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky, and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared."" 

All conference attendees and demonstrations were reportedly required to be approved by the administration at Fort Rucker, which strictly prohibited any use of aircraft containing Chinese-made parts, according to The Post.

""It would definitely have to be cleared,"" the unnamed attendee reportedly said. ""Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that."" 

The admission comes nearly one year after hundreds of drones flooded the Garden State's skies, sparking fear throughout the area as residents expressed concerns over the origins of the aircraft. The saga began on Nov. 13, 2024, after a swarm of drones was spotted over the Picatinny Arsenal Army base in Morris County, and lasted until mid-December.

A controversial new documentary has finally landed a distributor for wide release, and it's sure to cause a stir once it can be seen by a wider audience.

This careful choice of distribution will help the movie qualify for Oscar Season, though audiences in other cities will have to wait to experience the documentary when it drops on VOD and streaming at a later date.

Besides the small theatrical window, The Age of Disclosure will be exclusively streaming on Prime Video, and will be available for purchase starting on November 21. The film first premiered at the 2025 South by Southwest film festival in March, where it received a strong reaction from critics. On the review aggregate website     Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary only has six reviews posted, with five of them being ""rotten."" With the movie set to be released to a wider audience, it will be interesting to see what the overall critical reception will be for what has been described as speculative and heavy-handed.    

The latest trailer for the film (which can be viewed below) compiles interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. Government and Intelligence community who have knowledge of what the movie calls ""aerial phenomena."" Perhaps the biggest selling point of The Age of Disclosure is the film's theory that there has been a cover-up happening for the past 80 years about intelligent life that exists outside of Earth. Instead of divulging this information to the public, the documentary goes so far as to claim that there is a secret Cold War to reverse engineer UFO technology.

The Age of Disclosure comes at an interesting time, in no small part thanks to the recent Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP, formerly UFOs) that have primarily been about requesting more transparency for what the government knows anout any non-human life. Director Dan Farah would have this to say to The Hollywood Reporter about the film:

""My goal was to only interview people who had direct knowledge of the UAP topic as a result of their work for the U.S. government, and who would share what they can legally disclose … There are people who want the topic to continue to be kept from the public entirely. So I went to great lengths to make this documentary in secret over the last two-and-a-half years … there are these fundamental facts — like that we're not alone in the universe — that everyone feels like the public has the right to know, and it's also in our best interest to make known so that there's no longer this antiquated, unjust stigma that is making our country fall behind in how seriously this topic is taken.""

Come November 21, The Age of Disclosure's divisive content will make itself known to a much wider audience, and more than likely re-ignite the discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial beings.

RECOMMENDED

“Spiritualism,” the belief that one can communicate with the dead, gained prominence in North America in the mid-nineteenth century, spurred by interest in the Fox Sisters, three siblings who captivated the public with their ability to speak to the deceased through a code of inexplicable wrapping sounds. The scandal caused by the sisters' confession that the sounds were produced through trickery did not diminish this newfound interest in the observable occult. This fascination continues to this day, particularly in film, with “found footage” techniques in “The Blair Witch Project” (1999) and “Paranormal Activity” (2007) heightening the horror through a new sense of realism.

In time for Halloween, Chicago Shakespeare Theater makes horror more real still in “Paranormal Activity,” running through November 2, a stage adaptation of the hit film by Oren Peli. Directed by Felix Barrett, the play uses practical special effects, intense sound design and horror-trope-inspired lighting techniques to provide a sense of realism that is unmatchable in film. A new story by Levi Holloway, of a young couple who move to another country to escape the demons of their past, is a fresh take on the franchise, folding elements from the film into the story in ways that are surprising and unexpected.

On the heel of their one-year wedding anniversary, wife Lou (Cher Álvarez) and husband James (Patrick Heusinger) have recently moved from the United States to England for a fresh start. The couple's ostensible happiness is fake, and it is revealed that Lou suffers from depression because of terrifying phenomena that only she can perceive. But when James starts hearing invisible hands knocking at the door and seeing ghostly lights creeping around hallways, it becomes clear that it's not all in Lou's head.

The restrained pacing of the play is its hallmark feature. Like a typical horror narrative, the first act only alludes to the supernatural, and there's initially a sense that the ominous goings-on can be chalked up to coincidences. Near the end of the first act, forget it—the play throws a curveball that will catch you by surprise. From that point, anything can happen, and your eyes will greedily inspect every nook of the setting—a bifurcated, two-story, five-room house—for the twitch of a shadow or the reappearance of a dreadful ghoul.

Despite the hyperrealism of the effects, the story shies away from the “found footage” realism of the film and reincorporates classic horror tropes. Heusinger plays James as a masculine “bro,” whose bulging muscles are of no use against an ephemeral attacker. Álvarez dials the creep factor to eleven as she gradually morphs Lou from an anxious young woman into a demon-possessed succubus. Shannon Cochran, playing James' mother Carolanne, delivers some of the most delicious moments of terror, taking the trope of “monster-in-law” to a new level. Kate Fry, as spiritualist podcaster Etheline Cotgrave, illuminates the backstory of the poltergeist in a séance scene. In all, the play comes together as a satisfying blend of fantasy and reality.

Most striking was the reaction from the audience. People laughed during tense moments. Some mumbled “don't do it!” which made everyone laugh even more. Waves of excitement rushed through the crowd during centerpiece reveals. The experience was like watching a horror flick in one's living room with (hundreds) of friends. The not-so-obvious trickery of American spiritualism is revived with gusto in “Paranormal Activity,” a sensational start to the spooky season.

“Paranormal Activity” runs through November 2 at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, 800 East Grand. Tickets are available at chicagoshakes.com.

Aziz Ansari's debut feature, which he stars in and includes Keanu Reeves as an angel, is funny, sweet, and has a surprisingly anti-capitalist bent

Despite bearing the appearance of a children's fable, Aziz Ansari's supernatural comedy Good Fortune is surprisingly politically engaged. It's also incredibly funny, though it takes a beat (and then some) to settle into these rhythms. Its backdrop is an increasingly tech-drenched Los Angeles, whose social landscape has been ravaged by income inequality and racial wealth gaps. Former documentary editor Arj (Ansari) has taken to gigs and odd jobs to make ends meet, and ends up in the temporary employ of wealthy tech investor Jeff (Seth Rogen), in a bromance-across-class-lines that quickly goes awry. Arj ends up fired, but with the help of his budget guardian angel Gabriel (Keanu Reeves), swaps lives and identities with Jeff, in order to learn the lesson that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. The only problem? In a capitalist hellscape, money really does solve most of Arj's problems, and he refuses to switch back.

Good Fortune marks Ansari's feature debut, though because he directed several episodes of his Netflix sitcom Master of None—including the entirety of the third season—he's far from a novice. This is, perhaps, why the film seems like such an oddity at first, lacking any discernible style as it establishes its characters, and repeating jokes and observations for emphasis when the first time ought to suffice. There are only so many times you can chuckle at a shot pulling back to reveal a Wim Wenders-esque image of Reeves' winged Gabriel watching Arj's life fall apart from a distance, unable to intervene. However, when the two eventually meet, it's off to the races.

Gabriel, it turns out, is the angel of rescuing people from texting and driving, invisibly tapping them on their shoulders so they look up just in time to avoid collisions. His stature in the angelic hierarchy means his wings are much smaller than those of his counterparts, like his manager Martha (Sandra Oh), or the kindly Azrael (Stephen McKinley Henderson), who shepherds lost souls to self-actualization. He asks for more responsibility at their weekly rooftop meetings, but is never given the chance.

Upon observing Arj's daily routine, during which he's spread thin by the cruelty of the gig economy, Gabriel decides to take him on as a pet project. In the process, he ignores one of his other “clients”—the sweet, funny hardware store worker and union organizer Elena (Keke Palmer)—with whom Arj happens to be smitten. Long before the movie's magical switcheroo, in the vein of Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, the film establishes a surprisingly explicit political purview, with Arj refusing to join Elena's union efforts because he's too wrung out by the daily grind, and too selfish to look outside himself.

This subplot of solidarity is, however, something Gabriel can't even fathom or acknowledge as a path to fixing things, given his outmoded understanding of the world. The angels essentially function as the gods of The Good Place, i.e. stand-ins for vaguely progressive institutions like the Democratic Party, who are seldom willing to challenge the systems at fault. Gabriel is well-meaning, but lacks both the power and lived experience to make a meaningful impact. In his mind, having Arj temporarily swap places with his tech bro boss ought to be enough to give the failed filmmaker a new lease on life, but the world is more complicated than the moral binary Gabriel is shouldered to enforce.

Thanks to one of the many “task” apps Arj uses to find work, he ends up as Jeff's assistant for a week. The two hit it off incredibly well, and the movie begins to take more coherent shape, even though Gabriel's woes still feel like a separate story unfolding at a distance. However, the movie's disparate parts finally click into place when the two plots finally collide. Arj, in an effort to impress Elena, pays for their date with Jeff's company credit card, which leads to him being fired and sets off a more turbulent economic spiral. Seeing the floor fall out from under him, Gabriel decides to make himself known and seen to Arj, and tries to fill him with hope by showing him the life he's destined to live—an act that proves an utter and hilarious failure. Arj's position is so financially precarious that even these best case scenarios seem pitiful at best. So, with his other options exhausted, Gabriel opts for the nuclear option, leading to a Christmas Carol-like detour where the lesson doesn't actually stick.

Then again, why would it? Jeff is left to tough it out on the streets for once, while Arj suddenly has ridiculous riches at his disposal. To make matters more complicated, this spell can't be undone unless Arj decides to go back to the way things were, and until this deviation from reality is undone, Gabriel is even excommunicated from heaven and demoted to human form, where he's forced to find a job of his own while toughing it out alongside Jeff.

Eliding the simplest and most obvious lesson, of a rich man changing through his experience with poverty (and vice versa), Good Fortune ends up with a slightly more complex drama rooted in the trio's dynamics and relationships. Gabriel, now a naïve human learning the way things work for the first time, from his measly paycheck to the delights of drinking milkshakes and going dancing, ends up the movie's heart and soul—Ansari knows exactly how to play on Reeve's kindly, ethereal image—while Jeff and Arj are more concerned with screwing each other over, even as they learn more about each other's lives.

All the while, even though Arj tries to get close to Elena in this reality too, the problems she faces at work don't magically disappear, and only strengthen her efforts to unionize. That a mainstream Hollywood movie features scenes of Elena convincing her fellow workers to join the cause, and moments of them sharing food together as they draw up plans—as though these moments had been plucked from Brett Story and Stephen Maing's Amazon labor documentary Union—is perhaps Hollywood's most shocking recent development alongside Andor and One Battle After Another, in which progressive politics are given unapologetically revolutionary form.

 In all these cases including Good Fortune, art alone is unlikely to spark change, just like Gabriel's interference is unlikely to alter the world's fabric. But that these left-leaning ideas are so out in the open—even under corporate umbrellas like Lionsgate, Disney and Warner Bros.—represents a cathartic sea change. There's an imaginary, alternate version of Good Fortune that the movie sometimes threatens to become, wherein simple morals and the efforts of a reformed, benevolent billionaire are enough of a band-aid to satiate the characters, as well as the audience. However, the film mines its situational humor from realities to which more and more viewers have become aware, about how capitalism ensures that those on the top rungs of the ladder continue to thrive by keeping others at the bottom. It's a system that inherently corrodes people—Arj, when placed atop it, only helps his friends—and the major lesson that Jeff learns by the end of it is that only remaining options are radical change from within, or total societal revolt.

A film with politics this overt and preachy ought not to work as well as it does. However, Good Fortune uses its economic framework to build meaningful moments of character, and lures out its humor through a more intimate understanding of the way the world works, and the forces controlling it from just behind the curtain, by having two people on either side of its conundrum collide at lightspeed. Meanwhile, the presence of Reeves as an earnest cosmic being who learns the follies of modern human civilization firsthand is the kind of sweetly funny addition that makes the medicine go down slightly easier. Hollywood movies seldom feel like this, and while its story wraps up a little too neatly and conveniently, Good Fortune is an appropriately good time at the movies.

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Black Phone 2.

Horror sequels are easy to greenlight and tricky to pull off. Desperate to find a glimmer of originality in a story previously told, screenwriters seek out new ways to revive dead killers for another round of slash and hack. Yet every time they come back, their knives get duller. To compensate for these diminishing returns, horror sequels will often empower their villains with supernatural abilities that justify resurrection at the expense of scares. Take Michael Myers. The moment Halloween II reveals Michael as Laurie Strode's brother, the series begins a slow and inevitable decline into schlock. Over several sequels, Michael ticks names off his family tree according to a pagan curse based on a constellation that arrives every Halloween, a far cry from the simplicity of an escaped mental patient in a William Shatner mask. Like much of its throwback slasher antics, Black Phone 2 follows a similar trend. Where the original Black Phone used the supernatural to guide its heroes, the sequel makes it the entire game: Stealing a script from Freddy Krueger, whatever the undead Grabber does in a dream happens in reality. 

Restaging the plot of the original in the snowblind Rockies, Black Phone 2 again charges Finn (Mason Thames) and Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) Blake with uncovering the mystery of three ice-cold Grabber cases. This time they're at the frigid Alpine Lake summer camp, which just so happens to be the camp their mother, Hope (Anna Lore), used to work at. The siblings use their connection to the great beyond to investigate the camp, where The Grabber used to work as a groundkeeper. Afflicted with expository dreams that point her to local murders, Hope uses her shining to glean that The Grabber was killing Alpine campers.

Black Phone 2 emphasizes Gwen's power more than before, using her dreams to fill in Black Phone backstory and stage Wes Craven-inspired action sequences in which the Grabber, now a ghost, attacks Gwen in her dreams. Invisible to everyone else, The Grabber throws Gwen around her bunk as an unseen blade slashes her skin. While these sequences make Black Phone 2 play like a remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street, it's really the Halloween sequels that the movie is grabbing from. After Gwen uses her dreams to discover that The Grabber and Hope knew each other, The Grabber extends Gwen the courtesy of explaining himself: The Grabber reveals that he killed their mother and staged the murder to look like a suicide.

Much like the retconned supernaturalism and increased family ties of the Halloween franchise, this change undoes much of what The Black Phone did well. In the 2022 film, Finn and Gwen lived in a realistic world with realistic problems. They were latchkey kids of the late '70s whose family life was torn apart by their mother's suicide. Meanwhile, the otherworldly powers at play stood on a firmer foundation, doubling as a metaphor for the kids finding inner strength and determination against their attackers. The Grabber, too, was just a guy—one who could be killed by a telephone cord. Black Phone 2 makes him an all-powerful being with ice skates for feet who can only be killed by following a specific set of rules: Find the dead campers' bodies, and the Grabber will return to Hell.

It's easy to understand why some horror filmmakers go this route for their accidental franchises. The Saw movies made a complicated mess of their timeline by justifying how Jigsaw kept making a comeback every year. Scream eventually decided to add some of those ghostly elements to help smooth over the decade-long delay between installments. Black Phone 2 joins other supernaturally bent sequels, like Halloween and Friday The 13th, to stretch out the longevity of a series that never thought it'd be a series. But while an undead villain makes resurrection easier, it damages the credibility of the monster. These killers are at their scariest when they exist in familiar worlds, ones the audience can identify—like an everyday summer camp terrorized by a disgruntled employee, or a neighborhood menaced by a senseless killer. The Black Phone got a lot of mileage out of that. Like Halloween, it took a familiar world and added the uncanny. With Black Phone 2, those rules no longer apply. If anything can happen, nothing is scary.

John Deutch



At the Freakshow we don't spend a lot of time on conspiracy theories – but we make an exception when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein, a career criminal burrowed deep into the American national security and foreign affairs establishment for reasons that are unclear and with effects that are not fully understood. Was he a spy? Alex Acosta, the Miami federal prosecutor who cut Epstein's infamous sweetheart deal, supposedly said he was told to “back off” because Epstein “belonged to intelligence.”



So many of Epstein's connections are well-known and hashed over. Rich men have lost wives and jobs and paid massive settlements for their involvement, while others squirm and deny or issue carefully worded apologies. We know their names. But there's more to uncover. Epstein was a predator and pimp, yes, but it was never just about the girls.

House and Senate committees might wait forever for full disclosure from the Justice Department, but there are hoards of archives in the public realm that they could start looking into. A good place to start? The records of those old bogeymen, the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. These organizations preceded Davos, serving something of the same purpose – hosting self-important gasbag speakers for audiences of men with even greater self-regard. They primarily serve as closed-door clubs where private interests can be quietly advanced into public policy.



Epstein showed up inside these lofty clubs in the early 1990s – the launch years of his utterly mysterious rise in the American establishment. As we reported in a previous Freakshow, the doors to global power opened wide for Epstein in 1991 after the gnomelike Ohio billionaire Les Wexner very questionably gave him power of attorney over his billions. That same year, Jeff got his first jet and Ghislaine Maxwell appeared on the scene as his enabler and sometimes girlfriend.



He put the Wexner pile to work on power-networking right away. By 1992, Epstein was loaning $100,000 to Bill Clinton's inaugural committee. Between 1991 and 1995, he made 17 White House visits. The visits abruptly stopped in January 1995, the same year he joined both the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.

In the June 12, 1995, roster of the Trilateral Commission, he is identified as Jeffrey E. Epstein, President, New Albany Property Inc. (New Albany was the planned village near Columbus that Wexner was developing and living in). He soon forked over $350,000 to the Council on Foreign Relations, which has since publicly disavowed him. The CFR has also claimed he only showed up for two meetings as a member, but club records suggest otherwise.

In October 1995, Les Gelb – an international affairs éminence grise and New York Times columnist who appeared in Epstein's black book and traveled with him on his plane – arranged with Clinton's CIA director John Deutch for a “private tour and briefing” at the CIA. The daylong agenda included briefings on “info. warfare,” “global humanitarian emergencies,” “proliferation” and “economic intelligence,” and even included a $12 lunch with Deutch (that the CFR told the members they would have to cover themselves).

...

  Trip to Central Intelligence Agency; Council on Foreign Relations Records, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library

Epstein was among a small number of Gelb's invitees to that CIA event, along with some white shoe lawyers, oil and weapons industry reps, and consultants from Kissinger Associates and the Carlyle International Group. (MAGA conspiracists will be sorry to see that in one of the records related to this lunch, Gelb hand-wrote “George Soros unable to attend CIA Day anytime Oct-Nov.”)

  

The CIA director who hosted the event, John M. Deutch, also served as Clinton's Deputy Secretary of Defense, and was later accused of spectacular breaches of national security protocol. Official reports on his habits make Trump's Mar-a-Lago classified documents bathroom pile look like Fort Knox in comparison.



He kept a running journal of his work at the agency on a computer disk that he carried home with him every night and subsequently accessed on computers designated for “unclassified” use that were connected to the internet. He refused home security that most DCIs get, attempted to reformat and delete files when the CIA asked him to turn them over, and had a computer expert visit him weekly to discuss encryption and other issues, according to one inspector general's report..

“Dr. Deutch failed to follow even the most basic security precautions” read a Pentagon report on the matter. A CIA investigation concluded that he “intentionally processed... highly classified information” on his home computers in Massachusetts and Maryland.

Deutch refused to cooperate and was never charged; Clinton pardoned him two hours before he handed the White House over to George W. Bush in January 2001.

One could chalk up this behavior to being a bureaucratic tech Luddite – except that Deutch had been at MIT for decades by then, had served in the Pentagon and the Energy department and was regarded by a computer expert he worked with as a “fairly advanced” user.

After his government years, Deutch returned to MIT – another node of American national security and scientific power that Epstein was burrowing into with money and personal charm. He gave MIT $850,000 and struck up a friendship with, among others, Deutsch's friend Noam Chomsky. Deutch was head of the Department of Chemistry, Dean of Science and Provost, and eventually served on the board of a company started by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who had close ties to Epstein. Epstein connected Vekselberg with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2013, and the men went into business together. Deutch also helped Vekselberg create the Skolkovo Institute, a Russian-MIT collaboration that by 2014, Boston FBI warned could be a vehicle for Russia to steal US technology, and in 2022, the U.S. sanctioned it for its “close relationship with Russia's defense sector.”

By 2003, Epstein had embedded himself all the way into the establishment. It had taken just over ten years. His birthday book is a record of the respect, love and affection of numerous extremely powerful men. At the Trilateral Commission and the CFR, he smirked and slunk and rubbed shoulders with U.S. Senators current and former, Secretaries of State current and former, chairmen of banks and financial firms and aerospace and international conglomerates – men who would go on to make decisions affecting the course of world affairs and millions of people's lives, from Moscow to Tel Aviv, from Berlin to Abu Dhabi, from the status of Palestine to a nuclear-armed Iran.

These are all just breadcrumbs: facts over time that might suggest connections to larger events. Mostly they raise questions without answers. The Epstein motherlode is hoarded up in a Justice Department vault, currently guarded by K$H Patel and Pam Bondi. The Trump regime has gone to great lengths to divert attention from what had been their followers' greatest conspiracy obsession. Besides provoking unrest in American cities, they are hiding the files, flagging (and presumably erasing) King Don's presence in said files, slow walking or flat out ignoring Congressional subpoenas, and giving the royal prison treatment to Epstein's depraved procuress Ghislaine Maxwell.

Even Bible Mike, our God-lovin' House Speaker, is in on the coverup, refusing to swear in a duly elected member of Congress, apparently to delay or block a full House vote that would open the Epstein matter for discussion. To quote a song from one of Epstein's Boomer era bands: “There's something happening here… What it is ain't exactly clear.”

In May 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the first statewide lab-meat ban, saying that the meat was a tool of the 'global elite ... to achieve their authoritarian goals.' Photo by: Gage Skidmore/Flickr(CC BY-SA 2.0)

This story was originally published by Mother Jones and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration

Scientists once predicted meat-making machines on every kitchen counter, but so far cultured meat — grown from the cells of an animal in a lab or factory — has only been seen at a handful of high-end restaurants. There are entirely practical reasons the stuff has yet to make its debut at McDonald's, but also bizarre, conspiratorial ones; some states have already banned it for reasons that include “global elites” and “bugs.”

First imagined in 19th-century science fiction, cultured meat became a reality in the early 2000s when NASA grew fish tissue in a liquid serum. The first peer-reviewed paper on the topic, in 2005, predicted that cultured meat could address consumer concerns over “nutrition-­related diseases, foodborne illnesses, resource use and pollution” and the ethical implications of raising animals for meat.

The years that followed brought a mini-boom of research boosted by powerful investors like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. But the technology was pricey and the environmental gains didn't pan out. While early ­analyses­ predicted that emissions from meat production could be reduced by up to 96 per cent, those estimates were downgraded over the years; one paper even argued the environmental impact of lab-grown beef could be greater than that of cattle.

Farmers didn't take lab-grown meat seriously until about 10 years ago, when farmed animal protein was on the outs because of its association with climate change and heart disease. “Meatless Mondays” were in their Oprah-boosted heyday, plant-based burgers like Impossible and Beyond were exploding in popularity and the agricultural giant Tyson Foods had invested in lab-grown meat startups and launched its own plant-based products. By 2019, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) was lobbying states to pass laws limiting the use of terms like “hot dogs” and “burgers” to the marketing of farmed animal products. You'd have to say veggie “tubes” or “pucks.” (Tofurky sued and the restrictions were deemed unconstitutional, except when the meat-related words were being used deceptively.)

The next year, Singapore became the first country to approve cultured meat for consumption. The United States followed in 2023 and two companies — including one backed by Gates — brought to market lab-grown chicken products, which are as yet too expensive for most consumers.

In the interim, right-wing trendsetters were busy spreading conspiracy theories about lab-grown meat. In 2022, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene asserted that the government was “surveilling” Americans with meat grown in petri dishes and that the deep state would “zap” those who ate a real burger. Though widely mocked, Greene was tapping into a growing political movement that had begun the year before, with influencers going viral for promoting “real” — often raw — meat. The most famous one, Liver King, touted a meat-heavy “ancestral lifestyle” on TikTok that included eating raw organs and questionable “natural” supplements. He later admitted he was also ingesting copious amounts of steroids, but the trend stuck. Proponents, including doctors-turned-influencers, highlighted supposed benefits of animal meat — including increased testosterone and sperm count — and derided people who preferred plant-based options as “soy boys.”

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who brags of his “caveman”-style carnivore diet, drummed up concern about lab-grown meat when he served as chair of the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children's Health Defense, calling it a ­“catastrophe-in-the-making” and, weirdly, “the death knell to Thomas Jefferson's vision of a democracy.” Soon white supremacists were posting that Gates and other supposed shadowy “globalists” were pushing the government to replace traditional meat with stuff made from bugs. Tucker Carlson seized upon this particular bit of lunacy, devoting an episode of his show to it and declaring, “Eating insects is repulsive and un-American.” One of his guests said the push for bugs was “because they want these farmers' land.”

This was red meat for the MAGA base. In May 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the first statewide lab-meat ban. “Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,” he proclaimed. Earlier this year, in the lead-up to ­Nebraska's ban, a state senator warned that cultivated meat would “socially engineer” people away from farmed meat, while Gov. Jim ­Pillen declared it the result of “crazy far-left ideology.”

Despite such rants, the cattle ­industry seems less concerned now than it was a few years ago. The NCBA has reversed course and come out against the state bans, some of which have failed. Trump's FDA recently approved a cultured salmon product from the Bezos-backed company Wildtype.

What's behind the about-face? Politics might be part of it. Fourth-generation Nebraska rancher Dan Morgan recently told the Associated Press that banning meat alternatives seems antithetical to free-­market innovation. “It sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,” he quipped.

What's more, the whole idea of lab-grown meat appears to give folks the ick: In one 2022 survey, people deemed it “equally or more healthy, but more disgusting than conventional meat products.” As long as prices are high and consumers are weirded out, conventional producers have little to worry about. As the Cattlemen's director of government affairs put it last year, “We're not afraid of competing with these products in the marketplace.”","{'href': 'https://www.nationalobserver.com', 'title': ""Canada's National Observer""}","other"

Steven Hixson vanished from Trinity County in 2017 (Calif. DOJ photo)

HAYFORK, Calif. - The mysterious disappearance of Steven Hixson from Trinity County has puzzled authorities for eight years. Hixson was last seen on March 1, 2017, after he contacted the police to report an assault at his home.

Hixson initially claimed he was struck in the head with a baseball bat but later recanted, saying he had fallen. Police noted bruises on his head and called an ambulance, but Hixson refused hospital treatment.

Hixson has not been heard from since that day. Investigators identified the person who allegedly hit Hixson with the bat, but it remains unclear if this person is a suspect.

Hixson was known for walking and riding his bicycle over long distances. Authorities believe he might have become disoriented from his injury and wandered into the wilderness near Hayfork.

At the time of his disappearance, Hixson was 45 years old, stood 5 feet 8 inches tall, and weighed 149 pounds. He had brown eyes, black hair, and a tattoo of a woman's name on his right shoulder.

Anyone with information is urged to contact the Trinity County Sheriff's Office at 530-623-2611.

In this article

Amazon Web Services, a leader in the cloud infrastructure market, reported a major outage on Monday, taking down numerous major websites.

Many sites came back online within a few hours, although Downdetector showed another spike in user reports around noon ET of outages at Amazon, AWS and Alexa.

Amazon said in a blog post Monday afternoon that AWS customers were still experiencing ""increased error rates"" when trying to launch new instances in EC2, its popular cloud service that provides virtual server capacity.

The company also confirmed that the outage impacted Amazon.com, some of its subsidiaries and AWS customer support operations.

""We are working to fully restore service as quickly as possible,"" the company wrote.

The outage was first reported at 3:11 a.m. ET in AWS' main US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. A notice on AWS' status page said it was experiencing DNS problems with DynamoDB, its database service that underpins many other AWS applications.

DNS, or Domain Name System, translates website names to IP addresses so browsers and other applications can load.

AWS cited an ""operational issue"" affecting ""multiple services"" and said it was ""working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery,"" in an update at 5:01 a.m. ET. More than 70 of its own services were affected.

Shortly afterward, AWS said it was seeing ""significant signs of recovery.""

AWS said in an update at 6:35 a.m. ET that the DNS issue had been ""fully mitigated"" and that AWS service operations were ""succeeding normally.""

AWS is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure technology, accounting for around a third of the market, ahead of Microsoft and Google, according to Synergy Research Group. Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS for cloud computing services, such as servers and storage.

Downdetector showed user reports indicating problems at sites including Disney+, Lyft, the McDonald's app, The New York Times, Reddit, Ring doorbells, Robinhood, Snapchat, United Airlines, T-Mobile and Venmo.

British government websites Gov.uk and HM Revenue and Customs were also experiencing issues, per Downdetector.

A government spokesperson told CNBC: ""We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.""

Lloyds Banking Group confirmed that some of its services were affected and asked customers ""to bear with us"" while it worked to restore them. Some 20 minutes later, it added that services were coming back online.

The outage also brought down critical tools inside Amazon. Warehouse and delivery employees, along with drivers for Amazon's Flex service, reported on Reddit that internal systems were offline at many sites. Some warehouse workers were instructed to stand by in break rooms and loading areas during their shift, while they couldn't load Amazon's Anytime Pay app, which lets employees access a portion of their paycheck immediately.

Seller Central, the hub used by Amazon's third-party sellers to manage their businesses, was also knocked offline by the outage.

Reddit, too, is ""working on scaling Reddit back to 100 percent as we speak,"" a spokesperson told CNBC.

Some United and Delta Air Lines customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags.

A T-Mobile spokesperson said its customers had issues when trying to use other sites or services due to the AWS disruption, but that there ""was no outage or service disruption"" at the carrier.

Canvas, an online teaching platform used to host course information and submit assignments, said it was also hit by the ""ongoing AWS incident.""

Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage.

Graphic design tool Canva said it was ""experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider.""

Generative artificial intelligence search tool Perplexity was also affected. ""The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it,"" CEO Aravind Srinivas said in a post on X.

It's not the first time in recent history that major companies have been affected by a technical issue. In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed the fragility of global technology infrastructure when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. It also affected hospitals and banks.

AWS has also experienced other outages in recent years. A disruption in 2023 knocked many websites offline for several hours, while a more severe outage in 2021 affected websites and services across the globe, including some of Amazon's own delivery operations, which were briefly brought to a standstill.

""There's no sign that this AWS outage was caused by a cyberattack - it looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres,"" Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN, said in a statement. ""These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.""

An Amazon spokesperson pointed to AWS' service health dashboard when reached for comment.

Indeed, ""DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know,"" Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. However, it ""is one of the record-keepers of the modern Internet.""

""We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. The data appears to be safe. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data,"" he added.

""This episode serves as a reminder of how dependent the world is on a handful of major cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. When a major cloud provider sneezes, the Internet catches a cold.""

U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside of the country could upend the global industry — and deliver a heavy blow to Britain's already fragile sector.

The White House leader first announced duties on movies produced outside the U.S. in May this year. He than reiterated the issue in September, writing in a post on social media that other countries have ""stolen"" the movie-making business from the U.S.

The U.K.'s film industry has already faced multiple challenges in recent years from Box Office sales struggling to recover their pre-pandemic levels to rising competition from streaming platforms, the SAG AFTRA strikes and now the threat of film tariffs.

Gurinder Chadha, director of blockbuster movies ""Bend it Like Beckham"" and ""Bride & Prejudice,"" is set to release a new film this Winter called ""Christmas Karma,"" based on Charles Dickens' classic, ""A Christmas Carol.""  The director told CNBC it's a ""miracle"" that she's been able to make the film, given the challenges faced by the industry.  

""I'm not sure that tariffs are practical, but I think we have to look at the message behind that, which is that every country is trying to protect its own film industry,"" she said.

Still, the British film and TV sector is a bright spot for the economy, contributing billions of pounds through production spending, which reached £5.6 billion ($7.5 billion) last year, according to the British Film Institute (BFI).

""We know that it's worth — about 126 billion pounds a year — our creative industries. Quite often, people think about film and television as being things that make you feel good, things that entertain you, but actually they create thousands and thousands of jobs and huge amounts of inward investment across the U.K.,"" said Caroline Dinenage, a member of parliament and chair of the U.K.'s Culture Media and Sports Committee.

From Pinewood to Shepperton, U.K. studios depend heavily on U.S. partnerships. Last year, 65% of total U.K. production spend on film came from U.S. studios and streaming platforms, per a BFI report.

Without this stateside contribution, it would be more difficult to make British movies, according to film director Howard Berry.

""We are quite reliant on the U.S. investing into the U.K. to make films. We have to wait for them to say we're going to make a film, and then we scramble around to make it happen,"" he said.

""We're not so great at having a pot of money for the U.K. to say we're going to make U.K. films. And so if that money doesn't happen anymore, we're kind of stuck. We don't have that huge amount of investment to make our own films.""

Modern filmmaking is a collaborative process, with scripting, filming, post-production, and music development often worked on across different countries. This makes it difficult to enforce tariffs, according to the Vue CEO Tim Richards.

""I think because of the complexities, because there are other ways of actually implementing and getting to the same place, through tax credits, even what Gavin Newsom has been proposing as well in California, that there are other means of achieving the same goals without having the impact on the industry,"" Richards said, referring to California Governor Gavin Newsom.

This summer, Newsom increased the total film and TV tax credit to $750 million in California, nearly doubling the previous cap, in a bid to encourage more productions to film in Los Angeles.

""How do you define what is going to be actually hit by these tariffs? That's what everyone's really been focusing on,"" he added.

Zygi Kamasa, CEO of British-based theatrical distributor True Brit Entertainment, said that U.S. movie tariffs could result in the U.K. collaborating more with other nations.""A lot of our films that we made over the years, that we made in Britain, travel very well to Europe and Asia. And I think we'd look at co-production opportunities more out of the European territories to bolster the financing opportunities.""

For now the cameras keep rolling – but many within the industry are hoping the U.K. government will take action.

When Trump first called for 100% tariffs on movies, a spokesperson from the U.K. government told local media that it was not in the national interest to provide a ""running commentary"" on trade matters with the U.S. They added that the British film industry is ""world-class.""

""It's a really important thing for our prime minister to be discussing with the U.S. government, and I think it should definitely be front and center of any future trade discussion,"" said Dinenage.

            The Tomahawk is the workhorse of the United States' missile arsenal. It's been deployed in strikes in Syria and Libya and was used extensively against former dictator Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, in both the 1990s and in 2003.
    


            About 30 of the cruise missiles were used as part of the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.
    


            While not new, the Tomahawk remains effective and relatively cheap, at $2 million per missile. Depending on the variant, it can strike targets at a range of between 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers (1,000 to 1,600 miles).
    


            That is not much greater than some of Ukraine's longer-range drones, but the Tomahawk would pack a far higher explosive punch. It has sophisticated guidance technologies and travels at high subsonic (about 550 mph) speeds.
    


            It also flies low, literally hugging the contours of land, making it harder to detect and intercept.
    


            For all these reasons, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lobbied the Trump administration for the delivery of Tomahawks that could enable Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia. For now, at least, he's not going to get them. Trump made clear last week that the US has few to spare, saying: “We need Tomahawks for the United States of America too. We have a lot of them but we need them.”
    


            As we have seen in this war of attrition – with the F-16 fighter jets, Abrams tanks and even Patriot missile batteries supplied to Ukraine – no single system is a game-changer. Hundreds of Tomahawks would be needed to cripple Russia's refineries and airbases.
    


            Even so, a few dozen could enable the Ukrainian military to inflict substantial damage on key Russian infrastructure far from its borders – including the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast, according to Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War.
    


            “It's very difficult just to operate with only with Ukrainian drones. We need long-range Tomahawks,” Zelensky said in an interview with US network NBC on Sunday.
    


            He has also said that Tomahawks would “strengthen Ukraine and force the Russians to sober up a little (and) sit down at the negotiating table.”
    


            The Kremlin was so perturbed by the prospect of Kyiv procuring Tomahawks that it issued dire warnings about an escalation of the war, given that the missiles can carry nuclear warheads. Russia would perceive their supply to Ukraine as a “hostile move” that would threaten global security, according to the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to preempt the prospect in a lengthy call with Trump on the eve of Zelensky's visit to Washington on October 16.
    


            The Tomahawk is certainly proven in combat. In 1991, when the US and its allies sought to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, 122 Tomahawks were fired at Iraqi defenses in the opening three days of Operation Desert Storm – the first time they had been used. It has also been used for precision strikes in the Balkans, Afghanistan in 1998, Yemen, Libya and Syria. The latest version of the missile was introduced in 2021, with enhanced electronics and a greater range.
    


            However, it has largely been a sea-launched missile. Ukraine would need a ground-launcher – called the Typhon – to fire the missile. The Typhon, which resembles a large container, was developed after the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Moscow in 2019, citing multiple Russian violations.
    


            Zelensky has spoken optimistically about Ukraine's own cruise missile – dubbed the Flamingo – which purportedly has a similar range to the Tomahawk. But its capabilities are something of a mystery and Ukraine lacks the resources to scale up production.
    


            While Tomahawks would help Kyiv's long-range attacks inside Russia, Ukraine needs above all else more – and more capable – air defenses, as Russia ratchets up mass attacks with a combination of missiles and drones.
    


            Zelensky met with US manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Raytheon during his latest trip to Washington as he pursues what he has described as a “mega-deal” worth some $90 billion in weapons purchases.

Marjorie Taylor Greene criticizes House speaker's strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately

US politics live – latest updates

The US government shutdown extended into its 20th day on Monday with no resolution in sight, as a prominent Republican lawmaker publicly broke ranks with party leadership over the decision of Mike Johnson, the House speaker, to keep Congress shuttered for weeks.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative of Georgia, on Monday morning criticized Johnson's strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately.

“The House should be in session working,” Greene wrote on X. “We should be finishing appropriations. Our committees should be working. We should be passing bills that make President Trump's executive orders permanent. I have no respect for the decision to refuse to work.”

The callout from Greene, who is aligned with the right flank of her party, is a noticeable crack in support for Johnson's hardline approach from the GOP over an extended congressional recess. Since 19 September, when members last cast votes, the chamber has not been conducting legislative business, although members have staged press conferences.

The shutdown, which began on 1 October, has become the longest full government shutdown in US history, and the third-longest when including partial shutdowns. If it extends past Tuesday, it will surpass the 21-day shutdown of 1995-96 to claim second place. Only the 35-day partial shutdown during Donald Trump's first term, from December 2018 to January 2019, has lasted longer.

Johnson has defended his strategy as necessary to pressure Senate Democrats into passing the House's clean continuing resolution without policy additions. But Democrats have refused to support the measure without provisions addressing healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at year's end.

The speaker, in a Monday morning press conference flanked by other Republican congressional leaders including Andy Harris, the House Freedom caucus chair, said the reason for the shutdown was to appease Democratic voters, particularly at the No Kings rallies.

“It is exactly why Chuck Schumer is pandering, in this whole charade. We've explained from the very beginning, the shutdown is about one thing and one thing alone: Chuck Schumer's political survival,” Johnson said.

The shutdown's impact grew more severe on Monday as the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration began furloughing approximately 1,400 federal employees responsible for maintaining and modernizing the US nuclear weapons arsenal. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, is scheduled to address the furloughs at a press conference in Las Vegas later on Monday, a spokesperson told the Guardian.

Though widely expected to fail again, the Senate is looking to hold another vote on Monday evening on the House-passed funding measure, marking the 11th attempt to advance the legislation. Previous votes have repeatedly failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster.

Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser, speculated on Monday, citing “friends in the Senate”, that the impasse might soon break.

“I think the [Senate minority leader Chuck] Schumer shutdown is likely to end sometime this week,” Hassett said in a CNBC interview. He reasoned that some Democrats had been reluctant to reopen the government ahead of last Saturday's No Kings protests against Trump, which drew millions of demonstrators nationwide to rebuke corruption and authoritarianism.

Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne arrives at a cabinet meeting on Parliament Hill in October. Mr. Champagne says a new agency will be established to investigate sophisticated schemes that are often linked to organized crime.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

The 2025 federal budget will include plans for a new financial crimes agency that will target money laundering and online fraud, the government announced Monday.

Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne outlined the initiative on Parliament Hill as part of a series of announcements the government is making ahead of the Nov. 4 budget. 

Canadians lost $643-million to fraud in 2024, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.

Opinion: Canada lags allies in providing financial-crime guidance to banks, other businesses

The new office will investigate sophisticated schemes that are often linked to organized crime.

The new centre will be part of a broader federal anti-fraud strategy that will include legislation updating the Bank Act.

The legislative amendments would require banks to have policies and procedures in place to detect and prevent consumer-targeted fraud; obtain clear consent from bank account holders before enabling services like e-transfers and to collect data on financial fraud and report it to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada.

Mr. Champagne said the new agency is inspired by similar investigation teams in Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States.

“You need something different. You need something which is best in class in the world,” he said when asked if the new agency would duplicate work that is already taking place by existing federal organizations.

“You need the type of agents that would have the investigative power, the skills needed and the ability to really go after organized crime, money laundering, transnational crime,” he said.

Monday's announcement did not include a specific cost for the new agency. A government document said it will be funded by “leveraging investments in federal law enforcement capacity.”

Ottawa will also be launching consultations on a voluntary Economic Abuse Code of Conduct for financial institutions.

The news release does not describe how the new financial crimes agency would interact with existing national organizations that focus on financial crime.

There is currently a Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre that is described on its website as “a national police service that gathers intelligence on fraud across Canada and assists Police of Jurisdiction with enforcement and prevention efforts.”

There is also a federal body called FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada.

The organization describes itself as “Canada's financial intelligence unit and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing supervisor.”

Meanwhile, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions regulates and supervises more than 400 financial institutions in Canada.

That organization has a legal requirement under the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act “to supervise financial institutions in order to determine whether they have adequate policies and procedures to protect themselves against threats to their integrity or security, including foreign interference.”

US President Donald Trump has said Russia and Ukraine should freeze the current conflict front line in Donbass, noting that Moscow controls nearly all of the region anyway.

Trump made the remark after speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone on Thursday and meeting with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky the next day at the White House.

“We think what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are. The rest is very tough to negotiate,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday evening. “They should stop right now at the battle lines, go home, stop killing people, and be done,” he added.

Asked about Donbass, Trump said, “Let it be cut the way it is. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now. They can negotiate something later on.”

In 2014, the Donbass regions of Donetsk and Lugansk declared independence and voted to break away from Ukraine following the Western-backed coup in Kiev earlier that year. Under the Minsk Agreements, Kiev was bound to protect the status of Russian language and grant both regions more autonomy. Instead it backed an ethnic war in Donbass that, according to the International Crisis Group, left 14,000 people dead in eight years.

In September 2022, both regions held referendums to join Russia, which Kiev refuses to recognize. 

The chief of Russia's General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, said in August that Ukrainian troops held around 20% of the Donetsk People's Republic and less than 1% of the Lugansk People's Republic.

Putin has said that for a ceasefire to work, Ukrainian forces must withdraw from all of Donbass. He also listed recognition of Russia's new borders as one of the conditions for a lasting peace.

Zelensky has backed Trump's call for an immediate ceasefire but refused to hand over any “additional” territory to Russia.

MOSCOW, October 20. /TASS/. The EU has moved to ""active subversive efforts"" ahead of the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, seeking to disrupt any peace efforts in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS in an interview.

""We, of course, see and hear what is happening 'around the perimeter' due to the misunderstanding of what is going on. The EU and the aggressive Western European community have moved on to what they call active subversive actions,"" Zakharova said. ""Once again, there have been statements and threats,"" the diplomat pointed out.

""We understand what they want to do. I mean the Western European community fueled by former American ultra-liberal attitudes. Of course, they want to disrupt any peaceful aspirations, from talks about peace negotiations to actual actions,"" she noted.

""It's clear that they're trying to escalate the conflict as they did in 2022 by disrupting the peace talks requested by the Kiev regime, which our country made possible,"" Zakharova pointed out. ""They have been doing this all these years, periodically camouflaging their actions with statements about alleged peace and alleged peace initiatives. In reality, they are doing everything they can to escalate the conflict. It is difficult to say how much they realize what they are doing, given the number of unprofessional people in charge of all these Western European countries. These people lack professionalism in terms of education, experience, and vocation,"" the diplomat stressed. According to her, they are ""just talking heads who are fed the appropriate ideas."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Sixteen people were reportedly shot on 10 October after high school football game in downtown Leland

A seventh person has died from injuries suffered during the mass shooting in Leland, Mississippi, on 10 October, according to officials.

Ebanee Williams, 25, died on 17 October at the University of Mississippi medical center, as the local news outlet WLBT.com reported. Sixteen people were reportedly shot in the case, which unfolded in downtown Leland hours after a homecoming high school football game.

The Leland shooting was one of at least 14 mass killings in the US so far in 2025, according to the Associated Press. Such killings are generally defined as ones with four or more victims.

The killings in Leland also occurred among more than 400 mass shootings in the US for the year as of Monday, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. The resources describes mass shootings as “a single outburst of violence in which four or more people are shot”.

Perennially high numbers of mass shootings in the US have prompted many to call on Congress to provide more substantial gun control. But Congress has largely been unable or unwilling to heed such calls.

The six other victims who died in Leland during the 10 October mass murder include Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr, 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34, WLBT said.

As of 18 October, nine people have been arrested in relation to the shooting, according to WLBT. While the motive for the violence remains unclear, authorities said that it might have stemmed from a dispute.

“It appears the incident was sparked by a disagreement among several individuals,” the FBI's Jackson, Mississippi, office said in a statement. “This incident remains under investigation by local law enforcement, and the FBI is providing federal assistance in this investigation.”

Several of those arrested are facing capital murder charges. The FBI has requested that any members of the public with information contact them.

“It was the most horrific scene I'd ever seen,” witness Camish Hopkins told the Associated Press. Hopkins recalled witnessing four people dead, on the ground, and survivors who were wounded and bleeding.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Pope Leo met with survivors of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy for the first time on Monday, participants said, days after the Vatican's child protection commission accused senior Church leaders of being too slow to help victims.

Leo held a meeting with Ending Clergy Abuse, an international coalition of survivors, the group said. The encounter, which included four victims and two advocates, lasted about an hour with “a significant moment of dialogue,” they said.

The 1.4-billion-member Church has been shaken for decades by scandals across the world involving abuse and cover-up, damaging its credibility and costing it hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements.

An unusually critical report from the Vatican's own child protection commission, issued on Thursday, faulted senior bishops for not providing information to victims about how their reports of abuse were being handled, or whether negligent bishops had been sanctioned.

Gemma Hickey, a Canadian survivor who took part in Monday's meeting, said Leo met with the victims in his office at the Vatican's apostolic palace, took pictures with them, and listened carefully. 

“Pope Leo is very warm, he listened,” said Hickey. “We told him that we come as bridge-builders, ready to walk together toward truth, justice and healing.”

“I left the meeting with hope,” said Janet Aguti, a Ugandan survivor who was also at the meeting. “It is a big step for us.”

Opinion: The Vatican was looking for an improved Francis model, and just might have found one in Leo XIV

Leo, the first U.S. pope, was elected on May 8 to replace the late Pope Francis. Survivors said he told them he was still coming to grips with the enormity of the Church's scandals.

“I think he is still in a phase where he is trying to find out how to best address these issues,” said Matthias Katsch.

“The times where a pope is saying one sentence and everything is settled is over,” Katsch added.

Meeting participants said they asked Leo to create a global zero-tolerance policy for priests accused of abuse, something survivors have pushed for.

Timothy Law, an Ending Clergy Abuse co-founder, said he mentioned to Leo that the U.S. bishops have a zero tolerance law, which was enacted in 2002 after extensive reporting on abuse scandals in Boston. “Why can't we make it universal?” Law said he asked the pope.

Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is known to have met with survivors earlier in his career, when he was a missionary and bishop in Peru.

Francis, who died in April, made addressing abuse by clergy a priority of his 12-year papacy, with mixed results.

A former Russian oligarch has renewed his legal fight to force Ottawa to remove him from Canada's sanctions regime and free up more than $100-million of frozen assets.

Lawyers for Igor Makarov informed Global Affairs Canada on Oct. 10 that they plan to challenge his presence on Canada's sanctions list before an international arbitration panel. That could be either the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes or a United Nations panel.

The billionaire oil and gas tycoon renounced his Russian citizenship in 2023 and is now a citizen of Cyprus and Moldova. He accuses Ottawa of violating an investment treaty it has with Moldova.

Canada placed Mr. Makarov under sanctions and froze $145-million of his assets in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022. His lawyers say the frozen assets and lost investments amount to $350-million.

Mr. Makarov is seeking $350-million through international arbitration unless Ottawa renews negotiations to delist him.

Earlier: Russian oligarch Igor Makarov moved money before Canada added him to sanctions list

“We invite Canada to resolve this dispute amicably by negotiation,” his London-based lawyers wrote to Global Affairs' sanctions division in a letter obtained by The Globe and Mail.

The letter argues that the “sanctions have not been pursued in Canada in an even-handed manner or based on good-faith belief in any genuine connection between Mr. Makarov and the Russian regime, but rather to target Mr. Makarov as one of the few (former) Russians with substantial assets in Canada.”

Britain, Australia and New Zealand had also put Mr. Makarov on their Russian sanctions lists, but they delisted him in March, 2024, and May and September of this year, respectively.

The United States and European Union never imposed sanctions on Mr. Makarov, a former Soviet Union cycling champion.

Canada now remains the only Western country with sanctions in place against Mr. Makarov because of his alleged ties to senior Russian officials, which he denies having.

Mr. Makarov had previously challenged then-foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly's decision not to delist him before the Federal Court of Canada. That case was dismissed in August, 2024. The court said the minister has wide discretion and is “not bound by the strict rules of evidence.” The dismissal is currently under appeal at the Federal Court of Appeal. 

Mr. Makarov filed a second delisting application based on the international delistings in Britain and Australia. That application was also dismissed and is under judicial review. He then made a third delisting application after New Zealand subsequently also delisted him. That application is pending. 

His notice of legal dispute and intent to submit a claim to international arbitration under the Moldova-Canada investment treaty is a separate matter. He would be seeking compensation for mistreatment by Canada in violation of protections provided to him under the treaty. 

Thida Ith, a spokesperson for Global Affairs, said the department is “reviewing the information provided in the Notice of Intent,” but would have no further comment “on specific sanctions listings for privacy reasons.”

Mr. Makarov and his lawyers did not make themselves available for comment.

Opinion: Canada cannot wait for Europe and must act alone to ‘double-freeze' Russian assets

Rita Trichur: Canada struggles to enforce sanctions against countries including Russia and Iran, creating headaches for businesses

Mr. Makarov was the founder of the Russian energy conglomerate ITERA. The letter says that the businessman, who is currently president of ARETI International Group, not only severed ties to Moscow but has also spoken out publicly against the invasion of Ukraine and contributed funds to help 15,000 Ukrainian refugees.

He said in the letter that he was forced to sell ITERA to the Russian state-owned oil and gas corporation Rosneft in 2013 and moved to Switzerland in 2016. He is now a resident of Cyprus.

That same year, he invested heavily in Calgary-based oil and gas exploration company Inception Exploration Inc., which was later taken over by Spartan Delta. The shares in Spartan have been frozen.

His lawyers argue that Mr. Makarov's Canadian investments constitute a significant portion of the total value of his frozen assets and blocked transactions.

“Canada has unlawfully deployed its sanctions regime against Mr. Makarov to restrict him from benefiting from, transacting with, or dealing in any way with his extensive investments in Canada,” the letter says. 

Being placed on Canada's Russia-related sanctions list means any assets of the named person in Canada are frozen. People in Canada and Canadians outside of this country are prohibited from providing financial services to those under sanction, or entering into or facilitating transactions with them.

Those under sanctions in Canada might also face the prospect of the federal government seizing and selling off their assets, with the proceeds donated to Ukraine, as Ottawa has proposed doing. They are also banned from entering Canada.

France's Interior Ministry said jewels of ""inestimable value"" were taken from the world-renowned museum in a seven-minute heist. 

A break-in at the Louvre in the French capital Paris on Sunday saw suspected criminals make off with ""priceless"" jewelry, according to France's culture minister.

Rachida Dati said the incident occurred as the museum, one of the world's most famous, opened its doors Sunday morning.

""A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,"" she wrote on X. The museum confirmed it would be closed for the day ""for exceptional reasons.""

On Sunday evening, the culture ministry said nine objects had been stolen from the Paris museum. One of the items was recovered nearby, most likely after being dropped by the alleged thieves as they fled.

""Two high-security display cases were targeted, and eight objects of invaluable cultural heritage were stolen,"" the ministry said. 

One of the stolen items is an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife Empress Marie Louise.

The Paris prosecutors said police were hunting for four suspects, who had used high-powered scooters to escape, Laure Beccuau told BFMTV television. 

Interior Minister Laurent Nunez described the incident as a ""major robbery.""

He said the burglars, armed with small chainsaws, used a basket lift to reach the targeted room. They fled on motorbikes with the stolen jewelry.

""The investigation has begun, and a detailed list of the stolen items is being compiled. Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value,"" the French Interior Ministry said.

The Louvre's most notorious theft occurred in 1911, when the Mona Lisa was stolen by a former employee. Recovered two years later in Florence, the heist helped turn Leonardo da Vinci's portrait into the world's best-known artwork.

Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors.

Migration has become a dominant political issue in many Western countries, with rightwing movements claiming there's a dangerous unchecked influx of foreigners. Here's an analysis of the costs and benefits for society.



Migration is one of the most defining and debated issues of our time, with political, economic and social implications across the globe. While critics often highlight short-term costs — such as pressure on housing, welfare systems and public finances — experts and data consistently show that migration is a key driver of economic growth, innovation, and labor market stability. 

Countries like Germany and the United States rely heavily on migrants to fill labor gaps, support aging populations and fuel entrepreneurship, with nearly half of the largest US companies founded by immigrants or their children.

However, successful migration policy requires strategic planning and investment. Challenges like integration costs, infrastructure strain and public skepticism must be addressed through better alignment between labor market needs and migration pathways. 

As climate change, conflict and demographic shifts intensify global displacement, experts warn that governments must act now to create humane, economically sound migration systems — or risk social unrest and missed opportunities for prosperity.

Throughout history, humans have had to find creative ways to keep food from spoiling using whatever resources were available—from holes in the ground to cold water in nearby lakes and rivers. Although artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1700s, it wasn't until the early 20th century that what we now know as refrigerators gained traction and started appearing in homes across the United States.

Now that refrigerators are a staple appliance in every home, many of us tend to store as much as possible—especially fruits and vegetables—within them, believing it will retain freshness and preserve quality, texture, and taste.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            A president steeped in constitutional lore might have been offended by claims he's acting as a king.
    


            But Donald Trump and his entourage responded with mockery to weekend “No Kings” protests by millions of Americans — embracing the narrative in a way that explains his growing hubris and belief that he has unchecked power.
    


            The president and Vice President JD Vance this weekend both posted AI memes to social media depicting Trump in a crown. The one Trump shared was a mocked-up vision of the president flying a fighter jet emblazoned with “KING TRUMP” appearing to dump raw sewage on protesters. In Vance's troll on Bluesky, a site popular with liberals, prominent Democrats knelt as supplicants in a royal court before Trump, the divine and absolute ruler.
    


            It was a clever political trick. MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters' gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman.
    


            Trump's post is not only juvenile but also betrays striking contempt for tens of millions of Americans he ostensibly leads and for the concept of democratic free speech. He's far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don't agree with. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, all had their moments. And a sense that liberal elites disrespected heartland Americans was fundamental to Trump's rise to power.
    


            Moreover, Democrats seem to have done little self-reflection over whether their aggressive push to implement their progressive values alienated more conservative Americans and contributed to their own defeat in 2024.
    


            But the president's social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren't for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don't again rule America. He's implying there's no room for those who don't support him and showing he's willing to force them into line.



            Whether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. The stakes are especially high amid a government shutdown the president appears to have no desire to end.
    


            But as Trump's behavior becomes more imperious and as opposition gathers — from street protests to more universities refusing to bend to his ideological will, and judges temporarily halting his orders for troops to enter US cities — tensions and divisions are rising.
    


            The president shows no sign of changing course. He called Saturday's mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said.
    


 “When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.
    


            Trump's recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths.
    


            His stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president's latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This followed his demands that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were followed by indictments scant weeks later.
    


            Santos on Sunday related to CNN's Dana Bash how he'd been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,” Santos said, “I'm pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that's just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos' former GOP colleague from New York, said of Santos: “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”
    


            Pardoning and commutations are one of the few areas where the Constitution suggest presidents do have unaccountable power. But Trump's treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system's reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. (Of course, Republicans will respond that Biden pardoned members of his own family, so all is fair game.)
    


            The president's authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad.
    


            ► Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US military conducted a seventh strike against a boat in the Caribbean that the administration claims was manned by narcotics traffickers. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said.
    


            ► Trump's promises to get tough with drugs traffickers who have caused great misery inside the US resonated with many voters last year. But the administration's unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress' authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. It places the United States in a category of nations that mock the rule of law and opens the door for others to do the same. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It's something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I'm not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but Congress should vote. The president shouldn't do this by himself.”
    


            ► Trump last week detailed his decision to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela, prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump stoked speculation of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn't “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won't be done nicely.”
    


            Curtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump's methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America's global reputation. His administration's refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress.
    


            The saga is unfolding as Hegseth's Defense Department has kicked out journalists who refused to sign the administration's draconian new press regulations. The civilian leadership of Pentagon looks scared of scrutiny — a position that risks eroding public support for the military. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration's determination to deploy troops on American soil.
    


            Trump aides tried to diminish and defame the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party's constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.”
    


            There is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. Demonstrators dressed as frogs, chickens and Statues of Liberty mocked the unhinged rhetoric of the administration about the protests just as effectively as the president's vulgar social media posts mocked them.
    


            “We have millions of people turning out today,” Colleen Connell, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. “There are clearly more of us than there are of those who want an autocracy or a dictatorship. And so the message is pretty clear that we, the people, you know, own this country and that we are going to respect the rule of law and we are going to stand up and we are going to protect our democracy with peaceful protest and peaceful dissent.”
    


            In time, Saturday's protests may come to be seen not just as a reaction to Trump's first nine months in power but as a harbinger of greater resistance to come.
    


            At the least, they show that while many of Trump's supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don't.
    


            And while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. This follows a warning by Obama on Marc Maron's final podcast that it wouldn't be a huge sacrifice for more Americans to make their views known a year before midterm elections. “We're not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said.
    


            Organizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that's true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.
    


            Retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”
    


            “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don't do anything about it,” Cole said.
    


            Asked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”
    


            That's a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.
    


            In some ways, Trump is proving the protesters' point.

President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal Monday at the White House, making good on U.S. interest in Australia's rich rare-earth resources as a potential counterpoint to China's new minerals export restrictions.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

It follows Beijing's new requirement for foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China, or were produced with Chinese technology.

The U.S. Trade Representative said this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain, making Australia's mining economy a key alternative for critical minerals sought by the U.S.

Trade and defense are also up for discussion, as Trump hasn't indicated publicly whether he'll continue the AUKUS security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during the Biden administration. The Pentagon is reviewing the agreement.

Asked about maintaining the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Trump said the U.S. will give the situation a “little chance” in hopes that there will be less violence.

Israeli forces on Sunday killed dozens in strikes in Gaza after it accused Hamas militants of killing two soldiers.Trump said Hamas must behave or face consequences.

“They have to be good, and if they're not good they'll be eradicated,” he said.

The president warned, “If they keep doing it, then we're going to go in and straighten it out, and it'll happen very quickly and pretty violently.”

Trump said he wasn't talking about U.S. boots on the ground, but some of the other countries that backed the ceasefire agreement.

Federal officials are in court in Chicago to take questions about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the region, which has produced more than 1,000 arrests as well as complaints that agents are increasingly using combative tactics.

The hearing comes a few days after a judge ordered uniformed immigration agents to wear body cameras, if available, and turn them on when engaged in arrests, frisks and building searches or when being deployed to protests.Each Border Patrol agent who is part of Operation Midway Blitz “now has a body-worn camera,” said Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis last week said she was a “little startled” after seeing TV images of street confrontations that involved tear gas and other tactics during the immigration sweep.

“The longer we loiter on a scene and subjects come, the situation gets more and more dangerous,” Harvick testified.

The president said he's “doing a little bit of a tour” of the continent.

“I'll be in Malaysia, I'll be in Japan,” he said. 

Trump previously committed to visiting South Korea, where he expects to meet with Xi.He also said he'll visit China “fairly early next year.”

“They could still win it,” Trump said of Ukraine. “I don't think they will. They could still win it. I never said they would win it. Anything can happen, you know war is a very strange thing.”

Trump on Friday called on Kyiv and Moscow to “stop where they are” and end their brutal war following a lengthy White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, another shift in his position on the war.

After meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could win back all the the territory they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who during his 2024 and much of the early going of his presidency insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war.

“We want to enact a bipartisan spending agreement, but it actually has to make life better for the American people, not continue policies that are hurting everyday Americans,” Hakeem Jeffries said of Democrats' stance in shutdown negotiations during an interview at the New York Economic Club.

Jeffries added that Republican claims that Democrats want to provide health care services to people in the U.S. illegally was “divorced from reality” and that Republicans “go-to refrain is waste, fraud and abuse, then you actually ask them to point out where's the waste, fraud and abuse, and it's crickets.”

He reiterated that Democrats' message on affordability, health care and alleged corruption would be the party's main messages heading into the 2026 midterm elections.Discussing the national debt, Jeffries said that “at minimum, divided government” was needed to reach a sustainable spending plan for the country.

The president says he'll soon meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and that he expects “we'll probably work out a very fair deal” with China. 

“I think we're going to work out something that's good for both countries,” Trump said. Beijing has not announced any plan for Xi to travel to South Korea, where Trump says he plans to meet the Chinese president, though it's not unusual for Beijing to make announcements closer to the date. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week spoke with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, and he's said the two sides would meet in Malaysia later this week to help prepare for a leaders summit.

The U.S. secretary of state and Russian foreign minister spoke by phone on Monday to discuss next steps toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war, following conversations last week between presidents Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Both of their ministries issued similar vague statements that the conversation built on understandings reached by Trump and Putin in their Oct. 16 call. 

After that, Trump said he expected to meet with Putin in the coming weeks and that Rubio would meet a high-level Russian delegation, presumably led by Lavrov, this week. Neither the U.S. or Russian statements mentioned when either of those meetings might happen or where.

The Russian statement described Rubio-Lavrov call as “constructive” while the U.S. statement said that Rubio had “emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war.”

China has removed Li Chenggang, who had co-led trade talks with the U.S., and appointed Li Yongjie as its international trade representative. It didn't offer any reason. 

Monday's personnel change comes just days after the U.S. side lashed out at Li Chenggang. In a rare public airing of displeasure, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said Li “showed up here with very incendiary language on August 28"", has “gone rogue” and was “very disrespectful.” 

“He showed up uninvited in Washington and said, quote, ‘China will cause global chaos if the port shipping fees go through,'” Bessent said. 

Bessent is scheduled to meet with the Chinese trade delegation later this week in Malaysia to prepare for a likely leaders' summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The former vice president says the Democrats are right to take a stand for saving the health care of the American people, particularly as they see how Trump's budget law will increase their premiums next year.

“Nov. 1, people are going to really start feeling it in a very painful way,” Harris told the Associated Press in an interview during her book tour. 

“When you talk about who's responsible for this predicament, understand that the Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they control the White House. They are in charge. And they are responsible for the shutdown.”

As reporters waited in a hallway to enter the Cabinet Room where Trump and Albanese will meet, they watched through a glass door as Trump showed off his wall of presidential portraits to the prime minister.

Trump had the portraits installed recently on the West Wing colonnade.

Reporters couldn't hear the conversation between the two leaders.

The U.S. president and Australian prime minister welcomed press into the Cabinet Room to announce that the two countries will sign a critical minerals deal.

Australia is rich in rare earth resources that the U.S. is eager to tap, as China imposes tougher export rules on its own critical minerals.

Trump said the agreement had been negotiated over several months.

Albanese stressed the close relationship between the two countries, and said the criminal minerals deal was “just taking it to the next level.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright says furloughs have begun at the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency tasked with overseeing the U.S. nuclear stockpile.

In a social media post Monday, Wright said the agency is furloughing federal employees “due to the Schumer shutdown,'' a reference to the government shutdown that began Oct. 1.

Wright said he is visiting the Nevada National Security Site Monday and will “ask Nevada's leaders to help us end this shutdown.”

The NNSA has said it could furlough up to 1,400 workers as a result of a funding lapse from the shutdown. Nearly 400 federal workers would remain on the job, along with NNSA contractors. The agency, a semi-autonomous branch of the Department of Energy, also works secure nuclear materials around the world.

Trump and Albanese both said they hoped to get “a lot” done during their meeting.

Asked for his message to the people of Australia, Trump said, “We love them.”

Both leaders are now inside the White House preparing to appear before members of the U.S. and Australian press corps.

The former director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who endeared himself to many Maine residents with folksy news conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic, announced a run for governor on Monday.

“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Dr. Nirav Shah said in a statement Monday. “I'll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that's not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that's struggling and will only get worse because of Trump.”

The epidemiologist led the state's pandemic response until he left for a high ranking post with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He resigned from that position earlier this year and took a faculty appointment at Colby College in Maine. He's running as a Democrat in a crowded race to replaced outgoing Gov. Janet Mills.

The Republican House speaker says it's time to make progress on government funding talks now that demonstrators have had their march against Trump. 

Johnson said the shutdown now on its 20th day has been about Chuck Schumer's survival, accusing the Senate minority leader of trying to appease the left and show he is fighting the Trump agenda.

“Now that Democrats have had their protests and publicity stunts, I just pray that they come to their senses and end this shutdown and reopen the government this week,” Johnson said.

The House has not held votes since it passed a short-term funding bill on September 19th. Johnson says the House has done its job and now it's up to the Senate to act.

Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States amid an increasingly angry back-and-forth between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

Colombia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Monday that Amb. Daniel García-Peña Jaramillo was already in Bogota.

Tensions increased Sunday when Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” and “a lunatic” after Petro had accused the U.S. government of killing a Colombian citizen in a Sept. 16 strike on a boat the U.S. said was allegedly carrying drugs. Petro said one of those aboard was a fisherman named Alejandro Carranza and that his boat was malfunctioning when hit.

American naval ships, fighter jets and drones are deployed in the region for what the administration has described as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels.

“The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children,” Petro wrote on his social media.

Metal shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell fell hit and damaged a California Highway Patrol vehicle as personnel at a U.S. Marine Corps base fired live rounds over a highway — against the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom — during weekend exercises observed by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, state authorities said Sunday. No one was injured. 

GOP Rep. Darrell Issa had called it “a spiteful publicity stunt” when Newsom strongly objected to the firing of munitions over Interstate 5 for safety reasons and ordered the highway closed between Los Angeles and San Diego during the drills. A spokesperson for Vance, William Martin, had issued a statement accusing Newsom of misleading the public about the safety risk.

The Supreme Court said on Monday that it will consider whether people who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own guns, the latest firearm case to come before the court since its 2022 decision expanding gun rights. 

Trump's administration asked the justices to revive a case against a Texas man charged with a felony because he allegedly had a gun in his home and acknowledged being a regular pot user. The Republican administration favors Second Amendment rights, but government attorneys argued that this ban is a justifiable restriction. 

The man's attorneys argue that the broadly written law puts millions of people at risk of technical violations since at least 20% of Americans have tried pot, according to government health data. About half of states legalized recreational marijuana, but it's still illegal under federal law.

The “No Kings” demonstrations that drew crowds to large cities and hundreds of smaller public spaces across the United States is giving protesters hope that resistance is growing to President Donald Trump's authoritarian rule.

Trump's Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as “Hate America” rallies, but the crowds were joyful and full of red-white-and-blue costumes, featuring marching bands, demonstrators in inflatable costumes and huge banners with the U.S. Constitution's “We The People” preamble that people could sign. 

People carrying signs with slogans such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” and “Resist Fascism.” It was the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House.

“Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press.

China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far beyond its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.

In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.

That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. “This rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,” he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his reportedly tense meeting with Trump on Friday was “positive” — even though he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine — and emphasized what he said is continued American interest in economic deals with Kyiv.

In comments embargoed until Monday morning, Zelenskyy said Trump reneged on the possibility of sending the long-range missiles to Ukraine, which would have been a major boost for Kyiv, following his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin hours before the White House meeting.

“In my opinion, he does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Sunday.

According to Zelenskyy, Trump said during their meeting that Putin's maximalist demand — that Ukraine cede the entirety of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions — was unchanged. Zelenskyy said Trump ultimately supported a freeze along the current front line, so his overall message “is positive” for Ukraine.

Americans are growing increasingly concerned about their ability to find a good job under Trump, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds. It's a potential warning sign for Republicans as a promised economic boom has given way to hiring freezes and elevated inflation.

High prices for groceries, housing and health care persist as a fear for many households, while rising electricity bills and the cost of gas at the pump are also sources of anxiety, according to the survey. Some 47% of U.S. adults are “not very” or “not at all confident” they could find a good job if they wanted to, an increase from 37% when the question was last asked in October 2023. And more than half say the cost of groceries is a “major” source of financial stress.

The lead defense attorney of former FBI Director James Comey could be removed from representing Comey in his federal criminal trial if prosecutors get their way. 

Lawyers filed a motion on Sunday night claiming that Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey's attorney, could have a conflict of interest resulting from actions in which he allegedly helped leak the former FBI director's memos to the media in 2017. 

Comey was indicted by a grand jury in September 2025 on two charges: one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. His indictment stems from his remarks to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 about the FBI's role in the investigation into President Donald Trump and Russian collusion. 

U.S Attorney Lindsey Halligan and assistant attorneys N. Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz requested U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff for an expedited ruling on the government's motion for the “implementation of a filter protocol” to analyze information about Fitzgerald's alleged connection to the leak of the memos, which included classified information. 

“The evidence for filter review could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for the current lead defense counsel, Patrick Fitzgerald,” prosecutors said, according to court documents.

A filter protocol permits lawyers to review evidence quickly for the “identification, segregation, and disclosure of potentially protected material.” Prosecutors asserted that such a step was necessary because such protected material could prove pertinent in Comey's trial and contain “exculpatory or inculpatory evidence relevant to the defense and the government.” 

​​”Based on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,” court documents read. The prosecution then cited the Justice Department's inspector general report as evidence to support its claim. 

Michael Horowitz, the inspector general at the time, claimed in his report that Comey “violated Department or FBI policy, or the terms of Comey's FBI Employment Agreement. As described in this report, we conclude that Comey's retention, handling, and dissemination of certain Memos violated Department and FBI policies, and his FBI Employment Agreement.” 

Horowitz eventually criminally referred Comey to the DOJ for his conduct, but the agency decided not to prosecute.

TRUMP REPUDIATES 25 YEARS OF FAILED DEMOCRACY PROMOTION

“This fact raises a question of conflict and disqualification for current lead defense counsel,” the filing read. “Some of the communications in the potentially protected material are from the same time as the focus of the DOJ OIG report. Before litigating any issue of conflict or disqualification, the parties should have access to all relevant and non-privileged information. The sooner that the potentially protected information is reviewed and filtered, the sooner the parties can make any appropriate filings with the Court.”

Comey's lawyers are slated to file their first motions in the case on Monday and are expected to request a dismissal, according to Politico. His trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 5, 2026, at the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

“Not a single federal dollar goes to providing health insurance for undocumented immigrants. NOT. ONE. PENNY.” These were the words of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in a recent X post, after Republicans accused Democrats of shutting down the government in order to keep funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) echoed this same talking point, insisting, “Federal law prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance in any way, shape or form, to undocumented immigrants. Period, full stop. And Democrats aren't trying to change that.”

FEDERAL AGENCY DIRECTS FURLOUGHED WORKERS TO BLAME DEMOCRATS FOR SHUTDOWN IN OUT-OF-OFFICE REPLY

But the truth is much more complicated. Federal money does indeed make it possible for states to extend Medicaid to millions of illegal immigrants. Democrats have shut down the government, in part, to keep things that way.

One of the methods states use to funnel federal dollars to healthcare for illegal immigrants is through “emergency” Medicaid. This is the part of the program intended to reimburse hospitals for providing emergency care to uninsured patients. In recent years, the amount of federal money used to provide such care to illegal immigrants has soared.

In 2020, emergency Medicaid spending on illegal immigrants was just $2.06 billion, according to the Foundation for Government Accountability. By 2024, that figure had ballooned to $6.15 billion — quite a bit more than one penny.

California is by far the chief offender, responsible for 74% of emergency Medicaid spending on illegal immigrants. The Golden State has even used emergency Medicaid funds to pay for managed care plans for undocumented immigrants — at a cost to federal taxpayers of nearly $373 million between October 2018 and June 2019.

At the beginning of 2024, all illegal immigrants in California became eligible for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, thanks to legislation signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). The state claims it only uses its own funds to cover the cost of coverage for undocumented immigrants. But it can only do so because of the massive amounts of federal Medicaid funding it uses to pay for benefits for the legal Medicaid population. 

In May 2025, there were 14.4 million Medi-Cal enrollees; of that number, 1.6 million were illegal immigrants. 

There are numerous other ways in which states provide Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants. Many are deemed to be “lawfully residing” in the United States, despite their undocumented status — and thus qualify for the program. Others have been granted qualified alien status by states, which also opens the door to federal Medicaid funding.

HERE ARE THE GROUPS TRUMP HAS DESIGNATED AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS

The Republicans' July budget reconciliation package took steps toward cracking down on such abuses of the program by restricting which undocumented immigrants can qualify for the program through “lawfully residing” status. It also requires more regular eligibility checks for Medicaid enrollees and enforces new penalties for states with high rates of improper Medicaid payments.

It's hard to know what is worse — that Democrats oppose such commonsense reforms, or that they are willing to mislead the public so brazenly.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) on Monday for not “doing their jobs” during the government shutdown while they attended “No Kings” rallies last weekend.

House Democrats have spent the last 20 days calling out their Republican colleagues for being on “vacation,” as Johnson has kept the House in recess for over a month. In a Monday press conference, the speaker turned their messaging around, following the No Kings rallies that took place across the country in protest of the Trump administration.

“They're either going to be celebrating with you, or they're going to be calling for new leadership,” Johnson said. 

“Now that's a direct threat to Chuck Schumer, and he heard the message, so did Hakeem Jeffries in the House, and that's why neither of them were here doing their jobs instead, they were out in New York and California,” he continued.

Both minority leaders attended the rallies that took place this weekend as the movement argues President Donald Trump is administering “absolute” power through gutting healthcare, sending Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to cities, and “rigging” election maps.

“I proudly marched side-by-side with labor unions and so many more of our fellow citizens in NYC,” Schumer wrote on X. “We have no dictators in America. And we won't allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy.”

The rallies across the country were held as the third longest government shutdown in U.S. history continues, a mere two weeks shy of the longest on record.

“This is now the third longest shutdown in history,” Johnson said, “and when you when you look at it carefully, it is now already the longest full shutdown of all time. You had an example in 2018 and you had one back in 1995 that were longer, but they were partial shutdowns because they only affected a part of the federal government.”

House Democrats have held press conferences in Washington over the last 20 days, claiming they are at the Capitol “ready to work,” while Republicans are “vacationing” as the government remains shutdown. 

RESTLESS HOUSE REPUBLICANS BEGIN TO DEFY JOHNSON'S SHUTDOWN RECESS

Leading lawmakers of both parties in the House and Senate have not met to negotiate since the end of last month, while the shutdown moves forward with no end in sight. The House-passed continuing resolution to fund the government through Nov. 21 sits in the upper chamber, where it has continuously failed to pass the 60-vote threshold.

Schumer has fought to keep enough of his Democratic caucus in line to force Republicans to strike a deal that meets Democratic demands on healthcare. So far, only Sen. Angus King (I-ME) and two Democrats have backed the GOP plan with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) looking to wear down the party by forcing continuous votes on the same short-term funding bill.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The problem with minimizing the city's violence

On a mild spring night in Chicago, a woman told her 18-year-old boyfriend she wanted money for a barbecue. He rounded up three teenage friends, each with a long criminal record, and, according to prosecutors, they donned masks, carried guns, and robbed four people, tossing two to the ground. They went searching for more victims in a stolen Kia; shortly after 1:30 a.m. they crossed paths with Aréanah Preston.

Preston, a police officer, had finished her shift and, still in uniform, parked across the street from her family home on the South Side. The 24-year-old was to receive a master's degree in law the following week. The police department viewed her as a future leader; the FBI had talked with her about a job. The young men in the Kia saw her as a target. They ran at her; a grainy security video shows muzzle flashes. Police and prosecutors say that at least two of the teenagers shot at Preston, who returned fire but was struck in the face and neck. One of the young men grabbed her firearm, and they fled.

Preston's mother, Dionne Mhoon, had been out with friends in the suburbs and arrived home to patrol cars and swirling red lights. An officer drove her, praying, to the University of Chicago hospital. In a private waiting room, a door opened, and the mayor and a trauma surgeon walked in. We're so sorry. We did all that we could. She was so brave, your daughter. Mhoon felt ruin. “I had poured so much love into her,” she told me in late September, as we sat in her office on Chicago's South Side, where she runs a day care. She grew up and raised her daughters there. “It was unreal. I never expected this outcome, never. I don't know what to make of this city.”

The story of this accomplished young Black woman slain in front of her family's home gripped me when I first read of it. Preston died in May 2023, but her killing remains a powerful symbol of Chicago's inability to solve its decades-long violent-crime problem. Mhoon and her daughter tried to ward off the violence around them but still couldn't avoid it. And Preston's own department failed her: The ShotSpotter sensor technology the city used marked the sound of eight shots and relayed the address to police dispatchers. Preston's smartwatch alerted dispatchers to what it detected as a “car crash” and also conveyed the address. Yet, on a busy night for the police, 31 minutes passed before an officer arrived and found Preston lying on the sidewalk. (The police department launched an investigation into the response time. I asked a spokesperson about the status but didn't get an answer by publication time.)

Preston's killing was particularly high-profile, but among America's cities with populations of more than 1 million, Chicago has, for decades, had among the highest rates of homicide. President Donald Trump has seized crudely upon this misfortune and recently described the city as a “killing field.” He has mocked the mayor, Brandon Johnson, and Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, and earlier this month he sent 500 National Guard troops to the Chicago area declaring that Johnson and Pritzker “should be in jail.” (Courts have temporarily blocked troops from deploying in the city.)

Democratic politicians have taken the president's bait. Chicago, they argue, is not as violent as it once was. Crime in some cities in Republican-run states is worse, and red-state gun stores sell many of the weapons that Chicago men slip into their belts and hoodies. Pritzker, who has said that Trump's threats against the city suggest that he has dementia, took a walk last month along the Chicago lakefront with an NBC reporter. The reporter recited a litany of recent shootings, and asked whether the governor would advise friends to ride the city's public transit at night. Pritzker waved that off. Trump “has no idea that crime has gone way down in the city of Chicago,” he said. (He added, “Every crime, of course, is a tragedy.”) Johnson recently angered many in Chicago, not least the state's attorney and police officers, when he insisted that “jails and incarceration and law enforcement is a sickness that has not led to safe communities.”

What these politicians refuse to acknowledge is that violent crime in Chicago remains a serious problem, as I heard from residents there on a visit last month. The number of homicides has indeed dropped from a recent peak of 805 in 2021, and stands at 347 so far this year. But New York City, with a population more than three times that of Chicago's, has recorded 255 homicides in 2025. The most recent homicide tally for Los Angeles, which has about a million more residents than Chicago, stood at 217. Chicago, in the same year that officials celebrated its “safest summer” in six decades, could end up roughly four times deadlier than New York and twice as deadly as Los Angeles. Chicago is deeply segregated, and homicides remain a plague for Black and Latino young men, who make up the great majority of the killed and the killers. A study of homicides in Chicago in 2020 and 2021, when the murder rate was even higher, found that young adult males who lived in the city's most violent zip codes faced a greater risk of gun death than U.S. soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. The homicide rates in the deadliest neighborhoods remain dozens of times higher than those of Chicago's safest, mostly upper-middle-class and white neighborhoods.

In total, Chicago registered more than 8,000 homicides from 2010 to 2024, and more than 41,000 Chicagoans were wounded by gunfire in that time. A modern gun is a potent instrument; bullets can hit thighs and arms, or tear holes in intestines and lungs, paralyzing victims from the waist down or leaving them with a colostomy bag permanently affixed to their side. Selwyn Rogers, a top-ranked trauma surgeon at the University of Chicago, wrote a 2023 article in The New England Journal of Medicine about what it was like to treat the terribly wounded: “I fantasize about other possible lives for these patients. What if they had never been shot? What if they had grown up in a safe neighborhood? What if they had a fair chance to live up to their potential?”

I reported on New York's crack and crime epidemic in the early 1990s, and on the wave of homicides in Washington, D.C., later in the decade. As violent crime fell dramatically in those cities and elsewhere, I wondered why Chicago remained so bloody by comparison. Disinvestment and industrial decline are part of the answer; these forces led about 1 million people to move out of the city over decades, and left many Black and Latino neighborhoods blighted and dangerous. Another is the ineffectiveness of the Chicago Police Department, which has moved far too slowly into the 21st century and has never managed to bring the city's gangs to heel. Perhaps most troubling of all, the city's political leadership—which Democrats have dominated for nearly a century—has tolerated disorder for far too long. Some politicians talk of killings as they might of the weather, an implacable force.

Few residents I spoke with said that they want to see the National Guard manning corners on the West and South Sides, although several parents of children who navigate risk-filled blocks to school told me that they did not object to that possibility as strenuously as politicians might imagine. There are far worse traumas. Mhoon recalled laying down rules for her daughters: home before dark, homework done, care for your neighbors and each other. Aréanah followed these rules and prospered. “She's been fearless since she was a little girl, and I loved that in her,” Mhoon said. “But all I did was worry.”

Walking the streets of the South and West Sides of Chicago, I passed several commercial stretches multiple blocks long where every storefront—what used to be butchers, hardware stores, dress shops—was boarded up and abandoned. Some residential blocks had handsome, well-tended homes. Others were so deserted that they had an almost rural character, with knee-high grasses and alders, red hickories, and oaks.

The commercial buildings of Chicago's Magnificent Mile feature an exhilarating blend of Art Deco and modern architecture. There are the beaches and marinas along the waters of Lake Michigan, the Art Institute, and the gentrified neighborhoods that run north through Wrigleyville to Evanston. But beyond those parts of the city, Chicago too often feels hollowed out. Its once-formidable manufacturing economy has fallen away, and although finance, insurance, and health care are strong industries, the population has decreased by nearly 900,000 since 1950. Black residents led the exodus. From 1980 to 2017, 391,000 Black Chicagoans left, greater than the population of Cleveland.

I walked two miles west from the 51st Street Green Line L stop to the Back of the Yards neighborhood, where the Union Stock Yards once stood, offering jobs to tens of thousands of immigrants and inspiring Carl Sandburg to write of the “stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders.” A map of the area produced by DePaul University researchers confirms what the eyes reveal: Today, Back of the Yards, across its roughly five square miles, has 478 city-owned vacant lots and another 2,000 or so privately owned vacant lots. Chicago as a whole has more than 40,000 vacant lots, about 9,000 of which are held by the city. Most of these lots are in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods, where years of disinvestment resulted in many thousands of foreclosed and abandoned homes. City officials, fearing that these homes posed a crime threat, were assiduous about tearing them down.

That decision, however, has contributed to physical disorder in these neighborhoods that, in turn, has led to a pervasive sense of menace and fear on many blocks. Chicago officials have talked of plans and more plans but have handed over relatively few vacant lots to local groups and developers, community leaders told me. “We have been cannibalizing our city for decades,” Richard Townsell, the longtime executive director of the nonprofit Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, told me. “It has been planned shrinkage, and it's asinine.”

Jens Ludwig, the director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, told me that efforts to rebuild the city's troubled neighborhoods might be the only social programs that truly matter in attacking violent crime. He pointed to a study in which an organization picked vacant lots at random in Philadelphia and cleaned and beautified them, putting up fences around many; crime fell around those same lots. “Changes to the built environment make a remarkable difference,” Ludwig said.

Townsell's organization is part of United Power for Action and Justice, a 38-member consortium of religious groups and neighborhood nonprofits that wants to build 2,000 new homes on the West and South Sides. For several years, organizers told me, members have pressured city officials to turn over some 600 lots for a dollar a piece. The group has raised more than $50 million and built and sold 57 affordable homes; another 150 are under construction. (An affiliated organization in New York, East Brooklyn Congregations, has built 5,000 affordable homes, opened public schools, and renovated parks. New homeowners applied pressure to police precincts to crack down on drug corners.)

In a former school building that now houses the Precious Blood Ministry of Reconciliation, a Catholic group that is a member of United Power and focuses on building relationships with families and youth scarred by violence, I met the director, David Kelly. A lean man with a baritone voice, Kelly, a priest, told me that he holds a monthly meeting with mothers and grandmothers. “We have over 100 mothers who have lost children to homicide,” he said. He explained how a desolate landscape amplifies the neighborhood's threats. “You have such open lands. There's no grocery store here, no Target, none of that stuff,” Kelly said. “And the kids know it's dangerous to walk anywhere. Why wouldn't they carry guns?”

Kelly introduced me to a young man named Joe Montgomery. He was polite and spoke softly. At 19, he had been sentenced to four years in prison for armed robbery. Now 28, he works as a lead mentor at Precious Blood, counseling younger boys. I asked him what it was like to grow up in Back of the Yards. “My friends, we all grew up around each other. We felt okay, right?” He paused. “Then, as time went on, you know, a lot of us died, right? And a lot of us went to jail.” The empty lots, the trees and tall grasses, do not register to him as bucolic. He still does not take casual walks or ride alone on the elevated trains (which were near empty when I got on at mid-evening). When he sees a car pull a U-turn or slow as it approaches, his nerves jump. “I had a childhood friend,” he told me. “She was standing on the sidewalk, and some people killed her. They weren't aiming at her, but, y'know, it's not like a bullet has anyone's name on it.”

He used to shrug this off as just a part of life. “Now I look back at it, like, and think, Goddamn, that's a traumatizing way to grow up.”

Chicago's recent drop in homicides has stirred much hope, and it feels unkind to sound a skeptical note. But the city has seen seemingly promising drops in homicides since the 1990s, only to watch violence flare up again.

Part of the problem is that the Chicago police have been slow to modernize. New York City and Los Angeles, thanks in part to leaders such as Bill Bratton and, early on, Raymond Kelly, diversified their forces, offered better training and accountability, and infused data analysis into crime fighting. Chicago is still “a long way behind” New York and L.A., Ludwig said. “Those cities show us that even in an ocean of gun availability, you can reduce gun violence dramatically.” Politics plays a role as well. In Chicago, which last elected a Republican mayor in 1927, police departments were often creatures of the Democratic political machine, not to mention a political force in their own right; the lack of political competition perhaps has given them less incentive to change.

The Chicago police, Ludwig added, have begun to use data in a sophisticated manner, and some police-district captains are learning to work better with local organizing groups. In August, the mayor's office said that the city's homicide clearance rate had leapt to an astonishing 77.4 percent. Still, earlier this year, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Chicago police claimed a high number of “exceptional clearances” for homicides; these were cases in which no arrest was made owing to the death of a suspect or because prosecutors declined to bring charges. Only about 25 percent of Chicago murders led to an arrest, the newspaper noted.

Read: A very, very expensive way to reduce crime

There is also the question of discipline. From 2019 to 2024, according to an analysis by the local PBS station, WTTW, the city spent $491.7 million to resolve lawsuits concerning 1,643 Chicago police officers who allegedly committed a wide range of misconduct, including false arrests and use of excessive force. A ProPublica report earlier this year found that the department frequently failed to investigate officers accused of sexual misconduct. A police department with a reputation for brutality alienates precisely the communities from which it needs support.

The city cannot rely on policing alone, a point often made by the mayor, who lives with his family in the Austin neighborhood, where gun violence runs high. Many neighborhoods on the South and West Sides of Chicago have long been dominated by gangs: the Vice Lords and Latin Kings, the Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples. Federal investigations have brought down leaders, but gangs in turn have fragmented into loose affiliations of young men laying claim to desolate turf. What sparks them to violence can be hard to pinpoint, former members told me. Some beefs are so old that younger gunmen lose track of the origin story. Social media plays a pernicious role. One group mocks another—a guy kisses another guy's girl on TikTok, say—and young men with guns start saying they want to “light up someone's ass,” as Montgomery put it.

In the past few years, city officials, philanthropists, businesses, and community-organizing groups have worked to short-circuit the impulse to pull out a gun and shoot a rival or just someone who annoys you. The notion is that violence interrupted is violence delayed, which opens an opportunity for an intervention. Arne Duncan played basketball as a teenager in gyms across the South Side and lost mentors to gun violence. He later served as Chicago's school chancellor and President Barack Obama's secretary of education. Of late, he runs Chicago CRED, which, along with many other community organizations, fields an army of more than 1,200 peacekeepers and violence interrupters. (Duncan is also a managing partner at Emerson Collective, the majority owner of The Atlantic.) CRED's work is challenging and can leave him sounding haunted. “In my seven years heading the schools, we lost a child every two weeks. Today I saw the mom of a child who had been killed on the bus going home,” he told me one evening. “Now I find myself trying to negotiate a gang peace with a 17-year-old.”

To work with these boys and men requires diplomatic skills and an appreciation for the blustering insecurities of young people. Cedric Hawkins is a CRED violence interrupter in the Roseland and West Pullman neighborhoods of the South Side. He has an easy swagger that speaks to his own decades on the street; he served a 10-year sentence in federal prison for dealing heroin and cocaine. He took me for a drive around the neighborhoods where he grew up and now works. Hawkins pointed to a corner where three teenagers had died, a bungalow once used as a drug traphouse, an avenue where seven young men died in a single shootout in 2020. He slowed his car as he eased it through the gully that was the site of his first gun bust, at age 12. Hawkins told me that he has lost eight cousins and an uncle to gun violence. He's the rare one who made it into his 40s.

When he got out of prison, he cast about for work. Some friends suggested peacekeeping. “They say, ‘You didn't tell on nobody. You took your sentence like a man. People respect you,'” he told me. “But to be honest, I was reluctant. I didn't want anything to mess up my negative credibility.” Once he tried mediating, his view of himself changed. He saw the work as compensation for all the pain he had brought to the world.

He explained his diplomatic arts. If groups are beefing, he tries to negotiate a nonaggression pact. “We're not saying you all got to love each other. Just agree to stay off each other's turf and play defense, cool?” This means that gang members agree not to cross a truce line. “You saw Trump trying to tell Ukraine what to do?” Hawkins said, wagging his head. He explained that the president was trying to dictate terms to warring parties. “That's not the way to do it. You let one side say what they can do, and you let the other side give their line.” When a nonaggression pact turns into a peace agreement between two gangs, Hawkins and CRED try to cement it with the promise of education, jobs, and therapy. The offer of therapy piqued my interest. Hawkins was surprised at my surprise. “Around here, we got trauma coming out of the womb,” he said.

I asked Duncan whether all of this could really work. Can former gangbangers—and the assumption that all are former gangbangers requires a leap of faith—actually help police tamp down homicides? He said he is aware that some peacekeepers might be a “foot and a half” away from their old lives. But he pointed to the city's recent decline in homicides as a promising sign. His hope is that peace begets peace, even as he harbors no illusion of a miracle. He mentioned New York's much lower violent-crime rate and said, “My goal is just to be normal for a big city.”

Nine days after Aréanah Preston's death, Johnson delivered his inaugural address as the new mayor. A candidate of the left, he had once described incarceration as a “racist system,” and promised during his campaign to end the ShotSpotter technology, which he argued is susceptible to human error and can encourage cops to act too quickly. (Johnson discontinued the city's use of the technology in 2024. A majority of alderpersons representing Black and Latino districts have voted to keep ShotSpotter, and some claim that the mayor is putting Black and Latino lives at risk. Surveys suggest that most Black and Latino residents also favored the technology.) In his speech, Johnson invoked Preston by first talking of Adam Toledo, an armed teenager who two years earlier had fled in the dark from a cop and was shot dead after dropping his gun. “The tears of Adam Toledo's parents are made of the same sorrow as the parents of Officer Preston's parents and relatives,” Johnson told a cheering crowd. (Johnson's office didn't respond to interview requests for this story.)

Read: Trump is right that D.C. has a serious crime problem

Johnson was correct when he said recently that National Guardsmen “occupying our city” would solve more or less nothing. Pritzker, too, was correct when he told the NBC reporter that big-city crime is inevitable, although that sidesteps the particular tragedy of Chicago's high homicide rate. The National Guard deployments, although significant for the country and our sense of our democracy, are in most respects a sideshow in Chicago. At the same time, Trump doesn't entirely miss the mark when he lambastes generations of political indifference to so much suffering. When he deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C., crime fell.

What is striking, infuriating even, is that Dionne Mhoon speaks with more honesty and compassion than any one of these leaders about ending the city's violence epidemic. She is herself dubious that the National Guard can accomplish much. They are not, she told me, intimately familiar with Chicago's troubled communities. But she sees a deeper pain and deterioration that often goes unaddressed by politicians. When she went to watch the bond hearing for the young men charged with her daughter's murder, she told the press that she was praying for the accused even as she wanted them imprisoned. (All have pleaded not guilty, and their cases have yet to go to trial.) Afterward, she told me, family members and friends of those young men crowded around her, as if trying to draw her into a fight. (Two law-enforcement sources confirmed Mhoon's account to me.) She told me that she has received “dozens” of anonymous threatening phone calls and letters. At one point, the police department posted a patrol car outside her house for a month. “There has to be some accountability in the households. Like, we can't blame the mayor or the superintendent if your child is on the street at 11 p.m.,” she said. “Too many in our communities are detached from values and morals.”

Mhoon has started a foundation in honor of her daughter, with an emphasis, she told me, on reaching precisely the at-risk children who too often grow up to become victims and victimizers. She volunteers weekly at public schools on the South Side. She talks with young girls, telling them that they matter. She speaks with boys too, hoping to break the cycles of violence that claimed her daughter's life. “I talk about thinking about their choices, and their long-term effects, however hard that may seem,” she said. “Too many are clueless about love. They don't have it, and they don't know it.”

I asked whether her work offered any salve for her loss. She took off her glasses, rubbed her eyes, and shook her head. There's no healing, she said. “Even when I'm pumping gas, I look around and think, Do you know what I lost? You don't have a clue,” she said. “Then I hear every other day of another kid getting shot, and I wonder: How do we make it end?”

Bitcoin is staging a modest rebound after several days of intense selling pressure and fear across the market. The leading cryptocurrency has struggled to establish stable support, with volatile swings making it difficult for traders to navigate. Despite the uncertainty, some market participants continue to move strategically — and one of the most well-known whales has just made a big return.

The trader known as BitcoinOG (1011short) — who gained fame for earning over $197 million during last week's flash crash — is back in action. On-chain data shows that he has deposited $30 million in USDC to Hyperliquid and opened a 10x short position on 700 BTC, worth roughly $75.5 million.

This move has drawn the market's attention, reigniting speculation about whether the whale anticipates another leg down for Bitcoin. While BTC is attempting to recover above the $110,000 mark, the presence of such a large short position highlights lingering bearish sentiment and a lack of conviction among traders. For now, bulls are fighting to stabilize price momentum, but with whales like 1011short back in the game, volatility is likely far from over — and the market may be in for another sharp move soon.

Whale's Short in Profit as Market Tension Rises

According to Lookonchain, the whale known as BitcoinOG (1011short) currently holds an unrealized profit of about $880,000, or roughly 11%, on his latest $75.5 million short position opened on Hyperliquid. The trade, placed during Bitcoin's rebound phase, has quickly gained traction as BTC struggles to sustain momentum above the $111,000 level. This move has sparked unease among investors and traders alike, many of whom view it as a potential warning sign that larger players may be positioning for renewed downside pressure.

Still, analysts warn that this might not tell the full story. While the 1011short address has earned a reputation for precision — notably pocketing $197 million during the October 10 flash crash — the transparency of on-chain data has limits. It's unclear how many positions this whale currently holds across other exchanges or what the exact strategy behind his trades may be. As such, reading his moves as a simple bearish bet could be an oversimplification.

The next few days will be critical for Bitcoin's trajectory. If the whale decides to scale his short further, it could intensify selling pressure and drag BTC toward key support levels. Conversely, if he closes out the position or pivots to longs, it might suggest a short-term market bottom. Either way, the setup points to heightened volatility ahead, with traders bracing for sharp price movements as the market digests this high-profile activity.

Bitcoin Holds Weekly Support, but Resistance Looms

Bitcoin is showing early signs of stabilization on the weekly chart, recovering from its October 10 flash crash low near $103,000 to trade around $111,200. The candle structure suggests that buyers are defending the 50-week moving average (blue line), which has acted as a reliable mid-cycle support throughout the current bull phase.

However, the broader structure still shows Bitcoin consolidating below the $117,500 resistance — a level that has repeatedly capped rallies since mid-2025. Until BTC breaks above this zone with strong volume, the market remains trapped in a sideways range, with traders positioning cautiously amid high volatility and uncertain macro conditions.

Momentum indicators point to neutral-to-bearish sentiment, reflecting hesitation among bulls after weeks of heavy liquidations. Yet, the presence of higher lows on the weekly chart continues to support the long-term bullish structure, as long as BTC holds above $106,000–$107,000.

If price manages to reclaim and close above $117,500, the path could open toward $125,000–$130,000, aligning with liquidity pockets from previous tops. Conversely, a weekly close below $106,000 would shift the outlook bearish, suggesting deeper corrections ahead.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The recent flash crash that led to liquidations of roughly $19 billion not only proved that crypto can still be extremely volatile — it also proved the digital assets ecosystem can survive shocks, TD Cowen analysts said in a note on Monday.

""While cognizant that the recent episode caused intense financial hardship for many investors, what strikes us is how well the underlying ecosystem functioned,"" analysts wrote. ""Though it was the largest single-day liquidation ever, with open interest halved across venues, most crypto exchanges operated with little or no downtime.""

Earlier this month, after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed he would impose a 100% tariff on imports from China the total crypto market fell over 10%. First crypto liquidations quickly hit $10 billion before later climbing to nearly $20 billion.

""While less-reputable tokens were decimated, Bitcoin and Ethereum held up well enough, in our estimation. Bitcoin for example briefly reached a trough of down 15% only to close down just 8% on the day,"" the analysts also said Monday.

TD Cowen analysts are bullish on BTC, predicting the price of bitcoin will hit about $141,000 by December.

Aside from crediting crypto for its resilience, the analysts pointed to data showing that global adoption of Bitcoin ""continues apace."" For instance, TD Cowen analysts said that in Japan the number of registered accounts holding digital assets has quadrupled to over 7.9 million. 

""The growth has led its Financial Services Agency to reconsider the country's longstanding prohibition on banks investing in digital assets like bitcoin,"" the analysts said.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury company led by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, extended its ether ETH$3,952.94 buying streak purchasing over 200,000 tokens, roughly $800 million, through last week.

After the latest purchase, the company held $13.4 billion in combined crypto, equity and cash assets as of Sunday evening, it said in a press release. That includes over $219 million in unencumbered cash, 192 bitcoin BTC$110,379.79 and a $119 million equity stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS). The ETH portion accounted for the majority of BitMine's holdings, now standing at 3.24 million tokens, worth a bit over $13 billion at current prices. That's about 2.7% of the total ETH supply, with the firm's ambition to reach 5%.

Bitmine's stock gained 8% as crypto prices modestly bounced over the weekend.

The latest purchase means that the firm bought roughly $1.6 billion in ETH over the past two weeks as crypto prices tumbled, culminating in a dramatic crash on October 10. The company saw the correction a buying opportunity as the ""price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward,"" chairman Thomas Lee said.

Lee also said last week that the ""bubble"" of digital asset treasury firms might have already burst with many recently launched companies trading below the net asset value of their holdings. BMNR is still holding on to a slight premium to its holdings, Blockworks data shows.

Ethereum treasury BitMine Immersion bought the dip, snapping up 203,826 ETH last week to bring its current holdings to over 3.2 million digital coins—worth more than $13 billion based on early Monday's price. 

The NYSE-listed firm said it now holds 3,236,014 ETH bought at an average price of $4,022 per coin. Bitmine stock rose by nearly 9% Monday morning New York time. 

BitMine Immersion, which has the largest Ethereum treasury of any publicly traded firm and the second-largest overall crypto treasury, also said it owns 192 Bitcoins worth $21.3 million. 

ETH was recently priced at nearly $4,038 per coin after a rocky few days, dropping last week to as low as $3,709, its lowest mark in two months, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. 

In a statement, BitMine Chairman and Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner Tom Lee noted ETH's price drop, part of a wider crypto market swoon last week. 

""The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices,"" he said. 


In a Myriad market, nearly 60% of respondents believe that ETH will hit $5,000 before gold does. (Myriad Markets is a product of DASTAN, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Crypto markets got hit hard on October 11 after President Trump announced new trade tariffs on China. Over $19 billion in largely leveraged crypto futures positions were liquidated and the prices of many digital coins and tokens plunged. 

Major coins and tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum have since recovered some ground but are still well below their all-time highs. 

Lee is the force behind BitMine's ETH buying strategy, which gives investors exposure to the token without the burdens of holding it directly. BitMine is aiming to acquire 5% of the total ETH supply. 

Lee has long been bullish on Bitcoin, but in June said that Ethereum was rallying and could be the ""next Bitcoin"" as institutional investor interest in the digital coin and its network soared. Spot Ethereum ETFs have generated more than $14.6 billion in investments with most of those occurring in recent months.

Many cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin or Solana, known as altcoins, are waiting for approval by the SEC to be traded as exchange-traded funds. But with the government shutdown, that wait could be a lot longer.


The perpetual financial rollercoaster otherwise known as crypto has taken another dip. Bitcoin is well off the all-time high of $126,000 it reached earlier this month and is now trading at around $111,000. 

A recent crypto flash crash spelled even more turmoil for so-called “altcoins,” the less famous non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin or Solana.

Thing is, even if you haven't heard of them yet, those altcoins are poised to take a step into the financial mainstream.

Glauber Contessoto has had better weeks. “OK, over the last week, I am down $312,000 — no, $330,000 — on Dogecoin specifically,” he said.

Contessoto is a professional crypto investor. He made his first million by pouring his life savings into Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency based on an internet dog meme.

But Dogecoin has spiked and tumbled and spiked before, and Contessoto thinks there's a reason for another spike coming soon: Dogecoin ETFs.

“That would be really bullish for Dogecoin,” he said. It would be on news headlines, we would probably see a pump on the price.”

ETF stands for exchange-traded fund. You can think of them as an easy way to invest in crypto from the comfort of your Charles Schwab or Robinhood account — no interaction with the blockchain required.

The SEC approved the very first crypto ETFs early last year for Bitcoin.

“Bitcoin ETFs saw around $50 billion in aggregate in inflows, just in the first year,” said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, a crypto asset manager. “So these were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time.”

Since the crypto-friendly Trump administration took over, applications for altcoin ETFs have surged. Over 130 are right now waiting for SEC approval, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — although they may be waiting a bit longer than expected.

“The government shutdown has delayed the approval of a variety of altcoin ETFs,” Pandl said. “And we hope that that process can pick right back up as soon as the government reopens.”

Assuming the government does re-open, individual investors may soon have new crypto options in their brokerage accounts or 401(k)s.

Duke University crypto researcher Lee Reiners, however, worries that altcoin ETFs may give investors a false sense of security.

“Just because it's in a familiar wrapper — in this case, an ETF — does not mean that it is somehow safe or cannot go down significantly,” he said.

Reiners doesn't expect altcoin ETFs to cause broader financial market chaos, but he does think some people may invest in things they don't really understand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin and Quantum Computing: Nic Carter Explains the Threat and What To Do Next","https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/10/20/quantum-computing-is-biggest-risk-to-bitcoin-says-coin-metrics-co-founder","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:18:25 GMT","

Nic Carter says quantum computing is the biggest long-term risk to bitcoin's core cryptography and urges developers to treat it with urgency, not as science fiction.

In an essay published Monday, the Coin Metrics cofounder explains in plain language how bitcoin's keys work and why quantum matters. Carter writes that users start with a secret number (a private key) and derive a public key with elliptic-curve math on the secp256k1 curve, the basis for ECDSA and Schnorr signatures. 

He describes that transformation as deliberately one way: easy to compute forward, infeasible to reverse under classical assumptions. “Bitcoin's entire cryptographic premise is ‘there exists a one-way function that's easy to compute in one direction, and infeasible to invert,'” he writes.

To build intuition, Carter likens the system to a giant number scrambler. Going from private to public is efficient for honest users, he says, because they can use a shortcut known as “double and add” to reach a result quickly. He adds there is no comparable shortcut in the opposite direction. 

For non-specialists, he offers a deck-shuffle analogy: you can repeat the same sequence of shuffles to reach an identical final order, but an observer cannot look at the shuffled deck and infer how many shuffles were used.

Carter argues the concern is that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could erode that asymmetry by making progress on the discrete logarithm problem that underpins bitcoin's signatures. In his telling, routine network behavior also raises exposure: when coins are spent, a public key is revealed on-chain. 

He says that is safe today because converting a revealed public key back to the private key is not practical, but quantum advances could change that calculus, especially if addresses are reused and more keys remain visible for longer.

He is not calling for panic. Carter says the point is to plan. 

Near term, he highlights basic hygiene such as avoiding address reuse so public keys are not exposed longer than necessary. Longer term, he urges the community to prioritize post-quantum signature schemes and realistic migration paths, framing them as engineering work rather than a distant thought experiment.

The essay is the first in a short series; Carter said on X that parts II and III will arrive in the next couple of weeks and will cover “post-quantum break scenarios.”

The breakthrough could lead to more durable—and drastically safer—buildings.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists are always looking for ways to make inherently brittle materials, such as concrete or ceramic, tougher, safer, and more durable. This time, they found inspiration from one of the most unlikely of places—the extra-durable shells of oysters. 

Once again, mother nature provides. 

One of the most well-known attributes of these saltwater bivalve mollusks is the iridescent composite material nacre—also known as “mother of pearl”—that lines the animal's inner shell layer. Although this material has long been featured in jewelry shops around the world, nacre is also an architectural wonder. It contains microscopic hexagonal “tablets” made of aragonite (one of the most common, naturally occurring forms of calcium carbonate) held together by soft biopolymer, kind of like an organic glue. 

With the aragonite providing strength and the biopolymer providing flexibility, nacre is incredibly flexible and crack resistant—so much so that scientists from Princeton University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering wondered if this mollusk maneuver honed by half a billion years of evolution could imbue similar benefits to human building materials. The results of their study were published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. 

“This synergy between the hard and soft components is crucial to nacre's remarkable mechanical properties,” Shashank Gupta, a co-author of the study and graduate student at Princeton, said in a press statement. “If we can engineer concrete to resist crack propagation, we can make it tougher, safer and more durable.”

To achieve this lofty goal, Gupta's team crafted three types of multi-layered beams of material that alternated between cement paste sheets and a thin polymer layer. The first beam was made of these two ingredients stacked on top of one another, but the other two beams were slightly different. The first featured hexagonal grooves in the cement paste, while the second cut through the cement completely, forming hexagonal-shaped plates or “tablets.” All three beams were compared to a cast cement paste reference beam (i.e. no polymer layers or hexagonal markings at all). 

The resulting experiments proved that, while the reference beam was brittle with no ductility, all three beams showed significantly increased ductility and toughness. However, according to the researchers, it was the multi-layered beam featuring those nacre-like hexagonal plates that was the most remarkable. By matching the mechanics of microscopic nacre, the beam delivered 17 times greater toughness and 19 times more ductility than the cast cement—all while maintaining as much strength as the reference beam.

“Our bio-inspired approach is not to simply mimic nature's microstructure but to learn from the underlying principles and use that to inform the engineering of human-made materials. One of the key mechanisms that makes a nacreous shell tough is the sliding of the tablet at the nanometer level,” ​​Reza Moini, a coauthor of the study, said in a press statement. “In other words, we intentionally engineer defects in the brittle materials as a way to make them stronger by design.”

Stronger and safer cement wouldn't just be a boon for construction, but also the health of the planet, as the production of cement makes up roughly 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But while the study shows promising results for these nacre-inspired materials, this multi-layered, hexagonal-plated technique will need a bit more tweaking before construction companies start trading out mortar for mollusks.

An electrical device implanted under the retina helps to restore some visual acuity to people with age-related macular degeneration.Credit: Science Corporation

Scientists have used an eye implant to improve the vision of dozens of people left functionally blind by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The implant, which measures 2 millimetres by 2 millimetres, and is just 30 micrometres thick, is surgically inserted beneath the retina to replace the light-sensitive cells that have been lost to the disease.

The clinical trial, which is described today in The New England Journal of Medicine1, involved 38 people with advanced AMD whose retinas had degenerated severely. One year after device implantation, 80% of participants had gained a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision.

“Where this dead retina was a complete blind spot, vision was restored,” says trial leader Frank Holz, an ophthalmologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. “Patients could read letters, they could read words, and they could function in their daily life.”

Despite some minor events related to implantation surgery, the trial's safety-monitoring board viewed the device's benefits as outweighing its risks. In June, the device's owners — the San Francisco-based neurotechnology company Science Corporation — applied for certification that would allow the device to be sold on the European market.

“I think this is an exciting and significant study, which has been well-designed and analysed. It gives hope for providing vision in patients for whom this was more ‘science-fiction' than reality,” says Francesca Cordeiro, an ophthalmologist at Imperial College London.

AMD is the commonest form of incurable blindness in older people. There are two main types, wet and dry AMD. The current work studied people with dry AMD, the advanced form of which affects around 5 million people globally. In dry AMD, the central retina's light-sensitive cells die over a period of years, leaving affected individuals with intact peripheral vision but without their high-acuity central vision. “They can't recognize faces, they can't read, they can't drive a car, they can't watch television,” says Holz.

The light-sensitive cells that die (rods and cones) convert light into electrochemical signals that are conveyed to other types of retinal neurons, which then send messages to the brain's visual-processing regions. Because retinal neurons survive AMD, scientists reasoned that a light-sensitive implant that electrically stimulates the retina according to the pattern of photons striking it could reinstate a sense of vision.

The implant, termed PRIMA — for photovoltaic retina implant microarray — was originally developed by the Paris-based company Pixium Vision, and was acquired by Science Corporation last year. It is wireless, unlike previous retinal devices. And, being photovoltaic, the photons that activate it also provide the energy source for generating its electrical output.

It is used in combination with glasses that contain a camera that captures images and converts them into patterns of infrared light that they transmit to the retinal implant.

The system, which allows users to zoom in and out on target objects, and adjust contrast and brightness, does, Holz says, take months of intensive training to use optimally.

In the current study, 38 individuals were treated at 17 clinical sites across 5 European countries, and 32 of the participants were tested a year after implantation. Twenty-six of them had a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision — which, on average, amounted to being able to see two lines further down a standard eye test chart of letters. Overall, most participants' vision came close to the resolution achievable with PRIMA.

By the study's end, most recipients were using PRIMA at home to read letters, words and numbers. Of the 32, 22 said that their user satisfaction was medium to high.

Transient star-like objects of unknown origin have been identified in the first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) conducted prior to the first artificial satellite. We tested speculative hypotheses that some transients are related to nuclear weapons testing or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reports. A dataset comprising daily data (11/19/49—4/28/57) regarding identified transients, nuclear testing, and UAP reports was created (n = 2,718 days). Results revealed significant (p = .008) associations between nuclear testing and observed transients, with transients 45% more likely on dates within + /- 1 day of nuclear testing. For days on which at least one transient was identified, significant associations were noted between total number of transients and total number of independent UAP reports per date (p = 0.015). For every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in number of transients identified. Small but significant (p = .008) associations between nuclear testing and number of UAP reports were also noted. Findings suggest associations beyond chance between occurrence of transients and both nuclear testing and UAP reports. These findings may help elucidate the nature of POSS-I transients and strengthen empirical support for the UAP phenomenon.

Transient star-like objects have been identified in sky surveys conducted prior to the launch of the first artificial satellite on October 4, 19571,2. These short-lived transients (lasting less than one exposure time of 50 min) have point spread functions and are absent in images taken shortly before the transients appear and in all images from subsequent surveys3. As reported previously in this journal3, in some cases multiple transients appear in a single image, exhibiting characteristics not easily accounted for by prosaic explanations (e.g., gravitational lensing, gamma ray bursts, fragmenting asteroids, plate defects)3,4. We have identified numerous transients in the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) as well as in other sky surveys as part of the Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project1,2,3.

The source of the transients identified remains unknown and cannot be directly tested due to their historical nature. Nonetheless, examination of contemporaneous correlates of these transients may provide information useful for elucidating their possible origin. Systematic research of this type has not previously been conducted. However, anecdotal reports suggest speculative hypotheses regarding possible correlates of transients for which sufficient data are available to enable empirical testing.

Possible associations of transients with nuclear weapons testing might be considered for two reasons. From 1951 until the launch of Sputnik in 1957, at least 124 above-ground nuclear tests were conducted by the United States (U.S.), Soviet Union, and Great Britain. In some circumstances, nuclear radiation is known to cause a visible glow (i.e., Cherenkov radiation)5. This phenomenon can be observed in the atmosphere in response to high energy particles (e.g., gamma rays), although it is influenced by both particle energies and atmospheric density6. Consistent with this concept, glowing “fireballs” in the sky were reported in multiple instances to occur shortly after nuclear tests in locations where significant nuclear fallout was expected7,8. Based on such observations, we hypothesize that some transients might represent an unrecognized atmospheric effect of nuclear testing. Alternatively, it is also possible that fallout from nuclear testing may itself cause direct contamination of astronomical photographic plates, with a characteristic appearance of fogged spots noted on X-Ray sensitive photographic film9. We also considered a very different potential reason for links between nuclear testing and transients. Contemporaneous newspaper accounts and records from the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of what are now called Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) indicate that unusual, apparently metallic objects of unknown origin were reported in the sky on multiple occasions on dates immediately before, during, and after nuclear weapons tests7. UAP have often been reported at nuclear power plants and sites involved in nuclear weapons production as well7,10. We hypothesized that if UAP seen during nuclear tests were metallic, they might reflect sunlight (or possibly emit light directly) and thus appear as transients if they were in geosynchronous orbits immediately before or after their appearance during nuclear testing.

In an extension of this latter hypothesis, transients might also be associated with witness reports of UAP more broadly, outside of the nuclear testing context. Consistent with this, we note POSS-I images from July 19, 1952 and July 27, 1952, each of which exhibit multiple bright transients (see Fig. 1)4,11. These dates coincide with two consecutive weekends during which multiple UAP were observed for several hours both visually and on radar over Washington, D.C.11,12. We speculate that some transients could potentially be UAP in Earth orbit that, if descending into the atmosphere, might provide the stimulus for some UAP sightings.

Four exposures of the 3 × 3 arcmin region of sky centered on the triple transient identified in July 1952. Upper left: The POSS I red image on July 19, 1952 at 8:52 (UT) containing the triple transient just above center. Upper right: A 10 m exposure POSS I blue image of the same region taken immediately afterward with no evidence of the triple transient. Lower left and right: POSS I red (left) and blue (right) images taken two months later (September 14, 1952) showing the transient still gone. 

In the current study, we conducted a preliminary test of the speculative hypotheses above using a database we have created of > 100,000 transients identified in POSS-I survey images (see Methods). Each of these transients does not appear in a POSS-I image taken shortly before or in images from subsequent surveys. We examined associations of both the presence of any transient (Yes/No) and the number of transients (across the entire sky) identified on each date with: 1) dates of above-ground nuclear testing (from publicly available sources) and 2) reports of at least one UAP on that date (Yes/No) and the total number of independent UAP reported on that date in a comprehensive database of UAP witness reports (UFOCAT; see Methods). While we anticipated significant noise in the UAP sighting data (e.g., due to witness error) and potentially in the transient data as well (e.g., misidentifications related to dust, cosmic radiation, etc.), we believed it was important to subject these novel hypotheses to direct empirical test to provide a preliminary evaluation of possible associations between observed transients and both nuclear testing and UAP sightings.

Transient data were available for the period November 19, 1949 – April 28, 1957, inclusive, with the latter date more than 5 months prior to the launch of the first artificial satellite (Sputnik). Of the 2,718 days in this period, transients were observed on 310 days (11.4%). In the overall sample, the number of transients per date ranged from 0 to 4,528 (across multiple locations on multiple plates), with 5% trimmed mean = 10.09 and median = 0.0. The distribution of number of transients per date was highly right-skewed (skewness = 10.35) and over-dispersed (variance = 28,938.64).

Above-ground nuclear weapons tests (U.S., Soviet, and British) were conducted on 124 days (4.6%) during the study period. UAP reports were recorded in the UFOCAT database on 2,428 days during the study period (89.3%). For days on which at least one UAP sighting was reported, the 5% trimmed mean number of independent sightings (i.e., in different states or countries) was 3.77, with a median of 3.0 sighting reports. The number of UAP reports was significantly higher within a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 3.68) than outside of a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 3.31; Mann–Whitney U = 447,057, p = 0.008), suggesting some degree of association between these two outcomes.

We first tested for possible associations between occurrence of transients and nuclear weapons tests. The primary nuclear testing outcome reflected a window comprising the test date + /- 1 day (see Methods). Potential associations with transients were tested in two ways. Table 1 displays a 2 X 2 crosstabulation portraying whether each date was within a nuclear testing window (Yes/No) by whether any transient was observed on that date (Yes/No). Transients occurred significantly more often within a nuclear testing window than outside of a nuclear testing window, Chi-Square (1) = 6.94, p = 0.008. We note that 15.6% of nuclear test dates were associated with at least one transient whereas only 10.8% of dates outside of a nuclear testing window were associated with a transient. Our findings indicated that the relative risk ratio for a transient to occur when within a nuclear test window (relative to being outside of a nuclear test window) was 1.45 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.10 – 1.90). Thus, a transient was 45% more likely to be observed on dates within a nuclear test window (day of test + /- 1 day) compared to dates outside of a nuclear test window.

Follow-up secondary analyses were then conducted to examine in more granular fashion the timing of the association between nuclear testing and occurrence of transients. Table 2 summarizes the association between occurrence of transients and different time windows relative to nuclear testing, ranging from 2 days before a test until 2 days after a test. The only association that reached statistical significance was for the association in which transients occur 1 day after nuclear testing. Transients were observed on 18.5% of days that were 1 day following a nuclear test, whereas transients were noted on only 11.0% of days not meeting this criterion. These findings indicate that the chances of observing a transient were 68% higher on the day following a nuclear test compared to days unassociated with nuclear testing.

Beyond dichotomous occurrence of transients, we also tested for differences in the total number of transients observed on a given date as a function of whether that date fell within a nuclear testing window. Significantly more transients were observed on dates within a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 23.40) than outside of a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 8.55; Mann–Whitney U = 431,649.5, p = 0.007).

Because UAP reports were so common (at least one report on 89.3% of study dates), examination of possible links between transients and UAP sightings as dichotomous measures was of limited value (this test was not significant; Chi-Square = 2.43, p = 0.12). Instead, statistically more powerful analyses based on continuous measures were used to test associations between the number of UAP reports and number of transients observed on a given date. These analyses employed two approaches. The first approach simply examined the correlation between number of transients and number of UAP sighting reports on a given night. This analysis was restricted to dates on which at least one transient occurred (n = 310), an analysis that eliminates the substantial bias due to the large number of zero values in the transient data (there were no transients observed on 88.5% of the days in the dataset). This simple analysis revealed a very small but statistically significant association (i.e., beyond chance) between the total number of transients and total UAP reports on a given date (Spearman's rho = 0.138, p = 0.015). A scatterplot of this association is presented in Fig. 2.

Scatterplot of total number of transients identified by total number of independent UAP reports for dates on which at least one transient occurred (n = 310). Both variables have been log10 transformed to enhance scaling for clarity.

To address limitations of the simple correlation analysis approach above, we employed a second and statistically more powerful analytic approach to test our transient-UAP hypothesis in a manner that utilized all of the information available in the data. That is, we observed that the total number of transients per date was highly right-skewed and over-dispersed, approximating a negative binomial distribution. We therefore used Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analyses specifying a negative binomial distribution to test associations between number of UAP reports and number of transients each day in the overall sample. Model fit was good (Chi Square = 18.50). Results revealed a significant positive association between number of UAP reported and number of transients observed (Beta = 0.081, Standard Error = 0.006, p < 0.001). The exponentiated parameter estimate [Exp(B)] = 1.085] indicated that for every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in the number of transients observed.

Finally, because both nuclear testing and UAP reports were individually associated with transients, we also explored whether their linear combination was associated with total number of transients (i.e., are the observed associations additive?). We created a new categorical variable coded as follows: 0 = No UAP on that date and the date was not within a nuclear testing window, 1 = At least one UAP report that date or the date was within a nuclear testing window, and 2 = At least one UAP report that date and the date was within a nuclear testing window. The dependent variable was total number of transients for each date, so for reasons described above we again used a GLM analysis specifying a negative binomial distribution. Results were statistically significant, Beta = 1.073, Standard Error = 0.0834, p < 0.001. Estimated marginal means (with 95% confidence intervals) for each group are presented in Table 3. Dates with no UAP reports that were not within a nuclear testing window were associated with the fewest total transients whereas dates with at least one UAP report and that were within a nuclear testing window displayed the highest total number of transients. All pairwise differences between these individual groups were significant (p's < 0.001) and the 95% confidence intervals for each did not overlap. The overall pattern of results suggests that associations of UAP reports and nuclear testing with number of observed transients may be additive.

This study provided a preliminary test of hypothesized associations between short-lived star-like transients identified in POSS-I sky survey images from 1949 and 1957 and both nuclear weapons testing and reports of UAP sightings. The study premise was that identifying contemporaneous correlates of transients might help elucidate their nature and origin, which currently is unknown. Our results revealed several intriguing statistical associations.

First, although not the primary study focus, we observed a small but statistically-significant association between nuclear weapons testing and increased UAP sightings. Significantly more UAP sightings were reported within nuclear weapons testing windows (test date + /- 1 day) than outside of testing windows. To our knowledge, this statistical association has not previously been reported in the peer-reviewed literature, although it is consistent with anecdotal reports of such associations7.

Next, in tests of our primary hypotheses, we found that both dichotomous occurrence of transients and the total number of transients observed on a given date were associated with nuclear testing beyond chance. Transients were 45% more likely to be observed on dates that were within a nuclear test window than on dates not in a nuclear test window. More granular examination of the temporal sequencing of these associations revealed that the strongest (and only significant) association was between nuclear testing and increased likelihood of a transient occurring one day after that test.

We also note an intriguing incidental finding regarding possible nuclear testing-transient links. The last date on which a transient was observed within a nuclear testing window in this dataset was March 17, 1956, despite there being an additional 38 above-ground nuclear tests in the subsequent 13 months of the study period. A prior study of associations between UAP reports and nuclear weapons-related production and assembly sites (excluding nuclear weapons tests) concluded that elevated UAP activity at such sites began in 1948, increased dramatically and continued through 1952, but then precipitously decreased in 1953 and remained low through 1975 (end of their study period)10. This sudden and sustained decrease in UAP reports at nuclear production facilities in 1953 occurred despite major new nuclear weapons production and assembly facilities coming online during that time (e.g., the Savannah River and Pantex sites)10. Taken together, the period between 1953 and 1956 seems to mark a shift in a multiyear pattern of apparent UAP-nuclear associations. While the meaning of these parallel decreases in UAP activity at both nuclear weapons production and testing locations in the mid-1950s is unclear, they may represent convergent evidence for the validity of associations between UAP and nuclear weapons-related activity.

Finally, our hypothesis of associations between transients and UAP reports was also supported. We detected a very small positive correlation, which was well beyond chance, between the number of transients observed and the number of UAP reported on a given date (Spearman's rho = 0.14). This association was observed when analyses were restricted to dates on which at least one transient occurred, an analysis mitigating the potentially significant bias resulting from the large proportion of dates (88.5%) on which no transients were observed. This finding supports our hypothesis of potentially meaningful associations between transients and UAP reports. Other analyses examining the full sample indicated that for every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in number of transients observed on that date. Overall, findings of this study support our speculative hypotheses that transients exhibit some degree of association with both nuclear testing and reports of UAP. Our results further suggest these associations are additive, with the largest number of transients seen for dates within a nuclear testing window on which at least one UAP was reported.

Our findings do not definitively indicate what transients are nor do they necessarily imply causal associations. However, our results do argue against several prosaic explanations for transients. Our overall pattern of results is clearly not consistent with the proposition that most transients are due to contamination or defects in photographic plates or scanned images, or to any other local confounds at the observatory itself. Contamination of photographic plates by nuclear fallout produces diffuse fogged spots quite different in appearance than the discrete star-like brightness profiles with point spread functions characteristic of transients3,9. These explanations would also not account for the association of transients with UAP reports from multiple locations distant from the observatory. Associations between transients and both UAP and nuclear testing reported in this study also cannot be plausibly attributed to any form of observer bias, as the existence of transients was unknown at the time they occurred and the dates/times of nuclear tests were generally unknown to the individuals who were reporting the UAP. Finally, the fact that transients were most likely to occur one day after a nuclear test (rather than the day of the test) argues against bomb debris ejected into the atmosphere as a plausible explanation.

Regarding what transients might be, our findings point toward two hypotheses that could account for associations of transients with both nuclear testing and UAP reports. The first involves an unexpected and previously undocumented atmospheric phenomenon triggered by nuclear detonations or related to nuclear fallout that may serve as a stimulus for some UAP reports and appear as transients on astronomical images. While the latter is potentially plausible, effects in the atmosphere (rather than geosynchronous orbit) would be likely to result in a streak on the image over the 50 min exposure, yet all transients appear as distinct point sources rather than streaks. Moreover, this hypothesis is made even more unlikely given that transients were most often observed one day after a nuclear test; such atmospheric phenomena would have to be sustained and remain localized in one location for approximately 24 h to account for the visual appearance of transients. The second hypothesis is more speculative, drawing on a well-known strand of UAP lore suggesting that nuclear weapons may attract UAP7,8. While this alleged connection has been claimed for decades based on anecdotal evidence, it has until now lacked any systematic supporting data. Within this latter hypothesis, our results could be viewed as indicating that transients are artificial, reflective objects either in high-altitude orbits around Earth13 or at high altitudes within the atmosphere. Whether and how this hypothesis might be further tested remains to be determined. Regardless of what transients are ultimately determined to be, our results add to growing evidence supporting the interpretation of transients as real observations1,3,13 rather than as emulsion defects.

The small magnitude of the significant associations reported must be addressed. Detection of these small effects was enabled by the high statistical power resulting from the large sample size available. Several factors may have contributed to the small magnitude of the associations observed. These associations may have been limited in part by noise in the transient data. Automated methods were applied to identification of the > 100,000 transients comprising the data examined in this study. While a small subset of these have been subjected to manual confirmation, application of more sophisticated systematic validation methods employing artificial intelligence might reduce any misidentifications of transients and result in a higher signal to noise ratio, thereby increasing the magnitude of associations like those reported here. There is also undoubtedly substantial noise in the UAP data examined that could have minimized the size of observed associations. Witness reports are affected by various types of errors14,15,16 and reports in the UFOCAT database that provided UAP data for the current work have not been evaluated for validity in any systematic way. Additionally, the magnitude of the associations between transients and both nuclear tests and UAP might have been limited by the fact that the Palomar Observatory from which transients were observed only provides observations from a single geographic point, whereas nuclear weapons tests and UAP reports can occur worldwide. Finally, transients may be heterogeneous in nature and derived from multiple causes, limiting the magnitude of their association with any single correlate.

In conclusion, data obtained prior to launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957 reveal small but statistically-significant associations between short-lived star-like transients and both above-ground nuclear weapons testing and UAP sightings. Our findings provide additional empirical support for the validity of the UAP phenomenon and its potential connection to nuclear weapons activity, contributing data beyond eyewitness reports. The possibility that some transients may represent UAP events in orbit captured on photographic plates prior to the launch of the first artificial satellite cannot be ruled out. This study adds to the small peer-reviewed literature seeking to apply systematic scientific methods to the study of UAP-related data8,10,17,18,19,20. The ultimate importance of the associations reported in the current work for enhancing understanding of transients and UAP remains to be determined.

The initial transient dataset consisted of a list of 107,875 transients identified that occurred between 11/19/49 and 4/28/57. These transients were identified in publicly-available scanned images from the POSS-I survey available on the DSS Plate Finder website (https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_plate_finder). The process used to identify transients and eliminate misidentifications was conducted via an automated workflow detailed fully in Solano et al.1. In brief, transients were defined as distinct star-like point sources present in POSS-I E Red images that were absent both in images taken immediately prior to the POSS-I Red image and in all subsequent images. A final criterion for classifying an object as a transient was that there were no counterparts either in PanStarrs DR1 or Gaia DR3 at less than 5 arcsec.

This transient dataset contained the dates, times, and coordinates of each transient identified. For many dates, transients were noted in multiple images reflecting observations of different locations in the sky. The transient dataset (ASCII format) was converted to an SPSS for Windows data file that included a single line for each date on which at least one transient occurred, with a count variable created to summarize the total number of transients observed on each date.

An SPSS dataset was created from public sources which included the dates of all above-ground nuclear weapons tests during the study period. Tests conducted by the United States were identified from:

https://nnss.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DOE_NV-209_Rev16.pdf

Tests conducted by the Soviet Union were identified from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_the_Soviet_Union.

Tests conducted by Great Britain were identified from: https://chrc4veterans.uk/knowledge-hub/british-nuclear-weapons-testing/.

Anecdotal reports from individuals present during nuclear tests in the 1950's have variously reported UAP to be present at nuclear test sites before, during, and after nuclear tests7. Therefore, our primary outcome was a nuclear testing window variable (coded 1/0 for Yes/No) that indicated whether a given date fell within a 3-day window surrounding any nuclear test (test date + /- 1 day). This decision to use a 3-day window as the primary nuclear testing outcome was made while the authors were still blinded to the transient data. To permit subsequent examination of the temporal sequencing of transient associations with nuclear testing at a more granular level, we also created (post-hoc) several variables indicating whether a given date occurred at specific intervals relative to nuclear testing: 2 days before, 1 day before, day of testing, 1 day after, and 2 days after.

UAP witness report data were derived from the publicly-available comprehensive UFOCAT database maintained by the Center for UFO Studies (https://cufos.org/cufos-publications-databases/ufocat/). This database originated with the U.S. Air Force funded-University of Colorado UFO Study led by Dr. Edward Condon (1966–1968). It has been updated periodically since that time. It represents the most comprehensive publicly-available UAP sighting database covering the 1949–1957 period that was the focus of the current work. The original UFOCAT Microsoft Access database was imported into SPSS. This database contained many identical, duplicate entries (same date and location) obtained from different sources; only a single entry for each discrete report was retained. Next, to reduce the chances of duplicate reports of the same UAP described by separate witnesses on the same date and the same location (i.e., same state), only a single entry was retained in these cases. Finally, a variable reflecting the total count of UAP sightings reported from independent locations on each date was created.

The final analyzed dataset began with creation of an SPSS master file with a separate record for every date within the study period, 11/19/49 to 4/28/57 (n = 2,718 days). Then, the transient database, nuclear test database, and the UAP database were merged by date with this master file. Next, dichotomous variables (coded 1/0 for Yes/No) were created to indicate whether each date in the master file was associated with at least one transient and/or with at least one UAP report. Both dichotomous and continuous variables were available for the transient data (any transient Yes/No and total number of transients identified on each date) and for the UAP data (any UAP Yes/No and total number of independent UAP reports on each date). The nuclear testing variable was only available as a dichotomous index, that is, whether each date fell within a nuclear testing window (coded 1/0 for Yes/No).

All analyses were carried out using the SPSS for Windows Version 29 statistical package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). For testing associations between dichotomous variables [Nuclear Testing Window (Yes/No) versus Transient Observed (Yes/No)], chi-square tests were used. To aid in interpretation of the magnitude of the association between nuclear testing and transients, we adopted a relative risk approach like that commonly used in medical research. That is, we calculated the likelihood of a transient being observed (the “outcome”) based on whether its date was within a nuclear weapons testing window (the “exposure”). This relative risk ratio was calculated using an online calculator: https://www.medcalc.org/calc/relative_risk.php. Due to significantly non-normal distributions of the variables reflecting total number of transients and total number of UAP per night, differences in these variables as a function of nuclear testing were examined using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test. For characterizing the nature of group differences in these nonparametric tests, we present 5% trimmed means given the highly skewed distributions of these variables and that median values were generally uninformative (e.g., median total transients = 0). Also for distributional reasons, associations between these two continuous measures were tested using the nonparametric Spearman's rho correlation. To provide an interpretive context for the magnitude of the association between total number of transients and UAP reported per night, we conducted generalized linear model (GLM) analyses, specifying a negative binomial distribution given the highly right-skewed and over-dispersed nature of the transient data. The resulting exponentiated parameter estimate was then used to derive an estimate of the effect's magnitude (i.e., impact of number of UAP sightings on total transients observed that date) in terms of incidence rate ratio. For display purposes in Fig. 2, total transients and total UAP reports have both been log10 transformed (after adding a constant [+ 1] to avoid zero values) in order to optimize scaling in the figure.

The final analyzed SPSS dataset will be made available by the authors upon reasonable request to Dr. Stephen Bruehl (stephen.bruehl@vumc.org).

The Federal Trade Commission has removed three blog posts from the Lina Khan-era that addressed open-source AI and risks of AI to consumers, according to a Wired report.  

One post, titled “On Open-Weights Foundation Models,” was published July 10, 2024. Another, titled “Consumers Are Voicing Concerns About AI,” came out in October 2023. A third, authored by Khan's staff, was published on January 3, 2025 with the title “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm.” That post noted the FTC was “taking note of AI's potential for real-world instances of harm – from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.” 

TechCrunch has reached out to the FTC to learn why the posts were taken down. Khan declined to comment.  

These removals are part of a broader pattern under the Trump administration, which began issuing executive orders to direct federal agencies to remove or modify substantial amounts of government content.

After his inauguration, Trump also installed a new head of the FTC and removed several FTC commissioners, installing leadership that focused less on Khan's aggressive antitrust agenda and more on deregulation for Big Tech. In September, new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson submitted recommendations for deleting or revising anticompetitive regulations across the entire federal government.

The blog posts most recently removed by the FTC, which focused on consumer harm, don't seem to align with the Trump administration's AI Action Plan. That plan has reduced its focus on safety and guardrails, instead favoring fast growth and competition with China. However, the Trump administration has been vocal about backing open-source initiatives.  

Former FTC public affairs director Douglas Farrar told TechCrunch: “I was shocked to see that Andrew Ferguson led FTC be so out of line with the Trump White House on this signal to the market.”

This is not the first time this administration's FTC has removed content. In March, Wired reported that the FTC removed around 300 posts related to AI, consumer protection, and the agency's lawsuits against tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft.  

While hundreds of blog posts from Khan's tenure and earlier remain on the agency's Office of Technology Blog, Ferguson's FTC has yet to publish any posts to the site, despite the feverish pace of the AI race, which has resulted in several business mergers and acquisitions — including acqui-hires — that could be seen as anticompetitive.

The FTC blog culling follows the Trump administration's removal or modification of thousands of government web pages and datasets, particularly content related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; gender identity; public health; and environmental policy. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has removed data on topics ranging from chronic medical conditions to HIV/AIDS. The Justice Department has removed studies on hate crimes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has taken down the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports.  

The removal of content – including the blog posts from the FTC – could violate the Federal Records Act, which requires federal agencies to preserve records that properly document government activities, and the Open Government Data Act, which requires agencies to publish their data as “open data” by default. 

The Biden administration's FTC leadership placed warning labels on content published during previous administrations that it disagreed with, according to Wired.

WordPress co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg called the company's Tumblr acquisition his biggest failure — but one he hasn't given up on yet. The comments were made at the recent WordCamp Canada 2025 conference, where Mullenweg went live for a Town Hall session to connect with the open source-focused WordPress community.

The exec noted that Tumblr was still on a different technical stack than WordPress — something he had intended to correct by migrating the back end to WordPress infrastructure. However, that massive undertaking was put on hold earlier this year, as the cost to move Tumblr's half-billion blogs would be difficult given that the blogging platform wasn't profitable and continues to be sustained by the profits of other Automattic products.

The company has tried to trim costs with layoffs and the reallocation of Tumblr resources to more profitable parts of the business, but those efforts have yet to pay off. 

Mullenweg acknowledged these concerns at his Town Hall session, saying, “I need to switch [Tumblr] over to WordPress, but it's a big lift. It's over 500 million blogs, actually, and, as a business, it's costing so much more to run than it generates in revenue.”

As a result, Automattic had to prioritize other projects to make Tumblr sustainable, he said.

“It's probably my biggest failure or missed opportunity right now, but we're still working on it,” he added. 

If Tumblr were to move to the WordPress back end, it would be simpler and more cost-effective to maintain. Plus, it would enable the service to further join the open social web known as the fediverse, which was to be one perk of the WordPress migration.

During the course of his talk, Mullenweg discussed the other projects underway at the company, including at WordPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. He mentioned Playground, which lets you run WordPress entirely in a web browser, and Automattic's universal messaging app Beeper. The latter will be expanding to include support for bridges to other messaging apps, like KakaoTalk and messaging services from dating apps, he said.

He also touched on AI, saying, “We're not putting the genie back in the bottle” with the technology, and calling companies like OpenAI “too big to fail.” In one area of the business, the WordPress theme directory, he's thinking of tagging images made with AI to allow people to filter their searches appropriately, rather than rejecting AI-generated themes.

Notably, Mullenweg answered a question about the legal drama with WP Engine, a WordPress hosting company that Automattic has called out for profiting from the open source ecosystem without giving back. In response to an audience question about bad actors who exploit the community, Mullenweg responded that he didn't “want to say that there's bad actors,” but rather “bad actions.”

He suggested that Automattic should create more incentive systems to encourage contributions and other good behavior, like giving certain people higher rankings in the WordPress directory or showcase. He also encouraged the community to “vote with your wallet” by not supporting businesses that aren't doing the right thing.

“There's a site called WordPressEngineTracker.com which is currently tracking a number of sites that have left a certain host. It's about to cross 100,000 … that have switched to other hosts, and there were 74,000 have gone offline since September of last year,” he said.

The court ordered the site taken down at one point, which Mullenweg told the crowd was them “trying to muzzle free speech and transparency.”

San Francisco is getting a symbolic jolt very soon as newly elected mayor Daniel Lurie steps onto the Disrupt Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, taking place October 27-29 at Moscone West, in a homecoming of sorts for both tech and the city that helped define it.

Disrupt has long been a launchpad for founders and investors chasing the next wave. Lurie's visit signals a renewed effort to weave innovation back into San Francisco's future. Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a plus-one ticket.

Daniel Lurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the city's economy and restoring its global standing, isn't just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech's impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.

By showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn't retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It's doubling down.

For TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn't mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city's rebound, he'll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco's best inventions haven't been built yet.

If you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won't want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their plus-one ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group. Disrupt doors open in exactly seven days at Moscone West. Register now and don't miss the tech epicenter of the year.

For years, my local development setup has been a fragile mess of tools that never quite played nicely together. On my mac, it was a constant battle with Homebrew services starting (or not starting) on boot, conflicting PHP and Node versions managed by `asdf` or `nvm`, and a collection of `docker-compose.yml` files that I'd copy-paste and tweak for every single project. The cognitive load was just too high.Setting up SSL was another chore involving `mkcert`. Sharing a quick demo with a colleague meant firing up ngrok. And if I wanted to run two projects that needed different versions of PostgreSQL? Good luck. I'd have to stop one service to start another.I missed the simplicity of the MAMP/XAMPP era, but I needed something that could handle the diverse stack of a modern developer – not just PHP and MySQL, but Python, Go, Rust, Node.js, and various databases.That's why I (along with my small team) built ServBay. It's our attempt to bring back simplicity and speed to local development without sacrificing power. It's a native app for macOS and Windows, not a wrapper around Docker or VMs.Here's what it does:One-Click Stacks: You can install and run multiple, isolated versions of languages like Python, Node.js, Go, Java, Rust, Ruby, and .NET. No more path conflicts or environment variable hell.Databases, Plural: This was a huge one for me. You can run multiple instances of MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB simultaneously. Project A can use Postgres 14 while Project B uses Postgres 16, both running at the same time on different ports.Automatic SSL: Any host you create gets a valid SSL certificate out of the box. No more browser privacy warnings for `.test` or `.localhost` domains.Built-in Tunneling: If you need to demo a feature or test a webhook, there's a one-click button to expose your local site to the internet via a secure tunnel.One-Click Local AI: This is something we're really excited about. We've added a feature to easily download and run models like Llama 3 or Stable Diffusion locally through a simple UI, so you can experiment without worrying about API keys or costs.Everything Else: It also handles one-click backups, has a clean, non-intrusive UI, and is designed to be as lightweight as possible.I know what many of you are thinking: ""Why not just use Docker?""And that's a fair question. We use Docker for production and complex, multi-service architectures. But for quickly spinning up a single-service app, testing a new framework, or just general day-to-day development, the overhead of `Dockerfile`s, `docker-compose.yml`, slow file sync on macOS, and resource consumption often feels like overkill. ServBay is for those moments where you just want to get to the code.The project is still young, and we have a long roadmap ahead. I'm here all day to answer any questions, listen to your (brutally honest) feedback, and hear about what your own development workflows look like.You can check it out here: https://www.servbay.comThanks for reading.

That's why I (along with my small team) built ServBay. It's our attempt to bring back simplicity and speed to local development without sacrificing power. It's a native app for macOS and Windows, not a wrapper around Docker or VMs.Here's what it does:One-Click Stacks: You can install and run multiple, isolated versions of languages like Python, Node.js, Go, Java, Rust, Ruby, and .NET. No more path conflicts or environment variable hell.Databases, Plural: This was a huge one for me. You can run multiple instances of MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB simultaneously. Project A can use Postgres 14 while Project B uses Postgres 16, both running at the same time on different ports.Automatic SSL: Any host you create gets a valid SSL certificate out of the box. No more browser privacy warnings for `.test` or `.localhost` domains.Built-in Tunneling: If you need to demo a feature or test a webhook, there's a one-click button to expose your local site to the internet via a secure tunnel.One-Click Local AI: This is something we're really excited about. We've added a feature to easily download and run models like Llama 3 or Stable Diffusion locally through a simple UI, so you can experiment without worrying about API keys or costs.Everything Else: It also handles one-click backups, has a clean, non-intrusive UI, and is designed to be as lightweight as possible.I know what many of you are thinking: ""Why not just use Docker?""And that's a fair question. We use Docker for production and complex, multi-service architectures.

If you added a feature to push/fetch and sync the local development database from an s3 (or like bucket) it would solve one of the real core problems of new developers getting started.That nginx proxy probably works 99.999% of the time, but oh boy, is that .001% going to tick someone off. Proxy's always add a small layer of complexity that can fubar things in strange ways, i know from running many of proxies in production just fine until that tiny little app/proxy config change that borks it.  I haven't dug in enough yet, but i hope it can be bypassed.Ambitious project that I think has some legs.  A lot of devs dislike docker and many teams struggle to use it well anyway (for instance, a good dev Dockerfile is usually not the same as a good production Dockerfile).  You will need to make this more ""IAC-like"" if you want to beat it though, imho.Keep going and good luck!

The meat industry is a significant contributor to climate change, with livestock supply chains accounting for roughly 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Per capita meat consumption in the U.S. is among the highest in the world, with Americans eating significantly more meat than the global average.

To gain a clearer picture of how meat consumption drives greenhouse gas emissions across the country, researchers calculated and mapped the “carbon hoofprint” of every city in the contiguous United States. The findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, reveal the environmental impacts of the sprawling supply chains that deliver beef, pork, and chicken to Americans.

Goldstein and his colleagues used the Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability platform—or FoodS3—to analyze the carbon emissions of U.S. meat supply chains. This platform, developed by the University of Minnesota, consists of various data sources and models that allow researchers to simulate the movement of crops and livestock across the country.

The analysis underscores the size of America's urban carbon hoofprint, estimating the total meat-consumption-driven carbon emissions from all cities to be 329 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year. That exceeds the entire annual carbon footprint of the United Kingdom and is on par with annual carbon emissions from U.S. fossil fuel combustion, according to the study.

The researchers mapped per capita greenhouse gas emissions from meat consumption for cities across the U.S., revealing significant variation between the carbon hoofprints of individual cities. This variation is strongly linked to how carbon-intensive meat production is in different regions of the U.S.

“For instance, the GHG-intensity of beef in Las Vegas is 33 pounds of CO2 equivalent per pound of beef at retail compared to 21 pounds of CO2 equivalent per pound of beef at retail in Chicago,” lead author Benjamin Goldstein, an assistant professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan, told Gizmodo in an email.

“So the GHGs of eating a burger in Las Vegas are 1.5 times that of eating the same burger in Chicago,” he explained.

As such, relying on national or regional average greenhouse gas intensities for meat production causes major inaccuracies in estimating city-level carbon hoofprints, according to the study. The researchers therefore recommend that urban carbon accounting use more precise, location-specific data instead.

Policymakers have rolled out many campaigns and initiatives to help households reduce their carbon footprints, from subsidizing solar panel installations to offering tax credits for energy-efficient upgrades. Even with these incentives, such projects can still be costly for homeowners.

Goldstein and his colleagues argue that simply reducing your meat consumption can offer similar greenhouse gas savings depending on where you live. They estimate that the largest carbon hoofprint reductions come from substituting beef for alternative (ideally plant-based) proteins and halving food waste. Combined, these actions would reduce the total hoofprint by 123 to 142 metric tons of CO2 equivalent from baseline, according to the study.

“​​The main takeaway for me is to consume less beef,” Goldstein said. “You do not need to go vegetarian (all the power to you if you do), but less beef and more pork, chicken, or, heaven forbid, tofu are the best ways to curb the hoofprint.”

The $1,000 Asus ROG Xbox Ally X alone won't be enough to tide gamers over until the next-gen Xbox arrives. It's a factor of cost and expectation. Even if the next so-called Xbox is far more of a PC than what gamers are used to, that doesn't mean it has to feel like a Windows machine. The problem is players don't understand what's going on behind the scenes, and it's time the company became more transparent about what's in store to help us understand what's on the line for Xbox's future.

In an interview with Variety, Xbox President Sarah Bond reconfirmed the company is making a next-gen Xbox. However, for now, it's still trying to re-contextualize what “Xbox” even means anymore. Bond said Microsoft set the price of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X based on Asus, “because this is their hardware.” Of course, Asus is one of the major PC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that is tapped into the computing market, not necessarily consoles. Asus and fellow PC maker Lenovo set their prices of their top-end handheld PCs at $1,000 or more. For instance, Lenovo's 2023 handheld, the Lenovo Legion Go, cost $700 at launch with AMD's top-end handheld chip. The sequel, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 with a screen and chip upgrade (the same AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme as the ROG Xbox Ally X), costs $1,350.

PC makers have been put through the wringer over President Donald Trump's rotating, often nonsensical tariffs and resulting international trade war. These companies (Asus is headquartered in Taiwan and Lenovo in China) cannot subsidize their hardware nearly as much as Microsoft can. And still, Microsoft boosted the price of the five-year-old Xbox Series X by $150—up to $650. This year, Microsoft also hiked prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription from $20 to $30. Getting access to all of Game Pass' day-one titles would end up costing players $360 a year.

Xbox is treating the ROG Xbox Ally like a true-blue Xbox, despite the fact that any regular console gamer might get confused when they load up their device and realize OneDrive and Microsoft Teams come pre-installed, and their Xbox-specific games cannot run on the handheld hardware (though some cross-saves between console and PC will work on the ROG Xbox Ally). Bond repeatedly explained that the company sold out of Xbox Ally X devices on the Xbox Store. That may be more indicative of how many Asus and Microsoft decided to manufacture. PC makers do not expect to sell millions upon millions of units, at least judging by sales numbers from analyst firm IDC cited by The Verge.

The new handheld runs on a version of Windows with a unique interface called the “full screen experience.” It allows users to operate the Xbox Ally with a controller and still access the Xbox app and other game launchers like Steam. The UI makes the Xbox Ally one of the best Windows handhelds to date. It's still far from finished. There are multiple issues putting the device to sleep, including one that drains the battery rapidly after pressing the power button, but Xbox told us it's working on correcting those flaws.

The bigger issue is how Xbox gamers seem like they don't understand what the device is. The original Xbox that launched in 2001 was based around PC components and a version of Windows, yet any base user could hardly tell it was a PC in console clothing. The man who's often credited as the father of the original Xbox, Seamus Blackley, recently wrote on Bluesky, “Is it actually just a branded laptop with joysticks?” referring to the Xbox Ally.

Talking to Variety, Bond repeatedly tried to insinuate that the handheld was an Xbox, but that the ROG Xbox Ally X was an option for the “power players.” The regular $600 Xbox Ally that tries to enforce gaming at 720p instead of the screen's native 1080p is for a “casual” crowd. The argument falls flat when you consider how a Switch 2 handheld costs $450 and will play many games at the native 1080p resolution.

There are several major games Xbox is promoting at the end of the year. It has titles like Ninja Gaiden 4 to remind us of the original hard-as-nails ninja action title on the original Xbox. There's also Obsidian's satirical The Outer Worlds 2 and indie darling Double Fine's Keeper launching this month. That's a hearty number of new games, and I wouldn't dub any of them less worthy of attention just because they're being buoyed by Xbox.

And still, the larger Xbox audience has been feeling down in the dumps recently. It's hard to get excited about gaming when everything costs more. These upcoming games weren't built with the Xbox Ally X in mind, but they are all playable on the handheld so long as you don't mind lowering graphics settings. If this were a real console release, Xbox would have forced developers to design around the 7-inch Xbox Ally screen and create default settings to make the titles look good despite hardware limitations. Just look at how well Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws run on the Switch 2, all thanks to fine-tuning from the games' developers.

All of this comes down to hardware. The next-gen Xbox—and PlayStation for that matter—will likely make use of AMD RDNA 5 microarchitecture. Who cares? The big update beyond performance improvements is that it will let more gamers access AMD's FidelityFX AI upscaling. This takes frames rendered at a lower resolution and uses AI to upscale them while keeping the better performance. The Switch 2 is making use of a relatively old Nvidia SoC, or system on a chip. But because it has access to Nvidia's AI upscaling tech—namely DLSS—it can run intensive games at a stable frame rate at the handheld's native resolution.

There are reasons to get excited, but Xbox needs to tell gamers why it matters. Bond said about the Xbox Ally, “What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware.” The next Xbox console may not be here until 2027. It will be a long, long 2026 if we don't hear from Xbox in all that time.

As Stephen King fans well know, Pennywise the Dancing Clown emerges every 27 years to feast on the people of Derry, especially the younger generation. That's why It: Welcome to Derry takes place in 1962, 27 years before the 1989 events of Andy Muschietti's 2017 It feature film, and 54 years before the 2016 setting of It Chapter Two.

The early ‘60s setting allows It: Welcome to Derry to tap into the broader cultural climate of the era, drawing on issues like the civil rights movement and Cold War dread. io9 recently participated in a press day for the new HBO show ahead of its arrival on October 26, speaking with Muschietti (a co-creator and executive producer on the series, in addition to being the director of multiple episodes) as well as writers, executive producers, and co-showrunners Brad Caleb Kane and Jason Fuchs.

“[1962] is part of the story because we are telling the story through Pennywise cycles. So it was unavoidable to go to ‘62; this is our first step into a bigger journey,” explained Muschietti. “Segregation was still around; racial problems [were] at the heart of every town in America, especially the South, but also in the North, as we see in Maine, in the story. And the Cold War [too].”

He continued. “It was actually exciting to talk about these things because it creates not only a look into history, but also dramatic opportunities [for] our characters … Also, ‘62 is very close to the original time [setting] of It, the book. When we did the movie adaptation, we transferred it to the ‘80s. And now we're telling a prequel that happened in ‘62, but ‘62 is very close to 1958, which is [when the novel takes place]. So it's a bit of going back to the original feeling of the book and trying to explore a little bit of that world with its own flavors and textures, and also the childhood of Stephen King.”

Kane elaborated on the setting in a separate interview with io9. “You can't tell a story about an interdimensional being that exploits people's fears in 1962 without addressing the great fears of the time and the great troubles of the time. We leaned into it,” he said.

“And 1962 is very much considered a time of Norman Rockwell's America; it's a time that's idealized with great innocence. Obviously it wasn't that way for everybody, but if you think of 1962 in America, before Kennedy was assassinated, as the last moment of innocence in this country, well, what happens when you scratch the surface of that innocence, that idealized time, and you find out what's underneath? I think you'll see something very different than the facade, and we tried to lean into that reality as well.”

While most of the show takes place in 1962, it also takes time to explore the deeper history of the Derry area. The local Native American population plays a major role in the new series, bringing in a perspective not represented in King's original story or any of its previous adaptations.

“They're the first people that met the monster, and they play a crucial role in the fight against it,” Muschietti teased. “There's a part of the story that is not even in the book that is a crucial story point in this series, which tells us about the struggle of the Indigenous people against It, and that has tremendous ripple effects on generations to come.”

Kane expanded on why the Indigenous storyline was so important to include in It: Welcome to Derry. “We wanted to go back to the origins of the creature—and we wanted to talk about the stewards of the land. The Indigenous people have lived with this evil much longer than anybody else, having been here longer than anyone else, and they understand that evil is not something that you can necessarily defeat,” he said.

“It's a constant; it's a reality in life. It needs to be addressed; it needs to be confronted and understood, most importantly, and in lieu of destroying it, it needs to be contained properly. And that's what the Indigenous people in Derry seek to do in the story. So we felt that was an important perspective. And obviously, if we're thinking about Derry as a microcosm of America, you can't tell America's story without the Indigenous perspective. And I think that was an important reason for us to do it.”

While the Indigenous characters form a key part of It: Welcome to Derry, the show also aims for a microcosm feel—as Kane suggested, noting King originated the idea of looking at Derry through that lens. We spend time with the kids as they realize there's a monster in their midst. But we also get to know their parents and other adults in town, as well as the soldiers stationed on the military base nearby. It's a lot of cards to stack, but co-showrunners Kane and Fuchs didn't see it as a challenge.

“I think we saw it much more as an opportunity,” Fuchs said. “TV is obviously long-form storytelling and so we had a chance to delve into different perspectives in a way that the two hours of a movie just doesn't allow you to. We were really excited to get to see grown-up characters who were more aware of the entity than the grown-ups we meet in the context of the films. We were excited to go into different communities. We hadn't really seen Derry or It through the perspective of the Indigenous community, and it was an opportunity to also get a group of characters at the center of this, the Hanlon family, who are new to Derry, to really provide a way in for new fans who maybe haven't read the book or seen the films. We have a family at the core of this adventure who are being introduced to the world of Derry themselves for the first time. It was all by design and something we're really excited about; it felt like this was an opportunity for something a little different.”

While the show draws on a fair amount of new material, the fact that it's a prequel means viewers have a good idea of what happens next—including the fact that Pennywise has more cycles on the way. Crafting a satisfying ending for viewers who already know the monster won't be defeated took a certain nuanced approach.

“The benefit of long-form storytelling is really that you can dive into character a lot more deeply. And we're introducing a whole new set of characters in this than we saw in the movies,” Kane said. “But we try to rip the rug out from underneath people right away so you never know what's going to happen. You never know what to expect; you never know who you can come to care for that's not going to be wrenched away from you. We want to give the audience that feeling: to imbue you with love for these new characters and make you fear for their safety.”

“And really, that's the ride we're taking. It's not necessarily, ‘Will It be defeated in the end or not?' but ‘Will these characters survive? Will they learn lessons? Will they grow up? Will the parents see their children again? Will the evil plan that's being hatched as the engine of this piece be enacted in some way, or will that snap back on the person enacting it?'”

Kane continued. “We wanted to tell a story about unity and about innocence lost, just like the main themes of the book. Growing up and realizing that fear and hatred and all that stuff can only be really defeated through community and through love and through growth. We try to do all that with the characters, and that kind of journey makes it a lot more expansive than just, ‘Will It be defeated or not?' We're trying to paint a story on a much larger canvas.”

It: Welcome to Derry expands what fans know about Pennywise's history in quite a few aspects, but it's careful not to shine too bright of a light on things. As Fuchs explained, revealing details but also keeping some of that mystery intact was a delicate task.

“It was a constant balancing act—how much to reveal, how much to keep hidden. I think that what's great about the richness of Stephen King's mythology is that the more answers to mysteries you reveal, the more new mysteries suggest themselves,” Fuchs said. “So yeah, Brad and I wanted to know more about It. We wanted to understand why a being like It remains in Derry when it's a creature of light. It could travel anywhere. Why Derry? We wanted to understand why a shape-shifter who has a virtually infinite number of forms it could take continues to take the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown.”

“So you're going to get, I hope, really satisfying answers to some of those things in the context of the show. But the answers themselves suggest fresh mysteries and new questions. And that's part of the fun of the genre and of Stephen King's mythology. You can always go deeper and deeper.”

It: Welcome to Derry premieres October 26 on HBO.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Dr Joanna Scoon, and I'm a pulmonologist at CLS Health. Today, I'm going to talk to you a bit in general about the treatment for pulmonary fibrosis. 

Pulmonary fibrosis is a very complex disorder, and the treatment really depends on the etiology. Ultimately, most patients who have pulmonary fibrosis end up needing antifibrotic therapy, which basically slows down the degree of fibrosis of the lungs and tries to preserve lung function over time.

Then you have to decide if there's an autoimmune component. You definitely want to control that inflammation, and the patient will most likely require immunomodulatory agents to suppress the inflammation that is essentially leading to the fibrosis. Oxygen is another important therapy if patients require that.

Another important part of treatment is pulmonary rehabilitation — having patients do exercises at a facility to help improve their overall symptoms and their exercise tolerance.

With the World Cup less than a year away, GOAL ranks the strikers competing to make Mauricio Pochettino's squad

There is no position as discussed or dissected more than striker. It's always been that way. That fact applies to the U.S. men's national team - and perhaps doubly so after the struggles during the 2022 World Cup. From the moment the USMNT's run in Qatar ended, there was one pressing question: could the U.S. find a No. 9 who could make the difference?

That wasn't the only cause of their undoing at the 2022 World Cup. But throughout that run, the USMNT's lack of presence up top was noticeable. The hope has always been that, by the 2026 World Cup, there would be a solution. And so now Mauricio Pochettino must choose among several candidates. It's a good problem to have, but it doesn't make the selection any less crucial.

Choose right and the USMNT could make a run next summer. Choose wrong? Well, that could be the difference between winning and losing.

Striker is, of course, a position based on form. As much as anything, it's about riding the hot hand and using confidence to your advantage. There are other factors at play, as well - athleticism, timing, decisiveness, chemistry. All will play a part in determining who starts for the USMNT next summer, who comes off the bench and who might just be left out.

Graham Potter returned to Swedish soccer Monday as coach of its underperforming national team on a short-term mission: To qualify for the World Cup.

After a turbulent six years working in the Premier League, the 50-year-old Englishman has taken his first job in international soccer in the country where his coaching journey began in earnest — back in 2011 at Ostersund, a small, unheralded team that he guided from the fourth tier to Sweden's top division.

Fourteen years later, he will take charge of a national team filled with stars from the Premier League like Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres but underachieving after losing three straight games in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.



After firing Danish coach Jon Dahl Tomasson, the Swedish Football Association has hired another foreign-born coach in Potter on an initial deal that will see him take control for the team's final World Cup qualifiers against Switzerland and Slovenia next month. He will also coach Sweden in the World Cup playoffs in March, which Sweden is likely to reach by virtue of winning its most recent Nations League group.

If Sweden qualifies for the World Cup, Potter will lead the team at the tournament being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Potter understood the initial nature of the role, telling a hastily arranged news conference: “For me, it's very simple — there's no talk of building or changing or philosophy or anything like this. It's just to win games to get to the World Cup.”

The appointment marks a return to Sweden for Potter, who coached Ostersund from 2011-18 — leading the team from the amateur ranks into Sweden's top league in 2015 and the Swedish Cup title in 2017.

That qualified Ostersund for the Europa League, where it advanced to the knockout stage before losing to Arsenal despite winning the second leg 2-1 at Emirates Stadium.

Potter was regarded as a forward-thinking coach with a team-orientated playing philosophy and open to outside-of-the-box ideas about squad unity. During his time at Ostersund, for example, the club developed a “Culture Academy” where players learned skills such as stand-up comedy, art, dancing and rapping, and performed them in front of the city's inhabitants to challenge mental processes and decision-making under pressure.

With a lofty reputation, Potter — who had a modest playing career in England's lower leagues — returned to Britain to coach, firstly at Swansea and then in the Premier League with Brighton.

He was the first manager hired by Chelsea's new American ownership and didn't last seven months in a tenure played out in chaotic circumstances before being fired in April 2023. His most recent coaching stint was also underwhelming, at West Ham from January to September this year.

“With Graham Potter, we are getting a strong and experienced leader who has been tested at the absolute highest level,” Swedish FA president Simon Åström said.

Potter said he was “very humbled by the assignment, but also incredibly inspired.”

“When you're a kid, you dream of the World Cup,” Potter said. “The opportunity to help a country that's so close to my heart, that's played an incredibly important role in my career and life … to have this opportunity to help and get to the World Cup is incredibly exciting.”

Sweden's squad boasts high-profile players including Isak and Gyökeres — the starting strikers for Liverpool and Arsenal, respectively — Tottenham midfielder Lucas Bergvall, and wingers Anthony Elanga of Newcastle and Roony Bardghji of Barcelona.

However, the team is in last place in its World Cup qualifying group on one point from four games, after successive humiliating defeats to Kosovo either side of a loss to Switzerland.

Tomasson was unable to get the best out of Sweden's attacking riches. Now it's Potter's turn and he wants to find a better balance in the team.

“From my experience of Swedish football, my respect of Swedish football and what I learned from Swedish football, the collective is the most important thing,” Potter said, adding: “We've clearly got some top players but football isn't about the 11 best, it's the best 11.”

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

Oscar Piastri's Drivers' Championship lead took a hit at the United States Grand Prix as he finished fifth on Sunday, and lost a total of 23 points to Max Verstappen across the weekend in Texas.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri is searching for answers behind his lack of pace at the United States Grand Prix weekend as Max Verstappen dominated to significantly close the gap at the top of the standings.

While the points margin between Piastri and his McLaren team mate Lando Norris has ebbed and flowed throughout the 2025 season, Verstappen remained on the fringes of the picture, with his deficit standing at 104 points following the Dutch Grand Prix.

However, the Red Bull driver has out-qualified and out-raced both McLaren drivers in every session at the subsequent four Grands Prix, with the gap between him and Piastri now just 40 after the Australian could only claim fifth in Austin while Verstappen won.

Having struggled for pace across the Austin weekend and finishing 29.678s off the lead, as well as retiring at Turn 1 of the Sprint in a collision involving Norris, Piastri is determined to find answers for his difficulties in Texas.

“Today was what it was,” he reflected. “I think, with the pace that I had, I did more or less everything. I gained a spot at the start and couldn't really ask much more with the pace that I had.

“We need to try and understand why the pace was lacking this weekend, but not everything was bad. With the pace I had, I tried to execute the race the best as I could, and that's all I can ask for.”

Asked how much of a threat he is feeling from Verstappen and Norris – who finished in second place to close his own points gap to the leader down to 14 – Piastri added: “Obviously, Max is closing in and so is Lando, but the gap has not been comfortable at any point this year.

""Yes, it has been a bit bigger at certain points, but at no point has it felt like I could relax or sit back.

“My mentality hasn't changed, and it certainly won't now. I'm just trying to do the best job I can every weekend and naturally, the results will take care of themselves.”

Formula 1 moves on to Mexico City next weekend as the three championship contenders prepare to battle it out once again.

2025 United States Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

Despite losing out on P2 to Lando Norris, Charles Leclerc was pleased to claim the final spot on the podium at the United States Grand Prix.

Charles Leclerc was delighted to claim a podium at the United States Grand Prix amid a “tough second part of the year”, with the Monegasque happy that a “risky” strategy to start on the soft tyres paid off.

While most of the field lined up on the medium compound when the race got underway at the Circuit of The Americas, Ferrari opted to put the C4 soft rubber onto Leclerc's car in P3. The Monegasque overtook McLaren's Lando Norris on the opening lap, before defending robustly against the Briton as they fought over P2.

While Norris eventually found a way past, Leclerc soon pitted for the medium tyres – and ended up ahead of Norris again in the latter stages once all of the pack had made their pit stops.

As another close duel unfolded between them, Norris struggled to get ahead of the Ferrari but ultimately made his move into Turn 12 with a few laps remaining. Despite missing out on second place, Leclerc still claimed his first podium since the Belgian Grand Prix in July by taking P3.

Looking back on his race – in which he was the only car in the top 15 to start on the soft tyres – Leclerc conceded: “I was a little bit worried when I saw that I was the only car on softs at the beginning, but I kind of knew that it was a bit of a risky move.

“What I had in mind was to use the softs to try to get free air – it was quite optimistic because we had two cars in front, but that's what we tried to do.

“We at least gained a position, and that helped us a lot for the rest of the race.”

While he lost out on a place to Norris by the finish, the 28-year-old added of their battle: “I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, today I lost out at the end, but I had fun in the car.”

Having faced some tough moments across recent race weekends – as well as losing mileage during first practice in Austin owing to an issue on his car – Leclerc was particularly pleased with his result.

“I'm very happy overall because it has been a tough second part of the year, and to be back on the podium here after what was a difficult FP1 with a gearbox problem, we did well, so I'm happy,” the eight-time race winner said.

He joins an already star-studded slate with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, starring as Elphaba (aka the Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda (or Glinda the Good), respectively. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Colman Domingo secretly joined the cast of Wicked: for Good, as none other than the voice of the Cowardly Lion.


	The movie and actor's Instagram accounts shared the news Monday, after Jon M. Chu last week made headlines when he teased a big-name actor attached to the role. Domingo joins an already star-studded slate with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande playing Elphaba (now known as the Wicked Witch of the West in the second film) and Glinda (or Glinda the Good), respectively. 




	The Cowardly Lion is one of a few new characters introduced in Wicked: for Good that hail from the mainstay story of The Wizard of Oz. The Tin Man, Scarecrow and Dorothy's appearances have all been teased in the beginning of Wicked and subsequent teasers for the sequel. None of the actors who stepped into those roles have been revealed yet.

Following suit with the events of the original Broadway musical, the second movie will merge timelines with that of the 1939 film amid Dorothy's arrival to Oz.


	Adding to the high-profile cast, Jonathan Bailey also stars as Prince Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard. Both Erivo and Glinda were nominated for Oscars for their portrayal of the beloved witches, as the original 2024 film earned a total of 10 Academy Award noms and two wins.  

	











	The forthcoming second Wicked film flies into theaters Nov. 21., and will pick up following the events of the first movie.

""Seeing it for the first time was a revelation,"" says 'Billy Elliot' director Daldry, while Friedman shares: ""I hope it reminds us of the extraordinary impact that even the smallest acts of kindness can have.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Director and producer Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours, The Reader) and Sonia Friedman, the theater producer behind such West End hits as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and Stranger Things: The First Shadow, have boarded A Friend of Dorothy, a short film starring Miriam Margolyes (Harry Potter, The Age of Innocence) and Stephen Fry (Gosford Park, Wilde) as executive producers.


	Supported by Age U.K., the movie marks the filmmaking debut of writer-director Lee Knight, who also serves as an executive producer on the short.

A Friend of Dorothy follows “Dorothy (Margolyes), an elderly woman living alone, whose unexpected friendship with her young neighbour, JJ (Alistair Nwachukwu), begins when his football lands in her garden,” reads a synopsis. 


	Following multiple award wins at qualifying festivals throughout the year, the project is now eligible for both the best live-action short film at the 2026 Academy Awards and the BAFTA for best British short film, according to the creative team.


	“Seeing it for the first time was a revelation. In just 20 minutes, we experience the sweep of whole lives — a story that is both deeply moving and profoundly uplifting,” said Daldry, a three-time Oscar nominee and three-time Tony Award winner. “As a director myself, I know how rare it is for a debut to arrive so fully formed; it feels like the work of an artist with a lifetime of experience. What Lee has created is, quite simply, a mini masterpiece.”


	Friedman added: “I'm proud to support a work that will resonate far beyond the screen, sparking conversations about loneliness, friendship, identity, and the power of art to change hearts and minds. Above all, I hope it reminds us of the extraordinary impact that even the smallest acts of kindness can have on our lives.”

	











	About the support of the two big names, Knight said: “I'm thrilled to have Sonia and Stephen on board. I've admired their careers for many years; they're true game-changers in the world of storytelling. Their commitment to championing unique voices and amplifying urgent, essential narratives is deeply inspiring.”


	He added: “Sonia produced my very first acting job, and she also produced The Inheritance by Matthew Lopez, which Stephen directed, a play that had a deep impact on me, and is an underlying theme within my film. Having their support now feels incredibly full-circle.”


	Producing the project under Knight's Filthy Gorgeous Productions banner, in association with A Marlow's Production, Double Dice Films, and Namesake Films, are James Dean, Scottie Fotré and Max Marlow. The executive producers are Knight, Daldry, Friedman, Harry Burnett Rae, Gordon Cameron, Charles Gordon, Nicky Hale, Soumia Majumdar, Nichola Martin, Elliott Linger and Ingrid Tarrant.

A week after claiming the top 12 spots — all from her new album, The Life of a Showgirl — Swift still holds eight of the top 10.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



	A week after Taylor Swift monopolized the top 12 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 — all from her new album, The Life of a Showgirl — the superstar now scores eight of the top 10, while all 12 songs from the set rank in the chart's top 14.


	Swift's Hot 100 haul is led by “The Fate of Ophelia,” at No. 1 for a second week.


	The album adds a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, following its modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million equivalent album units.


	This week marks the fifth in the Hot 100's history in which an act claims at least 12 of the top 14 places — and the first via a set's second week of release. The four prior such frames, with three belonging to Swift, reflected albums' debut chart weeks: Before The Life of a Showgirl's performance a week ago, she charted the top 14 thanks to her album The Tortured Poets Department in May 2024 and filled the top 10, and 12 of the top 14, from Midnights in November 2022, while Drake amassed 12 of the top 14 the week that his Certified Lover Boy debuted in September 2021.


	Below are more highlights of Swift's latest triumphant week on the Hot 100.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 25, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Oct. 21. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	Here's a look at Swift's 12 songs in the top 14 spots on the latest Hot 100:




	“The Fate of Ophelia” drew 49.1 million official streams (down 47%) and 42.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 10%) and sold 11,000 in the United States Oct. 10-16. Notably, the song sports an individual sales total for the first time, after no songs were available for purchase à la carte during The Life of a Showgirl's first week of release; in its second week, only “The Fate of Ophelia” was.


	The single launches at No. 1 on the Digital Song Sales chart, becoming Swift's record-extending 30th leader; adds a second week atop Streaming Songs; and climbs 7-5 on Radio Songs, becoming just the third title to reach the top five in two weeks or fewer since the ranking began measuring all-format airplay in December 1998, joining Adele's “Easy on Me” (one week, 2021) and Lady Gaga's “Born This Way” (two, 2011).


	A week earlier, “The Fate of Ophelia” drew 92.5 million streams — the most for a song in a single week since all YouTube user-generated content (UGC) was removed from chart calculations in September 2020. With 49.1 million in its second week, it's the first song to pass 40 million streams in multiple weeks since Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” did so for three weeks in February-March. “The Fate of Ophelia” is the first song to clear the mark in its first two weeks since two hits in May-June 2024: Lamar's “Not Like Us” (its first four) and Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen (two).


	Since September 2020, “The Fate of Ophelia” is Swift's first song with multiple, and consecutive, weeks of more than 40 million streams. (She last achieved the feat with “Look What You Made Me Do” in its first two weeks in September 2017.)


	“The Fate of Ophelia” became Swift's 13th career Hot 100 No. 1, tying her for the fourth-most in the chart's archives.


	Swift now boasts the ninth-most weeks spent atop the Hot 100, as “The Fate of Ophelia” ups her count to 38 (breaking her out of a tie with Michael Jackson).


Most Weeks at No. 1 on Hot 100:


	(Beyoncé's total above does not include her 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 as a member of Destiny's Child, while Jackson's doesn't include his 10 weeks on top as part of the Jackson 5.)


	Swift also ties for the fifth-most multiple-week Hot 100 No. 1s, as “The Fate of Ophelia” becomes her eighth such leader.


	Here's a look at the artists with the most hits that have led the Hot 100 for two or more weeks each (with their overall No. 1 totals in parentheses):




	Two songs break up Swift's 12 in the Hot 100's top 14 spots, led by HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's record-slaying animated movie KPop Demon Hunters. It rebounds 13-3, following eight weeks at No. 1 beginning in August.


	Plus, Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which led the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, jumps 14-4, while ruling Radio Songs for an 18th week, up 1% to 78.5 million in audience — a new weekly best for the track. It also ties for the third-longest command in the airplay chart's 35-year history, matching the No. 1 runs of Miley Cyrus' “Flowers” (2023) and Goo Goo Dolls' “Iris” (1998); only Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (27 weeks, 2024-25) and The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (26 weeks, 2020) have led longer.


	Effective this week, on the first Hot 100 of Billboard's 2026 chart year, altered tiers will dictate when songs move to recurrent status following their runs on the ranking.


	Previously, descending songs were removed from the Hot 100 once falling below No. 25 after 52 weeks or below No. 50 after 20 weeks. Descending songs will now depart via the following thresholds, once they are:




	Songs gaining below those markers will be eligible to remain on the Hot 100 on a case-by-case basis. Plus, holiday classics will qualify to return above No. 50 regardless of total chart weeks, and then be subject to the rules noted above upon their descents; the same for newly-surging non-holiday catalog songs, with those without significant chart history eligible to debut at any rank, as considered individually. Songs will also continue to be removed from the all-format Radio Songs chart once they go recurrent on the Hot 100.


	Notably, amid the takeover of streaming during the past decade, the Hot 100 has reflected repeat listening more than ever before. Concurrently, as reflected on Billboard airplay charts, radio stations are now generally holding onto hits longer and in frequent airplay rotations. That shift has resulted in charts that move more slowly than in the past.


	The latest adjustments will alleviate congestion in various regions of the Hot 100, helping to move out songs that have gone recurrent at radio formats and/or are no longer actively being promoted by labels for DSP playlisting.


	In especially recent years, songs have logged some of the longest Hot 100 runs to date, led by Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which leaves the Oct. 25 chart after a record 112-week stay. Other hits that move to recurrent status this week include Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things,” after 89 weeks, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile,” after 60.

A decade in the making, the Massachusetts rapper released her BIANCA debut last Friday (Oct. 10), featuring Becky G, Ty Dolla $ign and Key Glock. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



BIA had plenty of chances to release a debut album in the past. 


	Many artists would dive headfirst into the opportunity to parlay momentum from a Nicki Minaj co-sign — which came on the Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit “Whole Lotta Money” remix — or when she went toe-to-toe with J. Cole on “London” two years later in 2023. But the Massachusetts-bred rapper knew the timing wasn't right.


	A testament to artist development, following a pair of EPs in the 2020s, BIA continued to refine her rap repertoire — and about a decade after signing to Pharrell's I Am Other label, BIA's BIANCA debut album arrived via Epic Records last Friday (Oct. 10).

	The versatile project finds BIA tapping into her Latin roots when connecting with Becky G to conquer a sample of Shakira's classic “Hips Don't Lie” for the party-starting “Hard Way.” She tries out The Notorious B.I.G.'s “Warning” flow on “Trifling” and shows off her vocal range while singing on tracks like “October,” as she transforms into R&BIA.


BIANCA, BIA's legal first name, serves as a juxtaposition for BIA joining the worlds of her rap moniker and her truest self. 


	“They're kind of figuring out how we can work together and be our truest, most authentic self,” she tells Billboard. “Sometimes our flaws, or sometimes like things that are most forward about us, or the most vulnerable things — those are all the things I put into a blender with this album, and I wanted to feel super authentic and relatable.”


	Many expected BIA to use BIANCA to respond to Cardi B's disses on AM I THE DRAMA?‘s “Pretty & Petty,” but she didn't want to lend negative energy to muddy her debut while addressing Cardi.

	











	“If I was to ever address it again, I would never attach it to my album, because this is a beautiful body of work that I believe in,” she states. “I wouldn't want to disservice this and overshadow it with noise or negativity.”


	Find the rest of our interview with BIA as she speaks on her well-rounded debut, the origins of her feud with Cardi B and unreleased collaborations with Ariana Grande. 


When momentum picked up with “Whole Lotta Money” or “London,” was the label trying to have you make an album?


	No, I wouldn't say that. They always gave me the creative control to put out what I felt like was my vibe at that time. When I put out For Certain, I was very certain about that project, and when I put out Really Her, it was kind of more of an international vibe, but still an EP. And then with this, it was like, I had songs that I had recorded even up until three, four years ago, that I wanted to find a home for them, but they weren't on those projects. So I was like, “Okay, this I know is special to me.” Like “October” was so special to me, but it didn't fit on [those projects]. I hadn't been ready to take my artistry there vocally. 


What would you consider success for BIANCA?


	For me, I'm always more of an energy person. I believe great things happen and come when you put out good things into the world, good energy. So putting this art out into the world is solely for touching the people, to inspire people, and to make people look at music in a way where it's like, “Oh, someone's being intentional about this.” Of course, I care about numbers. I care about metrics. But more importantly, it's less of my goal to be famous and more of my goal to reach people in a positive way.


I feel like sometimes people focus on the celebrity, but it can overshadow the artistry aspect.












	I mean, don't get me wrong, I love glam and I love the beauty of being an artist and a celebrity, but I more so love it when I go outside and people come to me and they talk to me about, “Oh, this song helped me get through this, or it helped me get through my divorce.” I've cried with women at Fashion Week. All my biggest moments have come from organic songs, and they've kind of found their home. We never had a song that was like. “We crafted this hit and we're gonna put it out.” It was always just like we made a song I love and we love it, and it's the baby, and wherever it lands is where it lands.


“Hard Way” with Becky G — how did that come about, and how was clearing that “Hips Don't Lie” sample?


	Legendary one. Becky's energy on a song is just so her. She's so small, but her voice is so commanding.  I loved working with her because we hit it off one time. We met during Fashion Week, and we became home girls, and when this song came it was like the perfect song for her. It's kind of like East Coast, West Coast, like Latin X vibes, but still very much our own selves. 


	I hope we did the sample justice. It's one of those things where you hope that you do it right, and not try to make it sound like the original.


You were experimenting with a lot of different sounds on the album. What was your process with that?


	Because of how I started making music, I would say my range is way more diverse than people expect it to be, so I wanted to showcase that on this project. And you've kind of been listening to some songs from me for a while, so some people don't even know that I sing. And I wanted to have some songs that you couldn't predict what was coming next, and to showcase my musical ability. I've written on every song on this project. I'm singing on every song that has vocals. I poured my heart, soul and love into this project, and just wanted to showcase what I learned musically throughout the years.


“Trifling” feels like a Biggie flow — and then you sample that Nicki Minaj speech at the end.












	I wanted to reference that original [Biggie] “Warning” flow, which, which Nicki redid, and so that's why I chose that sample at the end. Because I really wanted women to see we can be strong. A strong man's even a stronger man with a strong woman beside him. That was kind of more the message I was getting at and in the lyrics I wanted to paint like us women, even though people want us to be against each other, we're not really against each other. We should never be against each other — especially over a man, that's not for us. So I wanted a positive message that would reach women, and make them also feel powerful and strong.


I wanted to touch on something you talked about with Hot 97, where we listened to songs growing up, but we don't actually process the lyrics until we're much older — and I catch myself understanding things a lot differently now than back then.


	Yeah, when you're a kid and you're listening, you might be loving the song for the melody or for the chorus, and you're not really registering the words. But then, when you get older and you still know those songs word for word, because you memorize them, you look back and you're like, “Whoa, that message was being instilled on me so young.” I think that was something I really wanted to do with this project, make sure I was putting out a positive message on some of these songs that kids would listen to or my family was gonna listen to. I'm now representing something bigger. It's bigger than me, so I feel like the music needed to match where I'm at personally.


To me, you weren't going right at Cardi on the album. Was that intentional — like, “Hey, I didn't want to lend energy to this or take away from what I feel is my moment?”


	Yeah, I definitely feel like that. I feel like I addressed that a year ago. I kind of like left it on wax there. 

	











I think people were expecting it. 


	I think there's stuff on here people will be like, “Oh, okay.” I'm not that quiet either. I'm pretty direct, but what I'm not gonna do is make my album about somebody that I supposedly don't care about. 


Would you go at her with a diss track separately from this?


	I can't say right now. You know, it depends. Right now, I got some time. 


I'm sure when “Pretty & Petty” came out, you had people in your ear saying you should do this or do that.


	I think if this was me a year ago, I would've went [back at her] in 24 hours, but I think now where I'm at is such a beautiful place. I'm way more intentional with my music, and what I'm putting out. So I think that, you know, if it happens, it happens. But it's not my focus.


I heard Cardi talk about how she got a reference to “Whole Lotta Money” and passed on it. Is that true — and how did that track come out for you?


	it's so funny, because the reference that she's speaking of is the part “it's a whole lot of money,” and maybe a verse. I wrote the first verse on that song, and the hook, “I put on my jewelry just to go to the bodega.” So I'm so glad you clarified that, because there would be no “Whole Lotta Money” if there was no, “I put on my jewelry just to go to the bodega.” That's facts, and there would be no “Whole Lotta Money” if there was no “I can wear what you b—ches wear, because it's cheap to me,” which is also what I wrote. 


	So I think that you can have writers. Everybody uses writers. But what I'm talking about is a co-writer. There's not a song that I don't touch on my on my album, lyrically, that I don't put pen to paper. Even if I do get a full song, I'm gonna put a spin on it. I'm gonna remix it. I'm gonna do something to make it my own, because I have that talent and lyrical ability. There's nothing wrong working with [other] writers. I have tons of writers on my album, but they will tell you BIA can wrap her ass off. And BIA's gonna get in there and bar up every time. So this is not a question of that.

	











What's the root of your guys' beef? I read it was something creatively with similarities between Really Her and “Enough?”


	Yeah, there were similarities between different things in the creative. And when I responded to the tweet, acknowledging it, she came aggressively, calling me, trying to bully me. And it's behind-the-scenes recording conversations and things like that that are just happening every day. For me, it's more of like an artistry thing. I don't really care about anything else. If you think an artist is good enough or to take from them in any way, or have their work show up in your work, acknowledge that there's nothing wrong with that. Or if you don't know, say you don't know. But to act like it doesn't happen, and to act like it's not actively happening, would be naive of all of us.


Did you know “Pretty & Petty” was coming?


	I mean, I could assume, but I didn't wake up every day like, “Ahh!” My focus every day was BIANCA.


What's your friendship with Jaylen Brown? I like what he stands for and represents; it's a lot different than the typical athlete. 


	He's one of my closest friends. Man, I am so inspired by JB. Just not only his pursuit to be a great human and philanthropist, but also to just make sure that he's pushing knowledge first with the kids and community outreach; those things are really important. He also gives me a lot of advice on things, like, I'll go to him and say, “How you think I should handle the situation?” You need friends like that who want to see you be the best you, and not just settle for anything. He's a young, wise man. 

	











What's the origin of this picture with Pharrell and Ariana Grande?


	Oh my God, that is so cute. That picture was me, Pharrell and Ari. I think she was working on this Sweetener album at that time. But she's a sweetheart, always been. Pharrell, always so super cool and creative. And probably why I'm so eclectic with my music taste is because being around people like that who work so hard. They're so hands-on. I've had great people to learn from.


I was gonna ask you about the two Ariana collabs, “Esta Noche” and “More.” Why did they never come out?


	“Esta Noche,” we had a clearance issue with that. We tried to get that cleared for so long. We all wanted it to come out, but there was a clearance issue, and we didn't end up getting it figured out until years later. And I think Sweetener, one of the songs that was “More.” That was her song. 


What else did you take from being around her?


	Her work ethic. I think everyone I've worked with has had such a crazy work ethic that it shows me when I go to the studio some days and I see people that have so many hit records, but they're in the studio for days straight. Yeah, Future is one of those people. But it's like, that's why he has so many hits, because he lives there and those people like that inspire you. I've seen Ariana comp her own vocals. I always tell people that, because that was crazy to me. That's a different level of taking your artistry into your own hands.

Film Editor


	Following the success of his HBO limited series Mare of Easttown, Brad Ingelsby had a feeling his next series could draw some star power. So when he delivered the script for his crime drama follow-up Task to HBO higher-ups last year, it was Mark Ruffalo whose name kept crossing his mind to play FBI agent Tom Brandis. The only thing was, HBO brass thought it would be a tall task to get the busy movie star to sign on to another TV series.


	“I think we were scared to go to Mark because HBO said he's never going to do it,” Ingelsby tells Deadline.


	Regardless, HBO sent the script to Ruffalo and soon after he met up with Ingelsby and the show's main director Jeremiah Zagar to discuss the show and the character. While Ruffalo admits being reticent to for another dark drama after winning an Emmy for his work on HBO's I Know This Much Is True, ultimately Task was too good to pass up.

	











	Fast forward to last night's season finale, and by all accounts the decision was the right one: HBO not only has another hit series from Ingelsby, but is also sure to have him and Ruffalo in the awards-season conversation given the strong critical response.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ruffalo and Ingelsby sat down with Deadline to discuss all things Task including why Delco County makes for such a good space for storytelling, building chemistry with his series co-star Tom Pelphrey in the limited screen time they shared, and whether there are more stories to tell for Agent Brandis.


DEADLINE: It seems you've created a new genre, the Delco crime thriller. I believe it's your fourth project set in the area?












BRAD INGELSBY: Yeah, so, as the first one, Out of the Furnace, I think they shot that in Braddock, PA. It's a little bit west, but I did American Woman, which was set in Delco, and then I wrote The Way Back for Delco but [star Ben] Affleck wanted to stay with his family so we moved it to … we shot it in Long Beach. Yeah, it's funny. It was originally set in Delco.


DEADLINE: What makes that part of the country … I mean, you're from there originally, right?


INGELSBY: Yeah, I think it's just laziness. It's the people I know. I think it's just the people that I grew up with and the people that I still live near now again, because I moved back home, and I just have a lot of respect for those people, and I feel inspired to write those stories. I really do love where I live … so, always trying to make it as authentic and honest and as layered as I can, you know?


DEADLINE: When did you start coming up with this idea for this show? Was it during the Mare of Easttown shoot?


INGELSBY: Yeah, it was a little bit after. I came up with Mark's character first. So, I was interested in a priest who had lost his faith, because my uncle was a priest, Augustinian priest for a long time. He left the priesthood, married a woman. He's not an FBI agent, but I got really interested in that idea and how his ideas about, you know, faith have changed over the years, so that was really the start. I always start with characters. So, I got the idea for Mark's character, and then I got the idea for Tom's character when I was talking to our tech advisor, who said to me … we were talking about a different story, actually, and he said to me, the mailmen and trashmen, they know so much about your life, but you don't recognize it.


MARK RUFFALO: You'd never know it.


INGELSBY: Yeah, you'd never know.


RUFFALO: They're in the shadows, but not really, but they know everything.


INGELSBY: And so, I was like, well, that's a really interesting character, and that idea resonated with me, and I didn't want to do another whodunnit, because we'd done that with Mare. So, I thought, well, what's the tension, you know? And I thought, well, maybe a collision course, where you get to know and care about so many of these characters, and then they collide in the sixth episode.


DEADLINE: So when your  scripts for Task had come in, every agent in town said it was, like, the best script they had read in some time, and all they wanted to do was get their star a meeting with you.


INGELSBY: Oh, man.


DEADLINE: From your perspective Mark, when someone like an agent comes to you and says, Brad's got the scripts in. Did Casey [Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content] say we want you to come back?


INGELSBY: We were scared … I mean, because I think we were scared to go to [Mark], because HBO said he's never going to do it, right? You remember this. You can tell it.


RUFFALO: Yes, and that's what I heard from them, and my agent said, do you want to meet? And I was like, yeah, and I said let me let me read it. And I read it, and I was like this is really good, and they said do you want to meet? And I was like, yes, and I got to meet Brad and Jeremiah. We went out to dinner, and we talked a lot about it.


INGELSBY: We did.


RUFFALO: [About] the character and where it was going. But the line was that HBO says you'll never do another show, which I don't know how they got that.

	











DEADLINE: I mean, you had a pretty good experience the first time you did an HBO show.


RUFFALO: Yeah. Yeah. I think because I Know This Much Is True was so hard that they thought that, oh, he's not going to want to do it. But I met with them, and I think, you know, they were surprised. I was like. let's do it.


DEADLINE: Getting ready for the role, are you putting much research into the character? Are you talking to experts, or do you just kind of let Brad segue your way? 


RUFFALO: Brad really helped me with the priest. I had played a priest, a Jesuit priest, so I had done a lot of research for that. So, I understood that. Scott Duffy was our TA from the FBI, and he was just fantastic. He was with us all the time, so I found myself spending a lot of time going to him, because, you know, the priest part of his life is sort of behind him, but the FBI was so present with him, and so that became where I was getting most of that information. But I mean, it's really a family drama. I mean, it has the policework, and it has all that, but that's where all the tough work was.


INGELSBY: Oh my god, I know. Some of those scenes.


DEADLINE: Oh, with you mean the daughters?


INGELSBY: Yes. Yes.DEADLINE: So, wait. Did you shoot Crime 101 before or after this?


RUFFALO: Crime 101 was after this.


DEADLINE: Like, if you're jumping from one cop role to another, did that screw with you at all when you moved on to Crime 101?


RUFFALO: I kept saying, Bart [Crime 101 director Bart Layton], I just played this role. We don't want to repeat the same role, you know?


INGELSBY: I know they're very different.


RUFFALO: I was like, they're different, but they're … you know, it's a bit of an arc that's similar. He's like, I want you to put on a bunch of weight. I was like, Bart, I don't think you want me to put on a bunch of weight, you know?


DEADLINE: And he knew nothing about this?


INGELSBY: We actually met him on this. We had gotten Jeremiah, and then we talked to Bart about coming in and directing a couple episodes of the show.


RUFFALO: And he loved the show.


INGELSBY: Yeah, he did. He was very, very impressed.


RUFFALO: But he wanted to make his movie. Basically, he was prepping for it.


DEADLINE: He didn't want any, like, crossover.


RUFFALO: Except for me. [Laughs]RUFFALO: As the cops in his show, but yeah, I play a lot of … it's funny, because I'm the least likely cop I can think of.DEADLINE: Now, this show doesn't work without Tom Pelphrey, do you agree?


RUFFALO: One thousand percent.


DEADLINE: Brad, did you have Mark and Tom meet together first, or did you wait for the day they shot together? I'm kind of curious because even though they only have those couple scenes, I still feel like, from a distance, you needed them to have some kind of connection.


INGELSBY: I think Tom wanted to stay away.


RUFFALO: He did. He stayed away from me. I'd see him and be like, hey … and he would just keep going.


INGELSBY: Yes, it's so true. He wanted to make those scenes when they intersect to be really charged, I think.


RUFFALO: Michael Mann would do something similar. When I was doing Collateral, I came to set one day, and he kicked me off set because I walked over to say hi to Tom [Cruise], and [Mann] saw me, and he's like, get him off. Literally, I got the hook. Michael Mann did the same thing with Heat, with [Al] Pacino and [Robert] De Niro — he wanted to keep them apart the whole time.


INGELSBY: Yes. Exactly, but yeah, I just feel like [Pelphrey] just kind of like encapsulates … it's almost a more important one, just because there's so much that he is doing that … the cause and effect of it all. Yeah, he's driving the plot more, and as Mark's character has to react to, he's driving the plot. I think I told you this story, Mark, but we got an audition from Tom, and I was on another set at the time, and I pulled up the audition tape, and I got, like, half a minute into it, and I heard Tom laugh, and I was like, man, this guy's got something special. Even before I got done with the audition, I got a call from Jeremiah. He's like, this is the guy. As soon as we saw Tom's audition, we hired him, and it was Mark and Tom, and I think we got Emilia [Jones] next, right?


RUFFALO: Yeah. Yeah. She's incredible


DEADLINE: I was amazed how this show could've had four spinoffs. Even like Jamie McShane's Perry Dorazo and Sam Keeley's Jayson Wilkes had their own thing going, where I never felt like I was confused, but you have these layers where it's the family. It's Tom's team, it's your team, even the Martha Plimpton stuff to the side, she kind of gets her own thing. When you're doing that, does that just come naturally and organically, or do you go in thinking it would be nice where everyone kind of gets their moment and their own mini show? 












INGELSBY: I think that was important, and something we talked about, I think, was, try to make every character feel like they had an arc in the show, [that] they had a reason… I would always say, like, they have to earn a seat at the table. Why are they here? You know, why is every character here? And I meant that in a way that just wasn't about the plot, but in an emotional way, and I think that's what the sixth episode does, and everyone arrives at. We were talking to [director] Salli [Richardson-Whitfield] about it and I was saying, listen, it's a plot episode where all these people collide, but we're paying off all the arcs at the same time, you know? Mark gets in a fight with Jamie, and you know, Jamie kind of embarrasses him earlier, then Mark–


RUFFALO: He has a rage.


INGELSBY: He has a rage, yes. We just talked about that. This is where you explode and come into your own. You've been holding it. All this pent-up frustration comes out, and you punish Perry. So, I think, you know, we wanted everyone to earn a seat at the table and have an arc in the show. It's a testament to the actors that we got everybody in such a good place.


RUFFALO: And it's a testament to the writing. It's true. It's true, and everyone … the comment that I keep getting, and people are only into three (episodes), but they're like, what's amazing about this show is that every character feels so true and so original and so authentic and no one feels like a cliché. No character's tossed away purely for a plot point, and that's great writing.


DEADLINE: When you finally do have the scene with Tom, what was that like getting ready for that? First of all, you're doing the sequence in a car, and it's so different. How did you go into planning that?


RUFFALO: You know, it was just the locomotion. You know, the train was so on the tracks at that point, and your story's building in you as you're acting it, and you're piling the scenes on, and you're living in your character's story. And so, by the time Tom and I got to that, we were pretty well near the end of shooting … We didn't know each other at all, and so, when I got into the car, we were two strangers in that car, really. It was also baking hot and so uncomfortable. It was, like, 100 degrees outside, and we're in the car, and they put an AC in there, but we could never run it while we were shooting, right, and those were the longest driving scenes. So, we were baking in there. It was uncomfortable. He sweats. Like, he was very uncomfortable, and it was also tense, you know, but it all fed into it. We're feeling each other out. But it's interesting because we're not face to face, and so, it just plays so differently. If you're face to face, you're kind of feeling things out.


INGELSBY: You also can't really read the body language.


RUFFALO: Yeah, you can't. So, you're listening and sensing each other, you know, and he's behind me, and I can't see his face. I don't know what he's doing, but again, the writing is so … we've earned it. We've earned that moment from months and months of shooting.


DEADLINE: So In terms of shooting, did you have that sequence, and then you get into the big river shootout scene?












INGESLBY: YeahRUFFALO: There were places in the way they scheduled it that really was smart, because, as actors, that really helps us. If we got that scene first, then everything else is like butter, you know? You have the weight of the story pushing you through it, and now we've developed … so, we're two actors in that car, sweating our asses off, you know, suffering, and we're developing a relationship that way, and by the end of the time, we're loving each other, you know? Then we stop the car, and he sends him off on his way.


DEADLINE: Yeah, you couldn't have shot that last scene without doing the first.


RUFFALO: Never. Yeah, it wouldn't have worked.


INGELSBY: You wouldn't want to.


DEADLINE: As for the episode 6 shootout, what were you and Salli talking about as you were kind of prepping to go into the actual shoot? 


INGELSBY: Well, I love the ending of the fifth episode. Like, it gets me every time I watch it, and I usually can't watch anything. When I look back on that, I always think, wow, you know, when he drops him off and says, you know, “I can't go home,” I love that scene. That was so good. I just remember being on set that day, and once in a while, you have a feeling of, like, wow, that was epic, epic. But you know, what happened to me, Justin, I think there was a little bit of fear, because suddenly as I was writing the scripts realized, wait a second. This whole show is leading up to this confrontation. If the whole show is inching these parties closer, you have to pay it off in a really epic way. You have to reward the audience because they've been waiting, waiting, waiting, and then you have to pay it off, and so, when I got to the end of the fifth episode 00 and I did have some ideas for what happened in the sixth — but I remember saying to Salli, who was directing it … and to HBO, and God bless them, they went along with it, was like, guys, we have to make this epic se- piece. We have to find a bridge that looks out in the middle of the river and it needs to pay off, because we've been leading the audience up to this. If it's not a great shootout or it's not scary or tense or it's not emotional, the audience is going to feel let down, and so, we were very, very strategic in all the things that had to happen in that sequence, Justin, and had to feel equal parts exciting and devastating and still leave some questions in the audience's mind as to what was going to happen next. So, I just felt like, man, we have to go really big in the sequence, because I don't want the audience to turn on us, you know?


DEADLINE: So, the resolution comes, but what I appreciate most is that you give the audience time to take it all in. Like okay, the case is closed, but the stuff with Brandis and his family — it felt like those scenes were as equally important as the case coming to a close. Did you guys discuss that resolution, because it did feel like everyone was happy, even though what ultimately happened is sad.


RUFFALO: We did talk a lot about it and how to wrap it up without it feeling like we were rushing it, but also not lose the momentum of it. Like, how to close each piece up but still keep the audience going. That was something we talked a lot about in that last episode.


INGELSBY: I remember having these conversations and I don't think I ever told you this, Mark, but even in the edit, we got a little bit of pushback from HBO being like, hey, you got to have Tom keep the kid, and I was like, but that's not what the show is about. He's on a journey to take his son back in, you know? So, we had that ending in mind, and we were pretty passionate about keeping the ending. Even though the audience wants to see Sam with Tom and they see how much they like each other, I always felt like, well, that wasn't really what the show was about. It was about, like, getting the house ready to welcome his son, and obviously, forgiveness. You know, getting rid of his anger and being able to forgive. So that was always the ending, and we never strayed from that. Although we were always thinking how do we keep momentum?


DEADLINE: So, my last question is, you seem to have loved this time together. Is there a chance we get to see Agent Brandis again for another season?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Why do Return Of The King adaptations flinch away from its most crucial chapter?","https://www.avclub.com/return-of-the-king-70th-anniversary-scouring-of-the-shire","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

In Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings film trilogy, the destruction of the Shire occurs only in dream. The mystic elf Galadriel shows haunted adventurer Frodo Baggins a vision of what should happen if his mission fails: orcs loot the countryside, chaining hobbits into forced labor. A bleak orange sun rises over the hills. Smoke and fire dominate the blasted landscape. But when the Shire is ravaged in J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume novel—the final volume of which, The Return Of The King, celebrates its 70th anniversary of publication this week—it is men and hobbits, not orcs, who have done it. The absence of that act of partial self-destruction from the story's popular imagination casts ripples across its meaning, making The Lord Of The Rings a diminished, less complex work.

This destruction is revealed in one, solemn chapter, titled simply “The Scouring Of The Shire.” In essence, Frodo and his three hobbit friends, Sam, Pippin, and Merry, return after their journey across the kingdoms of Middle-earth. They discover that the hobbits have begun to industrialize the Shire. Ruffians cow the people into compliance with all the regular tools of state power: arrests, murders, cruel and unusual punishments. Merry and Pippin, now something of military men, galvanize the Shire into action, defeating the ruffians and discovering the corruption's source: the disgraced wizard Saruman.

As the four go deeper into the Shire, Tolkien describes the devastation: “It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking outflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been felled.” It is a scene of total environmental annihilation; the Shire made into a bleak, dirty place. It is easy to imagine the moment's cinematic power. The green wilderness and pastoral beauty of the Shire, which Frodo and the others forsook to wander blighted wastes and massive battlefields, has come to resemble that which they worked so hard to defeat.

To be fair, there are more than a few reasons why multiple adaptations have forsaken the chapter. For one, it is sort of an anti-climax, taking place well after the principle plot of Lord Of The Rings is over. Much of the setup for it weaves its way through the opening chapters of The Fellowship Of The Ring, involving minor characters and events that one could also excise without losing track of the main plot. (You also don't need it to explain Frodo's eventual departure from Middle-earth, so the book's supremely moving final moments can remain intact.) The Scouring does resolve the hanging plotline of Saruman's ultimate fate, since he doesn't suffer death-by-Wormtongue quite so early in Tolkien's original narrative, but serves more as a coda than any essential portion of his story. It is easy to understand, from a strict efficiency-based point of view, why both the 1980 animated Return Of The King TV movie and Jackson's 2003 film omit it.

Yet that is all using the narrow lens of plot. What is “essential” to a story is hardly what is most interesting, or most important, about it. The Scouring of the Shire reflects multiple thematic cores of The Lord Of The Rings, echoing meaning across the novel's entirety. The book's environmentalism is threaded throughout. Saruman already represented an industrial threat. Some hobbits' lack of care and vigilance to their environment, a relentless pursuit of profit, leads to the destruction of their home. Even the places still untouched, which we cannot imagine being destroyed, face the devastation of profit motive.

The cut also makes the book's final scenes, when Frodo boards the ship at the Grey Havens, lose some of their subtleties. When Sam realizes that Frodo plans to leave, he is filled with dismay: “'But,' said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, ‘I thought you were going to enjoy the Shire, too, for years and years, after all you have done.'” Replies Frodo, “‘So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.'”

The scene reflects both Frodo's ultimate victory and his most thorough defeat. Evil's triumph over the Shire was all too brief. In a few short years, much has been replanted and rebuilt. Yet Frodo's trials have so wounded him that he cannot enjoy it, much less steward it. The destruction of his home is a mirror of Frodo's heart. As Pippin and Merry straddle worlds, moving between the Shire and the wider world as both warriors and ambassadors; as Sam builds a home and family, restoring the Shire's garden on the way; Frodo remains alone. Sam's final words, the words which close the novel, “Well, I'm back,” reflect this loss. Through all the Shire's green verdancy, something has been hollowed out, something which Sam will not regain until he joins Frodo across the sea. 

It is easy to slot the Scouring into a reactionary reading of The Lord Of The Rings. The novel's racial imagery is an unquestionable part of its legacy, one which any honest criticism of it must account for: The novel's heroes are warriors of the West, its villains hordes from the East. The orcs themselves were once elves, corrupted through dark magic. In a broad way, The Lord Of The Rings is a fantasy of restoration, where an older, better world regains power over the newer, evil one. With a certain lens, the events of the Scouring lean into this logic in direct terms. Saruman is a foreigner who conscripts other foreigners into strong-arming the honest, decent folk of the Shire. They represent a corrupting influence that the hobbits must purge through violent force. 

Although these readings are accurate, they are also a little shallow. For one, Middle-earth is already decaying. Aragorn's throne is only a partial restoration. The elves are leaving and the forests they steward lose their grandeur with their departure. The books make clear that the Age Of Men, which Aragorn's reign begins, will oversee the fading of magic from the world. There may be something more pure and eternal awaiting us on the other side, but the world we leave behind will someday die.

The vulnerability of the Shire is part of this theme. Saruman's destruction of the Shire takes place over a few brief months; it takes years to restore it. When Frodo and crew arrive in the Shire, they find hobbits who are acquiescing and fearful, unquestioning of the rules. When they ask questions about how this came to be, one hobbit comments, “Even in the Shire there are some as like minding other folk's business and talking big.” When a few hobbits mimic the ruffians, Frodo says, “I hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.” It is not just that outsiders corrupt a pure world, but that they bring out a corruption that was already present.

The way the Shire saves itself is, in part, an opening up. Sam uses one of his gifts from the elves to restore the Shire. Merry and Pippin travel throughout the region and maintain their ties with both men and dwarves. Preservation can mean change. In fact, it may require it. Making the Shire an untouched place carries a stagnant stench. In Tolkien's books, nothing can be protected forever, and all requires active vigilance and care. In the films, the Shire is already perfect and needs no change at all.

Jackson's excision of the Scouring ripples across related media. The video game Tales Of The Shire, released earlier this year, is a prequel, set while Sam and Frodo are still growing up. This sets the Scouring far enough in the future that it cannot affect the proceedings, and without it looming over the recent past. But at the same time, the game takes place in Bywater, a section of the Shire which gets special attention in Tolkien's Scouring chapter. In the game's few encounters with Gandalf, he speaks of trials soon to come to the pastoral paradise. But the Scouring is only alluded to, never depicted, a thematic piece of the game, but one which remains foggy and indistinct. A direct look at the Scouring would disrupt the game's heavily marketed cottagecore fantasy, the illusion of an eternal pastoral paradise that needs no vigilance to protect.

In some sense, when it comes to this thematically vital chapter, Peter Jackson could not have made any other decision. Excising the Shire's brief destruction is as logical as cutting the hobbits' dalliance with Tom Bombadil, or their haunting battle with the spirits of the barrow-downs. Yet there is a depressing Hollywood logic to the decision. The battle of Helm's Deep, a slim handful of pages in the novel, takes up 40 minutes in Jackson's The Two Towers. The necessity of peace and restoration, the hard work they require, are left to the cutting floor, while hour-long scenes of heroic violence take more and more space in each subsequent film. Though the films' pastoral sequences have warmth and joy to them, they lack the bitter, beautiful edge that Tolkien's prose grants them. That's the cost of cutting Return Of The King‘s most crucial chapter: A loss as profound as the one Frodo Baggins suffers by novel's end.

Anne Rice was nothing if not thorough in building out her world of vampires, witches, and the mere mortals caught between their blood feuds. The prolific author spun rich tapestries in The Vampire Chronicles and Lives Of The Mayfair Witches book series, introducing intricate and interconnected mythologies that stretched across centuries, multiple installments, and thousands of pages. And she left very few veins untapped along the way.

But she had a blind spot, at least in her published works, and AMC is looking to capitalize on it with the new series Talamasca: The Secret Order. After choking down that mouthful of a title, the show is, perhaps, the network's biggest bet yet in populating its burgeoning Immortal Universe of programming. Interview With The Vampire had already been turned into a beloved 1994 film when creator Rolin Jones elevated the material with an episodic take. Even Mayfair Witches, based on the mammoth 1,000-plus-page book The Witching Hour, had the mystic of Rice's characters and the thrill of finally bringing the fan-favorite story to the screen—even if it took two seasons to finally embrace its kooky, spooky voice.

But Talamasca is nearly a whole-cloth creation of AMC's Immortal Universe team led by executive producer Mark Johnson. The resulting series, from creator John Lee Hancock, is a conspiracy-tinged spy thriller set within the ranks of a secret order of agents (a.k.a. the Talamasca, Latin for “animal mask”) who stealthily monitor the vampires, witches, ghosts, and other manifestations of Rice's wonderfully demented mind. They watch and they are always there, per the mantra recited by Elizabeth McGovern's mysterious leader Helen in the first episode. Rice wrote of the Talamasca throughout her books, but she never gave them own series, instead using their globe-trotting mission to keep order as connective tissue to hold her worlds together. So AMC's choice to diverge from Rice's bibliography to give the shadow lurkers and their bureaucratic bosses their own moment in the sun (so to speak) is a bold move—and one that mostly pays off in this roguish, paranoia-laced thriller.

Like Mayfair before it, Talamasca has the misfortune of arriving after the fantastic Interview With The Vampire. After two seasons, which completed Jones' adaptation of Rice's book, the series is reinventing itself for its upcoming rock-‘n'-roll third round as The Vampire Lestat and remains the best take on Rice's work ever committed to the big or small screen. Talamasca is not quite on that level, nor should it have the pressure to be. This isn't one of Rice's sweeping epics, but rather an enigmatic puzzle of a series that takes pleasure in rolling around in the author's densely packed lore like a pig in mud. Its purpose is to test the elasticity of Rice's stories, because if the Immortal Universe is to survive, it can't all be Interview-level greatness. It needs mid-tier shows that quench the thirst of the famished diehards between seasons, and Talamasca is the right dose of in-world fan service and compelling spy escapism to do the job.

McGovern's aforementioned Helen is the boss of the Talamasca's New York Mother House, the code name for one of the many global clandestine bases within the organization. After one of her agents is killed, she decides it's time to recruit Guy Anatole (Nicholas Denton), a mousy young lawyer who happens to have the ability to hear people's thoughts. He's skeptical about her pitch to join their ranks (especially when she starts talking about vampires), but she also knows just enough about his mysterious past to arouse the questions about himself that have been burning a hole in his psyche since he was an orphaned kid.

Beyond Helen's recruitment of Guy, there isn't much that can be said about Talamasca before it premieres.  But here's what can be said. First and foremost, McGovern is sensational and clearly having the time of her life portraying an American-based Brit trying to play it cool that something foul is afoot within the Talamasca. McGovern has been preparing for this role since 2011, when she started as the lone American living a highfalutin British fantasy in Downton Abbey. She clearly picked up a few accent quirks hanging around all those Brits, as evidenced by her wild pronunciation of “equilibrium” when Helen explains to Guy the Talamasca's delicate finger on the world's balancing scales. But it's more than just her accent work. The way her character greets every one of Guy's skeptical remarks and little rebellions with a mischievous grin as if she's seen it all before and revels in the chance to broaden his worldview is tremendous fun, as is how she manages to class up a hoodie and sneakers as she weaves her way through New York, London, and who knows where else. 



Helen is the magnet that Guy must push and pull against as he tumbles further into the void of a world he both never knew existed and was always destined to walk in. Denton's flustered-but-faking-it demeanor in the premiere takes some getting used to, but with the help of McGovern's breezy stride and a splendidly over-the-top turn from Jason Schwartzman, he finds his footing. In fact, the entire series feels like it finally falls into place when Schwartzman's flamboyant vampire Burton arrives on the scene in the first episode, bringing with him a sleekly dangerous vibe that feels most akin to Interview. But the looming threat over this whole party is William Fichtner's Jasper, an inscrutable yet rakish vampire whose fleeting appearances in the premiere offer very little insight into his actual role in the series. 

On the whole, Talamasca is not yet a perfect companion piece to the Immortal Universe's ongoing slate. The story's insistence on following a police investigation into inevitable bloodshed feels misplaced in a series that wants its viewers to believe there is no greater danger than what is lurking in the dark—or worse, out in the open. Asking us to care about what a little law and order might do in the worlds of the immortal, undead, and magically charged just comes off as child's play and wears the show down a bit by the end of the season. After all, who's really concerned if the police are at your door when there's a vampire draining your blood in the basement? 

But one thing working in the series' favor is the goodwill of its predecessors and the stirring potential to explore the fringes of fear that Rice so beautifully, tragically, and lyrically mined in her written works. By stepping off the path she laid in front of the Immortal Universe, Talamasca has the chance to pay homage to its creator while restaging the supernatural surveillance state she built for a modern context. What is a spy in the world of AI and TikTok? Are vampires and witches really as elusive as they think in an age with an infinite amount of digital eyes, not to mention authors like Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) writing books about his interviews with a real bloodsucker?

Talamasca will feed that hunger for more of what Interview and Mayfair conjured up, while distinctly living in its own corner of the universe. Will the consequences of the first season come to bear in the other series? Only time will tell. For now, Talamasca and the larger Immortal Universe are asking audiences to simply do what the organization has done for centuries: Watch and come back for more.

Talamasca: The Secret Order premieres October 26 on AMC

When longtime Hallmark stars Meghan Ory and Benjamin Ayres showed up on the set of their new movie, “A Christmas Angel Match,” they were tasked with portraying angels Monica and Michael, whose mission is to help soulmates on Earth meet and establish a meaningful connection during the holidays.

(Spoiler Alert: If you don't want to know what happens in “A Christmas Angel Match,” please stop reading here.)

In the movie, which premiered on October 19, 2025, there's a plot twist as Monica and Michael are working to get soulmates Daisy and Patrick to connect; the two angels start having unexpected feelings for each other. Given the angels' innocence and sole/soul focus on helping “tenderhearts” — their word for humans — Ory and Ayres decided it would only make sense to act like kids experiencing their first crush. And a first kiss between angels, they realized, had the potential to be “pretty awkward,” Ayres told EntertainmentNow ahead of the movie's premiere.

“Chesapeake Shores” alum Ory and her creative partner, director Christie Will Wolf, co-wrote the script for “A Christmas Angel Match.” Still, Ory and Ayres realized as they arrived on set in Vancouver that they needed to get on the same page about how their angelic characters might behave, especially as they experienced romantic feelings for the first time. 

Ayres told EntertainmentNow, “I was like, ‘Wait, have they ever kissed? We were literally, on our first day of filming, talking through this. I was like, ‘So, these two have never felt love before in this condition, in this way, and they have never kissed!” 

“So that meant we get to have these childlike discoveries,” Ayres continued. “These angels are old and wise, but also childlike. So we were going back to what it felt like to be kids having a crush or their first kiss, trying these different ways of making that believable.” 

In one scene, the two angels get caught under the mistletoe, but are so adorably nervous about potentially kissing that they both pucker up without ever coming close to touching. By the time Monica and Michael feel ready to try again, Ayres said he and Ory felt the scene still needed to be “really innocent” and “magical.”

“We were kind of choreographing how to have it be awkward and sweet, but with feeling,” Ayres said. “We're like, ‘How about this? How about that? Ok, wait, let's try it again.' I think it worked in the end. I hope people love it.”

A post shared by Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel)

Fans had strong feelings about “A Christmas Angel Match” right out of the gate, taking to social media with their reviews, including one who commented on Hallmark's Facebook post about the movie, “Omgoodness Im watching its at the end and Meghan Ory you wrote a great movie. LOVE THIS AND and you did great. Love seeing my Chesapeake Shores People.”

Someone else commented, “I love whimsical Christmas movies like this one. I enjoyed this one a LOT!”

Another fan sweetly shared, “I liked that they addressed the issue of screen time replacing human interaction. The comment that hit me the most was that there is still life or love even in the 70s, as I will hit the big 70 in a few months. I realize I haven't been very forward-thinking.”

One viewer complained that the time Monica and Michael had been angels created too much of an age gap — “Too big of an age difference to match. Come on a 586 year old and a 97 year old?” — but Hallmark Channel's social team adorably replied, “It's only about a 5 year difference in angel years. 😉”

Other viewers were surprised by how different the movie felt from a typical Hallmark romance, even branding it “too silly.” But different was exactly what Ayres told EntertainmentNow they were going for — leaning into the comedy with tongue-in-cheek scenes, amusing puns, whimsical sets and props, and “exploring different ways” to experience and cultivate love.

“A Christmas Angel Match” is available to stream on Hallmark+ and will re-air on Hallmark Channel several times, including on October 21 and October 25 at 10 a.m. Eastern time on both days.

Very cute movie.  Wish you would not have brought the gays in on the picture.  You always seem to work them in some way, somehow???

I do agree.  Hallmark seems to try to hard and to much to incorporate that.  Sad they feel the need in almost every movie.😫

Kenny Loggins slammed President Donald Trump for sharing an apparently AI-generated video of him dumping shit on “No Kings” protesters, soundtracked to Loggins' classic Top Gun song, “Danger Zone.” 


	“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone,'” Loggins said in a statement. “Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately.”


	Trump shared the video (which appears to have originated on the Trump meme page @xerias_x) on his Truth Social page on Saturday, Oct. 18, in conjunction with the massive and peaceful nationwide protests. In it, “Danger Zone” plays as an AI version of Trump, wearing a crown and piloting a military fighter jet emblazoned with “King Trump,” dumps what sure looks like feces on protesters. (Loggins' statement refers to it as “brown sludge.”)


	Beyond the allegedly unauthorized use of “Danger Zone,” Loggins said of the video, “I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us.”

	The singer-songwriter continued: “Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together. We're all Americans, and we're all patriotic. There is no ‘us and them' — that's not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It's all of us. We're in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us.”

	As of publication, the original video is still on up on social platform X, as well as Trump's Truth Social page, with the recording of “Danger Zone” still intact. Because the video was not created by Trump or the White House, Loggins' likely best recourse will be to file copyright complaints with X and Truth Social.


	Loggins now joins a long list of musicians who've been frustrated by Trump, or his surrogates and supporters, using their music. While those dustups have often centered around songs being played at campaign rallies, the Loggins situation most closely resembles an incident from last year when then-Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung (now White House communications director) posted a short clip featuring Beyoncé's “Freedom.” Beyoncé's team told Rolling Stone that the musician did not give the campaign permission to use the Lemonade track and threatened to send a cease-and-desist letter. Cheung's post with the video was eventually deleted.

	Fans are getting closer to the long-anticipated third season of Euphoria and Jacob Elordi says it will be worth the wait. Speaking to Variety at the Academy Museum Gala over the weekend, the actor praised his experience shooting the new episodes.


	“It was incredible, man,” Elordi said. “It was incredibly liberating. I got to play something so sort of far out from what I've done before.” He added that series creator Sam Levinson “constructed something that's incredibly clever and cinematic.” “I think people are really going to like it,” Elordi noted. 


	Despite the excitement, the actor explained he doesn't actually know all of the plot lines for the forthcoming third season. “Everybody shoots at different storylines,” Elordi said. “I don't know what anyone else is doing. I had a really singular storyline. You don't know what the other story lines are. It's like FBI files. So it's great because I'll get to consume the show the same way that everybody else does as a fan, which I haven't been able to do before. I'm really excited.”

	











	Elordi plays high school football star Nate Jacobs on Euphoria. The show also stars Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney, Maude Apatow, Eric Dane, and Dominic Fike. Season 3 will feature several new cast members, including Sam Trammell, Trisha Paytas, Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler, and Eli Roth. In November, Storm Reid revealed she would not be returning for a third season, but expressed gratitude for becoming a part of the “cultural phenomenon.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The second season of the teen drama aired in 2022. Fans have been waiting ever since to see how several storylines conclude. Earlier this year, HBO finally confirmed that the show would be back on the network in 2026. After Season 2 debuted, Zendaya speculated about what the follow-up might entail. 


	“I want to see what Rue looks like in her sobriety journey, how chaotic that might look,” she said. “But also with all the characters, in the sense where they're trying to figure out what to do with their lives when high school is over and what kind of people they want to be. What was special about this season was that we got to dive into [the other characters] in a much deeper sense. I think we can do that again with the third season.”

	Earlier this year, Sweeney promised that Season 3 would be “unhinged.” In an interview with Empire magazine, the actress gave a light tease of the show's return while discussing her deep attachment to her character, Cassie. She praised Levinson's openness to pushing things as far as possible, calling him “a brilliant filmmaker to work with, because I'll read something, then I'll call him, and I'm like, ‘Let's go crazier,'” Sweeney said. “And he's like, ‘I'm all in.'”

Marjorie Taylor Greene criticizes House speaker's strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately

US politics live – latest updates

The US government shutdown extended into its 20th day on Monday with no resolution in sight, as a prominent Republican lawmaker publicly broke ranks with party leadership over the decision of Mike Johnson, the House speaker, to keep Congress shuttered for weeks.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative of Georgia, on Monday morning criticized Johnson's strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately.

“The House should be in session working,” Greene wrote on X. “We should be finishing appropriations. Our committees should be working. We should be passing bills that make President Trump's executive orders permanent. I have no respect for the decision to refuse to work.”

The callout from Greene, who is aligned with the right flank of her party, is a noticeable crack in support for Johnson's hardline approach from the GOP over an extended congressional recess. Since 19 September, when members last cast votes, the chamber has not been conducting legislative business, although members have staged press conferences.

The shutdown, which began on 1 October, has become the longest full government shutdown in US history, and the third-longest when including partial shutdowns. If it extends past Tuesday, it will surpass the 21-day shutdown of 1995-96 to claim second place. Only the 35-day partial shutdown during Donald Trump's first term, from December 2018 to January 2019, has lasted longer.

Johnson has defended his strategy as necessary to pressure Senate Democrats into passing the House's clean continuing resolution without policy additions. But Democrats have refused to support the measure without provisions addressing healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at year's end.

The speaker, in a Monday morning press conference flanked by other Republican congressional leaders including Andy Harris, the House Freedom caucus chair, said the reason for the shutdown was to appease Democratic voters, particularly at the No Kings rallies.

“It is exactly why Chuck Schumer is pandering, in this whole charade. We've explained from the very beginning, the shutdown is about one thing and one thing alone: Chuck Schumer's political survival,” Johnson said.

The shutdown's impact grew more severe on Monday as the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration began furloughing approximately 1,400 federal employees responsible for maintaining and modernizing the US nuclear weapons arsenal. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, is scheduled to address the furloughs at a press conference in Las Vegas later on Monday, a spokesperson told the Guardian.

Though widely expected to fail again, the Senate is looking to hold another vote on Monday evening on the House-passed funding measure, marking the 11th attempt to advance the legislation. Previous votes have repeatedly failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster.

Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser, speculated on Monday, citing “friends in the Senate”, that the impasse might soon break.

“I think the [Senate minority leader Chuck] Schumer shutdown is likely to end sometime this week,” Hassett said in a CNBC interview. He reasoned that some Democrats had been reluctant to reopen the government ahead of last Saturday's No Kings protests against Trump, which drew millions of demonstrators nationwide to rebuke corruption and authoritarianism.

This article was amended on 20 October 2025. A previous version said the No Kings protests drew tens of thousands of demonstrators. The actual number was in the millions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Willemstad, Curaçao, October 20th, 2025, Chainwire

Whale.io, an online casino and sportsbook platform, has announced the launch of Crock Dentist, a new addition to its Whale Originals game series. This release marks the first time the classic game, known for its engaging tooth-pulling mechanics, has been adapted as an original online casino title. Alongside the game, Whale.io is minting 1,000 Crock Dentist NFTs, available on its platform, providing holders with access to airdrop rewards tied to the game's performance. These digital collectibles are designed to connect in-game assets with real-world value, aligning with the broader Real World Asset (RWA) integration trend in gaming and blockchain.

Crock Dentist: A New Whale Original

Crock Dentist reimagines the traditional game as a digital casino experience, combining familiar gameplay with randomized outcomes and modern graphics. As part of the Whale Originals portfolio, it is designed to deliver a seamless and entertaining experience for players. The game operates with a 97% Return to Player (RTP), meaning 3% of each wager contributes to a house edge, which is redistributed to the holders through an airdrop system.

Crock Dentist NFTs: Minting, Earning, Trading




Whale.io's Crock Dentist NFTs introduce a novel way for players to engage with the platform's ecosystem. The NFTs, limited to a supply of 1,000, can be minted directly on Whale.io's website. Key features include:

The first weekend was an exclusive mint for Battlepass owners. It has been said that the public mint will open up for the public on Tuesday. Each user can mint up to 5 Crock NFTs and the mint price will increase daily until all 1000 NFTs are sold out. The airdrop pool grows with every spin played in Crock Dentist, creating a direct link between game activity and NFT holder rewards. Based on previous Whale Originals releases, the game performance is expected to grow consistently which translates to bigger airdrops for the NFT holders.

Transparency and Accessibility

Whale.io emphasizes transparency by maintaining publicly accessible wallet on its site:

This approach ensures users can verify all activities on the blockchain, fostering trust and accountability. Airdrops are automatically sent to NFT holders' wallets, requiring no additional actions beyond minting and holding.
		



Integration with $WHALE Token

The $WHALE token serves as the native currency within Whale.io's ecosystem. Currently, users can utilize $WHALE to play games, purchase battle passes, or stake for additional benefits. With the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), the platform plans to introduce further utilities, enhancing the token's role across its offerings. The launch of Crock Dentist and its NFT collection arrives as Whale.io prepares for its $WHALE TGE, a milestone that will expand the platform's ecosystem. By minting Crock Dentist NFTs, users can join the community early and participate in the evolving reward structure. The limited supply of 1,000 NFTs underscores the exclusivity of this opportunity.

About Whale.io

Whale.io is an online casino and sportsbook platform known for its proprietary Whale Originals games and community-driven reward systems. Crock Dentist is now live on Whale.io, with NFT minting open to all users. Committed to transparency and innovation, Whale.io serves a global user base with a focus on integrating gaming and blockchain technology.

Cards Against Humanity, the irreverent party game company known for its provocative humor, has settled its trespassing lawsuit against SpaceX, one year after filing the complaint and launching a profanity-laced marketing campaign against Elon Musk's rocket company.

The dispute centered on a plot of land along the Rio Grande River in Cameron County, Texas, that Cards Against Humanity purchased in 2017. The company crowdfunded the purchase through 150,000 separate $15 donations ($2.25 million total) from supporters who wanted to help block President Donald Trump's border wall.

The land happened to be located right next to where SpaceX has been building its Starbase rocket complex, a launch facility for the company's spacecraft. That became an issue in 2024 when Cards Against Humanity accused SpaceX of trespassing on the property and dumping construction equipment and materials there. (SpaceX and a lawyer for the rocket company did not respond to a request for comment.)

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Cards Against Humanity had been seeking $15 million and had told supporters who helped fund the land that it hoped to pay them as much as $100 each from the proceeds. But those supporters won't receive cash; instead, they can sign up for a “brand new mini-pack of exclusive cards all about Elon Musk,” a special expansion for the popular party game, according to an email they've just received.

“So while we can't give you what you really wanted––cash money from Elon Musk––we're going to make it up to you, our best, sexiest customers…with comedy!” the company wrote in the email sent on Monday, referring to the new mini-pack of cards.

“We're happy to have stood up to a bully like Musk. We're happy to have forced a settlement,” Cards Against Humanity told TechCrunch in a statement. The company says SpaceX has removed its construction equipment and that Cards Against Humanity is “working to restore [the land] to its natural state: devoid of space garbage and pointless border walls.” 

In an email to its supporters last year, Cards Against Humanity had told them: “Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire – Elon Musk – snuck up on us from behind and completely f—-d your land with gravel, tractors, and space garbage.” It even launched a website titled “www.ElonOwesYou100Dollars.com.”

Cards Against Humanity said at the time that its “longstanding reputation as a company that makes outrageous promises and actually keeps them is on the line.” But it also warned those supporters in the email that “Musk has way more money and lawyers than we do, so you'll probably get, like, $2 tops.” 

Now, they won't even get that amount. 

The lawsuit had moved quickly. The two sides had already gone through the discovery process, where both parties exchange evidence before trial, and a trial was slated for November. Cards Against Humanity told TechCrunch on Monday that SpaceX even admitted to the trespass during discovery, which the gaming company called “a real vindication.”

Cards Against Humanity said Monday that it was “prepared to go to trial and we're confident we would have won.” But the company ultimately decided that a trial “would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.” 

“Under Texas law, we likely wouldn't be able to recoup our legal fees. We had the truth on our side, but Musk and SpaceX could easily outspend us,” the company said.

Musk is well-known for his willingness to fight his perceived enemies — and those of his companies — in court. He once claimed that Tesla's “hardcore litigation department” would “never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.” 

Despite that, Musk and his companies often settle. The Cards Against Humanity case is not the first this year. Earlier this month, X settled a complaint filed by former Twitter executives. Tesla has settled a number of Autopilot-related cases. One Autopilot case that Tesla didn't settle — despite having the chance to do so — became one of its highest-profile court losses to date.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Melissa Barrera (Scream VI) has joined survival thriller Black Tides as co-lead, starring opposite John Travolta in the Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger) film.


	The film has officially begun principal photography in Gran Canaria, Spain, with Travolta's daughter Ella Bleu Travolta (The Poison Rose), Álvaro Mel (A Perfect Story) and Dylan Torrell (Islands) also aboard in key roles.


	As we first told you ahead of Cannes, Black Tides follows Bill Pierce (Travolta), an estranged father trying to reconnect with his daughter Rebecca (Barrera) and grandson Sebastian (Torrell) when their sailboat is attacked by rogue orcas off the southern Spanish coast—setting off a fight for survival across open waters.

	“Shooting at sea is one of the hardest things you can do in film but the footage we're getting is stunning,” added producer Adrián Guerra. “The cast has bonded in a way that's rare and powerful, and Renny's directing chops are on full display—balancing raw spectacle with real human emotion.”

	











	The film will mark 25 year-old Ella Bleu Travolta's fifth screen role. In post she has 2023 feature Get Lost, which is awaiting release, and she is also in production with Sosie Bacon on comedy-horror Nice People.

Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert are following up on a heartbreaking video chronicling a previous pregnancy loss, thanking fans for their outpouring of love and support. See what the “Dancing With the Stars” judge and his wife shared in their new heartfelt message.

A post shared by Derek Hough (@derekhough)

On October 15, Erbert took to Instagram to share the couple's devastating loss with fans. “There are some things in life that change you forever. For us, this is one of those things,” she wrote in the caption. “A chapter of love, loss, heartbreak, and everything in between.”

She noted, “This video is a tribute to a part of our story … Although we are so excited to be welcoming our rainbow baby so soon, we honor our baby that never made it earthside.”

On October 19, Hough and Erbert took to Instagram with a message of gratitude for all of their fans' support.

“From the bottom of our hearts, we just want to say a huge thank you for all the beautiful messages and for sharing your own stories with us,” Hough wrote in the caption.

He continued, “When we decided to share this part of our journey, it was because hearing other people's experiences during our own heartache truly helped us feel less alone.”

“Your kindness and openness mean the world, and if sharing our story brings a little bit of comfort or connection to anyone out there, that's all we could hope for,” the “Dancing With the Stars” judge noted.

Hough added, “Wherever you are in your journey, hope is a powerful companion. You are never alone, and brighter days are ahead. We love you all so much.”

“We just wanted to come on here real fast and say thank you so much for all your beautiful and kind messages for the post we did the other day talking about our loss last year,” Hough began in the video.

Erbert noted, “We wanted to share that video this month specifically because it is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. And when we went through that experience, it truly helped so much to hear our close friends' stories that they had also experienced the same thing. So we just wanted to share and hope that it could help somebody along the way.”

She continued, “I really appreciate all of the messages and the comments of people sharing their stories with me, feeling that they now have the courage to be able to talk about their experience. And it's been really beautiful how our community has just come together and supported one another.”

Hough recalled, “When Hayley and I found out, it was absolutely devastating. We were in tears, we were consoling each other. We were in our car, just really beyond devastated.”

Reaching out to friends and family helped the couple immensely, with Hough sharing, “They had been really supportive and shared their own stories, and it really felt like in a moment of absolute despair and heartbreak, it felt like a warm blanket. It felt like a feeling of we're not alone and realizing how common it actually is. I mean, we had no idea, honestly.”

After Hough noted the emotions involved in processing a loss, Erbert shared, “It feels isolating. You feel isolated when you're going through something like that. But knowing that it's so common and having people talk to you about their experience truly feels like you're a little less alone.”

Hough added, “It doesn't take away the heartbreak … but we hope that by sharing, we're able to bring maybe a little bit of comfort, or a little bit of connection and something that we can relate to and connect with, even with the pain. And encourage and give you some hope and some love on the other side.”

“Just know we feel you, we love you and we support you,” the “DWTS” judge added. 

A post shared by Hayley Erbert Hough (@hayley.erbert)

Hough and Erbert's fans flooded the comments section to thank them for sharing their story and helping others.

“I had eight years of fertility issues before having our rainbow baby,” one fan wrote. “I can't wait for you to hold your own rainbow baby, there are no words to describe the healing that follows.”

Another fan noted, “Hayley and Derek, you are an extraordinary couple. You have had so many challenges the last few years. You have handled all with unbelievable strength, positivity, class, and true grace. The love you share is so powerful that we can feel it in your posts. Thank you for sharing so much and being so inspirational.”

One fan commented, “You two have tackled so much in a short time. Your strength and love for one another is so evident. Keep sharing. You don't know how many you're helping!”
