                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, right, shakes the hand of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese after signing an agreement on critical minerals and rare earths in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Friday, October 20, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal Monday at the White House, making good on U.S. interest in Australia's rich rare-earth resources as a potential counterpoint to China's new minerals export restrictions. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months. It follows Beijing's new requirement for foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China, or were produced with Chinese technology. Israeli forces on Sunday killed dozens in strikes in Gaza after it accused Hamas militants of killing two soldiers.Trump said Hamas must behave or face consequences. Federal officials are in court in Chicago to take questions about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the region, which has produced more than 1,000 arrests as well as complaints that agents are increasingly using combative tactics. The hearing comes a few days after a judge ordered uniformed immigration agents to wear body cameras, if available, and turn them on when engaged in arrests, frisks and building searches or when being deployed to protests.Each Border Patrol agent who is part of Operation Midway Blitz “now has a body-worn camera,” said Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis last week said she was a “little startled” after seeing TV images of street confrontations that involved tear gas and other tactics during the immigration sweep. Trump previously committed to visiting South Korea, where he expects to meet with Xi.He also said he'll visit China “fairly early next year.” “They could still win it,” Trump said of Ukraine. Anything can happen, you know war is a very strange thing.” Trump on Friday called on Kyiv and Moscow to “stop where they are” and end their brutal war following a lengthy White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, another shift in his position on the war. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who during his 2024 and much of the early going of his presidency insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war. “We want to enact a bipartisan spending agreement, but it actually has to make life better for the American people, not continue policies that are hurting everyday Americans,” Hakeem Jeffries said of Democrats' stance in shutdown negotiations during an interview at the New York Economic Club. Jeffries added that Republican claims that Democrats want to provide health care services to people in the U.S. illegally was “divorced from reality” and that Republicans “go-to refrain is waste, fraud and abuse, then you actually ask them to point out where's the waste, fraud and abuse, and it's crickets.” The president says he'll soon meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and that he expects “we'll probably work out a very fair deal” with China. “I think we're going to work out something that's good for both countries,” Trump said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week spoke with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, and he's said the two sides would meet in Malaysia later this week to help prepare for a leaders summit. The U.S. secretary of state and Russian foreign minister spoke by phone on Monday to discuss next steps toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war, following conversations last week between presidents Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both of their ministries issued similar vague statements that the conversation built on understandings reached by Trump and Putin in their Oct. 16 call. After that, Trump said he expected to meet with Putin in the coming weeks and that Rubio would meet a high-level Russian delegation, presumably led by Lavrov, this week. China has removed Li Chenggang, who had co-led trade talks with the U.S., and appointed Li Yongjie as its international trade representative. Monday's personnel change comes just days after the U.S. side lashed out at Li Chenggang. In a rare public airing of displeasure, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said Li “showed up here with very incendiary language on August 28", has “gone rogue” and was “very disrespectful.” “He showed up uninvited in Washington and said, quote, ‘China will cause global chaos if the port shipping fees go through,'” Bessent said. Bessent is scheduled to meet with the Chinese trade delegation later this week in Malaysia to prepare for a likely leaders' summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 1, people are going to really start feeling it in a very painful way,” Harris told the Associated Press in an interview during her book tour. As reporters waited in a hallway to enter the Cabinet Room where Trump and Albanese will meet, they watched through a glass door as Trump showed off his wall of presidential portraits to the prime minister. Australia is rich in rare earth resources that the U.S. is eager to tap, as China imposes tougher export rules on its own critical minerals. Trump said the agreement had been negotiated over several months. Wright said he is visiting the Nevada National Security Site Monday and will “ask Nevada's leaders to help us end this shutdown.” The NNSA has said it could furlough up to 1,400 workers as a result of a funding lapse from the shutdown. Nearly 400 federal workers would remain on the job, along with NNSA contractors. Trump and Albanese both said they hoped to get “a lot” done during their meeting. Asked for his message to the people of Australia, Trump said, “We love them.” FILE - Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks at a news conference, Tuesday, April 28, 2020, in Augusta, Maine. The former director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who endeared himself to many Maine residents with folksy news conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic, announced a run for governor on Monday. “As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Dr. Nirav Shah said in a statement Monday. “I'll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that's not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that's struggling and will only get worse because of Trump.” He resigned from that position earlier this year and took a faculty appointment at Colby College in Maine. The Republican House speaker says it's time to make progress on government funding talks now that demonstrators have had their march against Trump. The House has not held votes since it passed a short-term funding bill on September 19th. Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States amid an increasingly angry back-and-forth between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. American naval ships, fighter jets and drones are deployed in the region for what the administration has described as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. Metal shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell fell hit and damaged a California Highway Patrol vehicle as personnel at a U.S. Marine Corps base fired live rounds over a highway — against the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom — during weekend exercises observed by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, state authorities said Sunday. GOP Rep. Darrell Issa had called it “a spiteful publicity stunt” when Newsom strongly objected to the firing of munitions over Interstate 5 for safety reasons and ordered the highway closed between Los Angeles and San Diego during the drills. A spokesperson for Vance, William Martin, had issued a statement accusing Newsom of misleading the public about the safety risk. The Supreme Court said on Monday that it will consider whether people who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own guns, the latest firearm case to come before the court since its 2022 decision expanding gun rights. The Republican administration favors Second Amendment rights, but government attorneys argued that this ban is a justifiable restriction. About half of states legalized recreational marijuana, but it's still illegal under federal law. ▶ Read more about the Trump administration's case against marijuana users The “No Kings” demonstrations that drew crowds to large cities and hundreds of smaller public spaces across the United States is giving protesters hope that resistance is growing to President Donald Trump's authoritarian rule. People carrying signs with slogans such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” and “Resist Fascism.” It was the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House. “Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press. China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far beyond its borders to make demands on non-American companies. In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology. ▶ Read more about China now using US trade war tactics Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his reportedly tense meeting with Trump on Friday was “positive” — even though he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine — and emphasized what he said is continued American interest in economic deals with Kyiv. In comments embargoed until Monday morning, Zelenskyy said Trump reneged on the possibility of sending the long-range missiles to Ukraine, which would have been a major boost for Kyiv, following his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin hours before the White House meeting. “In my opinion, he does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Sunday. According to Zelenskyy, Trump said during their meeting that Putin's maximalist demand — that Ukraine cede the entirety of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions — was unchanged. Zelenskyy said Trump ultimately supported a freeze along the current front line, so his overall message “is positive” for Ukraine. Trump has been fond of hosting aides, lawmakers and other allies at the Rose Garden, which has been paved over, for events. When the Senate is in session, GOP senators meet every Tuesday (as well as Wednesdays and Thursdays) for lunch to strategize about the week ahead. The lunch was confirmed by a person granted anonymity to speak about plans not yet made public. AP Morning Wire curates the most important stories and sends them straight to your inbox. Americans are growing increasingly concerned about their ability to find a good job under Trump, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds. It's a potential warning sign for Republicans as a promised economic boom has given way to hiring freezes and elevated inflation. High prices for groceries, housing and health care persist as a fear for many households, while rising electricity bills and the cost of gas at the pump are also sources of anxiety, according to the survey. Some 47% of U.S. adults are “not very” or “not at all confident” they could find a good job if they wanted to, an increase from 37% when the question was last asked in October 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) on Monday for not “doing their jobs” during the government shutdown while they attended “No Kings” rallies last weekend. House Democrats have spent the last 20 days calling out their Republican colleagues for being on “vacation,” as Johnson has kept the House in recess for over a month. “They're either going to be celebrating with you, or they're going to be calling for new leadership,” Johnson said. “Now that's a direct threat to Chuck Schumer, and he heard the message, so did Hakeem Jeffries in the House, and that's why neither of them were here doing their jobs instead, they were out in New York and California,” he continued. Both minority leaders attended the rallies that took place this weekend as the movement argues President Donald Trump is administering “absolute” power through gutting healthcare, sending Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to cities, and “rigging” election maps. “I proudly marched side-by-side with labor unions and so many more of our fellow citizens in NYC,” Schumer wrote on X. And we won't allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy.” “This is now the third longest shutdown in history,” Johnson said, “and when you when you look at it carefully, it is now already the longest full shutdown of all time. You had an example in 2018 and you had one back in 1995 that were longer, but they were partial shutdowns because they only affected a part of the federal government.” So far, only Sen. Angus King (I-ME) and two Democrats have backed the GOP plan with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) looking to wear down the party by forcing continuous votes on the same short-term funding bill.</p>

Michaela Renee Johnson says fear is a natural response to seeing the recent aviation disasters — and shares thoughts on how people can ultimately tackle their fear. According to a new report released by The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and obtained by People magazine, James departed from John C. Tune Airport (JCA) in Nashville, heading for Macon County Airport (MCA) in Franklin, North Carolina, before the fatal crash on Sept. 18. There were three passengers total, including James, his wife Melody Carole, 59, and her daughter Meryl Wilson, 28. Per the report, at around 2:48 p.m. local time, James approached MCA to land, reporting that he was at 6,800 feet and "intended to perform a 360° turn to land" on the runway. Brett James, the country music songwriter who was best known for writing Carrie Underwood's iconic "Jesus, Take the Wheel," died in a tragic plane crash on Sept. 18. Air traffic control received no further transmissions from James after that, according to the report. The plane reportedly began "a descending left turn from 6,300 ft" and made a full turn before approaching the runway at 3,300 feet. The plane was "rocking from side-to-side" and eventually began "rolling inverted and descending behind a tree line," the report stated, per People. No signs of engine failure were found in NTSB's investigation. The aircraft was recovered and is undergoing further examination. A representative for the NTSB did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. A post shared by Brett James (@brettjamessongs) Several days before his post, the country songwriter shared a selfie of himself and his wife Melody on the beach. The plane crash occurred just days after James' stepdaughter, Meryl, celebrated her 28th birthday. Brett James was killed in a plane crash Sept. 18, 2025, along with his wife, Melody Carole, and stepdaughter, Meryl Wilson. James' illustrious career spanned decades, and he became one of the most successful and beloved songwriters in Nashville. He worked on more than 500 songs recorded by artists like Faith Hill, Kelly Clarkson, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban and Meghan Trainor. In 2020, James was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Fox News Digital's Stephanie Giang-Paunon contributed to this report.

Republican New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli discusses the tight race against Mikie Sherrill, his response to her claims on opioid deaths and more on ‘Fox News Sunday.' The reception in minority communities has been great, and on being endorsed by prominent Democrats, that tells you all you need to know in terms of the people of New Jersey wanting change. Change," Jack Ciattarelli said this weekend in an interview on "Fox News Sunday." Phil Murphy four years ago, has good reason to be optimistic he can pull off victory in blue-leaning New Jersey. In a state where registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans despite a GOP surge in registration this decade, three public opinion polls released last week — from Fox News, Quinnipiac University and Fairleigh Dickinson University — indicated Ciattarelli narrowing the gap with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in the race to succeed the term-limited Murphy. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee for governor in New Jersey, speaks to supporters at a diner in Saddle Brook, N.J., on Oct. 15, 2025. And this year, they're being viewed, in part, as ballot-box referendums on President Donald Trump's unprecedented and combustible second-term agenda. While Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in blue-leaning New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past 10 elections. President Donald Trump, seen speaking during a campaign event at Wildwood Beach in Wildwood, New Jersey, May 11, 2024, will headline a tele-rally for Jack Ciattarelli, the 2025 Republican gubernatorial nominee in the Garden State. And Trump made major gains in New Jersey in last year's presidential election, losing the state by only six percentage points, a major improvement over his 16-point deficit four years earlier. Ciattarelli, interviewed by Fox News Digital last week in Bayonne, New Jersey, noted that he "made big gains" in his 2021 showing "in Hudson County and Passaic County," two long-time Democratic Party strongholds. And if you take a look at who's been endorsing me, including some very prominent Democrats here in Hudson County, people want change," Ciattarelli emphasized. Multiple sources confirmed to Fox News that Trump will hold a tele-rally with Ciattarelli ahead of Election Day. Trump's teaming up with Ciattarelli may help energize MAGA supporters, many of whom are low propensity voters who often skip casting ballots in non-presidential election years.

(Paul Steinhauser/Fox News) And last week, Ciattarelli was joined at a jam-packed diner stop in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, by Vivek Ramaswamy, the MAGA rock star who is running for governor next year in his home state of Ohio. Ramaswamy, the multimillionaire biotech entrepreneur and conservative commentator who pushed an "America First 2.0" platform as he ran for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before ending his bid and becoming one of Trump's top supporters and surrogates, told Fox News Digital that a Ciattarelli win this year would "set the table for even bigger and more decisive victories, hopefully in places like Ohio next year." And this week another well-known Republican politician in MAGA world is headed to New Jersey. Fox News has learned the Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, a top House ally of the president who has Trump's backing as he runs next year for Florida governor, will team up with Ciattarelli on Wednesday. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, commenting on why Republicans feel bullish about the New Jersey showdown, raised concerns. "New Jersey is the best place, probably, for Donald Trump to actually stop the Democratic momentum — or at least minimize the Democratic momentum that we've seen throughout this year," Martin said in a Politico interview. But the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) forecasts a Sherrill victory in two weeks. "As numerous polls show her holding a strong lead and earning more than 50% of the vote, Mikie Sherrill is rising to meet the moment in this incredibly competitive race," DGA spokesperson Izzi Levy told Fox News. "It's clear that Mikie has the momentum, and that New Jersey voters are all-in to reject Ciattarelli for a third time this November." Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie of New Jersey, left, teams up on the campaign trail with Maryland Gov. "From Maryland to New Jersey, we're united with one goal – making sure every voice is heard at the ballot box," Moore wrote on social media. At the second and final debate two weeks ago, Sherrill charged that her GOP rival had "shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA, and he's shown every sign of being that." New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill, right, and Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, on the stage moments at the start of their second and final debate, on Oct. 8, 2025, in New Brunswick, N.J. (Paul Steinhauser/Fox News Digital) Asked whether he considered himself part of the MAGA movement, Ciattarelli said he was "part of a New Jersey movement." When asked to grade the president's performance so far during his second term, Ciattarelli said, "I'd certainly give the president an A. I think he's right about everything that he's doing." "I think that tells us all we need to know about who Jack Ciattarelli's supporting. I give him an F right now," Sherrill responded, as she pointed to New Jersey's high cost of living. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, takes questions from reporters following a debate on Oct. 8, 2025, in New Brunswick, N.J. (Paul Steinhauser/Fox News) The race in New Jersey was rocked a couple of weeks ago by a report that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, mistakenly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information like her Social Security number, to a Ciattarelli ally. But Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal. Sherrill, who was never accused of cheating in the scandal, went on to serve nearly a decade in the Navy, flying helicopters. The showdown was jolted again two weeks ago after Sherrill's allegations that Ciattarelli was "complicit" with pharmaceutical companies in the opioid deaths of tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, as she pointed to the medical publishing company he owned that pushed content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain. Last week, Trump set off a political hand grenade in the race, as he "terminated" billions of federal dollars for the Gateway Project, which is funding a new train tunnel under the Hudson River connecting New Jersey and New York. "I'm fighting for the people of New Jersey. But Garden State voters haven't elected a governor from the same party in three straight elections in over a half century, which would favor the Republicans. One of those political trends will be busted in next month's election. Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest developments in the government shutdown on 'Special Report.' But until you reach that tipping point, most Americans are ho-hum about government shutdowns and interpret the infighting between Democrats and Republicans as de rigueur on Capitol Hill. So they don't pay much mind to them. However, Democrats engineered a scheme in advance of this fall's government shutdown. They would transmogrify the shutdown into something Americans care about: healthcare. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., left, hold a news conference on the GOP reconciliation bill, at the Capitol in Washington, June 11, 2025. Democrats know that healthcare consistently polls well with voters. Democrats have known for months that many people who receive their healthcare coverage via "Obamacare exchanges" would absorb a marked price spike with their premiums early next year. Moreover, notices informing people about the impending price increase would start to hit mailboxes in mid-October. Obamacare subsidies and the government shutdown aren't directly connected. But Democrats believed they could link the two. And then, after people snored off to sleep about the government shutdown on Oct. 1, they were rudely awakened by a notice in the mail that their healthcare premiums were about to jump. Say what you will about the tactics, but it was a shrewd strategy by Democrats to seize on an issue important to their base. Moreover, it gave the party the opportunity to show voters that it's "fighting" against President Donald Trump. That's something which didn't happen in the March funding round. In fact, the Democrats' lack of fighting is what set a match to an internecine fight among Democrats about how to combat the president. "Fighting for healthcare is our defining issue," said House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., in an exclusive sit-down interview with Fox News. But it is one of the few leverage times we have." They believe Democrats own the healthcare crisis. They passed Obamacare in the first place. "It is the Democrats who created that subsidy who put the expiration date on it. They did it all on their own," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. That said, Johnson tried to beat back those calls from conservatives. Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks to the media next to Vice President JD Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on the day President Donald Trump met with top congressional leaders from both parties ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government, at the White House in Washington, Sept. 29, 2025. We have to improve it," said Johnson. Here we have a Republican Speaker of the House arguing that Congress must sustain — even assist — Obamacare. "Obamacare has been a failure," said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., on Fox News. "We've been enduring this now for almost 15 years." Stutzman benefited from the GOP's plan to ditch Obamacare in 2010. It was an historic, 63-seat midterm election pickup for Republicans. Voters sent Stutzman to Washington for the first time in that midterm. "Every couple of years they need more and more subsidies to be able to prop [Obamacare] up because it's not affordable," said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., on Fox Business Network. "It is an inflection point in this budget process where we have tried to get the Republicans to meet with us and prioritize the American people," said Clark. I asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. "The fact that it needs to be propped up in some form?" They're through the roof expensive," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. But other conservatives insist that Obamacare needs rescuing. "If you're on [Obamacare] your premium is going to literally double. If you have your own private health insurance policy, your premium is going to go up and people already can't afford their premiums," said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. "People back at home are going, ‘Wait a minute, my premium is going to skyrocket.'" Greene is one of the most outspoken members of her party when it comes to concerns about the premium increases. In fact, she believes that Republicans allowed "Democrats to hold the moral high ground on it, because they're talking about it." Greene and Johnson spoke about her concerns several days ago. But Obamacare vexed the GOP for years. Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and others led an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. House Republicans voted dozens of times to wipe out Obamacare in 2011 and 2012. They couldn't push such a package through the Senate, but it made for a powerful GOP talking point. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., got a little closer. So the House and Senate both voted for the first time to repeal and replace Obamacare, but President Barack Obama vetoed it. But the House regrouped and finally engineered a strategy that passed. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, May 6, 2025. Trump even offered a familiar, if well-traveled promise, during last year's campaign. "You'll be hearing about it in the not too distant future." "Obamacare is a failed product in the first place. And they used that as an excuse in order to add additional federal dollars," said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. The sides just don't see eye-to-eye. "When [Obamacare] was passed, healthcare was a lot less costly than it is now, and insurance rates were a lot lower. So these healthcare tax credits are necessary for healthcare inflation to make it affordable for people," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. Obamacare and the shutdown are now inextricably linked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House, on Feb. 7, 2025, in Washington. Sanake Takaichi, right, the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, meets with Hirofumi Yoshimura, second left, and Fujmitake Fuijta, leaders of of Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Innovation Party at the parliament in Tokyo, on Oct. 15, 2025. TOKYO (AP) — Sanae Takaichi is on track to become Japan's first female prime minister, after her governing party secured a crucial coalition partner. Takaichi, 64, is set to replace Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tuesday's parliamentary vote. If she's successful, it would end Japan's three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the coalition's loss in the July parliamentary election. It came just days after Takaichi's election as LDP leader, and forced her into a desperate search for a new coalition partner to secure votes so that she can become prime minister. The Buddhist-backed Komeito left after raising concerns about Takaichi's ultraconservative politics and the LDP's lax response to corruption scandals that led to the party's consecutive election defeats and loss of majority in both houses. While the leaders of the country's top three opposition parties failed to unite to seek a change of government, Takaichi went for a quick fix by teaming up with the most conservative of them: the Osaka-based Ishin no Kai, or Japan Innovation Party. The fragile new coalition, still a minority in the legislature, would need cooperation from other opposition groups to pass any legislation. Big diplomatic tests await the government will come within days — talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and regional summits. At home, Takaichi needs to quickly tackle rising prices and come up with economic stimulus measures to appease the frustrated public. An admirer of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi's breaking of the glass ceiling makes history in a country whose gender equality ranks poorly internationally. But many women aren't celebrating, and some see her impending premiership as a setback. “The prospect of a first female prime minister doesn't make me happy,” sociologist Chizuko Ueno posted on X. Ueno said that Takaichi's leadership would elevate Japan's gender equality ranking, but “that doesn't mean Japanese politics becomes kinder to women.” Takaichi, an ultraconservative star of her male-dominated party, is among those who have stonewalled measures for women's advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family's male-only succession, opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the civil law allowing separate last names for married couples, so women don't get pressured into abandoning theirs. Takaichi's policies are extremely hawkish and I doubt she would consider policies to recognize diversity,” said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper. If she's successful in the parliamentary vote, Takaichi would immediately launch her Cabinet on Tuesday and make a policy speech later in the week. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to emulate his economic and security policies. She would have only a few days to prepare for diplomatic talks at regional summits, and with Trump in between. She is expected to keep ties with China and South Korea stable, despite concerns over her revisionist views on wartime history and past visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as a lack of remorse about Japan's wartime past. Takaichi supports a stronger military, currently undergoing a five-year buildup with the annual defense budget doubled to 2% of gross domestic product by 2027. Trump is expected to demand that Japan increase its military spending to NATO targets of 5% of GDP, and purchase more U.S. weapons. Takaichi also needs to follow up on Japan's pledge of investing $550 billion in the U.S. as part of a U.S. tariff deal. Takaichi hasn't addressed bigger issues like demographic challenges. On Friday, Takaichi sent a religious ornament instead of going to the Yasukuni Shrine, apparently to avoid a diplomatic dispute with Beijing and Seoul. “There is no room for Takaichi to show her true colors. All she can do is cooperate per policy,” said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University political science professor. Many observers expect a Takaichi government wouldn't last long and an early election may follow this year.</p>

Speaker Mike Johnson tells ABC's "This Week" why he thinks Democrats are to blame for the shutdown and defended the Pentagon's new press policy. FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans' campaign arm is announcing it brought in nearly $24 million in the months of July through September this year. More than half of that — roughly $13.95 million — came in September, as Republicans were readying for a political messaging war over federal funding. That fight is still ongoing now, more than halfway through October. The government has been shut down for 20 days as Republicans and Democrats are still in disagreement over federal spending. The National Republican Congressional Committee's (NRCC) $13.95 million haul represents its best September in a non-election year and a 50% increase from the previous comparable September in 2023. House Speaker Mike Johnson during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Oct. 16, 2025. The NRCC is ending the third quarter with nearly $46 million cash on hand and nearly $93 million raised in 2025 alone. In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, NRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., pointed out that House Republicans already voted to keep the federal government funded last month and touted the GOP base propelling his group ahead of the 2026 elections. Our majority funded the federal government, and we're delivering for working families and building unstoppable momentum heading into 2026," Hudson said. "With President Trump leading the charge and voters rallying behind our conservative agenda, we're raising record-breaking resources to hold the House and grow our majority," he said. Rep. Richard Hudson, Chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), speaks on Day 4 of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, July 18, 2024. Republicans are battling to keep the House in next year's midterm elections, which have historically been unfavorable to the party in power. But GOP leaders have expressed confidence in their agenda and in the White House, while arguing the Democratic Party is facing a lack of cohesion and disapproval of its policies by American voters. Both groups and their allies have spent much of October battling over the government shutdown in the court of public opinion. The government is in a shutdown after Congress failed to reach an agreement on federal funding. Republicans are accusing Democrats of holding the federal government hostage by refusing to vote for their funding bill unless partisan healthcare demands are met. Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that Republicans are risking the healthcare costs of millions of Americans by not including an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire this year without congressional action. The House passed a seven-week federal funding bill largely along party lines on Sept. 19. Previous digital bylines seen at Daily Mail and CBS News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Amazon Web Services outage is causing major disruptions around the world. The Amazon app icon is seen on a smartphone, Feb. 28, 2023, in Marple Township, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) A problem at Amazon's cloud computing service disrupted internet use around the world early Monday, taking down dozens of online services, including social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games and chat app Signal. AWS provides behind-the-scenes cloud computing infrastructure to some of the world's biggest organizations. Its customers include government departments, universities and businesses, including The Associated Press. Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system, which converts web addresses into IP addresses so websites and apps can load on internet-connected devices. On DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many other services. Coinbase and Signal both said on X that they were experiencing issues related to the outage. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers reported that they were not working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle. This is not the first time issues with Amazon cloud services have caused widespread disruptions. Many popular internet services were affected by a brief outage in 2023. AWS's longest outage in recent history occurred in late 2021, when a wide range of companies — from airlines and auto dealerships to payment apps and video streaming services — were affected for more than five hours. The first signs of trouble emerged at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time, when AWS reported on its “health dashboard” that it was “investigating increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.” Around 6 a.m. Eastern time, the company reported seeing recovery across most of the affected services and said it was working on a “full resolution.” Amazon referred requests for comment to its AWS dashboard. Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said “a slow and bumpy recovery process” is “entirely normal.” “It's similar to what happens after a large-scale power outage: While a city's power is coming back online, neighborhoods may see intermittent glitches as crews finish the repairs,” said Chapple, an information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong, “it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,” Burgess said. “The good news is that this kind of issue is usually relatively fast” to resolve, and there's no indication that it was caused by a cyberattack, Burgess said. Something's gone wrong, and it will be fixed by Amazon,” he said. There are “well-established processes” to deal with outages at AWS, as well as rivals Google and Microsoft, Burgess said, adding that such outages are usually fixed in “hours rather than days.” Associated Press videojournalist Mustakim Hasnath in London contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first time Fontella “Faun” Day believes she saw life from another planet, it came from above. It was a cloudy afternoon in Rachel, Nevada, and the phones and computers at the Alien Cowpoke gas station and mini mart where she works had been glitching for hours. That's when she saw it: Up in the sky, a peculiar cloud formation that looked remarkably like a flying saucer. Even after she rubbed her eyes, the shape was still there, she says, hovering right above her. Today those images — and the eerie, vivid memory of that moment — are all she has from what she considers an otherworldly encounter. That's how they hide behind the clouds, I guess.” Day's story is one of hundreds found along the Extraterrestrial Highway, a 140-mile ribbon of road in south central Nevada, just outside Las Vegas. Skeptics say these “UFOs” are probably just super stealth aircraft from the nearby Nellis Air Force Base. Ufologists, those people who believe in aliens, have a different explanation for why this stretch of the Great Basin Desert seems to be so popular among beings from the outer corners of the universe. Many believers cite the region's proximity to the Nevada Test and Training Range and Area 51 — a top-secret base that the US Central Intelligence Agency didn't even admit was real until 2013. Some who have worked at Area 51 claim it is home to alien spacecraft and possibly even a dead alien. Others have linked the site to a 1947 incident near Roswell, New Mexico, that led to conspiracy theories about the government's role in covering up what some thought was the crash of an alien spaceship. As Mulder and Scully from “The X Files” would have said,  “The truth is out there.” For many, the best way to search for it in the Nevada desert is on an overnight road trip from or to Las Vegas along a stretch of road known as the Extraterrestrial Highway. If you leave from Las Vegas, the adventure begins by heading north on I-15 past downtown and beyond the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. From here, exit on US Route 93 and continue 85 miles north through the desert toward Ely. The first part of the drive is notable for its nothingness — nearly 90 minutes of sand, sagebrush, prickly pear and juniper. It's about 20 different shades of brown, all year long. There's even wildlife: The area comprises wetland and riparian habitats for thousands of migratory birds and other (terrestrial) critters. The next one comes up quickly at the intersection of US 93 and Nevada State Route 375 in Crystal Springs: A roadside market named E.T. Murals of bug-eyed aliens across the parking lot from a fake UFO in the sand, welcome visitors to this double-wide trailer renowned for its selection of dried snacks. Another creative option is “Freeze-Dried Alien Tongues,” a softer candy that mimics the ice cream they eat in space. The route received this formal moniker back in 1996, thanks in part to the advocacy of George Harris, a US Army veteran and local entrepreneur. In this role he spoke to more than 5,000 people. He also spent time working inside Area 51. When he retired from the service, Harris purchased a plot of land just north of where the Extraterrestrial Highway begins. He built a Quonset hut there and opened the Alien Research Center in 2000. Shortly after opening, Harris added Zork, a 40-foot-tall alien sculpture, out front. Visitors can purchase alien-themed clothing, magnets, hot sauce and more. Harris also sells alien shot glasses and Alien Tequila, a brand he started with some friends in Mexico in 2008. The tequila comes in bottles shaped like alien heads (of course). Harris, who splits his time between the Mojave and Las Vegas, considers these endeavors his personal tributes to extraterrestrial life. “I believe in aliens, one hundred fifty bazillion percent,” he said, adding that he has seen things inside Area 51 that lead him to hold this position. It still takes about an hour on a dirt road to drive to the base, and looky-loos are turned away at the gate. To call Rachel isolated would be an understatement. Turn your head to the left, you see nothing but ochre mountains and sand. Technically, the “Cowpoke,” as locals call it, is a gas station — it's the only gas for about 50 miles in either direction. A tiny building behind the pumps doubles as a market that sells snacks and handmade alien souvenirs such as magnets, posters, bags and keychains. There's also a selfie stop out front with haybales and three sculptures of aliens. This is where Faun Day works, the spot from which she regales visitors with details of her sighting that fateful afternoon. Visitors can marvel at similar yarns down the road at the Little A'Le'Inn, where a model UFO hangs from the hook of a tow truck out front. While this quirky motel offers 10 barebones overnight accommodations, the real attraction is the restaurant, which serves hot food including a hamburger with special alien sauce. The establishment features a life-size alien mannequin, blow-up aliens, and news clippings about alien sightings over the years. Among the highlights: alien head shot glasses, an alien head cookie jar, and replica Nevada license plates that say 4ALIENS and ET HWY. In certain spots, the road stretches into oblivion and looks like a line that someone just scribbled onto the landscape. The answer: At least two of these rutted roads lead to the perimeter gates of Area 51; curious civilians who drive them are invariably turned away at a military checkpoint, if an MP doesn't pull you over and confiscate your camera equipment first. Eventually, Nevada 375 ends at US Route 6, and the Extraterrestrial Highway continues west to Tonopah. Though this former mining town lacks an official dark sky designation from DarkSky International, it's considered one of the best places in the United States for stargazing — and, by extension, spotting alien spacecraft. In particular, the Tonopah Stargazing Park, with cement pads for telescopes and tripods, is a great spot to scan the cosmos on a clear night. Alien fanatics might remember Tonopah from the climactic scenes of the 2011 movie, “Paul,” a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost comedy about an alien who escapes from Area 51. The Mizpah, said to have several different “permanent” residents, embraces its spooky past with nightly ghost tours that include an Electromagnetic Field Reader and dowsing rods — two tools that those who consider themselves ghost-hunters often use to detect the presence of spirits. All guests are encouraged to report any paranormal experiences at check-out. (For the record, hauntings are not guaranteed.)

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy departs after speaking to reporters in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House, following a meeting with President Donald Trump, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Washington. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to reporters in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House, following a meeting with President Donald Trump, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Washington. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his reportedly tense meeting with U.S President Donald Trump last week was “positive” — even though he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine — and emphasized what he said is continued American interest in economic deals with Kyiv. Zelenskyy said Trump reneged on the possibility of sending the long-range missiles to Ukraine, which would have been a major boost for Kyiv, following his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin hours before the Ukrainian leader and American president were to meet on Friday. “In my opinion, he does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Sunday. Ukraine is hoping to purchase 25 Patriot air defense systems from American firms using frozen Russian assets and assistance from partners, but Zelenskyy said procuring all of these would require time because of long production queues. According to Zelenskyy, Trump said during their meeting that Putin's maximalist demand — that Ukraine cede the entirety of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions — was unchanged. Zelenskyy was diplomatic about his meeting with Trump despite reports that he faced pressure to accept Putin's demands — a tactic he has kept up since the disastrous Oval Office spat on Feb. 28 when the Ukrainian president was scolded on live television for not being grateful for continued American support. Zelenskyy said that because Trump ultimately supported a freeze along the current front line his overall message “is positive” for Ukraine. So far, Zelenskyy said he has not been invited to attend but would consider it if the format for talks were fair to Kyiv. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive — that we stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides understand what is meant,” Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy expressed doubts about Hungary's capital of Budapest being a suitable location for the next Trump-Putin meeting. “I do not consider Budapest to be the best venue for such a meeting. Zelenskyy took a stab at Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, saying he does not believe that a prime minister “who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution.” Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about Putin's proposal to swap some territory it holds in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions if Ukraine surrenders all of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “We wanted to understand exactly what the Russians meant. So far, there is no clear position,” he said. “That doesn't mean it will definitely end, but President Trump has achieved a lot in the Middle East, and riding that wave he wants to end Russia's war against Ukraine,” Zelenskyy added. An earlier version of this story has been corrected to show that the referenced Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in Oval Office was on Feb. 28, not in March.</p>

Colorado Bankers Association CEO and President Jenifer Waller explains why one blue state continues to rank near the top for bank robberies despite nationwide declines and how banks are responding to new threats. Despite a national decline in bank robberies over the past several years, Colorado remains among the top states for these crimes — a fact that concerns local banking leaders who report an uptick in heists. That ranked third in the nation behind California (192) and Illinois (116). Jenifer Waller, chief executive officer and president of the Colorado Bankers Association, said the state's high ranking is nothing new. "Colorado, unfortunately, has always been high in robbery," Waller said. "We compete with California and a few other states for the number one position on bank robberies." View of Bennet Avenue in Cripple Creek, Colorado. While incidents declined after 2021, when Colorado had 191 bank robberies, Waller said the trend appears to be edging upward again. "Some of our member banks have noticed a slight uptick again in recent months." That concern has been echoed by law enforcement agencies across the state — including in Aurora, where police recently responded to an armed bank robbery that underscored how quickly these crimes can escalate. "A man walked in, went straight to the middle counter, pulled out a gun, put it into one of the employees' faces and demanded money," an Aurora Police Department (APD) spokesperson told Fox News Digital. Detectives identified him as 41-year-old Matthew Procella, and three days later — aided by a license-plate reader hit — officers located his vehicle and arrested Procella without incident. When asked what might be fueling this increase, Waller admitted it's a complex issue with no clear cause. Police search a strip mall where a Chase Bank was robbed on Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018, at the corner of East Mulberry Street and South Lemay Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. "I've often questioned if the easy access to highways and interstates doesn't aid in bank robberies here," she said. "But I don't have a solid answer. It could also be a downturn economically that motivates it — we have seen that in the past." Many of these security upgrades were accelerated by pandemic protocols and have continued as permanent deterrents. Our number one priority is ensuring the safety of our customers and employees in any robbery situation," Waller said. "One thing we saw implemented ... is where banks' doors would be locked and the customers would have to get access to come inside the bank. We've seen banks continue that as a means of security." Banks are also leaning on technology, including dye packs, advanced cameras and continued employee training. Some institutions have opted to employ armed guards as a further deterrent. Despite the high numbers, most bank robberies in Colorado are nonviolent, Waller said. Still, even nonviolent robberies take an emotional toll. "Bank robbery isn't a victimless crime," Waller said. "Those involved — employees and customers alike — experience a certain amount of stress, even if it's just a note job." While physical robberies remain a major concern, fraud and scams are rapidly increasing — particularly involving check-washing schemes and organized crime groups exploiting vulnerable individuals to cash fraudulent checks. "It surprises me, but we're seeing a rise in old-fashioned check washing," Waller said. "Law enforcement has identified organized criminal activity behind it." In addition to traditional bank robberies, Colorado is beginning to see a dangerous crime trend known as "jugging," which had previously been more common in other parts of the country. "We're starting to see that in Colorado," Waller said. We're reminding customers to stay aware of their surroundings and not leave bank bags in vehicles." Banks and law enforcement agencies are responding with public education campaigns focused on situational awareness and safe handling of cash. Waller credited the FBI and the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force for their strong partnership with financial institutions. "The Task Force does a phenomenal job of identifying and convicting bank robbery. Waller noted that historically, about 80% of bank robberies were solved within 24 months, though she emphasized she did not have a current figure. For customers who might find themselves in a robbery situation, Waller offered simple but firm advice. "You just comply with the robber's demands immediately," she advised. "After the fact, you write down everything you can remember… without talking to anyone else so no one influences your memory. As bank crimes evolve, Colorado's financial institutions continue to adapt — balancing technology, vigilance and customer safety. "Customer and employee safety is our number one priority," Waller emphasized. While Colorado may not currently top the list of states with the most bank robberies, the rise in new criminal tactics and fraud schemes remains a concern — one that Colorado's financial institutions are watching closely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The government shutdown didn't deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors' center was closed and no park rangers were nearby. And I guess that's what worries me the most.” The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds. In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior. The state's Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.” Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they're bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on. Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he's not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall. Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.” A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors. It's unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC's trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's data on daily train station entries and bus boardings. And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses. With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want. She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends. In Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes. “We don't know how long this government shutdown is going to be.” The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.” Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on. Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We'll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.” CNN's Marshall Cohen, Brian Todd and Austin Culpepper contributed to this report.</p>

(AP Photo/John Clark) PETERSBURG, Va. (AP) — Rae Pickett stepped onto Richell Hines' front stoop wearing a pink T-shirt that foretold the case she hoped to make to Virginia voters as she knocked on doors on a sunny Saturday in early October. Hines answered Pickett's knock on her Petersburg, Virginia, door with a disarming smile and a T-shirt of her own: “She who kneels before God can stand before anyone.” Spanberger, a former congresswoman, supports a proposed state constitutional amendment that will reach voters only if Democrats maintain their House of Delegates majority. Earle-Sears, Virginia's lieutenant governor, has been an outspoken abortion rights opponent throughout her political career. Both candidates have cast the other as an outlier on abortion. But they're also focusing on other matters, from Spanberger's emphasis on the economy to Earle-Sears' opposition to transgender people's rights. If those folks backed Democrats in the competitive House of Delegates district — regardless of their reasoning — she knew they were effectively voting for abortion rights, too. “I do understand in some circumstances it's needed and others it's preventable,” Hines said when asked her views on abortion. Nationally, advocates across the abortion rights spectrum are watching Virginia for clues about how the issue might resonate in 2026 midterm campaigns, with control of Congress and dozens of statehouses at stake. “We know that the elections here signal what the tone and temperature could be in other elections going forward,” said Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, which opposes abortion rights. Slightly fewer than half, 45%, said they'd favor such a restriction. Polling also indicates most people believe abortion should be allowed in some circumstances but not others, roughly in line with national numbers: 62% of U.S. voters last November said abortion should be legal in at least “most” cases. In their recent debate, both candidates touched on the nuanced opinions of voters like Hines. Earle-Sears sidestepped a question about abortion, which she once called “wicked” in a clip Spanberger has featured in an ad. It's going to be what the majority of Virginians want,” Earle-Sears said. “There's a constitutional amendment, and the voters will make that decision.” Spanberger remained silent for several seconds after Earle-Sears suggested she supported letting fully birthed infants die. Spanberger countered by noting women who suffered life-threatening and, in some cases, fatal infections from pregnancy complications but could not receive medically necessary abortions in states that adopted restrictions after the 2022 Supreme Court decision. “If my opponent were to become governor, that is what she would inflict upon Virginia.” Earle-Sears shot back: “Don't lie like that.” Spanberger, when asked about restrictions, opted first for a legalistic explanation of “the Roe standard” that Supreme Court justices overturned. Pressed by moderators, she endorsed existing Virginia law that includes parental consent for minors seeking abortions and certain controls on third-trimester procedures. “The language is so vague,” said Turner, arguing women, including minors, could challenge any statutory limitation as violating a state constitutional right. The proposed amendment requires one more approval from lawmakers before it can go to voters. Abortion rights supporters hold a one-vote edge in the House of Delegates. Republicans have drawn attention to claims a Fairfax County school social worker helped students access abortion care in 2021, which officials described as untrue in their interim findings. “I think everybody in the Commonwealth can agree that parents should know what their daughters are doing,” Del. Phillip Scott said at a Moms for Liberty town hall recently in Fairfax. For now, Virginia Republicans have little hope of imposing tighter abortion restrictions because the state Senate's Democratic majority is not on the ballot this year. Abortion demand in Virginia has risen as other Southern states imposed new restrictions or effective bans. Despite potential consequences in Virginia and beyond, abortion is one of many issues voters are weighing. About 1 in 10 Virginia voters said abortion was the nation's top issue, and a similar share named health care. Back in Petersburg, Hines said the cost of living worried her. “I don't think it's my place to judge,” she said. ___ Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.

A problem at an Amazon Web Services facility in northern Virginia knocked out many websites, messaging platforms, banks, and other internet-based services, according to reports. The New York Times reported that the internet outage affected travelers at LaGuardia Airport in New York City, as “kiosks appeared to not work and apps were down.” Later, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were also included among the companies with outages. A list of all the sites and services disrupted can be found here. “We have identified a potential root cause for error rates for the DynamoDB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region,” AWS said in an update. We are working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery. This issue also affects other AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lead defense attorney of former FBI Director James Comey could be removed from representing Comey in his federal criminal trial if prosecutors get their way. Lawyers filed a motion on Sunday night claiming that Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey's attorney, could have a conflict of interest resulting from actions in which he allegedly helped leak the former FBI director's memos to the media in 2017. U.S Attorney Lindsey Halligan and assistant attorneys N. Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz requested U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff for an expedited ruling on the government's motion for the “implementation of a filter protocol” to analyze information about Fitzgerald's alleged connection to the leak of the memos, which included classified information. “The evidence for filter review could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for the current lead defense counsel, Patrick Fitzgerald,” prosecutors said, according to court documents. A filter protocol permits lawyers to review evidence quickly for the “identification, segregation, and disclosure of potentially protected material.” Prosecutors asserted that such a step was necessary because such protected material could prove pertinent in Comey's trial and contain “exculpatory or inculpatory evidence relevant to the defense and the government.” ​​”Based on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,” court documents read. Horowitz eventually criminally referred Comey to the DOJ for his conduct, but the agency decided not to prosecute. “This fact raises a question of conflict and disqualification for current lead defense counsel,” the filing read. Before litigating any issue of conflict or disqualification, the parties should have access to all relevant and non-privileged information. His trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 5, 2026, at the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shrapnel from the 250th anniversary celebration for the U.S. Marine Corps on Saturday struck and damaged a law enforcement officer's vehicle along a major California highway. The celebration occurred at Camp Pendleton near San Diego. CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said the incident was a rarity. “This was an unusual and concerning situation,” Coronado said. “It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.” Gavin Newsom (D-CA) criticized Vice President JD Vance and the Trump administration over the incident in a social media post on Sunday. We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects.https://t.co/vQ3epSTvyh “We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects,” Newsom posted. “Donald Trump and JD Vance think that shutting down the I-5 to shoot out missiles from ships is how you respect the military,” Newsom posted on Oct. 15. “PUT ASIDE YOUR VANITY PARADE AND PAY OUR TROOPS INSTEAD,” he added. It added that it would offer a “recommendation to conduct an additional after-action review into the planning, communication, and coordination between federal, state, and local government” to ensure necessary steps would be implemented to “strengthen protocols for future demonstrations and training events near public roadways.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Donald Trump and his entourage responded with mockery to weekend “No Kings” protests by millions of Americans — embracing the narrative in a way that explains his growing hubris and belief that he has unchecked power. The one Trump shared was a mocked-up vision of the president flying a fighter jet emblazoned with “KING TRUMP” appearing to dump raw sewage on protesters. In Vance's troll on Bluesky, a site popular with liberals, prominent Democrats knelt as supplicants in a royal court before Trump, the divine and absolute ruler. MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters' gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman. He's far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don't agree with. But the president's social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren't for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don't again rule America. Whether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. He called Saturday's mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said. “When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. Trump's recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths. His stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president's latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This followed his demands that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were followed by indictments scant weeks later. Santos on Sunday related to CNN's Dana Bash how he'd been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,” Santos said, “I'm pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that's just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos' former GOP colleague from New York, said of Santos: “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.” But Trump's treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system's reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. The president's authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said. But the administration's unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress' authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. ► Trump last week detailed his decision to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela, prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump stoked speculation of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn't “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won't be done nicely.” Curtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump's methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America's global reputation. His administration's refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration's determination to deploy troops on American soil. Trump aides tried to diminish and defame the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party's constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.” There is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. At the least, they show that while many of Trump's supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don't. And while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. “We're not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said. Organizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that's true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest. Retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.” Asked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?” But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.</p>
