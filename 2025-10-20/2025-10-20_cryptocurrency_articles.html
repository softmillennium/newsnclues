                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent flash crash that led to liquidations of roughly $19 billion not only proved that crypto can still be extremely volatile — it also proved the digital assets ecosystem can survive shocks, TD Cowen analysts said in a note on Monday. "While cognizant that the recent episode caused intense financial hardship for many investors, what strikes us is how well the underlying ecosystem functioned," analysts wrote. "Though it was the largest single-day liquidation ever, with open interest halved across venues, most crypto exchanges operated with little or no downtime." Earlier this month, after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed he would impose a 100% tariff on imports from China the total crypto market fell over 10%. "While less-reputable tokens were decimated, Bitcoin and Ethereum held up well enough, in our estimation. Bitcoin for example briefly reached a trough of down 15% only to close down just 8% on the day," the analysts also said Monday. TD Cowen analysts are bullish on BTC, predicting the price of bitcoin will hit about $141,000 by December. Aside from crediting crypto for its resilience, the analysts pointed to data showing that global adoption of Bitcoin "continues apace." For instance, TD Cowen analysts said that in Japan the number of registered accounts holding digital assets has quadrupled to over 7.9 million.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) has imposed a £14 million fine on Capita for a data breach it suffered in March 2023. The breach was suffered after an unknown threat actor gained access to Capita's systems following the inadvertent download of a malicious file onto an employee device, which led ultimately to the theft of the personal data of 6.6 million individuals, including highly sensitive data, such as financial information, criminal record data, data relating to children, and other ‘special category' data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nic Carter says quantum computing is the biggest long-term risk to bitcoin's core cryptography and urges developers to treat it with urgency, not as science fiction. “Bitcoin's entire cryptographic premise is ‘there exists a one-way function that's easy to compute in one direction, and infeasible to invert,'” he writes. Going from private to public is efficient for honest users, he says, because they can use a shortcut known as “double and add” to reach a result quickly. He adds there is no comparable shortcut in the opposite direction. For non-specialists, he offers a deck-shuffle analogy: you can repeat the same sequence of shuffles to reach an identical final order, but an observer cannot look at the shuffled deck and infer how many shuffles were used. In his telling, routine network behavior also raises exposure: when coins are spent, a public key is revealed on-chain. He says that is safe today because converting a revealed public key back to the private key is not practical, but quantum advances could change that calculus, especially if addresses are reused and more keys remain visible for longer. Near term, he highlights basic hygiene such as avoiding address reuse so public keys are not exposed longer than necessary. Longer term, he urges the community to prioritize post-quantum signature schemes and realistic migration paths, framing them as engineering work rather than a distant thought experiment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (ticker BMNR) has disclosed a fresh week of ether accumulation, saying it purchased roughly 203,826 ETH and now holds 3.24 million ETH in total. BitMine's ether position represents about 2.7% of ETH's circulating supply and solidifies its lead as the largest digital asset treasury company focused on Ethereum, according to the press release. The update is part of a string of rapid-fire purchases that The Block has tracked this month. Earlier this month, the firm said its ether balance had topped 3 million. Meanwhile, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee has argued that Ethereum is a "truly neutral" chain likely to see growing institutional adoption, a view the company has used to justify its bid to reach 5% of ETH's supply over time. Ether's price is down almost 10% in October following the recent historic deleveraging event. BitMine has framed the buying as opportunistic amid post-liquidation price dislocations. "The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week, and this put downward pressure on ETH prices," Lee said, adding that "given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward." Ether has hovered near $4,000 today, according to The Block's price page, while BMNR shares rose 7% shortly after today's announcement and U.S. market open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But with the government shutdown, that wait could be a lot longer. The perpetual financial rollercoaster otherwise known as crypto has taken another dip. A recent crypto flash crash spelled even more turmoil for so-called “altcoins,” the less famous non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin or Solana. Thing is, even if you haven't heard of them yet, those altcoins are poised to take a step into the financial mainstream. “OK, over the last week, I am down $312,000 — no, $330,000 — on Dogecoin specifically,” he said. “That would be really bullish for Dogecoin,” he said. You can think of them as an easy way to invest in crypto from the comfort of your Charles Schwab or Robinhood account — no interaction with the blockchain required. Since the crypto-friendly Trump administration took over, applications for altcoin ETFs have surged. Over 130 are right now waiting for SEC approval, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — although they may be waiting a bit longer than expected. Assuming the government does re-open, individual investors may soon have new crypto options in their brokerage accounts or 401(k)s. Duke University crypto researcher Lee Reiners, however, worries that altcoin ETFs may give investors a false sense of security. “Just because it's in a familiar wrapper — in this case, an ETF — does not mean that it is somehow safe or cannot go down significantly,” he said. Reiners doesn't expect altcoin ETFs to cause broader financial market chaos, but he does think some people may invest in things they don't really understand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diacente Group, a prominent Ugandan developer specializing in green industrial zones, has announced a strategic partnership with the US-based Global Settlement Network (GSN) to launch an ambitious $5.5 billion project aimed at building national digital infrastructure across Uganda. This landmark initiative will connect farms, mines, power projects, and factories throughout the country, helping to modernize the country's economic landscape. The digital currency, which is backed by treasury bonds, will allow Ugandans to conduct transactions through mobile phones, even on basic devices. This development is significant as it directly links financial transactions to real economic activity, providing a foundation for a more inclusive and efficient economy. The $5.5 billion investment will be financed through tokenized loans, as well as contributions from investors based in Korea and the Middle East. With more than 80% of Uganda's workforce currently employed in the informal economy, the promise of cheaper, faster, and more transparent trade through this system could significantly transform the economic landscape. The rollout of the initiative will commence in the Karamoja Green Industrial & Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), a government-backed industrial zone that is part of Uganda's Vision 2040 development plan. Ryan Kirkley, cofounder of GSN, emphasized that the project will merge technology with tangible production processes while ensuring that local licensing and control remain central to the project. Odongo Solomon, CEO of Diacente, highlighted that this initiative would integrate cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies into Uganda's broader development framework, marking a significant step toward modernizing the nation's financial and industrial systems.

To obtain the best experience, we recommend you use a more up to date browser (or turn off compatibility mode in Internet Explorer). This paper analyzes the time-varying herding behavior in the non-fungible token (NFTs) and cryptocurrency markets and investigates their interrelationship. Based on the rolling window method, our findings show the presence of herding behavior in both markets, where herding behavior in these markets may be influenced by the major events announcements particularly those related to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Such finding contributes to a deeper understanding of the market dynamics. Based on blockchain technology, in contrast to traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for intermediaries to address trust-related concerns (Ballis and Drakos, 2020). Similarly, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are a type of digital asset that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, such as art, music, photos, or even land (Ante, 2022b; Dowling, 2022a; Yousaf and Yarovaya, 2022a), also rely on blockchain technology and smart contracts as their digital infrastructure. NFTs open up new possibilities for digitizing and trading unique values on the Internet. The year 2022 also witnessed an increasing trend in NFT sales, reaching 23.74 billion. Data from CryptoSlam further reveals a growing interest in NFTs, as evidenced by over 800,000 unique buyers tracked for three consecutive months, starting from January 2022 (Keller, 2022). The objectives of our study are twofold. This phenomenon can be explained by Network Externalities and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, which illustrates how the value and adoption of NFTs are influenced by the interconnectedness of market participants and the rapid diffusion of new technologies. Coupled with inadequate, commonly accepted regulation or information (Makarov and Schoar, 2020; Corbet et al., 2019), market volatility and signals may influence investors' portfolio rebalancing decisions when allocating funds to the non-fungible token (NFT) and cryptocurrency markets, potentially resulting in herding behavior (Wilson et al., 2022). Herding behavior may be exacerbated during periods of extreme fear in a crisis when investors suppress their rational thinking and follow the market's reaction due to a lack of information or fear of loss, rather than relying upon their analysis (Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000; Christie and Huang, 1995; Galariotis et al., 2015). Thus, severe herd behavior emerges, resulting in highly volatile, explosive, or distressed markets (Bouri et al., 2019). Considering the non-fungibility feature of NFTs, which provides investors with additional value beyond price appreciation (Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000), we argue that the NFT market can exhibit greater stability during periods of market volatility, with less herding behavior compared to the cryptocurrency market. Hence, we extend previous studies by examining the herding frequency in both markets during periods of high fluctuation and frequent interest rate hikes. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between investors' herding behaviors and major event announcements during this special period. Additionally, it is imperative to acknowledge cross-market herding behaviors in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Major NFT platforms like OpenSea and Rarible accept cryptocurrencies as a means of transaction, enabling users to exchange cryptocurrencies for NFTs (Ante, 2022b; Osivand and Abolhasani 2021). Dowling (2022a) also find that participants in the NFT market recognize a significant overlap between the two markets because they understand that accessing and using cryptocurrencies can pose challenges and that those who already possess cryptocurrencies are more likely to invest in the NFT market. While some previous studies have explored the interaction of pricing efficiency between these two markets (Kong & Lin, 2021; Dowling, 2022a), limited emphasis has been placed on understanding how herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market impacts herding behavior in the NFT market. However, it is worth noting that currently, there is a lack of studies examining the relationship between investor behavior and sales volume in the NFT market with cryptocurrency price fluctuations, particularly considering the role of cryptocurrency herding behavior in linking these two markets. Thus, our study bridges this gap by providing a deeper understanding of the cross-market herding dynamics between these two interconnected markets. Our study contributes to understanding whether NFTs represent an independent asset class and how they potentially contribute to the growth of cryptocurrency markets. Should NFTs display a propensity for absorbing risk and remain unaffected by the herding behaviors observed in the cryptocurrency markets, they could serve as a valuable tool for diversifying investments and spreading risk, thereby contributing to the overall stability of financial markets. This study period captures the highly dynamic global macroeconomic environment and interest rate policies that triggered investor panic and influenced investor behavior in financial markets. Our paper thus provides insights into herd behavior during periods of heightened volatility, in comparison to previous studies such as Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a) and Amirat and Alwafi (2020), which examine herd behavior in relatively steady markets. Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, we adopt a rolling window method, following the approach of Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022b), which distinguishes our study from most previous research that uses the static model of Cross-Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD). In contrast, the rolling window method accounts for changes over time, making it more suitable for analyzing behaviors during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this study innovatively links herding behavior to the macro-environment by discussing how it responds to major event announcements, including the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate hikes. Secondly, our study specifically considers the role of cryptocurrency herding behavior in linking the NFT and cryptocurrency markets within our model, thereby complementing the growing body of NFT literature. This may be attributed to investors making more rational investment decisions in the Ethereum-priced NFT market compared to the broader cryptocurrency market. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of market dynamics and thus add to the current research realm by identifying the appropriate asset class for composing portfolios to mitigate the risks of a volatile macroeconomic environment. It holds significant implications for portfolio construction and risk hedging against market events. According to Bouri et al. (2019), Ng et al. (2022), and Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021), a relatively immature and emerging financial market such as the cryptocurrency market may exhibit significant herding behaviors due to information asymmetry and uncertainty regarding returns. Past studies such as Vidal-Tomás et al. (2019), Da Gama Silva et al. (2019), and Ballis and Drakos (2020) that rely on the CSAD and cross-sectional standard deviation (CSSD) of returns models find support for the static herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market. Their findings reveal a tendency for synchronized movements among the cryptocurrencies during both markets increases and declines. This suggests that other non-fundamental factors or market dynamics may be at play, influencing the herding behavior observed in the cryptocurrency market. However, certain studies do not find evidence of static herding behavior when utilizing the CSAD model. Instead, they employ the rolling window method to demonstrate significant time-varying herding behavior (Bouri et al., 2019; Amirat & Alwafi, 2020; Kurt Gümüş et al., 2019; Yousaf & Yarovaya, 2022a). Bouri et al. (2019) suggests that applying a static CSAD model may not be suitable for detecting herding behavior due to the presence of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the cryptocurrency data series. With the rolling window method, their daily prices for six major cryptocurrencies from August 2015 to December 2018 with 1242 observations show that time-varying herding behavior tends to occur during periods of increased market uncertainty. Amirat and Alwafi (2020) support the notion that static herding behavior is not evident, instead they find evidence of time-varying herding. They collect daily closing prices for the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from January 2015 to January 2019, covering a period of 1492 trading days. They suggest that this behavior may be associated with significant economic events at the time. Their hypothesis is substantiated by the observation in that periods of herding, identified through the rolling window method, correspond with price surges in 2017 and the official recognition of cryptocurrencies as legal tender under Japan's Payment Services Law. H1: There is time-varying herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets. Apart from Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021), various studies including Bouri et al. (2019), Amirat & Alwafi (2020), Demir et al. (2018), and Corbet et al. (2017) also highlight that, cryptocurrency market, being a component of the broader financial market, is susceptible to significant economic events such as the interest rate policies implemented by the Federal Reserve. According to these studies, significant economic policies have the potential to trigger herding behavior among investors in the cryptocurrency market. Hence, as part of our H1, we attempt to explore the time-varying herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets during periods of uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Besides policy announcements, media coverage also influences investors' behavior. Media coverage also includes key decisions by institutional investors or celebrities. For instance, Elon Musk's public support of Dogecoin on Twitter not only impacted the price of Dogecoin but also spurred investor attention and investment behavior towards other cryptocurrencies (Elsayed et al., 2024a; Elsayed et al., 2024b). Among existing empirical studies, the investigations of pricing efficiency and spillover effects in the NFT market are considered the two most representative directions, with most studies showing evidence of NFT market inefficiency. Specifically, Dowling (2022a) suggests that the rapidly expanding NFT market is in an early stage of searching for an appropriate pricing model. He collects data on all secondary market transactions of Decentraland tokens between March 2019 and March 2021 using automatic variance ratio (AVR) tests, automatic portmanteau (AP) tests, and Domínguez and Lobato (DL) consistency tests to validate the inefficiency of pricing in the NFT market, indicating that it is an unmatured and emerging market. Kong and Lin (2021) and Kampakis (2022) concentrate on a specific project, similar to Dowling (2022a) and use a hedonic regression model with a similar observed period to examine the pricing dynamics and return-risk trade-off of the CryptoPunks project, which is one of the most valuable NFTs. These studies investigate the extraordinary returns offered by NFTs compared to traditional assets, highlighting their association with high volatility. Kong and Lin (2021) further propose that the pricing of NFTs is predominantly influenced by factors such as token scarcity and investor preferences. Additionally, Vidal-Tomás (2022) explores the metaverse segment of NFTs and investigates their short- and long-term performance from October 2017 to October 2021. Similarly, Borri et al. (2022) extend their analysis to the broader NFT market and find that volatility and the NFT valuation ratio are significant predictors of NFT market returns. These studies collectively provide compelling evidence supporting the findings of Dowling (2022a) that pricing inefficiencies exist in the NFT market. Their investigation reveals that herding behavior is more widespread during the launch of submarkets. Furthermore, they argue that herding behavior exhibits a correlation with investor attention, predominantly influenced by media coverage. Jiang and Xia (2023) provide support for the view that investor attention can significantly amplify the volatility of NFTs, as demonstrated by their autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-mixed-data sampling (G-M) model. De Silva et al.(2024) employ a time-varying method using three different-length windows within the CSAD model, also suggesting that herding behavior exists in the NFT market because of media movement. However, Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022b) present contrasting findings as they collect daily data from May 16, 2020, to May 15, 2021, using the same model as Bao et al. (2022). NFTs, because of their scarcity and value distinguish them from cryptocurrencies, are seen as an important development direction of blockchain technology, and the existence of its market herd is controversial (Chohan, 2021). There has not been as much research on the NFT market herd as there has been on the cryptocurrency market. H2: There is time-varying herding behavior in NFT markets. The spillover effects of NFT are one of the most significant directions of empirical research, with various studies analyzing the interactions between NFT and other major asset classes. However, the interrelationship between NFT and major cryptocurrency markets remains debatable. Numerous studies argue that NFT is relatively independent of other cryptocurrency markets (Karim et al., 2022; Aharon & Demir, 2022; Yousaf and Yarovaya, 2022a). Dowling (2022b) conducts wavelet coherence analysis and finds a weak correlation between the NFT market and the cryptocurrency market. The study incorporates data from the NFT secondary market trades and traditional cryptocurrency market data, covering the period from March 3, 2019, to March 2021, and aims to investigate the transmission of volatility between NFT pricing and traditional cryptocurrency pricing. Karim et al. (2022) employ the quantile connectedness technique and demonstrate that NFT exhibits significant disconnection from other blockchain markets, offering potential diversification benefits and bearing significant risk. Aharon and Demir (2022) find that NFT is independent of shocks from other asset classes, exhibiting weak interaction and even absorbing risk during the COVID-19 period. Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a) examine volatility transmission links between NFT and other cryptocurrencies, corroborating Dowling's (2022b) conclusion regarding the decoupling of NFT from other markets. They propose that during periods characterized by a surge in demand for alternative investments and the pursuit of higher returns in a low-interest rate environment, NFT prices experience significant increases due to investors' aesthetic preferences. Umar et al. (2022a) also support the view that global investments were transferred to the cryptocurrency market from other markets, causing spillover effects between markets, using the TVP-VAR connectedness approach. Additionally, Elsayed et al. (2024b) suggest that other cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum) are influenced by price fluctuations in non-traditional crypto assets, especially when the market size of these assets increases. This impact is particularly significant due to the speculative nature of NFTs, which are often characterized by high market volatility. However, they partially consider the spillover effects between markets but do not fully account for other factors influencing herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market, such as macroeconomic trends. According to Wang et al. (2023), the trading volume of CryptoPunk in the short time before investors buy CryptoPunk has a negative relationship with the return of NFT, suggesting that investors interested in NFT should avoid joining the market when the market trading volume is at a high level. It indicates that NFT unique buyers are correlated with market volume. Their results show that there is a short-term causal relationship between NFT sub-markets. Umar et al.(2022a) also indicate that there are spillover effects among NFT segments by employing the TVP-VAR connectedness approach. Umar et al. (2022b) present separate findings based on different time intervals, revealing distinct relationships between NFT and other assets in various circumstances. They observe that NFT exhibits relative independence from other assets, but the linkages between NFT and other assets strengthen during periods of market volatility. The study divides the period from June 26, 2017, to October 29, 2021, into three subintervals and utilizes data from Bloomberg terminals, including NFT, Bitcoin price, MSCI World Equity Index, FTSE World Government Bond Index, gold, and crude oil, for empirical analysis. Based on the previous literature, we hypothesize that: H3: There is a relationship between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets. Our dataset comprises 1,216 daily observations, spanning from January 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2023. It includes several variables such as the daily number of unique buyers and unique sellers in the NFT market, as well as the closing prices of two categories of cryptocurrencies: NFT and traditional cryptocurrencies. To expand upon the dataset used by previous studies and for the purpose of examining time varying herding, we collect data for the top 10 cryptocurrencies in each category based on market capitalization. The selected cryptocurrencies must have at least one year of available data. For NFT market data, we obtain information from Cryptoslam Corporation (https://www.cryptoslam.io). As for traditional cryptocurrencies, we collect daily closing prices from the cryptocurrency exchange platform (https://coinmarketcap.com). Following the methodology employed by Yousaf and Yarovaya (2022a), we conduct an analysis of time-varying herding behavior in both the cryptocurrency market and NFT market. We calculate the Cross-Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD) value for each market and then utilize R to identify the specific dates on which herding behavior is observed. Shih et al. (2012) and Ferreruela et al. (2022) also support the notion of cross-market herding behavior through Granger causality tests. According to Christie and Huang (1995), herding behavior in financial markets refers to investors' tendency to buy or sell an asset based on the perceived opinions or actions of others. Therefore, we include the number of unique sellers and unique buyers as variables to measure changes in the NFT market. Our study opts to use the VECM model because it has the advantage of handling non-stationary time series with cointegration relationships, providing estimates of long-term equilibrium relationships, while connectivity methods focus primarily on detecting causal relationships between variables as applied by Elsayed et al.(2024a) and Umar et al. (2022a). Unlike Ante's (2022b) study, which does not distinguish between herding and stabilization scenarios in the cryptocurrency market, our research incorporates herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market as an exogenous dummy variable to account for the impact of herding. Various past studies also include exogenous dummy variables in their vector autoregressive models to account for various impacts such as financial crises (Jiang and Liu, 2011), airlines strike and war (Bonham et al., 2009), and Olympic Games (Yap and Allen, 2011) which enhance their analyses. Similarly, we utilize the variables NFT sales, bitcoin prices, and Ethereum prices, as employed in Ante's study, to investigate the impact of cryptocurrency market herding on the NFT market. A preliminary test is conducted to ensure the variables are suitable for our model. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test results allow us to assess whether multicollinearity exists among the model variables. Generally, the VIF criteria are as follows: VIF < 10: No significant impact on the model, though some degree of multicollinearity may exist(O'brien, 2007). The VIF results as shown in Table 1 for all variables in the current model fall within an acceptable range, indicating that the model is suitable for use. In line with Dowling's approach, we consider ETH (Ethereum) as the primary currency for issuing and trading NFTs, given its prominence and relevance in the NFT market. Additionally, BTC (Bitcoin) is selected as the largest and most significant cryptocurrency, serving as a reference market for our analysis. By incorporating these specific currencies and following Dowling's methodology, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics and interactions between NFTs and cryptocurrencies within the context of our analysis. We first employ Chang's et al. (2000) model as the measure of dispersion to investigate herding behavior in the rolling window method. To quantify this, we utilize the cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD), which is defined by Eq. where N = the number of cryptocurrencies (NFTs). Chang et al. (2000) provide the following Eq. If the coefficient of \({({R}_{{mt}})}^{2}\) is negative and statistically significant, it implies that the connection between the distribution of individual cryptocurrencies (NFTs) returns and cryptocurrencies (NFTs) market returns is non-linear, indicating the presence of market herding. As previously stated, the static model is sensitive to the chosen sample period, and it may not be suitable when there is a structural break in the data. Forecasting each series separately without considering the broken structure of the data often leads to undesirable outcomes (Zhang et al., 2017). Given that our selected sample period includes the Covid-19 crisis, which deviates from the conditions assumed by the static model, we have opted not to use it for examining herding behavior. We employ a more robust rolling window approach to assess the stability of model parameters and detect potential time-varying parameters. However, in our case, we choose a relatively short window length to ensure an adequate number of windows, enabling us to detect trends and capture any potential instability in the parameters (Stavroyiannis & Babalos, 2017). Therefore, in our case, we choose a relatively short window based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), traditionally using a 14 day period, which is a widely recognized technical indicator for evaluating overbought and oversold conditions. This period helps ensure an adequate number of windows, allowing us to detect trends and capture any potential instability in the parameters (Stavroyiannis and Babalos, 2017). It is considered optimal for capturing market dynamics without excessive noise or lag. ε represents the random disturbance term, which captures unmodeled factors. Hence, \({{\rm{Y}}}_{t}\) = (volume, unique buyer, bitcoin prices, Ethereum prices), and to incorporate cryptocurrency herding as an exogenous variable, we assign a value of 1 to \({D}_{t}\) to represent the day of herding and 0 otherwise. Our model's optimal lag length is determined based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Fransiska et al., 2018; Scott Hacker and Hatemi-J, 2008; Hatemi-J 2004; Hamilton, 1994). Such long-run connections make the VECM a suitable model to study any short-run deviations from the equilibrium relationship (Engle and Granger, 1987). Based on the Johansen cointegration test result (reported in section 4), we employ the vector error correction model (VECM) in our analysis. VECM is a combination of the vector autoregressive model and cointegration restrictions. The general VECM can be represented by Eq. The use of VAR or VECM models to study herding behavior is supported by information cascade theory. This theory explains how investors, in the face of uncertainty, are inclined to replicate the trades they observe, leading to herding behavior (Avery & Zemsky, 1998; Cipriani & Guarino, 2014). VAR models can capture the short-term dynamics of these cascades, while VECM model is suitable when long-run equilibrium relationships are expected, as often seen in interconnected markets (Park & Sabourian, 2011). These models allow us to study the observed trading actions on market behavior, particularly in highly fluctuating markets like cryptocurrency and NFT markets (Hirshleifer & Teoh, 2003). By modeling the dynamic interactions between observed actions and market outcomes, these models can shed light on how information cascades propagate herding behavior (Anderson & Holt, 1997). 1b depict the historical prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. Based on the figures, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum underwent a rapid surge starting in 2020 and continuing until early 2021. To be more specific, Bitcoin reached its relatively high price levels earlier and sustained them for a longer period, fluctuating within the upper price range during the first quarter of 2021, whereas Ethereum's price only reached a relatively high level during the first month of the second quarter, and its duration was very short. Subsequently, the prices dropped substantially until July, marking a nearly 50% decrease from their peak levels. However, from that point onwards, the prices experienced a steep decline, ultimately plummeting by a staggering 77% by 2023. Notably, August 2021 witnessed an incredible surge in NFT sales volume, while the remaining months of 2021 experienced a decline. However, as we may note from Fig. In April 2022, the sales volume reached its peak. Conversely, after May 2022, the sales volume experienced a significant decline, reaching a lower level, although it remained higher than the sales record in 2020. The analysis utilizes a rolling window method with a length of 14 days, selected to effectively capture the underlying trends. a Time-varying Herding in the Cryptocurrency Market. b Time-varying Herding in the NFT market. According to Sharma (2021), uncontrolled economic stimulus measures implemented during the economic slowdown, such as extensive money printing coupled with macroeconomic instability resulting from low-interest rates, led to the depreciation of the dollar, increased inflation rates, and raised investor concerns. However, the halving of Bitcoin in May 2020, which reduces the rate of Bitcoin inflation and emphasizes its scarcity, encouraged investors to shift their funds from dollars to cryptocurrencies (Copeland, 2020). In late 2020, the announcement of investments in cryptocurrencies and their trading ecosystems by institutional investors and banks had a significant impact, particularly benefiting Bitcoin and fueling investor frenzy (Sharma, 2021). These factors contributed to the herding behavior observed during this period in the cryptocurrency market as depicted in Fig. In 2021, the herding behavior observed in the cryptocurrency market aligns with a period characterized by cryptocurrency price volatility, often referred to as a bubble period. During this period, significant price fluctuations were witnessed in Bitcoin. For instance, from February to March, the price of Bitcoin surged to new highs before experiencing a minor decline. Subsequently, following a bottoming out in July, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies embarked on a solid recovery, partially driven by Elon Musk's engagement with leading Bitcoin mining companies to develop more sustainable and efficient mining practices (Ante, 2023). These specific timeframes in 2021 coincide with the bubble period, providing evidence of time-varying herding behavior in traditional cryptocurrencies. 2a, coincided with the Federal Reserve's announcements of interest rate increases. This suggests that investor herding behavior is influenced by economic policy, which aligns with the conclusions drawn by Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021). This perception is evident from the investor herding behavior observed in both 2020 and 2022. According to Corbet et al. (2019), monetary policy decisions made by the FOMC, particularly those concerning interest rates, exert a significant impact on Bitcoin prices. 1a, b. Conversely, as investors perceive the dollar as a stable currency with minimal risk of rapid depreciation, the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in March, followed by an additional 50 basis points in May, culminating in a 75-basis point increase in June 2022, becomes even more appealing (see Table 2, Panel B). This prompts investors to shift their funds from risky cryptocurrency investments to dollar-denominated financial markets, resulting in a significant decline in cryptocurrency prices. These findings consequently imply the potential utility of Bitcoin as a risk management tool, particularly in the face of unpredictable interest-rate risk shocks. They suggest that investors may consider incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios as part of their risk analysis and management strategies. According to Table 2, Panel A, herding behavior occurs from 3 days before to 10 days after the announcement, except for the event on July 21, 2021. Moreover, herding behavior is not persistent over time but it occurs periodically. This is in line with the observation by Qiang (2023). Moreover, investors postponed their reaction during the herding period on October 12th, primarily because Bitcoin's value increased further as global markets improved, and traders were awaiting the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data while also monitoring a significant upgrade to the Ether blockchain (Bloomberg, 2022; Qiang, 2023). From February to August 2020, the presence of herding behavior in the NFT market can be attributed to market inefficiencies, aligning with the findings of Bao et al. (2022) and Dowling (2022a). Furthermore, herding behavior can be observed in the NFT market from May to September 2022 and April 2023. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency market also exhibits herding behavior (see both Figs. Thus, our hypotheses H1 and H2 are both supported. Consequently, it is reasonable to speculate that there may be a causal relationship between the NFT and cryptocurrency markets. It is observed that all variables have mean values greater than their corresponding standard deviations, indicating an under-dispersed distribution. Unit root test results (Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)) are shown in Table 4, indicating that all the variables are stationary at their first difference level, which means that they are in the same order of integration, making VAR a suitable method. Yet, as shown in Table 5, on the basis of eigenvalues, Trace test and Maximum Eigenvalue test, our Johansen test of cointegration indicates one cointegration relationship, thus making the VECM as our model. After confirming the presence of a long-run association between our variables, we examine the long-run dynamics among these variables. The results show that all the p-values (in Table 6) are greater than 5%, suggesting that there is no evidence of serial correlation in our model. The long-run relationship among the proposed variables for one cointegrating vector is displayed below (standard errors are displayed in parenthesis). Table 7 displays the short-run Granger causality test results, which assess whether a change in one variable precedes a change in other variables. These statistics are computed for each combination of our dependent and independent variables. To illustrate, the first row of results shows whether all independent variables (ETH price, the number of unique buyers and Bitcoin price) significantly impact NFT sales. Since the estimates of these independent variables exceed the significance threshold of 10%, we cannot conclude that ETH price, Bitcoin price, and the number of unique buyers Granger-cause NFT sales. It demonstrates similar results, indicating that neither Bitcoin price, Ethereum price, nor NFT sales Granger cause the number of unique buyers. We conduct a further test by substituting variables. It is important to note that variables in the further test are stationary at I(1), and again the Johansen cointegration test confirms the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between them. Table 8 presents the results of our robustness test, which reveal important insights. The number of unique sellers exhibits a Granger-causal relationship with NFT sales volume at the 1% significance level (see first row of Table 8). However, the null hypothesis that the prices of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) do not Granger-cause NFT market-related variables is accepted (see first and third rows of Table 8). Combined with the result mentioned above, where the number of unique buyers Granger-causes Ethereum's price, this enhances our findings that investors in the NFT market have a significant impact on Ethereum's price. On the other hand, Bitcoin's price is influenced by Ethereum's price at the 5% significance level, indicating a Granger-causal relationship between these two cryptocurrencies during periods of market herding. However, NFT market-related variables do not significantly affect Bitcoin's price (see forth row of Table 8). Our Granger causality results suggest that, the number of investors in the NFT market have cross-market influence in cryptocurrencies' prices. Figure 3 shows the relevant impulse response function results. Specifically, it illustrates the response of cryptocurrency prices to a unit shock in the number of investors, including both unique sellers and buyers, and also shows the response of investors to a unit shock in cryptocurrencies prices. Impulse response functions based on the VECM are shown for a time horizon of ten days. Unlike VAR, impulse response functions of a VECM need not return to their mean value, as series are cointegrated in the long-run (Mills, 1998, Ante, 2022b). 3) to a unit shock in the number of investors (both unique buyers and unique sellers) in the NFT market is negative and exhibits a decreasing trend. Comparing the left and right columns of Fig. In addition, long-term herding effects captured by the VECM model reflect more stable, equilibrium-driven behaviors that emerge over extended periods. The unique buyer would cause the increasing price of cryptocurrencies for both Bitcoin and Ethereum; however, the increasing price of cryptocurrencies would not cause an increase in the number of unique active wallets (both sellers and buyers) in NFT markets. We argue that the herding behavior in these markets is influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, corroborate with Omane-Adjepong et al. (2021) and Amirat and Alwafi's (2020) view. Furthermore, we observed that the herding behaviors in our study are not persistent over time but happened periodically as they are related to the major event announcements, not only to the FOMC meeting announcements but also the influencers and institutional investors' decisions. Our analysis also reveals more instances of herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market compared to the NFT market, implying that NFTs possess more characteristics of an asset than a liquid currency because the NFT market does not react quickly to changes in other markets. While herding behavior is present in the NFT market, it can be attributed to the market's initial inefficiency during its early development and the subsequent rapid growth in 2021. These findings are consistent with the explanations provided by Bao et al. (2022) and Dowling (2022a, 2022b). Therefore, our finding supports the conclusions of Zhang et al. (2022) and Umar et al. (2022c), suggesting that NFTs can be considered relatively independent assets for portfolio construction and risk hedging purposes, as argued by Kong and Lin (2021). It should be noted that in portfolio construction, it is the overall value of the entire NFT projects that is being considered, in which the NFT projects may consist of multiple unique NFTs. Finally, we identify a mutual Granger-causal relationship among cryptocurrencies. Our study highlights the presence of herding behavior in both the cryptocurrency and NFT markets, suggesting important strategies for investors and policy implications. For investors, the findings suggest that investors need to be sensitive and cautious especially during major market events such as FOMC meetings and key decisions by institutional investors. Investors should diversify their portfolios to reduce the risks of these periodic herding behaviors, especially in the more volatile cryptocurrency market. As NFTs show relative independence from cryptocurrency market fluctuations, they offer an opportunity for risk hedging and diversification, which could help stabilize portfolios. From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that regulators should focus on mitigating the effects of herding behavior, particularly in the cryptocurrency market, where it is more prevalent. This could include implementing measures to monitor cryptocurrency exchanges and the substantial electricity fees associated with cryptocurrency mining to increase market transparency. Additionally, introducing policies to reduce the influence of speculative behaviors, such as increasing the value of collateral for NFT transactions to decrease the possibility of flash loans, could be beneficial. Policymakers should also monitor the NFT market's rapid growth and inefficiencies, ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect investors. Limitations in our study should be acknowledged. Moreover, due to the accessibility of off-chain NFT transactions, our study primarily relies on on-chain data, excluding a portion of the market conducted through private sales or via third-party platforms. These off-chain transactions can be significant and may influence overall market dynamics, particularly when capturing the full extent of herding behavior in the NFT market. Another limitation is the variation in NFT transactions across different blockchain platforms. Our study does not differentiate between NFTs built on various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana). Given that the majority of NFTs are built on Ethereum, we focused solely on data from this blockchain, which could potentially introduce biases in analyzing NFT market behavior. Second, we recognize that certain characteristics of NFTs as a unique asset are not fully explored in our research. For instance, the unique nature of NFTs may make them symbolic of social status, as observed when celebrities endorse and promote them on social media, leading to a surge in sales volume driven by influential individual purchasers rather than market dynamics. This characteristic of NFTs is not explicitly considered in our study. Finally, with regards to the issue of wash trading via flash loans, our study does not specifically control for such manipulative practices. Flash loans are used to artificially inflate trading volumes, which can distort market activity and affect price discovery in the NFT market. While our approach focuses on the broader relationship between NFTs and cryptocurrencies, it does not address these market distortions. This limitation presents an avenue for future research. For instance, future research could explore the application of machine learning techniques to identify and filter out wash trading activities. Moreover, while our study relies on traditional econometric models, incorporating machine learning techniques in future studies could offer additional insights into the complexities of NFT and cryptocurrency markets. Methods like random forest, XGBoost, or neural networks could help in modeling nonlinear relationships, identifying patterns in large datasets, and improving prediction accuracy. This could also allow for real-time monitoring of market trends and herding behavior. Amirat A, Alwafi W (2020) Does herding behavior exist in cryptocurrency market?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, altcoins are making a comeback and the SEI Crypto (SEI/USDT) chart is flashing early bullish signals again. According to CoinGecko, SEI's chart is caught between pressure and potential. Resistance at $0.203-$0.204 has stalled every bounce so far, while tightening Bollinger Bands signals the calm before another move. With RSI drifting near 45, momentum is cooling but far from dead. Resistance remains firm at $0.203-$0.204, the ceiling short-term traders have repeatedly defended. Moreover, Bollinger Bands are tightening, a classic precursor to volatility expansion, while RSI hovers around 45, signaling cooling momentum but not capitulation. In a recent Blockcast interview at Token2049 Singapore, Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, described the city as a “vital hub” for both development and expansion across Asia. “The density of talent in Singapore is unbelievable,” Feng said. SEI's network is stretching past finance and trying to break into unproven Web3 sectors like gaming, social apps, even tokenized DNA. Additionally, the chain's pending acquisition of a 23andMe business unit would let users trade and stake their own genetic data, turning personal biology into an on-chain asset. DeFi Llama data shows total value locked (TVL) on SEI exceeding $469 Mn, making it one of 2025's fastest-growing L1s. With a tightening Bollinger setup and institutional expansion in Asia, SEI may be positioning for an L1 rotation trade if altcoins regain momentum later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, the Treasury Department finished receiving responses to a request for comments on “Innovative Methods To Detect Illicit Activity Involving Digital Assets.” It turns out I have such a thing in mind. It's just a matter of weeks before the law enforcement dynamics around digital assets—and in general—change completely. A few months ago, I wrote in characteristically laudatory terms about the GENIUS Act. In my role as skunk at the garden party, I pointed out that GENIUS stablecoins will be “horrible on privacy.” I also sought to show how GENIUS doled out favors to select business sectors, guaranteeing that stablecoin holders will lose the benefits they could reap from digital currency. The GENIUS Act also called for a study of “anti–money laundering innovation.” That, I said, is an understated admission that today's financial surveillance policies are questionable. Two years ago, I broached the idea of a system that would allow for law enforcement to query participants in financial transactions, obviating the need for wholesale financial surveillance. Here's the background: Money has evolved over recent centuries from movements of tangible things to digital communications events. Over the last half-century, financial surveillance law has taken root. The product of the two trends is a comprehensive, global financial surveillance regime that has substantial costs in both dollar terms and in values such as privacy, free speech, and autonomy. My article goes through how those costs appear to vastly outstrip the benefits of such surveillance. I rely heavily on superlative research from Ronald Pol, who has more evidence coming out soon to show the weakness of global financial surveillance. In place of broad financial surveillance, I propose a system through which law enforcement agencies could query digital transactors for investigative purposes. Such a system would maintain or strengthen law enforcement capabilities while obviating the existing broad and costly financial surveillance regime. You can decide for yourself how well I do as a sociologist and criminologist. For many, this may be a daunting, heavily technical idea, too difficult to grok. As I write, “Where law enforcement need is shown, people should be able to participate in detecting wrongdoing and catching wrongdoers. For some, that is contrary to the ethos of digital currency, which is to escape the oppressions of present-day surveillance-mongers. Crypto users, I'm confident, don't want their networks to be powerful and ready tools for ransom-takers, terrorists, child-abusers, and every other type of wrongdoer. Because a system for communicating law enforcement queries to global transactors would be “retail,” it would allow for political feedback loops that cause law enforcement practices and priorities to hew more closely to public values than the current “wholesale” financial surveillance system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally. Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains. The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on “cryptographic proof instead of trust” and the problems with traditional systems being related to “all the trust that's required to make it work,” much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called “stablechains,” which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma. More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks. As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain. Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size war back in 2017. However, Ethereum's reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology. Contrastly, Bitcoin's main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network. While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term Bitcoin holders took profits at record levels with realized gains hitting $1.7 billion daily as older coins re-entered circulation. The failure of crypto markets to recover was not due to manipulation, paper Bitcoin, or suppression, “just good old-fashioned sellers,” said analyst James Check on Sunday. Another chart showed that realized profit had spiked to $1.7 billion per day while realized losses climbed to $430 million per day, the third highest level this cycle. Meanwhile, the “revived supply” from older coins reached its second-highest level at $2.9 billion per day. Crypto investor Will Clemente said that “the last year of relative weakness for BTC has mostly been a transfer of supply from OGs to TradFi,” which can be seen in onchain data. Related: John Bollinger says to ‘pay attention soon' as big move could be imminent Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz echoed the sentiment in an interview with Raoul Pal last week. Novogratz confirmed that the only supply his firm has seen is “old OGs” and miners. Bitcoin has held onto support with a weekly closing candle at $108,700, according to TradingView. “Continued holding here could see price rally to $120k+ over time. Stability here is absolutely key,” said analyst “Rekt Capital” on Sunday.

One of those officials is the PBoC governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, who claimed stablecoins are a security risk for the financial system. Central banks currently have at least two key concerns. GENIUS Act and Hong Kong's Stablecoin Ordinance have noted these risks, though control remains insufficient. In August, Mainland regulators also asked major brokerages to stop publishing research that endorses stablecoins, and in recent weeks advised leading firms in Hong Kong to slow real-world asset tokenisation initiatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All the conditions are in place for a spectacular rally: abundant money supply, easy financial conditions, and a US administration which is actively pushing crypto with favourable deregulation and the creation of a strategic reserve to boost its price. And yet, after a rally to an all-time peak at the start of October, Bitcoin has fallen hard, shedding some 15% of its value in just the last two weeks. Sharp volatility isn't unusual in crypto but this pullback has happened at a time when the broader market has either held steady or kept rallying. It could be that Bitcoin's seemingly relentless upward climb will resume in the coming days and that all this will turn out to be much ado about nothing. But the past fortnight could also be a harbinger of its eventual demise. The Bitcoin oligarchs may find it eventually explodes in their hands. Yet the revolution in finance it was meant to bring about never took place. True, for those rebels who got in early, Bitcoin has certainly paid off handsomely. Worth mere pennies at its creation, it surpassed the $10,000 mark by the end of its first decade and is worth over $100,000 today. Beyond that, though, not much remains of Bitcoin's early, idealistic vision. There was admittedly some democratisation, as over 50 million people bought Bitcoin — more if one includes people who've bought shares in funds that own Bitcoin. Yet it never managed to become an actual currency, being too cumbersome and volatile to be useful as a medium of exchange. More tellingly, the crypto universe is now dominated by a handful of oligarchs managing large funds and “Bitcoin treasuries” who, by forging close ties with the Trump administration, have used state patronage to boost their asset values, much as the banks did in 2008. Trump and his family have themselves reportedly made $1 billion off their crypto creations. This isn't the radical, decentralised financial system we were promised. Rather than treat crypto as an alternative financial system, these “crypto-garchs” have turned it into a speculative asset, whose price they manipulate through Bitcoin treasuries — large funds whose purpose is to take Bitcoin off the market so as to further boost its price. The biggest of these funds is MicroStrategy (which, though recently re-branded as Strategy, still goes by the stock-ticker label of MSTR). MSTR was originally a software company founded in 1989 by American entrepreneur Michael Saylor. After a history of setbacks and repeated run-ins with regulatory and tax authorities, Saylor finally found his pot of gold in 2020. Saylor used his company's cash to buy a relatively small stash of Bitcoin. When it rose in value, his plan took flight. The business model was simple: by buying Bitcoin in large quantities, MSTR helped bid up its price. And on it went for the next four years in a virtuous — to the company and its shareholders — upward spiral. The value of MSTR's Bitcoin holdings rose from $250 million in 2020 to over $40 billion this year, while MSTR's share price shot up from $12 to over $400 in the same time span. Taking over the market in this way gave the crypto-garchs both economic and political leverage: economic, in that by removing Bitcoin from circulation they reduced the market's liquidity, which amplified the impact of their further purchases, since they were now bidding for a smaller pool of Bitcoin. Although originally a crypto-sceptic, calling it a scam as recently as 2021, Trump saw the opportunity in forging ties with an industry that was then out of favour. The industry donated more than $130 million to election campaigns, with an eye on displacing crypto-sceptics and supporting their backers, led by Trump. In return, Trump promised to lift regulation and promote the industry. After Trump won the election, he came good on his pledges. He appointed big crypto-donors such as Howard Lutnick to his Cabinet, ended investigations into firms such as Gemini, which is owned by the same Winklevoss twins who'd donated $3 million to his political action committee, and withdrew a lawsuit against Coinbase, which together with some of its owners had contributed some $16 million to Trump's campaign funds. After announcing his plan to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump hosted several crypto-garchs at the White House, Michael Saylor among them, to discuss its implementation. MSTR raised $21 billion in share sales, giving it a powerful armoury to juice the Bitcoin price further. But for all its lucre, there was an obvious flaw in this plan. Given the relatively low volume of Bitcoin trades on any given day, even a small sale will sharply raise the supply — MSTR alone owns more Bitcoin than trade daily, so even a small liquidation of its portfolio would cause prices to fall sharply. Since then, the company has struggled to raise new share capital. The debt MSTR raised to buy Bitcoin doesn't come due for another two years, and having purchased its stash of Bitcoin for an average price of around $74,000, it's still nearly 50% up. But if Bitcoin doesn't resume rising, MSTR will struggle to raise more capital. MSTR is still buying Bitcoin at a weekly rate, but it is paying above market rates and its purchases have grown much smaller. This may explain why the gold market is booming as Bitcoin suffers. It appears that investors believe that if the only thing left of Bitcoin is a digital equivalent to gold — a store of value with limited fungibility — they might as well stick with the original. After all, humans have turned to gold amid social and economic crises for millennia, but have only held Bitcoin for a few years. If they sense a major crash might be coming, atavism may lead them back into the fold of what they know to work. In the short term, given all the favourable tailwinds, it seems more likely than not that Bitcoin will resume its rise. Bitcoin has now spread so deeply into the formal system that a major crash would likely force other liquidations as fund managers looked to cover their losses, possibly starting a chain-reaction through markets. And while oligarchs in 2008 had every reason to expect the government would bail them out, this time might be different. If this ends up toppling a few oligarchs, Bitcoin's original creators may feel their vision came true after all.
