                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert are following up on a heartbreaking video chronicling a previous pregnancy loss, thanking fans for their outpouring of love and support. “There are some things in life that change you forever. For us, this is one of those things,” she wrote in the caption. “A chapter of love, loss, heartbreak, and everything in between.” He continued, “When we decided to share this part of our journey, it was because hearing other people's experiences during our own heartache truly helped us feel less alone.” Hough added, “Wherever you are in your journey, hope is a powerful companion. “We just wanted to come on here real fast and say thank you so much for all your beautiful and kind messages for the post we did the other day talking about our loss last year,” Hough began in the video. And when we went through that experience, it truly helped so much to hear our close friends' stories that they had also experienced the same thing. So we just wanted to share and hope that it could help somebody along the way.” Hough recalled, “When Hayley and I found out, it was absolutely devastating. After Hough noted the emotions involved in processing a loss, Erbert shared, “It feels isolating. But knowing that it's so common and having people talk to you about their experience truly feels like you're a little less alone.” Hough added, “It doesn't take away the heartbreak … but we hope that by sharing, we're able to bring maybe a little bit of comfort, or a little bit of connection and something that we can relate to and connect with, even with the pain. “I had eight years of fertility issues before having our rainbow baby,” one fan wrote. Another fan noted, “Hayley and Derek, you are an extraordinary couple. You have had so many challenges the last few years. You have handled all with unbelievable strength, positivity, class, and true grace. The love you share is so powerful that we can feel it in your posts. One fan commented, “You two have tackled so much in a short time. Your strength and love for one another is so evident.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swift's Hot 100 haul is led by “The Fate of Ophelia,” at No. The album adds a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, following its modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million equivalent album units. Below are more highlights of Swift's latest triumphant week on the Hot 100. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “The Fate of Ophelia” drew 49.1 million official streams (down 47%) and 42.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 10%) and sold 11,000 in the United States Oct. 10-16. 1 on the Digital Song Sales chart, becoming Swift's record-extending 30th leader; adds a second week atop Streaming Songs; and climbs 7-5 on Radio Songs, becoming just the third title to reach the top five in two weeks or fewer since the ranking began measuring all-format airplay in December 1998, joining Adele's “Easy on Me” (one week, 2021) and Lady Gaga's “Born This Way” (two, 2011). A week earlier, “The Fate of Ophelia” drew 92.5 million streams — the most for a song in a single week since all YouTube user-generated content (UGC) was removed from chart calculations in September 2020. “The Fate of Ophelia” is the first song to clear the mark in its first two weeks since two hits in May-June 2024: Lamar's “Not Like Us” (its first four) and Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen (two). Since September 2020, “The Fate of Ophelia” is Swift's first song with multiple, and consecutive, weeks of more than 40 million streams. “The Fate of Ophelia” became Swift's 13th career Hot 100 No. (Beyoncé's total above does not include her 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 as a member of Destiny's Child, while Jackson's doesn't include his 10 weeks on top as part of the Jackson 5.) Swift also ties for the fifth-most multiple-week Hot 100 No. 1s, as “The Fate of Ophelia” becomes her eighth such leader. Two songs break up Swift's 12 in the Hot 100's top 14 spots, led by HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's record-slaying animated movie KPop Demon Hunters. Plus, Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which led the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, jumps 14-4, while ruling Radio Songs for an 18th week, up 1% to 78.5 million in audience — a new weekly best for the track. 1 runs of Miley Cyrus' “Flowers” (2023) and Goo Goo Dolls' “Iris” (1998); only Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (27 weeks, 2024-25) and The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (26 weeks, 2020) have led longer. Effective this week, on the first Hot 100 of Billboard's 2026 chart year, altered tiers will dictate when songs move to recurrent status following their runs on the ranking. Previously, descending songs were removed from the Hot 100 once falling below No. Descending songs will now depart via the following thresholds, once they are: Plus, holiday classics will qualify to return above No. 50 regardless of total chart weeks, and then be subject to the rules noted above upon their descents; the same for newly-surging non-holiday catalog songs, with those without significant chart history eligible to debut at any rank, as considered individually. Songs will also continue to be removed from the all-format Radio Songs chart once they go recurrent on the Hot 100. Concurrently, as reflected on Billboard airplay charts, radio stations are now generally holding onto hits longer and in frequent airplay rotations. The latest adjustments will alleviate congestion in various regions of the Hot 100, helping to move out songs that have gone recurrent at radio formats and/or are no longer actively being promoted by labels for DSP playlisting. In especially recent years, songs have logged some of the longest Hot 100 runs to date, led by Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which leaves the Oct. 25 chart after a record 112-week stay. Other hits that move to recurrent status this week include Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things,” after 89 weeks, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile,” after 60.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Task,” especially Season 1, Episodes 6 and 7.] While on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, creator Brad Ingelsby admitted he was nervous about how audience's would react to last night's far less action-pack finale. “There's a negative in some way to having such a big explosion [in Episode 6] — that's the high point of action in the show, you're never going be able to replicate that or do anything close to that, and it's still one episode left,” said Ingelsby. Related Stories Ethan Hawke Keeps Getting Better, as Music Enriches His Art Actor-Turned-Director Harris Dickinson and His Breakout Star Frank Dillane on Their Stunner ‘Urchin' But the “Task” creator was quick to point out “Mare” was a whodunnit being led by a cop (Kate Winslett) avoiding facing her son's suicide. “Task,” in addition to being more “Heat” than mystery, was led by an investigator Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo), who comes out of the near-death experience of the investigation ready to confront the family tragedy he had been avoiding. It's an arc thats emotional resolution required the time and space of last night's tear-jerking finale. “I'm sure there's going to be people who watch the show and go, ‘Man, Episode 6, that was it for me,'” said Ingelsby. “But I hope they do stick around, because the emotional payoffs are quite high.” “It's always between A and B, and because if it's a guy who's lost his faith and then has to let his son come home, I know that the story has to take place within those two edges,” Ingelsby said describing how his writing process was shaped by knowing Tom's arc centering on his loss of faith. That's right, Ingelsby went into writing “Task” not knowing the FBI would clash with the Dark Hearts biker gang in Episode 6, but he did know Tom would end up giving that courtroom speech in Episode 7. While on the podcast, Ingelsby talked about how Tom was inspired by one of his many Delaware County relatives. He's not an FBI agent, but my uncle would give last rites in the hospital,” said Ingelsby. The “Task” creator liked the idea of how being a former priest better equips Tom to receive Robbie at a moment of crisis (the car ride in Episode 5), and comfort him at his moment of death (the car ride in Episode 6) based on having given last rites and his experience dealing people's fear of death at the end. Tom being a former priest also gave his loss of faith, and the subsequent leap of faith he takes in Episode 7, that much more dramatic impact. But that emotional dissonance is part of the point. “I know audiences might struggle with [not keeping Sam], but that was really important to me because when I was writing the story, it's not about keeping Sam, it's about embracing his son and getting the house ready for his son to come home. “There is a danger that it can be very hokey,” said Ingelsby of the courtoom speech. So, what was the key to it not being hokey? Not surprisingly, Ingelsby, a research junkie, found the answer working with “Task” mental health consultant Ariel Stern and reading testimonials of parents and care-givers about the difficulty of caring for a child, like Ethan, with severe mental issues. “One of the things that stood out to me when I was talking to Ariel, or reading an article, was ‘Weekends were the worst for me as a parent,'” said Ingelsby, quoting a line from Ruffalo's courtroom speech, which came directly from reseach. For Ingelsby who, like most parents, looks forward to the weekends as the time he gets to enjoy his kids, that line hit hard. And I wanted Tom to not run from that. I wanted him to acknowledge that it was hard,” said Ingelsby. “I think once we got to acknowledging the hardness of that, then it felt we'd earned the right to [have] some [dialogue], that on its own could be hokey, like, ‘He called me Dad. There is a confessional aspect to Tom's courtroom statement — the theme of confession running throughout the series paying off in this moment. And Mark, he's just so good in that scene.” The decision for Tom to read from prepared remarks — rather off-the-cuff and from the heart as we've come to expect in these type of scenes — was important for two reasons. One is dramatically obvious: It sets up the powerful moment, where Tom puts down his typed statement to finally make eye contact with Ethan (“Ethan, look at me, son”). But for Ingelsby, the carefully crafted written words also spoke to where Tom is at the final moments of “Task.” “Like a priest at the podium giving a homily, it just felt like he had taken the time and care,” said Ingelsby. “I always feel like ‘Mare' was a show about a woman who avoided having to face the death of her son. And so [it meant something] for him at the end to have been through the craziness of this case, to sit down and take the time to write his thoughts that he's been avoiding, and also to take the burden off of [his daughter] Emily (Silvia Dionicio). That was the act of grace, ‘Emily, I don't want this to be your choice. Ingelsby didn't want to show us Ethan's homecoming. The idea of having cake and celebrating their reunification months later would be a false note. “What it meant for me was Tom cleaned, he got his son's room ready, he's readying for his son to return,” said Ingelsby of the last scene. And it's not that he knows he's going to be OK, it's that he knows it's going to be hard, and it's going to be challenging, but there is a spirit in him that is ready to face what's coming in a way that he was not ready at the beginning of the show.” To hear Brad Ingelsby‘s full interview, subscribe to the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

The Solution Entertainment Group handles international sales excluding Spain and will continue to cook up deals with buyers ahead of the upcoming American Film Market. “Shooting at sea is one of the hardest things you can do in film but the footage we're getting is stunning,” added producer Adrián Guerra. “The cast has bonded in a way that's rare and powerful, and Renny's directing chops are on full display—balancing raw spectacle with real human emotion.” The film will mark 25 year-old Ella Bleu Travolta's fifth screen role.

Netflix Lands Holiday Comedy 'The In-Claus' From Lord Miller And Writer Travis Braun 'Run Away': First Look At Harlan Coben's Latest Netflix Thriller While heavily into the world of politics, their business and personal lives intersected with Hollywood across multiple generations. Before helping to launch the political careers of his three sons, Joe Kennedy had a high-profile government career of his own. The series received 24 Emmy Awards from its total 87 nominations, including Best Drama Series for Season 4 in 2021, and multiple acting awards. In addition to Shaw, Vinterberg and Logevall, executive producers are Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping and Kaitlin Dahill for Chernin Entertainment, Eric Roth, Lila Byock, Anya Epstein, Dustin Thomason and Anna O'Malley. Up next, he will be seen in Hope, the film written, directed and produced by Na Hong-jin in which he stars alongside his wife Alicia Vikander, to be released next year. He is perhaps best known for his work in the Alien franchise film Prometheus, set before the original Alien film released in 1979; playing Steve Jobs in the eponymous biopic from Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle; and starring as Magneto in four X-Men franchise films.

In the movie, which premiered on October 19, 2025, there's a plot twist as Monica and Michael are working to get soulmates Daisy and Patrick to connect; the two angels start having unexpected feelings for each other. Given the angels' innocence and sole/soul focus on helping “tenderhearts” — their word for humans — Ory and Ayres decided it would only make sense to act like kids experiencing their first crush. And a first kiss between angels, they realized, had the potential to be “pretty awkward,” Ayres told EntertainmentNow ahead of the movie's premiere. “Chesapeake Shores” alum Ory and her creative partner, director Christie Will Wolf, co-wrote the script for “A Christmas Angel Match.” Still, Ory and Ayres realized as they arrived on set in Vancouver that they needed to get on the same page about how their angelic characters might behave, especially as they experienced romantic feelings for the first time. Ayres told EntertainmentNow, “I was like, ‘Wait, have they ever kissed? We were literally, on our first day of filming, talking through this. I was like, ‘So, these two have never felt love before in this condition, in this way, and they have never kissed!” “So that meant we get to have these childlike discoveries,” Ayres continued. So we were going back to what it felt like to be kids having a crush or their first kiss, trying these different ways of making that believable.” In one scene, the two angels get caught under the mistletoe, but are so adorably nervous about potentially kissing that they both pucker up without ever coming close to touching. “We were kind of choreographing how to have it be awkward and sweet, but with feeling,” Ayres said. Fans had strong feelings about “A Christmas Angel Match” right out of the gate, taking to social media with their reviews, including one who commented on Hallmark's Facebook post about the movie, “Omgoodness Im watching its at the end and Meghan Ory you wrote a great movie. Someone else commented, “I love whimsical Christmas movies like this one. Another fan sweetly shared, “I liked that they addressed the issue of screen time replacing human interaction. One viewer complained that the time Monica and Michael had been angels created too much of an age gap — “Too big of an age difference to match. Other viewers were surprised by how different the movie felt from a typical Hallmark romance, even branding it “too silly.” But different was exactly what Ayres told EntertainmentNow they were going for — leaning into the comedy with tongue-in-cheek scenes, amusing puns, whimsical sets and props, and “exploring different ways” to experience and cultivate love.

There has to be some kind of happy medium between the JJ Abrams “mystery box” school of publicity and campaigns that overshare every little bit long before a film or series is released. For a moment there, it seemed as if “Wicked: For Good” might have found it, at least in regards to some exciting new casting. In a recent interview with Deadline, director Jon M. Chu teased the voice casting of the iconic Cowardly Lion. While he didn't tell the trade who would be stepping into the fluffy mane, he hinted it was someone big, explaining that he sent the unnamed star a direct message on Instagram in an attempt to snag them for the part. He was like, ‘Why the fuck not, let's go!' Related Stories Ethan Hawke Keeps Getting Better, as Music Enriches His Art Actor-Turned-Director Harris Dickinson and His Breakout Star Frank Dillane on Their Stunner ‘Urchin' It'll be wild.” Frankly, we would have loved that of reveal. On Monday morning, an announcement was made on the “Wicked” Instagram account, with the brand-new “Wicked” star hiding behind a lion stuffed animal before revealing himself and saying: “See you in Oz!” OK, no complaints about the actual casting: it's Colman Domingo! (You can check out the, admittedly very cute, post below.) The beloved two-time Oscar nominee is no stranger to voice acting: he's also voiced roles in “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Ruby Gilman, Teenage Kraken,” and “The Electric State.” As the iconic big scaredy cat, Domingo will be tasked on a well-loved role and making it his own. Universal will release the film in theaters on Friday, November 21.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel‘s short-lived suspension from ABC may have had a significant impact on Disney+ subscriptions, according to new data from the subscription analytics firm Antenna, which tracks subscriptions and viewership data for major streaming services. Ryan Murphy Praises Kim Kardashian and Refers to 'All's Fair' Cast as "This Season's Lady Avengers" A source notes, however, that the pending cancelations subsided quickly, and that while people tend to be loud when dropping a service, they often quietly return afterward. Ratings for Kimmel's show have also soared after the move. The Antenna data also carries some asterisks, a Disney source notes. It is not clear how Antenna views upgrades or downgrades as part of Disney's wholesale business, and that the numbers appear higher than Disney's internal data. It's also not clear how many subscribers left because of Kimmel and how many left because of planned price hikes that were announced amid the drama. The elevated churn came amid Kimmel's suspension from his ABC late night show over a somewhat ambiguously worded on-air comment on the Sept. 15 edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live! ABC ultimately returned him to the air after less than a week, but his suspension sparked enormous outrage, with many users on social media urging followers to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. In fact, Kimmel's friend, the influential SiriusXM host Howard Stern, said on his show that he had canceled Disney+ in protest of the move by Disney. Still, the new data suggests that churn doubled, which would be consistent with a loss of around three million subscribers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here, the 49 top agents and managers who guide the most successful creators as they leap from a few thousand followers to multimillion-dollar partnerships. These three managers have a knack for growing brands: In 2020, Arias orchestrated a partnership between Sarah Cheung and incubator Gloss Ventures to launch SACHEU Beauty. Berger sold TikToker Eli Rallo's fiction debut, I Hope Eden Reads This, which releases next month. This CEO makes sure top creators aren't missing out on opportunities, especially in China. He oversees Jimmy Donaldson's, aka MrBeast's, business there, while expanding the brand of family creators Jordan and Salish Matter, who have over 55 million followers across platforms. Baumel also launched a supplement called Molo for expectant mothers with influencer Rebecca Zamolo, now at Walmart. Rosenbaum has been the go-to for podcasters like Alex Cooper, while TikTok comic Veronika Slowikowska was just cast on SNL. Flynn helped Morgan Riddle land deals with the Tennis Channel and the NFL, while Alsberg signed Kai Cenat early on and works with major Black lifestyle creators on Twitch like Fanum and Duke Dennis. Bhatia was behind the launch of TikTok pop-culture expert Coco Mocoe's Middle Row talk show and landed YouTuber Nicole Rafiee a six-figure ambassadorship with NOCD while growing her Chronically Online Girl series into a YouTube franchise. After more than a decade in advertising, the agency founder hopped to conservative media brand The Daily Wire, where she helped make right-leaning influencers like Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens into household names. Now, she manages Brett Cooper, 23, one of the fastest-growing conservative stars on YouTube. In between running from NYC to the White House, the duo also have negotiated creator partnerships with Paramount, McDonald's, Amazon, Grubhub and Netflix. WME's team has surpassed $750 million in podcast deals, and co-head Davis' roster includes YouTube megastars such as Hot Ones' Sean Evans, techie Marques Brownlee and vlogger Casey Neistat. Agent Webb secured hosting roles for Pokimane and Ludwig with snack brand Takis' Super Bowl livestream. And agent Devlin landed Addison Rae a Super Bowl ad and podcaster Paige DeSorbo a Dunkin Donuts partnership, which resulting in billions of impressions. Range has a new division called Awareness Creation, aimed at targeting younger audiences for brands, and also will be helping clients like Warner Bros. and Applebee's go viral. He now helps oversee Çelik's relationship with Riot Games, which includes on-site co-streaming at major esports events. In just two short years, Goodfried, ex-head of digital at UTA, transformed Charli D'Amelio, one of the most followed TikTokers, into a multifaceted entertainer who debuted on Broadway this year with & Juliet and is the face of campaigns with CeraVe, Prada, Red Bull and Kate Spade. Night helped take MrBeast from a no-name kid in North Caroline to the most followed creator on YouTube. Gordon helped transform The Rizzler, a jolly 9-year-old, into this generation's Shirley Temple. Meanwhile, Huntzinger has guided Hasan Piker to becoming the most relevant left-leaning creator for young people. Jones has scaled up the creators division from 17 employees to more than 70 in just two years. VP Woessner has facilitated live events for her creators, bringing in seven-figure sponsorships for Tianna Robillard's Tianna's Night Out and podcaster Jenna Palek's sold-out Barre to Brunch tour. A former startup exec, Jacobs was hired by Brillstein in 2017 and has since landed major distribution deals and brand partnerships for digital talent. Among his clients are Ash Kelley and Alaina Urquhart, hosts of Morbid, a top true-crime podcast, Sheena Melwani, host of Sheena Interrupted, and Sabrina Deana-Roga and Corinne Vien, hosts of Two Girls One Ghost. Jones played a formative role in building the Hype House and has since helped other creators make their mark, including 26-year-old Mitchell Halliday, whose beauty brand Made by Mitchell made $1 million on TikTok in 12 hours after its launch. Wilhelm cut his teeth as a creator himself, eventually teaming up with Katz, former COO of gaming collective FaZe Clan, to manage over a dozen creators including YouTuber Funny Mike and Twitch streamer Sketch. With more than 16 million YouTube subscribers, the McCartys are a family vlogging phenom, and Linden has helped them negotiate multiple six-figure brand partnerships. Linden also orchestrated their Halloween special and merch line. Justine Ezarik, aka iJustine, has had a major year, from serving as a co-host at CES to working with blue-chip companies like Microsoft, John Deere, AT&T, Google and Tiffany & Co.

She's closed more than $100 million in deals for her comedy creators (Hannah Stocking, Adam Rose, Amanda McCants, Josh Peck). Sokolik has helped Alex Warren transform from a TikTok kid to a full-fledged pop star, performing with Ed Sheeran and racking up millions of plays on Spotify. Shahidi has been a mainstay in creator management since Vine. After transforming his Vine clients into YouTube superstars, he began managing pranksters the Nelk Boys, their mega-successful Happy Dad beverage brand and their political work advocating for Trump during last year's election. Shapiro has helped them tell their own stories, brokering a deal for Shari's New York Times best-selling memoir, The House of My Mother: A Daughter's Quest for Freedom. Sherman leads the division following Gersh's acquisition of A3 Artists Agency's digital department. She helped Ariana Madix capitalize on the attention around the Scandoval season of Bravo's Vanderpump Rules and also works with YouTube behemoths Smosh. Rusheen works with TikTok star turned red carpet interview master Reece Feldman, who made his filmmaker debut with the short Wait, Your Car? CAA made a big splash hiring veteran exec Weinstein, who built UTA into a digital powerhouse and pioneered the business models countless creators rely on today. Fotiadou signed Trisha Paytas in 2024, as her first talent rep in nearly 20 years, while Wasserman transformed YouTuber Amelia Dimoldenberg into a global superstar through her Chicken Shop Date interview series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kenny Loggins slammed President Donald Trump for sharing an apparently AI-generated video of him dumping shit on “No Kings” protesters, soundtracked to Loggins' classic Top Gun song, “Danger Zone.” “Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately.” In it, “Danger Zone” plays as an AI version of Trump, wearing a crown and piloting a military fighter jet emblazoned with “King Trump,” dumps what sure looks like feces on protesters. (Loggins' statement refers to it as “brown sludge.”) Beyond the allegedly unauthorized use of “Danger Zone,” Loggins said of the video, “I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us.” What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong Because the video was not created by Trump or the White House, Loggins' likely best recourse will be to file copyright complaints with X and Truth Social. Loggins now joins a long list of musicians who've been frustrated by Trump, or his surrogates and supporters, using their music. While those dustups have often centered around songs being played at campaign rallies, the Loggins situation most closely resembles an incident from last year when then-Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung (now White House communications director) posted a short clip featuring Beyoncé's “Freedom.” Beyoncé's team told Rolling Stone that the musician did not give the campaign permission to use the Lemonade track and threatened to send a cease-and-desist letter. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is out widely in U.S. theaters this Friday, October 24.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mystic elf Galadriel shows haunted adventurer Frodo Baggins a vision of what should happen if his mission fails: orcs loot the countryside, chaining hobbits into forced labor. A bleak orange sun rises over the hills. Smoke and fire dominate the blasted landscape. But when the Shire is ravaged in J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume novel—the final volume of which, The Return Of The King, celebrates its 70th anniversary of publication this week—it is men and hobbits, not orcs, who have done it. This destruction is revealed in one, solemn chapter, titled simply “The Scouring Of The Shire.” In essence, Frodo and his three hobbit friends, Sam, Pippin, and Merry, return after their journey across the kingdoms of Middle-earth. Ruffians cow the people into compliance with all the regular tools of state power: arrests, murders, cruel and unusual punishments. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking outflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been felled.” It is a scene of total environmental annihilation; the Shire made into a bleak, dirty place. It is easy to imagine the moment's cinematic power. The green wilderness and pastoral beauty of the Shire, which Frodo and the others forsook to wander blighted wastes and massive battlefields, has come to resemble that which they worked so hard to defeat. To be fair, there are more than a few reasons why multiple adaptations have forsaken the chapter. (You also don't need it to explain Frodo's eventual departure from Middle-earth, so the book's supremely moving final moments can remain intact.) The Scouring does resolve the hanging plotline of Saruman's ultimate fate, since he doesn't suffer death-by-Wormtongue quite so early in Tolkien's original narrative, but serves more as a coda than any essential portion of his story. It is easy to understand, from a strict efficiency-based point of view, why both the 1980 animated Return Of The King TV movie and Jackson's 2003 film omit it. Yet that is all using the narrow lens of plot. Even the places still untouched, which we cannot imagine being destroyed, face the devastation of profit motive. When Sam realizes that Frodo plans to leave, he is filled with dismay: “'But,' said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, ‘I thought you were going to enjoy the Shire, too, for years and years, after all you have done. '” Replies Frodo, “‘So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. The scene reflects both Frodo's ultimate victory and his most thorough defeat. Evil's triumph over the Shire was all too brief. In a few short years, much has been replanted and rebuilt. Yet Frodo's trials have so wounded him that he cannot enjoy it, much less steward it. As Pippin and Merry straddle worlds, moving between the Shire and the wider world as both warriors and ambassadors; as Sam builds a home and family, restoring the Shire's garden on the way; Frodo remains alone. Through all the Shire's green verdancy, something has been hollowed out, something which Sam will not regain until he joins Frodo across the sea. The orcs themselves were once elves, corrupted through dark magic. Saruman is a foreigner who conscripts other foreigners into strong-arming the honest, decent folk of the Shire. They represent a corrupting influence that the hobbits must purge through violent force. Aragorn's throne is only a partial restoration. There may be something more pure and eternal awaiting us on the other side, but the world we leave behind will someday die. Saruman's destruction of the Shire takes place over a few brief months; it takes years to restore it. When Frodo and crew arrive in the Shire, they find hobbits who are acquiescing and fearful, unquestioning of the rules. When they ask questions about how this came to be, one hobbit comments, “Even in the Shire there are some as like minding other folk's business and talking big.” When a few hobbits mimic the ruffians, Frodo says, “I hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.” It is not just that outsiders corrupt a pure world, but that they bring out a corruption that was already present. Making the Shire an untouched place carries a stagnant stench. Jackson's excision of the Scouring ripples across related media. The video game Tales Of The Shire, released earlier this year, is a prequel, set while Sam and Frodo are still growing up. In the game's few encounters with Gandalf, he speaks of trials soon to come to the pastoral paradise. But the Scouring is only alluded to, never depicted, a thematic piece of the game, but one which remains foggy and indistinct. In some sense, when it comes to this thematically vital chapter, Peter Jackson could not have made any other decision. Yet there is a depressing Hollywood logic to the decision. The necessity of peace and restoration, the hard work they require, are left to the cutting floor, while hour-long scenes of heroic violence take more and more space in each subsequent film. Though the films' pastoral sequences have warmth and joy to them, they lack the bitter, beautiful edge that Tolkien's prose grants them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"You can use that downloaded track to make something grander." In mid-October, just below The Zombies‘ re-recorded 1960s classic “Time of the Season” and Tame Impala‘s new indie hit “Dracula,” a curious track landed at No. “‘You Got This' was the phrase he ALWAYS said,” she posted. Unbound Music, which has posted more than 120 tracks on TikTok over the past year, adds a disclaimer: “All songs have AI elements in them.” It's not unusual for AI artists to hit the charts — Xania Monet, an AI artist whose lyrics come from a Mississippi-based songwriter, went Top 10 on R&B Digital Song Sales for two straight weeks in September and No. What is harder to understand is why these artists are selling so many tracks online in addition to all the streaming. There may be a simple explanation: Creators find digital-download files to be cleaner source material for training generative AI systems than recordings based on Spotify or Apple Music streams. “That's what's driving the sales, is the experimenting and curiosity behind it,” says Ahmed Kordofani, who goes by Chord of Annie, a London producer who “humanizes” AI tracks. You can use that downloaded track to make something grander, even bigger.” Many of the charting AI artists have mysterious origins — nobody responded to a DM through Unbound Music's TikTok account. But “You Got This” is one of several likely AI and AI-enhanced artists hitting sales charts in recent weeks. 15 on the latest Rock Digital Song Sales chart, with 1,000 downloads and 224,000 streams in a week, according to Luminate; and ChildPets Galore's “The Only Thing I Can Take to Heaven” peaked at No. “AI has been booming these days, and a lot of people have been using AI to enhance or generate new songs,” Kordofani says. In addition to the chart activity, Billboard‘s charts team has identified several apparently AI-enhanced tracks that have sold an unexpected number of downloads, suggesting real people, not just online bots designed to boost streaming data, are fans of the music. That may be due in part to lingering iTunes habits from Christian and country consumers, among others. “Country fans are much more likely to still be buying downloads. The Christian genre is smaller, but they're still more likely to be listening to things from iTunes or Amazon,” says Russ Crupnick, Music Watch Inc.'s managing partner. “One could make the argument: If there's a lot of AI falling into those genres, and they're available on downloads, and those [listeners] are more likely to fall into downloads as well as streaming — you can tie all those bows together.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

No turkey for some of y'all, very interesting,” Cardi said during a Spaces session on X. “And I find this so funny, because these are the type of things that I was trying to warn y'all that's gonna happen in the Trump administration, but y'all didn't care. All y'all cared about is that I called him Shrump.” Whether I have an accent or not, it went viral.” Under the Trump administration, she continued on X, conditions have only worsened. “Everything been rising up, from the prices of fucking Fashion Nova and Shein to Chanel and all of that shit, because the tariffs are so fucking expensive.” At the rally, Cardi slammed Trump as being “a man who cares only about making himself rich and cutting taxes for his billionaire friends,” telling the crowd, “Today is your wallet, tomorrow he'll be conning you out of your healthcare rights.” She added that he was also “hustling” people by prompting them to buy his line of sneakers, including a pair printed with an image from the July 2024 assassination attempt. When Cardi released her album Am I the Drama? in September, she apologized for “asking y'all to buy my album and this is how the economy is right now.” On a livestream, she shared additional concerns about housing costs, adding, “I don't know how people are surviving.” What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong In June, celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Zayn Malik, and Sheryl Crow have signed an open letter from Feeding America urging Congress not to approve the massive cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP that are baked into Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Act. In their letter, Feeding America said that an estimated 15.5 million children and 7.2 million seniors rely on SNAP and Medicaid to “make ends meet.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the season comes to a close, there's still so much more I want to know about so many of its key players. And yet, in other ways, I think the series could have benefited from a more condensed five or six episode run that cut out the Grasso chapter altogether and really anchored this story around Tom and Robbie, with the Dark Hearts as a background threat to drive the plot forward. While the action and violence that happens in this finale is tense and visceral, it lacks the same emotional drive as last week's forest shoot-out. (Even Perry's visit to Maeve's house back in “Vagrants” had way more meat on its bones in terms of her family's connections to the motorcycle gang.) Is it insane that Perry left his monogrammed chain on Eryn's body after he killed her? Does it make any sense that Grasso kept Ray's burner phone rather than switching it out with the decoy one in the evidence locker? Yet when I think back on Task, I suspect that what will linger with me won't be the plot holes, but the unexpectedly gentle tone this intense show has found for itself. And, to its credit, this is one of the few crime shows I've watched where characters seriously consider turning themselves over to the cops rather than simply running for as long as they can. Maeve did that with Sam and she considers doing it with the one-million dollars that Robbie left her as well—at least until her arcade co-worker suggests she should at least try to keep it for herself. Grasso also plans to turn himself in after Lizzie's death proves to be the straw that broke the camel's back for his two-year stint as a Dark Hearts informant. Despite how intense his conversation with Tom was last week, Grasso's pretty eager to do the right thing here. And after Dorsey's attempt to frame him goes violently wrong (a great scene! In some ways, there's been a sort of karmic balance to who lives and dies this season. Cliff, Tom, and—to a lesser degree—Eryn died for the hubris of trying to bite off more than they could chew with their get-rich-quick/revenge scheme. Instead of listening to Cliff's gut instinct, they went through with an ambitious burglary and eventually lost their lives for it. Grasso, however, does enough to earn redemption and survive his gunshot wound. He's left with guilt and (presumably) a prison sentence but still very much alive. And Maeve—perhaps the purest, most sympathetic character on the show—gets to live thanks to her guardian angel Donna and some quick, if reckless, thinking from Harper. Perry's death, meanwhile, takes on the sheen of a Greek tragedy. Yet even as he's bleeding out from a gruesome stab wound, he's still trying to save Jayson's life—warning him that the Dark Hearts mother club is coming to kill him. And, if you squint, I suppose Aleah's karmic reward is getting to work through some of the trauma of her past abuse by taking down a giant Dark Hearts goon who's trying to choke her to death. If anything, though, I think leaving Lizzie alive to process Grasso's dirty-cop reveal would have been more interesting than killing her off to motivate his face turn. As is, she winds up feeling weirdly forgotten in this finale, even though her death was such a major event last week. Which isn't to say that Task hasn't had some compelling female characters—including Kathleen as a great successor to the Mare Of Easttown vibe. I also love the way these past few episodes have depicted Sara and Emily's slowly thawing relationship. Tom's impulsive decision to honor his wife's memory and take Sam in as a foster kid becomes an act of healing for the whole Brandis family. Seeing Sam's innocent excitement at getting to decorate his own room or his sweet request that Tom stay with him until he falls asleep serves as a reminder that Ethan and Emily were once just young, vulnerable foster kids that Tom, Susan, and Sara excitedly welcomed into their family. If Task is in some way a show about generations, then Sam's arrival allows Tom, Sara, and Emily to look at their experiences through a new, gentler lens—one where Sara proudly recalls her little brother finding a lost neighborhood dog and Tom remembers that Emily is still just a kid who needs a parent, not someone he should be leaning on to take care of him. But he was also dealt an incredibly unfair hand in life, both with his intense disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and with a pandemic that cut him off from the only medication that could quiet the dangerous voices in his head. Whenever Ethan is released from prison, Tom will have his room waiting for him. Mark Ruffalo plays the reality of Tom reading the letter in court, only going for the emotional jugular when Tom pauses to ask Ethan to look at him so he can offer forgiveness, love, and freedom from shame. I also love that even after all the sweet scenes of Tom bonding with Sam, the show doesn't just have Tom adopt him. Father Daniel (another character I would have liked to learn more about) helps Tom realize that. And the show ultimately ends on a hopeful—but not quite “happily ever after”—note. Before the Prendergrasts take off for their own new future, Maeve takes a photo of Harper in front of the home that played such a seismic role in their lives. The past doesn't have to define us, but it's still a part of our story.
