                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Black Phone 2. Desperate to find a glimmer of originality in a story previously told, screenwriters seek out new ways to revive dead killers for another round of slash and hack. Yet every time they come back, their knives get duller. To compensate for these diminishing returns, horror sequels will often empower their villains with supernatural abilities that justify resurrection at the expense of scares. The moment Halloween II reveals Michael as Laurie Strode's brother, the series begins a slow and inevitable decline into schlock. Like much of its throwback slasher antics, Black Phone 2 follows a similar trend. This time they're at the frigid Alpine Lake summer camp, which just so happens to be the camp their mother, Hope (Anna Lore), used to work at. Afflicted with expository dreams that point her to local murders, Hope uses her shining to glean that The Grabber was killing Alpine campers. Black Phone 2 emphasizes Gwen's power more than before, using her dreams to fill in Black Phone backstory and stage Wes Craven-inspired action sequences in which the Grabber, now a ghost, attacks Gwen in her dreams. While these sequences make Black Phone 2 play like a remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street, it's really the Halloween sequels that the movie is grabbing from. They were latchkey kids of the late '70s whose family life was torn apart by their mother's suicide. Meanwhile, the otherworldly powers at play stood on a firmer foundation, doubling as a metaphor for the kids finding inner strength and determination against their attackers. Black Phone 2 makes him an all-powerful being with ice skates for feet who can only be killed by following a specific set of rules: Find the dead campers' bodies, and the Grabber will return to Hell. It's easy to understand why some horror filmmakers go this route for their accidental franchises. The Saw movies made a complicated mess of their timeline by justifying how Jigsaw kept making a comeback every year. Black Phone 2 joins other supernaturally bent sequels, like Halloween and Friday The 13th, to stretch out the longevity of a series that never thought it'd be a series. These killers are at their scariest when they exist in familiar worlds, ones the audience can identify—like an everyday summer camp terrorized by a disgruntled employee, or a neighborhood menaced by a senseless killer. Like Halloween, it took a familiar world and added the uncanny.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a message from President Donald Trump on the source of drone sightings reported over New Jersey. A private aerial contractor has reportedly taken responsibility for the swarms of mystery drones that wreaked havoc over New Jersey's skies last year. Speaking at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker, Alabama, in August, the unnamed company allegedly revealed during a panel that their manned aerial craft was to blame for the scare across New Jersey's skies, an attendee told The New York Post. "You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us," an employee of the unnamed contractor reportedly said, according to The Post. The unnamed company reportedly told attendees at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit that their aircraft was behind the mystery drones in New Jersey last year, according to The New York Post. The company claimed their aircraft was performing exercises to "test out their capabilities" over New Jersey in November 2024, The Post reported. "It feels like it's a UFO because it defies what you're expecting to see," the source said, adding that there was an "uncanny valley feeling" as the aircraft quietly soared through the sky for a demonstration. "When it turned, you almost completely [lost] sight of it," the individual told The Post. "Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky, and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared." All conference attendees and demonstrations were reportedly required to be approved by the administration at Fort Rucker, which strictly prohibited any use of aircraft containing Chinese-made parts, according to The Post. Hundreds of drones were spotted flying over neighborhoods in New Jersey last year, sparking mass hysteria and theories surrounding their origin. "It would definitely have to be cleared," the unnamed attendee reportedly said. "Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that." The saga began on Nov. 13, 2024, after a swarm of drones was spotted over the Picatinny Arsenal Army base in Morris County, and lasted until mid-December.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the Freakshow we don't spend a lot of time on conspiracy theories – but we make an exception when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein, a career criminal burrowed deep into the American national security and foreign affairs establishment for reasons that are unclear and with effects that are not fully understood. Alex Acosta, the Miami federal prosecutor who cut Epstein's infamous sweetheart deal, supposedly said he was told to “back off” because Epstein “belonged to intelligence.” So many of Epstein's connections are well-known and hashed over. House and Senate committees might wait forever for full disclosure from the Justice Department, but there are hoards of archives in the public realm that they could start looking into. These organizations preceded Davos, serving something of the same purpose – hosting self-important gasbag speakers for audiences of men with even greater self-regard. They primarily serve as closed-door clubs where private interests can be quietly advanced into public policy. As we reported in a previous Freakshow, the doors to global power opened wide for Epstein in 1991 after the gnomelike Ohio billionaire Les Wexner very questionably gave him power of attorney over his billions. That same year, Jeff got his first jet and Ghislaine Maxwell appeared on the scene as his enabler and sometimes girlfriend. He put the Wexner pile to work on power-networking right away. By 1992, Epstein was loaning $100,000 to Bill Clinton's inaugural committee. In the June 12, 1995, roster of the Trilateral Commission, he is identified as Jeffrey E. Epstein, President, New Albany Property Inc. (New Albany was the planned village near Columbus that Wexner was developing and living in). He soon forked over $350,000 to the Council on Foreign Relations, which has since publicly disavowed him. The CFR has also claimed he only showed up for two meetings as a member, but club records suggest otherwise. In October 1995, Les Gelb – an international affairs éminence grise and New York Times columnist who appeared in Epstein's black book and traveled with him on his plane – arranged with Clinton's CIA director John Deutch for a “private tour and briefing” at the CIA. warfare,” “global humanitarian emergencies,” “proliferation” and “economic intelligence,” and even included a $12 lunch with Deutch (that the CFR told the members they would have to cover themselves). Trip to Central Intelligence Agency; Council on Foreign Relations Records, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library Official reports on his habits make Trump's Mar-a-Lago classified documents bathroom pile look like Fort Knox in comparison. He kept a running journal of his work at the agency on a computer disk that he carried home with him every night and subsequently accessed on computers designated for “unclassified” use that were connected to the internet. A CIA investigation concluded that he “intentionally processed... highly classified information” on his home computers in Massachusetts and Maryland. Deutch refused to cooperate and was never charged; Clinton pardoned him two hours before he handed the White House over to George W. Bush in January 2001. One could chalk up this behavior to being a bureaucratic tech Luddite – except that Deutch had been at MIT for decades by then, had served in the Pentagon and the Energy department and was regarded by a computer expert he worked with as a “fairly advanced” user. After his government years, Deutch returned to MIT – another node of American national security and scientific power that Epstein was burrowing into with money and personal charm. He gave MIT $850,000 and struck up a friendship with, among others, Deutsch's friend Noam Chomsky. Epstein connected Vekselberg with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2013, and the men went into business together. Deutch also helped Vekselberg create the Skolkovo Institute, a Russian-MIT collaboration that by 2014, Boston FBI warned could be a vehicle for Russia to steal US technology, and in 2022, the U.S. sanctioned it for its “close relationship with Russia's defense sector.” These are all just breadcrumbs: facts over time that might suggest connections to larger events. The Epstein motherlode is hoarded up in a Justice Department vault, currently guarded by K$H Patel and Pam Bondi. Besides provoking unrest in American cities, they are hiding the files, flagging (and presumably erasing) King Don's presence in said files, slow walking or flat out ignoring Congressional subpoenas, and giving the royal prison treatment to Epstein's depraved procuress Ghislaine Maxwell. Even Bible Mike, our God-lovin' House Speaker, is in on the coverup, refusing to swear in a duly elected member of Congress, apparently to delay or block a full House vote that would open the Epstein matter for discussion. To quote a song from one of Epstein's Boomer era bands: “There's something happening here… What it is ain't exactly clear.” Nina Burleigh is a journalist, author, documentary producer, and adjunct professor at New York University's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. She has written eight books including her recently published novel, Zero Visibility Possible.</p>

Kelli Saam is an anchor for Action News Now and rejoined the team in 2021. HAYFORK, Calif. - The mysterious disappearance of Steven Hixson from Trinity County has puzzled authorities for eight years. Hixson was last seen on March 1, 2017, after he contacted the police to report an assault at his home. Police noted bruises on his head and called an ambulance, but Hixson refused hospital treatment. Authorities believe he might have become disoriented from his injury and wandered into the wilderness near Hayfork. At the time of his disappearance, Hixson was 45 years old, stood 5 feet 8 inches tall, and weighed 149 pounds. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Trinity County Sheriff's Office at 530-623-2611. Kelli Saam is an anchor for Action News Now and rejoined the team in 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chicago Shakespeare Theatre's “Paranormal Activity,” with Cher Álvarez/Photo: Kyle Flubacker This fascination continues to this day, particularly in film, with “found footage” techniques in “The Blair Witch Project” (1999) and “Paranormal Activity” (2007) heightening the horror through a new sense of realism. In time for Halloween, Chicago Shakespeare Theater makes horror more real still in “Paranormal Activity,” running through November 2, a stage adaptation of the hit film by Oren Peli. Directed by Felix Barrett, the play uses practical special effects, intense sound design and horror-trope-inspired lighting techniques to provide a sense of realism that is unmatchable in film. A new story by Levi Holloway, of a young couple who move to another country to escape the demons of their past, is a fresh take on the franchise, folding elements from the film into the story in ways that are surprising and unexpected. On the heel of their one-year wedding anniversary, wife Lou (Cher Álvarez) and husband James (Patrick Heusinger) have recently moved from the United States to England for a fresh start. The couple's ostensible happiness is fake, and it is revealed that Lou suffers from depression because of terrifying phenomena that only she can perceive. But when James starts hearing invisible hands knocking at the door and seeing ghostly lights creeping around hallways, it becomes clear that it's not all in Lou's head. Chicago Shakespeare Theater's “Paranormal Activity,” with Patrick Heusinger/Photo: Kyle Flubacker From that point, anything can happen, and your eyes will greedily inspect every nook of the setting—a bifurcated, two-story, five-room house—for the twitch of a shadow or the reappearance of a dreadful ghoul. Heusinger plays James as a masculine “bro,” whose bulging muscles are of no use against an ephemeral attacker. Álvarez dials the creep factor to eleven as she gradually morphs Lou from an anxious young woman into a demon-possessed succubus. In all, the play comes together as a satisfying blend of fantasy and reality. Waves of excitement rushed through the crowd during centerpiece reveals. The experience was like watching a horror flick in one's living room with (hundreds) of friends. The not-so-obvious trickery of American spiritualism is revived with gusto in “Paranormal Activity,” a sensational start to the spooky season. “Paranormal Activity” runs through November 2 at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, 800 East Grand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A United Airlines pilot was left covered in blood and forced to make an emergency landing after a mystery object smashed into the plane's windscreen. The captain was flying at 36,000ft as he transported passengers between Denver and Los Angeles on Thursday (16 October) when he was likely left with the shock of his life, as something hit the windscreen, sending glass flying and injuring those inside the cockpit. Fortunately, despite his arms being left bloody, the pilot was still able to land the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane safely in Salt Lake City, not far from the neighbouring state where they originally took off from. United Airlines said: “On Thursday, United flight 1093 landed safely in Salt Lake City to address damage to its multilayered windshield. It also remains unclear exactly what struck the plane but given the height they were travelling at, there is mounting suspicion that it could have been something from space. In a trailer for the documentary The Age of Disclosure, Marco Rubio said: "We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities - and it's not ours." However, given a missile didn't even seem to damage a UFO, the object that struck the plane is likely to have been something far smaller, such as some debris or even a minuscule meteor from space - as you would imagine an alien spaceship would have probably done far more damage. But even then, more likely is still far from likely at all, as the Federal Aviation Administration has previously estimated the probability of space debris causing serious injury to a commercial airline passenger as less than one in a trillion. Planes more often collide with birds or pieces of hail at lower altitudes but it is unlikely that these things would have hit the aircraft while it was cruising close to 40,000ft. Passengers were able to reach their destination after a six-hour delay, with local media suggesting that the original plane remains grounded in Salt Lake City as engineers try and fix it up, while also trying to figure out exactly what caused this unfortunate damage. United Airlines told LADbible: "On Thursday, United flight 1093 landed safely in Salt Lake City to address damage to its multilayered windshield.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report has been released that states that the film, titled The Age of Disclosure, is set to have a limited theatrical run in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. This careful choice of distribution will help the movie qualify for Oscar Season, though audiences in other cities will have to wait to experience the documentary when it drops on VOD and streaming at a later date. Besides the small theatrical window, The Age of Disclosure will be exclusively streaming on Prime Video, and will be available for purchase starting on November 21. The film first premiered at the 2025 South by Southwest film festival in March, where it received a strong reaction from critics. On the review aggregate website     Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary only has six reviews posted, with five of them being "rotten." With the movie set to be released to a wider audience, it will be interesting to see what the overall critical reception will be for what has been described as speculative and heavy-handed. The Age of Disclosure comes at an interesting time, in no small part thanks to the recent Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP, formerly UFOs) that have primarily been about requesting more transparency for what the government knows anout any non-human life. "My goal was to only interview people who had direct knowledge of the UAP topic as a result of their work for the U.S. government, and who would share what they can legally disclose … There are people who want the topic to continue to be kept from the public entirely. So I went to great lengths to make this documentary in secret over the last two-and-a-half years … there are these fundamental facts — like that we're not alone in the universe — that everyone feels like the public has the right to know, and it's also in our best interest to make known so that there's no longer this antiquated, unjust stigma that is making our country fall behind in how seriously this topic is taken." Come November 21, The Age of Disclosure's divisive content will make itself known to a much wider audience, and more than likely re-ignite the discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial beings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private firm contracted by the United States military has taken responsibility for the mysterious objects seen flying above New Jersey last November. But a private contractor revealed at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August that they had launched the objects to 'test out their capabilities,' according to NYPost. 'You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? The company reportedly offered a live demonstration of their manned aerial craft, which had an unconventional appearance. 'Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.' In the footage, which was shot close near Atlantic City, family members were heard discussing what they witnessed before the object suddenly disappears. Some 964 sightings of flying objects were logged in the state between November 19 up until December 13, according to statistics collected by the state's Office of Emergency Management. Former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman had warned that the drones lighting up multi-state skies may be a 'classified exercise.' She told Fox News Live that the drone sightings were 'extremely unsettling,' and shared her theory that they may be part of a technology 'test' orchestrated by the federal government. Ballman said: 'Now in terms of who is behind this, seeing the statements that have been made by John Kirby, who has said that these objects are not operating illegally. 'Coupled with the several op-eds that have been out there in the last 24 hours about the need to look at our detection systems, [it] makes me think perhaps this is actually a classified exercise to test either evasion technology or detection technology in urban areas.' White House National Security spokesman John Kirby had confirmed the aircraft were not foreign. 'The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they're working closely with the state and local law enforcement to provide resources using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin.' 'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft being operated lawfully,' he said.</p>
