                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the World Cup less than a year away, GOAL ranks the strikers competing to make Mauricio Pochettino's squad There is no position as discussed or dissected more than striker. But throughout that run, the USMNT's lack of presence up top was noticeable. And so now Mauricio Pochettino must choose among several candidates. It's a good problem to have, but it doesn't make the selection any less crucial. Choose right and the USMNT could make a run next summer. Well, that could be the difference between winning and losing. Striker is, of course, a position based on form. As much as anything, it's about riding the hot hand and using confidence to your advantage. There are other factors at play, as well - athleticism, timing, decisiveness, chemistry. All will play a part in determining who starts for the USMNT next summer, who comes off the bench and who might just be left out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Topics: Zinedine Zidane, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Football Real Madrid and France legend Zinedine Zidane reportedly sees just one European club as being on the same level as Los Blancos – and it's not Barcelona. Zidane, 53, has, without doubt, already etched his name into the history books of Real Madrid. After retiring from playing in 2006, Zidane embarked on a career in coaching, firstly taking charge of Real Madrid's youth setup before making the step up to manage the senior team in 2016 until 2018. And despite having managed at a senior level for a combined four years, the Frenchman still managed to guide Los Blancos to 11 trophies - two La Liga titles, three Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, and two FIFA Club World Cups – over his two reigns as Real boss. It has been widely reported that he is earmarked for the France job, with current manager Didier Deschamps set to take a step down following the 2026 World Cup. But which club does Zidane put on the same level as his beloved Madrid? Speaking to Source 1, relayed by Foot Mundo, in 2024, a close friend of Zidane explained how he would “go back to Juventus” having played for the Turin club between 1996 and 2001, as well as possibly considering “the French national team or Bayern Munich” as future destinations. “He sees Bayern like Real Madrid: an institution, a club with a great past and excellent working conditions,” the source reportedly said. “In this sense, he would undoubtedly fit well. But if the Munich leaders want to bring him in, they must give him sporting power and respond to his wishes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami CF proudly congratulates forward Mateo Silvetti for his remarkable performance at the FIFA U-20 World Cup, where he helped guide Argentina to a second-place finish. La Albiceleste fell 2-0 to Morocco's U-20 side in the tournament's final. Silvetti, who joined Inter Miami during the summer transfer window, had a breakout tournament, playing a pivotal role in Argentina's deep run to the championship match. The young attacker scored three decisive goals, each coming in critical knockout-stage moments. His first goal came in the Round of 16 against Nigeria, sealing Argentina's 4-0 victory and passage to the next round. In the quarterfinals, Silvetti once again struck late, netting the final goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico that secured Argentina's spot in the semifinals. Then, in a hard-fought battle against Colombia, he came off the bench at halftime and delivered the match-winning goal that sent Argentina to the World Cup final. In the championship match, Silvetti was subbed-on in the 33rd minute after Argentina conceded two early goals. Despite his energetic performance and Argentina's relentless efforts, the team ultimately fell short as Morocco claimed the title. Silvetti will now return to Inter Miami CF training as the team prepares for its first-round playoff clash against Nashville SC this Friday, October 24 at 8 p.m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Soccer announced Monday its roster for the United States Under-20 Women's National Team training camp, which includes three Kansas City Current players. Forwards Mary Long and Alex Pfeiffer along with defender Katie Scott will participate in the camp from Oct. 22-30 at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center, the KC Current's training site. Both 18 years old, Long and Scott have been regulars on the U-20 circuit since the beginning of this year. They are three of seven National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) players at this camp. The latter part of the upcoming U-20 camp – from Oct. 27-29 – will be held concurrently with the senior U.S. Women's National Team's visit to Kansas City for its match against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The U.S. U-20 WNT will attend that match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium purpose-built for a professional women's sports team. It will be the USWNT's first-ever visit to CPKC Stadium. Limited tickets are still available for purchase HERE. Long totaled three goals and an assist – including a brace against Puerto Rico – at the Concacaf Championship while Scott netted a goal and donned the captain's band during a group stage match. Long also had a goal and an assist vs. Costa Rica. Long was a vital component of the USA's bronze-medal performance at the 2024 FIFA U-17 World Cup where she played in all six matches and earned a start in five. She scored against South Korea in addition to adding an assist and drawing a penalty against Colombia during the group stage. She scored twice in a friendly against Brazil during her first national team call-up for a training camp in preparation of the U-17 World Cup in 2024. Pfeiffer has trained and competed with the national youth program at the U-15, U-16 and U-17 levels since 2022. She won the 2022 Concacaf U-15 Championship before helping her U-16 squad claim the 2023 French Mondial World Cup. She began playing with the U-17 squad as a 15-year-old and scored a hat trick in a September 2023 friendly against Japan, one month before becoming the youngest player to ever sign with the Current.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Oct. 20, 2025) — Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team training camp to be held from October 22-30 at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center, home of the 2025 NWSL Shield winners Kansas City Current.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With international duty over for another month, European soccer's American stars were back on club duty over the weekend and experienced fluctuating fortunes. It went well for Folarin Balogun in Ligue 1, but Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie have more questions to answer. Folarin Balogun needed to start showing signs of his true capabilities. With his status as the USMNT's starting striker fading and players such as Josh Sargent and Haji Wright — both enjoying resurgent seasons in England's second-tier Championship — breathing down his neck, it was high time he returned to scoring ways for club and country if he wanted to give himself a chance of going to the 2026 World Cup as the main man, as he was at the Copa America a year earlier. So he will look back at the two most recent USMNT camps, where he scored twice in the four games, and his improvement with Monaco as a timely revival. Despite his own injury issues, Sargent managed 15 goals (and five assists) for Norwich in the same campaign, and has scored five in 10 games this time. At the same level, Wright rode his own injury travails to hit 12 goals in 20 league appearances for Coventry in 2024-25 and has started the current campaign on fire — eight in 10 matches, putting him top of the division's scoring chart. So it was essential for Balogun that he started firing over the water in French football. Momentum is key, and he built on his most recent USMNT strike — in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador — and responded to Wright's brace against Australia four days later by coming off the bench to score in Monaco's 1-1 draw away to Angers on Saturday. The New York-born forward was the only USMNT player to play a significant part for his European club as domestic leagues resumed this weekend after this latest international window, with most being benched by their coaches to ensure their full recovery following those friendlies in Texas and Colorado and the long-haul journeys back across the Atlantic. Introduced as a 62nd-minute substitute at Raymond Kopa stadium, Balogun had only been on the field for 10 minutes when he took advantage of a Takumi Minamino deflection to score emphatically from inside the box. On a weekend when Haji endured a rare blank in Coventry's 2-0 home win against Blackburn and Sargent only managed one shot on target as Norwich lost 1-0 to visitors Bristol City, it was advantage Balogun in what will remain a fascinating race to become top pick to lead the U.S. line going into the summer. So seeing injury-hit Antonee Robinson stalled on a combined 61 minutes of top-flight football for Fulham this season, including just 10 since the end of August, and missing altogether once again for their defeat by Arsenal on Saturday, will be a concern. Having travelled to the national camp for this month's games — Pochettino conceded Robinson had “a minor problem with his leg, a bit of pain”, which prevented him playing a full part — the left-back was unavailable again back in Europe as the injury problems mount up for Fulham coach Marco Silva. The west London club have now lost three league games in a row, with Robinson's absence for 260 of those 270 minutes against Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Arsenal keenly felt. Given the 28-year-old is trying to work his way back from knee surgery in May, it seems he needs more time to fully recover from the operation and any related fitness issues. There is plenty of time for him to return and recapture his best form before the World Cup begins in June, of course, so nobody will be panicking yet. It's not like playing in Gladbach is worse for him. That was former Germany international turned LA Galaxy forward Marco Reus' stance on Gio Reyna after the American departed Borussia Dortmund for fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach over the summer. But in this crucial period ahead of the World Cup, his move to Monchengladbach is yet to yield those crucial minutes, or tangible proof that he can become a consistent performer. Left on the bench for Friday's visit to Union Berlin, Reyna came on after an hour and finished Gladbach's 3-1 defeat with only a stoppage-time yellow card to show for a low-key performance. Chris Richards has been building a convincing body of work to underline his credentials as one of the first picks for Pochettino in next summer's tournament. That three-man central defence under Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace has brought the best out of him, and he has become a key performer for the south London side. But the Palace back line were severely tested on Saturday during their 3-3 draw at home against Tyler Adams' Bournemouth, and Richards was reminded of the perils of opponents blessed with searing pace. That's what Antoine Semenyo has, and he used it to get the better of the American, leaving him second-best in a foot race in the buildup to Bournemouth's second goal, which gave them a 2-0 half-time lead. Palace captain and fellow centre-back Marc Guehi also made a rare error leading to a goal, but Richards and company kept going to ensure they have still lost just once this season across 13 matches in all competitions. After his recent goal against Wolfsburg, Noahkai Banks made his second consecutive start in Germany's Bundesliga for Augsburg in the 1-1 draw away to Koln on Saturday. It is no mean feat for an 18-year-old to be starting games in defence at such a high level, and he played a solid 85 minutes. Weston McKennie's yo-yo club fortunes continued as he was back on the bench as Juventus suffered a surprise 2-0 defeat at Como. McKennie eventually came on in the 77th minute, just before Como doubled their lead, and although he tried to make a difference with three passes into the final third, Juventus are now winless in four Serie A matches. The goalkeeper, on loan from fellow second-tier side Cardiff, was sent off in second-half stoppage time on Saturday for clattering Charlton's Isaac Olaofe outside the box. It meant defender Liam Palmer had to go in goal as the clock ticked down on a 2-1 away defeat for financially-stricken Wednesday, who now do not have a senior 'keeper available for their midweek home game against high-flying Middlesbrough with Horvath suspended. Midfielder Aidan Morris will hope to be back in the visitors' line-up for that one, after starting their 2-1 defeat of Ipswich on the bench. Morris started against Ecuador and featured as a substitute against Australia, which was played in the early hours of Wednesday UK time, so was rested for the Friday night fixture, only coming on for the final 20 minutes, but will want to pick up where he left off with Middlesbrough just a point behind Wright's table-topping Coventry. Arsenal old boy Balogun faces a tough test of his renewed form as Monaco host Europa League winners Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League on Wednesday. In the Bundesliga, Kristoffer Lund started again for Koln last weekend and will be hoping to remain in their defence away to Cole Campbell‘s Dortmund (Saturday, 12:30pm, ESPN+). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

Graham Potter returned to Swedish soccer Monday as coach of its underperforming national team on a short-term mission: To qualify for the World Cup. Fourteen years later, he will take charge of a national team filled with stars from the Premier League like Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres but underachieving after losing three straight games in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. After firing Danish coach Jon Dahl Tomasson, the Swedish Football Association has hired another foreign-born coach in Potter on an initial deal that will see him take control for the team's final World Cup qualifiers against Switzerland and Slovenia next month. He will also coach Sweden in the World Cup playoffs in March, which Sweden is likely to reach by virtue of winning its most recent Nations League group. Potter understood the initial nature of the role, telling a hastily arranged news conference: “For me, it's very simple — there's no talk of building or changing or philosophy or anything like this. Potter was regarded as a forward-thinking coach with a team-orientated playing philosophy and open to outside-of-the-box ideas about squad unity. During his time at Ostersund, for example, the club developed a “Culture Academy” where players learned skills such as stand-up comedy, art, dancing and rapping, and performed them in front of the city's inhabitants to challenge mental processes and decision-making under pressure. With a lofty reputation, Potter — who had a modest playing career in England's lower leagues — returned to Britain to coach, firstly at Swansea and then in the Premier League with Brighton. His most recent coaching stint was also underwhelming, at West Ham from January to September this year. “With Graham Potter, we are getting a strong and experienced leader who has been tested at the absolute highest level,” Swedish FA president Simon Åström said. Potter said he was “very humbled by the assignment, but also incredibly inspired.” However, the team is in last place in its World Cup qualifying group on one point from four games, after successive humiliating defeats to Kosovo either side of a loss to Switzerland. Tomasson was unable to get the best out of Sweden's attacking riches. Now it's Potter's turn and he wants to find a better balance in the team. “From my experience of Swedish football, my respect of Swedish football and what I learned from Swedish football, the collective is the most important thing,” Potter said, adding: “We've clearly got some top players but football isn't about the 11 best, it's the best 11.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A revamped ‘international management module' will be added to Football Manager 26 next year Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has signed a multi-year partnership with FIFA. This includes the addition of FIFA World Cup 26 in Football Manager 26, including the official kits of all 48 teams (once they've been confirmed) as well as official broadcast graphics and tournament branding. When it's released on November 4, Football Manager 26 won't feature international football management (except for FM26 Mobile on Netflix) and will be focused solely on club management. However, Sports Interactive says a revamped ‘International Management module' will be added to the game in a content update next year, ahead of FIFA World Cup 26 taking place. Football Manager 26 will be available in four different versions when it's released. The ‘main' Football Manager 26 will be available on PC on November 4 via Steam, the Epic Games Store and the Windows Store, and will be available on PC Game Pass. A streamlined version called Football Manager 26 Console will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, also on November 4, and will also be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Official FIFA tournaments debut in #FM26, with a revamped International Management module arriving in a free future content update ahead of FIFA World Cup™ 2026. Football Manager 26 Touch, which is made with touchscreens in mind, will be released on Apple Arcade on November 4 alongside the other versions, with a Nintendo Switch version following on December 4. After multiple delays, Football Manager 25 was officially cancelled in February 2025, with Sega and developer Sports Interactive saying its focus would shift to the next game in the series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mike Penders is currently on loan at Strasbourg, but he spent some time with the Chelsea first team during the summer. With Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen being Chelsea‘s first-choice and second-choice goalkeepers during the 2024/25 season, Penders did not get an opportunity at this year's Club World Cup. However, the 20-year-old still appeared to enjoy his time at the tournament and had some very positive things to say about his teammates. In a recent interview with Het Laatste Nieuws, Penders said: “It was good to tag along and get to know the group. I'm the kind of person who immediately starts talking. Every dressing room is a bit similar, you know. Once the Belgian returns to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea are expecting big things from him. The feeling at Cobham is that Penders will be Chelsea's No.1 one day. It means that either Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen is likely to depart west London at some point. While Penders did not have a great game against PSG as he went on to concede three goals, the former Genk man is still having a bright campaign at Strasbourg. In seven Ligue 1 appearances, Penders has been able to keep three clean sheets. He also has a save percentage of 70%, which is fairly good. He can compete with Sanchez to be No.1, while Jorgensen is loaned out or sold. The Denmark international has not looked convincing during this campaign. Jorgensen really struggled against Lincoln City, for example, a League One side.</p>
