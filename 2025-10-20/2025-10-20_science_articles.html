                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists are always looking for ways to make inherently brittle materials, such as concrete or ceramic, tougher, safer, and more durable. Although this material has long been featured in jewelry shops around the world, nacre is also an architectural wonder. With the aragonite providing strength and the biopolymer providing flexibility, nacre is incredibly flexible and crack resistant—so much so that scientists from Princeton University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering wondered if this mollusk maneuver honed by half a billion years of evolution could imbue similar benefits to human building materials. “This synergy between the hard and soft components is crucial to nacre's remarkable mechanical properties,” Shashank Gupta, a co-author of the study and graduate student at Princeton, said in a press statement. “If we can engineer concrete to resist crack propagation, we can make it tougher, safer and more durable.” To achieve this lofty goal, Gupta's team crafted three types of multi-layered beams of material that alternated between cement paste sheets and a thin polymer layer. The first beam was made of these two ingredients stacked on top of one another, but the other two beams were slightly different. The first featured hexagonal grooves in the cement paste, while the second cut through the cement completely, forming hexagonal-shaped plates or “tablets.” All three beams were compared to a cast cement paste reference beam (i.e. no polymer layers or hexagonal markings at all). The resulting experiments proved that, while the reference beam was brittle with no ductility, all three beams showed significantly increased ductility and toughness. “In other words, we intentionally engineer defects in the brittle materials as a way to make them stronger by design.” Stronger and safer cement wouldn't just be a boon for construction, but also the health of the planet, as the production of cement makes up roughly 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But while the study shows promising results for these nacre-inspired materials, this multi-layered, hexagonal-plated technique will need a bit more tweaking before construction companies start trading out mortar for mollusks.

Some see an upgraded test as a necessary benchmark for progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) — an ambiguous term used by many technology firms to mean an AI system with the resourcefulness to match any human cognitive ability. But at an event at London's Royal Society on 2 October, several researchers said that the Turing test should be scrapped altogether, and that developers should instead focus on evaluating AI safety and building specific capabilities that could be of benefit to the public. “Let's figure out the kind of AI we want, and test for those things instead,” said Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. In focusing on “this march towards AGI, I think we're really limiting our imaginations about what kind of systems we might want — and, more importantly, what kinds of systems we really don't want — in our society”. Some of the best AI models are highly specialized, such as AlphaFold, Google DeepMind's protein-structure predictor, he said. It does not try to write sonnets,” he said. Turing's playful thought experiment has often been used as a gauge of machine intelligence, but it was never meant as a serious or practical test, said Sarah Dillon, a literature researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, who studies the mathematician's works. Yet the fact that chatbots can imitate speech credibly does not mean that they can understand, said several researchers at the event. For this reason, models could still fail the Turing test if they are challenged by a scientist who knows their weaknesses. Still, the rapid improvement of LLM-based systems in a broad range of areas, especially reasoning tasks, has prompted speculation about whether machines will soon reach human-level performance on cognitive tests. Such tests are often framed as milestones on the route to general intelligence, but researchers don't agree on any one benchmark for achieving AGI.

Gene editing and other technologies have made it easier for researchers to use mice to probe human biology. A polarized debate in biomedical research is pitting those who favour ‘traditional animal models' — meaning living non-human mammals, such as mice, that are used to investigate human disease mechanisms, responses to treatments and so on — against proponents of various experimental approaches collectively termed NAMs. NAMs, short for ‘new approach methodologies' or ‘novel alternative methods', include in vitro models, such as organoids grown from stem cells or other cells, that are designed to mimic the properties of human organs or tissues1; computational (in silico) modelling approaches that predict how biological systems respond to drugs or other perturbations2; and chemical (in chemico) techniques that assess how biological molecules interact outside an organism or cell3. NAMs could markedly accelerate progress in drug discovery, toxicology and disease modelling. They could also lessen the need for animal testing, which is ethically problematic for many people. But framing NAMs as innovative disrupters and ‘traditional animal models' as outdated holdovers — as many are now doing — oversimplifies a reality that is much more nuanced. Worse, it is distracting researchers from considering the scientific, ethical and translational issues related to both types of approach. As a clinically trained veterinarian and biomedical scientist, I have been using mouse models to try to understand human genetic diseases for more than 20 years. For decades, researchers have been using tools, such as human induced pluripotent stem cells, to garner information relevant to humans and to lessen the need for animal testing. What's brought all this to the fore are major technological advances in NAMs and a push by regulators and funders globally for the expanded use of these methods in research. Alternatives to animal testing are the future — it's time that journals, funders and scientists embrace them Alternatives to animal testing are the future — it's time that journals, funders and scientists embrace them NAMs and animal models offer distinct, often complementary insights into the workings of complex in vivo biological systems. For well-defined, narrow applications, such as in toxicology, or when researchers are wanting to assess a specific biological process or disease mechanism at the molecular, chemical, cellular or organ level, NAMs are proving highly useful. Currently, however, no NAM can model how a specific gene functions in a person, how an organ or the entire body works or how a disease progresses. All models — whether they are NAMs or inbred mice — should be updated, refined or replaced as tools and data emerge that allow researchers to better match models to the human system they are trying to investigate. Experimental technologies, such as the gene-editing tool4 CRISPR–Cas9, have made it easier for researchers to design animal models that more faithfully recapitulate human biological processes or phenomena. Targeted genome editing in mice5, for instance, has shown how some human genes have different effects in men and women6, and how some have different effects at different life stages7. It has also uncovered cases of genetic pleiotropy, in which a single gene influences multiple traits8,9. Future advances will probably improve animal models even further.

Jackson/SPL Moreover, for all models, the quality and usefulness of the information generated will depend on a host of factors that are extraneous to the model itself. NAMs are increasingly being touted as a solution for the limited translatability of findings from preclinical research to the clinic10. But problems with translatability can stem from factors other than the physiological differences between species12,13. For instance, the disease models could have been oversimplified, or the group sizes made too small, or the animals being tested might not have been assigned to the treatment groups in a sufficiently random manner. Many of these issues could apply equally to studies involving NAMs. Ineichen, B. V., Furrer, E., Grüninger, S. L., Zürrer, W. E. & Macleod, M. R. PLoS Biol. van der Worp, H. B. et al. PLoS Med.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Automation plays a key role in Toyota's production, but only to supplement skilled human labor. Covering over nine million square feet, roughly 156 football fields. Employing just under 9,500 workers, TMMK was able to produce 435,631 vehicles in 2024. In fact, the Kentucky-based factory is one of the few Toyota facilities able to produce engines and dies (tools used to cut, form, or shape material) as well as automobiles. Despite considerable advancements in automation, Toyota (and Lexus) maintain that humans are still the right answer. In fact, the brand's “Kaizen” strategy of continuous improvement aligns much better with a human workforce than a fleet of robots. Having said that, the superiority of a skilled workforce is much more complex than just simply being better. Humans and robots both require training to complete tasks with significant proficiency levels. That's why all production-line employees at TMMK (and all other Toyota Motor Manufacturing facilities) are trained in a classroom environment before working on customer vehicles. The program firmly follows a crawl, walk, run approach, with the training demonstration beginning with tasks as simple as picking up bolts. There were actually a number of “analog” training aids that helped steer me in the right direction. Namely, the table in front of the bolt tightening demo would alarm if I pushed too hard; along with simply being unnecessary, I was told excess pressure could put undo strain on workers. You may also be able to spot a bar that runs the length of the table, which plays a subtle train whistle if I leaned into it. Many are worried about Artificial Intelligence (AI) “stealing” jobs as it continues to become further integrated into society. Automation is excellent for repetitive tasks; however, it still can't compete with a human's ability to spot minute details for quality control, solve problems, and improve processes on the fly. And that's a good thing, as the majority of these vehicles are responsible for transporting parts and pieces from storage to workers on the production line. The Kentucky facility uses a fleet of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) to deliver those components. If you've ever seen videos of those fast food delivery robots putzing around on college campuses, these operate on much the same logic. Much like their life on the street, these robots are trained to avoid collisions with humans and other autonomous vehicles. The end result is a homogeneous factory where robots and humans work together in harmony. So if you suddenly find yourself in the market for a Toyota vehicle, know that it was primarily built by skilled sets of hands.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cells Have a Crystal Trigger That Makes Them Self-Destruct When Viruses Invade A special class of immune proteins protect us from pathogens but also drive inflammation and cell death A model showing proteins called death fold domains (green) telling a caspase enzyme (blue) to kill the cell after it has been compromised by pathogens. The immune system has a tough job: When a tiny virus invades one of our cells, that cell must detect it and, within minutes, decide what to do. Now researchers have discovered that a special group of about 100 immune proteins hangs out inside every cell in the body, where these proteins do nothing but wait. The kind of cell death caused by this mechanism is called pyroptosis, and unlike apoptosis (programmed cell death), it triggers inflammation.

Historically, scientists have studied proteins' folded structures to understand their function individually. But “we're in this explosion of discovery, realizing that these individual molecules that we've studied so well are coming together into larger structures that are not bound by membranes,” says D. Allan Drummond, a molecular biologist at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the study. The study, which was done in living yeast cells and human cell lines, illustrates how proteins act collectively by forming a crystal that gathers caspases together to activate the cell death program and enable the cell to make a rapid life-or-death decision. Although structural biologists had studied this kind of protein behavior in test tubes, “what was really lacking was: ‘Does this really happen in the cell? '” says Bostjan Kobe, a protein structural biologist at the University of Queensland in Australia. “That's why [Halfmann's] work was really interesting—because it came at the problem from a completely different angle.” “What this means is that if you wait long enough, every cell will die via this mechanism because even if a virus doesn't get into the cell, it will happen at some frequency spontaneously,” Halfmann says. (Of course, cells can die by other mechanisms, such as apoptosis, first.) Halfmann's team quantified the driving force for these proteins to crystallize in different human cell types and found that their concentration is correlated with the rate of cell turnover in our body. For example, some blood cells are replaced every few days, whereas neurons often last a lifetime. The faster cells normally turn over, the more of these immune proteins they tend to have, suggesting that this process of spontaneous activation might be responsible for killing them. Finding ways to keep the proteins from crystallizing could potentially extend cells' lifespan and reduce aging-related inflammation, but the trade-off would be a weaker immune system, Halfmann says. This feature of the immune system is very ancient. “If you're a single-celled organism, there's no drive to kill yourself,” Halfmann says.

Transient star-like objects of unknown origin have been identified in the first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) conducted prior to the first artificial satellite. We tested speculative hypotheses that some transients are related to nuclear weapons testing or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reports. A dataset comprising daily data (11/19/49—4/28/57) regarding identified transients, nuclear testing, and UAP reports was created (n = 2,718 days). Results revealed significant (p = .008) associations between nuclear testing and observed transients, with transients 45% more likely on dates within + /- 1 day of nuclear testing. For days on which at least one transient was identified, significant associations were noted between total number of transients and total number of independent UAP reports per date (p = 0.015). For every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in number of transients identified. Small but significant (p = .008) associations between nuclear testing and number of UAP reports were also noted. These findings may help elucidate the nature of POSS-I transients and strengthen empirical support for the UAP phenomenon. Transient star-like objects have been identified in sky surveys conducted prior to the launch of the first artificial satellite on October 4, 19571,2. These short-lived transients (lasting less than one exposure time of 50 min) have point spread functions and are absent in images taken shortly before the transients appear and in all images from subsequent surveys3. As reported previously in this journal3, in some cases multiple transients appear in a single image, exhibiting characteristics not easily accounted for by prosaic explanations (e.g., gravitational lensing, gamma ray bursts, fragmenting asteroids, plate defects)3,4. We have identified numerous transients in the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) as well as in other sky surveys as part of the Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project1,2,3. The source of the transients identified remains unknown and cannot be directly tested due to their historical nature. Nonetheless, examination of contemporaneous correlates of these transients may provide information useful for elucidating their possible origin. Systematic research of this type has not previously been conducted. However, anecdotal reports suggest speculative hypotheses regarding possible correlates of transients for which sufficient data are available to enable empirical testing. Possible associations of transients with nuclear weapons testing might be considered for two reasons. From 1951 until the launch of Sputnik in 1957, at least 124 above-ground nuclear tests were conducted by the United States (U.S.), Soviet Union, and Great Britain. This phenomenon can be observed in the atmosphere in response to high energy particles (e.g., gamma rays), although it is influenced by both particle energies and atmospheric density6. Consistent with this concept, glowing “fireballs” in the sky were reported in multiple instances to occur shortly after nuclear tests in locations where significant nuclear fallout was expected7,8. Based on such observations, we hypothesize that some transients might represent an unrecognized atmospheric effect of nuclear testing. Alternatively, it is also possible that fallout from nuclear testing may itself cause direct contamination of astronomical photographic plates, with a characteristic appearance of fogged spots noted on X-Ray sensitive photographic film9. We also considered a very different potential reason for links between nuclear testing and transients. Contemporaneous newspaper accounts and records from the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of what are now called Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) indicate that unusual, apparently metallic objects of unknown origin were reported in the sky on multiple occasions on dates immediately before, during, and after nuclear weapons tests7. UAP have often been reported at nuclear power plants and sites involved in nuclear weapons production as well7,10. We hypothesized that if UAP seen during nuclear tests were metallic, they might reflect sunlight (or possibly emit light directly) and thus appear as transients if they were in geosynchronous orbits immediately before or after their appearance during nuclear testing. Consistent with this, we note POSS-I images from July 19, 1952 and July 27, 1952, each of which exhibit multiple bright transients (see Fig. These dates coincide with two consecutive weekends during which multiple UAP were observed for several hours both visually and on radar over Washington, D.C.11,12. We speculate that some transients could potentially be UAP in Earth orbit that, if descending into the atmosphere, might provide the stimulus for some UAP sightings. Four exposures of the 3 × 3 arcmin region of sky centered on the triple transient identified in July 1952. Upper left: The POSS I red image on July 19, 1952 at 8:52 (UT) containing the triple transient just above center. Upper right: A 10 m exposure POSS I blue image of the same region taken immediately afterward with no evidence of the triple transient. Lower left and right: POSS I red (left) and blue (right) images taken two months later (September 14, 1952) showing the transient still gone. In the current study, we conducted a preliminary test of the speculative hypotheses above using a database we have created of > 100,000 transients identified in POSS-I survey images (see Methods). Each of these transients does not appear in a POSS-I image taken shortly before or in images from subsequent surveys. We examined associations of both the presence of any transient (Yes/No) and the number of transients (across the entire sky) identified on each date with: 1) dates of above-ground nuclear testing (from publicly available sources) and 2) reports of at least one UAP on that date (Yes/No) and the total number of independent UAP reported on that date in a comprehensive database of UAP witness reports (UFOCAT; see Methods). While we anticipated significant noise in the UAP sighting data (e.g., due to witness error) and potentially in the transient data as well (e.g., misidentifications related to dust, cosmic radiation, etc. ), we believed it was important to subject these novel hypotheses to direct empirical test to provide a preliminary evaluation of possible associations between observed transients and both nuclear testing and UAP sightings. In the overall sample, the number of transients per date ranged from 0 to 4,528 (across multiple locations on multiple plates), with 5% trimmed mean = 10.09 and median = 0.0. Above-ground nuclear weapons tests (U.S., Soviet, and British) were conducted on 124 days (4.6%) during the study period. For days on which at least one UAP sighting was reported, the 5% trimmed mean number of independent sightings (i.e., in different states or countries) was 3.77, with a median of 3.0 sighting reports. The number of UAP reports was significantly higher within a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 3.68) than outside of a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 3.31; Mann–Whitney U = 447,057, p = 0.008), suggesting some degree of association between these two outcomes. We first tested for possible associations between occurrence of transients and nuclear weapons tests. Potential associations with transients were tested in two ways. Table 1 displays a 2 X 2 crosstabulation portraying whether each date was within a nuclear testing window (Yes/No) by whether any transient was observed on that date (Yes/No). Transients occurred significantly more often within a nuclear testing window than outside of a nuclear testing window, Chi-Square (1) = 6.94, p = 0.008. We note that 15.6% of nuclear test dates were associated with at least one transient whereas only 10.8% of dates outside of a nuclear testing window were associated with a transient. Our findings indicated that the relative risk ratio for a transient to occur when within a nuclear test window (relative to being outside of a nuclear test window) was 1.45 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.10 – 1.90). Thus, a transient was 45% more likely to be observed on dates within a nuclear test window (day of test + /- 1 day) compared to dates outside of a nuclear test window. Follow-up secondary analyses were then conducted to examine in more granular fashion the timing of the association between nuclear testing and occurrence of transients. Table 2 summarizes the association between occurrence of transients and different time windows relative to nuclear testing, ranging from 2 days before a test until 2 days after a test. The only association that reached statistical significance was for the association in which transients occur 1 day after nuclear testing. Transients were observed on 18.5% of days that were 1 day following a nuclear test, whereas transients were noted on only 11.0% of days not meeting this criterion. These findings indicate that the chances of observing a transient were 68% higher on the day following a nuclear test compared to days unassociated with nuclear testing. Beyond dichotomous occurrence of transients, we also tested for differences in the total number of transients observed on a given date as a function of whether that date fell within a nuclear testing window. Significantly more transients were observed on dates within a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 23.40) than outside of a nuclear testing window (5% trimmed mean = 8.55; Mann–Whitney U = 431,649.5, p = 0.007). Because UAP reports were so common (at least one report on 89.3% of study dates), examination of possible links between transients and UAP sightings as dichotomous measures was of limited value (this test was not significant; Chi-Square = 2.43, p = 0.12). Instead, statistically more powerful analyses based on continuous measures were used to test associations between the number of UAP reports and number of transients observed on a given date. The first approach simply examined the correlation between number of transients and number of UAP sighting reports on a given night. This simple analysis revealed a very small but statistically significant association (i.e., beyond chance) between the total number of transients and total UAP reports on a given date (Spearman's rho = 0.138, p = 0.015). A scatterplot of this association is presented in Fig. Both variables have been log10 transformed to enhance scaling for clarity. To address limitations of the simple correlation analysis approach above, we employed a second and statistically more powerful analytic approach to test our transient-UAP hypothesis in a manner that utilized all of the information available in the data. That is, we observed that the total number of transients per date was highly right-skewed and over-dispersed, approximating a negative binomial distribution. We therefore used Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analyses specifying a negative binomial distribution to test associations between number of UAP reports and number of transients each day in the overall sample. Results revealed a significant positive association between number of UAP reported and number of transients observed (Beta = 0.081, Standard Error = 0.006, p < 0.001). The exponentiated parameter estimate [Exp(B)] = 1.085] indicated that for every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in the number of transients observed. Finally, because both nuclear testing and UAP reports were individually associated with transients, we also explored whether their linear combination was associated with total number of transients (i.e., are the observed associations additive?). We created a new categorical variable coded as follows: 0 = No UAP on that date and the date was not within a nuclear testing window, 1 = At least one UAP report that date or the date was within a nuclear testing window, and 2 = At least one UAP report that date and the date was within a nuclear testing window. The dependent variable was total number of transients for each date, so for reasons described above we again used a GLM analysis specifying a negative binomial distribution. Results were statistically significant, Beta = 1.073, Standard Error = 0.0834, p < 0.001. Estimated marginal means (with 95% confidence intervals) for each group are presented in Table 3. Dates with no UAP reports that were not within a nuclear testing window were associated with the fewest total transients whereas dates with at least one UAP report and that were within a nuclear testing window displayed the highest total number of transients. All pairwise differences between these individual groups were significant (p's < 0.001) and the 95% confidence intervals for each did not overlap. This study provided a preliminary test of hypothesized associations between short-lived star-like transients identified in POSS-I sky survey images from 1949 and 1957 and both nuclear weapons testing and reports of UAP sightings. The study premise was that identifying contemporaneous correlates of transients might help elucidate their nature and origin, which currently is unknown. Our results revealed several intriguing statistical associations. First, although not the primary study focus, we observed a small but statistically-significant association between nuclear weapons testing and increased UAP sightings. Significantly more UAP sightings were reported within nuclear weapons testing windows (test date + /- 1 day) than outside of testing windows. To our knowledge, this statistical association has not previously been reported in the peer-reviewed literature, although it is consistent with anecdotal reports of such associations7. Next, in tests of our primary hypotheses, we found that both dichotomous occurrence of transients and the total number of transients observed on a given date were associated with nuclear testing beyond chance. Transients were 45% more likely to be observed on dates that were within a nuclear test window than on dates not in a nuclear test window. More granular examination of the temporal sequencing of these associations revealed that the strongest (and only significant) association was between nuclear testing and increased likelihood of a transient occurring one day after that test. We also note an intriguing incidental finding regarding possible nuclear testing-transient links. The last date on which a transient was observed within a nuclear testing window in this dataset was March 17, 1956, despite there being an additional 38 above-ground nuclear tests in the subsequent 13 months of the study period. A prior study of associations between UAP reports and nuclear weapons-related production and assembly sites (excluding nuclear weapons tests) concluded that elevated UAP activity at such sites began in 1948, increased dramatically and continued through 1952, but then precipitously decreased in 1953 and remained low through 1975 (end of their study period)10. This sudden and sustained decrease in UAP reports at nuclear production facilities in 1953 occurred despite major new nuclear weapons production and assembly facilities coming online during that time (e.g., the Savannah River and Pantex sites)10. Taken together, the period between 1953 and 1956 seems to mark a shift in a multiyear pattern of apparent UAP-nuclear associations. While the meaning of these parallel decreases in UAP activity at both nuclear weapons production and testing locations in the mid-1950s is unclear, they may represent convergent evidence for the validity of associations between UAP and nuclear weapons-related activity. Finally, our hypothesis of associations between transients and UAP reports was also supported. We detected a very small positive correlation, which was well beyond chance, between the number of transients observed and the number of UAP reported on a given date (Spearman's rho = 0.14). This association was observed when analyses were restricted to dates on which at least one transient occurred, an analysis mitigating the potentially significant bias resulting from the large proportion of dates (88.5%) on which no transients were observed. This finding supports our hypothesis of potentially meaningful associations between transients and UAP reports. Other analyses examining the full sample indicated that for every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in number of transients observed on that date. Our results further suggest these associations are additive, with the largest number of transients seen for dates within a nuclear testing window on which at least one UAP was reported. However, our results do argue against several prosaic explanations for transients. Our overall pattern of results is clearly not consistent with the proposition that most transients are due to contamination or defects in photographic plates or scanned images, or to any other local confounds at the observatory itself. Contamination of photographic plates by nuclear fallout produces diffuse fogged spots quite different in appearance than the discrete star-like brightness profiles with point spread functions characteristic of transients3,9. These explanations would also not account for the association of transients with UAP reports from multiple locations distant from the observatory. Associations between transients and both UAP and nuclear testing reported in this study also cannot be plausibly attributed to any form of observer bias, as the existence of transients was unknown at the time they occurred and the dates/times of nuclear tests were generally unknown to the individuals who were reporting the UAP. Regarding what transients might be, our findings point toward two hypotheses that could account for associations of transients with both nuclear testing and UAP reports. The first involves an unexpected and previously undocumented atmospheric phenomenon triggered by nuclear detonations or related to nuclear fallout that may serve as a stimulus for some UAP reports and appear as transients on astronomical images. While the latter is potentially plausible, effects in the atmosphere (rather than geosynchronous orbit) would be likely to result in a streak on the image over the 50 min exposure, yet all transients appear as distinct point sources rather than streaks. Moreover, this hypothesis is made even more unlikely given that transients were most often observed one day after a nuclear test; such atmospheric phenomena would have to be sustained and remain localized in one location for approximately 24 h to account for the visual appearance of transients. The second hypothesis is more speculative, drawing on a well-known strand of UAP lore suggesting that nuclear weapons may attract UAP7,8. While this alleged connection has been claimed for decades based on anecdotal evidence, it has until now lacked any systematic supporting data. Within this latter hypothesis, our results could be viewed as indicating that transients are artificial, reflective objects either in high-altitude orbits around Earth13 or at high altitudes within the atmosphere. Regardless of what transients are ultimately determined to be, our results add to growing evidence supporting the interpretation of transients as real observations1,3,13 rather than as emulsion defects. Detection of these small effects was enabled by the high statistical power resulting from the large sample size available. While a small subset of these have been subjected to manual confirmation, application of more sophisticated systematic validation methods employing artificial intelligence might reduce any misidentifications of transients and result in a higher signal to noise ratio, thereby increasing the magnitude of associations like those reported here. There is also undoubtedly substantial noise in the UAP data examined that could have minimized the size of observed associations. Witness reports are affected by various types of errors14,15,16 and reports in the UFOCAT database that provided UAP data for the current work have not been evaluated for validity in any systematic way. Additionally, the magnitude of the associations between transients and both nuclear tests and UAP might have been limited by the fact that the Palomar Observatory from which transients were observed only provides observations from a single geographic point, whereas nuclear weapons tests and UAP reports can occur worldwide. Finally, transients may be heterogeneous in nature and derived from multiple causes, limiting the magnitude of their association with any single correlate. In conclusion, data obtained prior to launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957 reveal small but statistically-significant associations between short-lived star-like transients and both above-ground nuclear weapons testing and UAP sightings. Our findings provide additional empirical support for the validity of the UAP phenomenon and its potential connection to nuclear weapons activity, contributing data beyond eyewitness reports. The possibility that some transients may represent UAP events in orbit captured on photographic plates prior to the launch of the first artificial satellite cannot be ruled out. These transients were identified in publicly-available scanned images from the POSS-I survey available on the DSS Plate Finder website (https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_plate_finder). The process used to identify transients and eliminate misidentifications was conducted via an automated workflow detailed fully in Solano et al.1. In brief, transients were defined as distinct star-like point sources present in POSS-I E Red images that were absent both in images taken immediately prior to the POSS-I Red image and in all subsequent images. A final criterion for classifying an object as a transient was that there were no counterparts either in PanStarrs DR1 or Gaia DR3 at less than 5 arcsec. For many dates, transients were noted in multiple images reflecting observations of different locations in the sky. The transient dataset (ASCII format) was converted to an SPSS for Windows data file that included a single line for each date on which at least one transient occurred, with a count variable created to summarize the total number of transients observed on each date. An SPSS dataset was created from public sources which included the dates of all above-ground nuclear weapons tests during the study period. Tests conducted by the United States were identified from: Tests conducted by the Soviet Union were identified from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_the_Soviet_Union. Tests conducted by Great Britain were identified from: https://chrc4veterans.uk/knowledge-hub/british-nuclear-weapons-testing/. Anecdotal reports from individuals present during nuclear tests in the 1950's have variously reported UAP to be present at nuclear test sites before, during, and after nuclear tests7. Therefore, our primary outcome was a nuclear testing window variable (coded 1/0 for Yes/No) that indicated whether a given date fell within a 3-day window surrounding any nuclear test (test date + /- 1 day). To permit subsequent examination of the temporal sequencing of transient associations with nuclear testing at a more granular level, we also created (post-hoc) several variables indicating whether a given date occurred at specific intervals relative to nuclear testing: 2 days before, 1 day before, day of testing, 1 day after, and 2 days after. UAP witness report data were derived from the publicly-available comprehensive UFOCAT database maintained by the Center for UFO Studies (https://cufos.org/cufos-publications-databases/ufocat/). This database originated with the U.S. Air Force funded-University of Colorado UFO Study led by Dr. Edward Condon (1966–1968). It has been updated periodically since that time. The original UFOCAT Microsoft Access database was imported into SPSS. This database contained many identical, duplicate entries (same date and location) obtained from different sources; only a single entry for each discrete report was retained. Next, to reduce the chances of duplicate reports of the same UAP described by separate witnesses on the same date and the same location (i.e., same state), only a single entry was retained in these cases. Finally, a variable reflecting the total count of UAP sightings reported from independent locations on each date was created. The final analyzed dataset began with creation of an SPSS master file with a separate record for every date within the study period, 11/19/49 to 4/28/57 (n = 2,718 days). Next, dichotomous variables (coded 1/0 for Yes/No) were created to indicate whether each date in the master file was associated with at least one transient and/or with at least one UAP report. Both dichotomous and continuous variables were available for the transient data (any transient Yes/No and total number of transients identified on each date) and for the UAP data (any UAP Yes/No and total number of independent UAP reports on each date). The nuclear testing variable was only available as a dichotomous index, that is, whether each date fell within a nuclear testing window (coded 1/0 for Yes/No). All analyses were carried out using the SPSS for Windows Version 29 statistical package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). To aid in interpretation of the magnitude of the association between nuclear testing and transients, we adopted a relative risk approach like that commonly used in medical research. That is, we calculated the likelihood of a transient being observed (the “outcome”) based on whether its date was within a nuclear weapons testing window (the “exposure”). This relative risk ratio was calculated using an online calculator: https://www.medcalc.org/calc/relative_risk.php. Due to significantly non-normal distributions of the variables reflecting total number of transients and total number of UAP per night, differences in these variables as a function of nuclear testing were examined using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test. For characterizing the nature of group differences in these nonparametric tests, we present 5% trimmed means given the highly skewed distributions of these variables and that median values were generally uninformative (e.g., median total transients = 0). Also for distributional reasons, associations between these two continuous measures were tested using the nonparametric Spearman's rho correlation. To provide an interpretive context for the magnitude of the association between total number of transients and UAP reported per night, we conducted generalized linear model (GLM) analyses, specifying a negative binomial distribution given the highly right-skewed and over-dispersed nature of the transient data. 2, total transients and total UAP reports have both been log10 transformed (after adding a constant [+ 1] to avoid zero values) in order to optimize scaling in the figure.

We used high-throughput discovery proteomics and samples from presymptomatic patients with MS and matched healthy controls to define the biological neurological onset and characterize the mechanisms involved. Remarkably, evidence of myelin injury was seen ~7 years before the symptomatic onset and preceded evidence of axonal injury by ~1 year. By contrast, astrocyte involvement became evident only at clinical onset. Numerous changes in the serum proteome indicate the involvement of interleukin 3 and nuclear factor kappa B pathways during the presymptomatic stage. Furthermore, people with MS with a previously reported distinct autoantibody signature showed increased immune cell activity compared to those without. We propose a protein biomarker panel that may help distinguish presymptomatic patients with MS from healthy controls, pending validation in future studies. Our findings can help understand the pathophysiology of MS as well as the cascade of central nervous system injury and might facilitate early detection of MS in high-risk people.

Box-plot figure demonstrating the distribution of samples in relation to symptomatic onset of multiple sclerosis in the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Neurofilament light chain (NEFL) normalized protein expression (NPX) in samples from people with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to healthy controls (HC) in the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DODSR), and in relation to symptomatic onset of the disease. A shows NPX values in pre-symptomatic MS samples, their controls and the p-value for comparison (nominal p from limma models correcting for age and sex). B shows the same comparison using post-onset samples. C shows predicted NEFL NPX evolution over time between pre- and post-onset samples and p-value for interaction term between NPX and duration between samples using linear mixed model accounting for age at pre-onset sample, and sex. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) normalized protein expression (NPX) in samples from people with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to healthy controls (HC) in the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DODSR), and in relation to symptomatic onset of the disease. A shows NPX values in pre-symptomatic MS samples, their controls and the p-value for comparison (nominal p from limma models correcting for age and sex). B shows the same comparison using post-onset samples. C shows predicted MOG NPX evolution over time between pre- and post-onset samples and p-value for interaction term between NPX and duration between samples using linear mixed model accounting for age at pre-onset sample, and sex. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) normalized protein expression (NPX) in samples from people with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to healthy controls (HC) in the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DODSR), and in relation to symptomatic onset of the disease. A shows NPX values in pre-symptomatic MS samples, their controls and the p-value for comparison (nominal p from limma models correcting for age and sex). B shows the same comparison using post-onset samples. C shows predicted GFAP NPX evolution over time between pre- and post-onset samples and p-value for interaction term between NPX and duration between samples using linear mixed model accounting for age at pre-onset sample, and sex. Cellular network analysis of differentially expressed proteins in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) compared to healthy controls (HC) indicates the involvement of different cells, mostly of the immune system (B, natural killer, monocyte, and plasma cells) as well as trends for involvement of neuronal and oligodendrocyte cellular components. Cellular network analysis of differentially expressed proteins in pre-symptomatic samples from people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) compared to healthy controls (HC) indicates the involvement of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during the pre-symptomatic stage of MS. Cellular network analysis of differentially expressed proteins in pwMS with immune cluster compared to those without indicates the involvement of B-, plasma- and natural killer (NK) cells with a trend for increased network activity in T- cells.
