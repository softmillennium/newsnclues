                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix After twice battling with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Lando Norris took second place in the United States Grand Prix. Lando Norris was content with second place in the United States Grand Prix, the McLaren driver admitting that there was “not a lot more we could have done” on a day where he won out in a “tough” battle with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. A close fight unfolded between the pair, with Norris eventually making an overtake stick into Turn 12 on Lap 21. While both drivers seemed to be struggling with their tyres, Norris was able to find a way past the Ferrari just a few laps from the finish, allowing him to take a hard-fought second place. I thought we kind of had it in an easier way after the overcut. I expected a slightly easier second attempt to get through, but it wasn't the case. There's not a lot more we could have done.” During his duel with Leclerc, Norris' race engineer Will Joseph at one stage told him to cool his tyres before making another attempt at an overtake. So when I had my first try, I started to really struggle with the tyres and Charles was probably already in the consistent point.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Max Verstappen's dominant display over the United States Grand Prix weekend has closed the points gap to Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri even further. Four weekends later the Red Bull man is now  just 40 points behind the championship leader courtesy of three Grand Prix wins and a Sprint victory. “It was an unbelievable weekend for us,” said Verstappen after claiming Grand Prix victory. “I knew that the race was not going to be super forward. Just in that first stint was where we made the difference, and I could eke out a bit of a gap, which is basically what we kept to the end. “It wasn't easy to manage the tyres for most of the stints, but we kept it in the lead and I'm just incredibly proud of everyone to be able to deliver a weekend like this.” Piastri lacked pace throughout the weekend in Austin and could only finish fifth. Other than ruling out his title chances at the Spanish Grand Prix, Verstappen has remained relatively quiet on the topic, although McLaren has consistently warned that he remains a significant factor. However, after hearing his display described as “a champion's drive”, Verstappen was asked directly if he now believes that the chance is there for a fifth consecutive title. "It's exciting, and I'm just very excited to the end.” Formula 1 now moves on to Mexico City next weekend with Verstappen, Norris and Piastri set to do battle once again as the Drivers' Championship fight heats up.</p>

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix

He may not be in contention for race wins of late, but you just can't keep this man off the F1 rostrum...

A superb start from Charles Leclerc lifted him from P3 to P2 in Austin - and a masterclass in defensive driving kept the Ferrari man there for much of the afternoon, despite the best efforts of a marauding Lando Norris.

Ultimately Leclerc had to give best to the McLaren's superior pace, but that didn't stop you recognising a drive of supreme class as the Monegasque secured the final podium place. Here's how the voting broke down…

Charles Leclerc - 35%
Max Verstappen - 18.2%
Lando Norris - 8.9%
Lewis Hamilton - 7.8%
Yuki Tsunoda - 6%

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yuki Tsunoda was irked by perceived blocking from Liam Lawson in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, leading him to accuse the Racing Bulls driver of causing such instances "on purpose". Yuki Tsunoda has hit out at Liam Lawson for “always doing something on purpose” after complaining of being blocked by the Racing Bulls driver in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix. Their previous flashpoints included an earlier incident this weekend in Sprint Qualifying, when the two battled through the first corners in a failed bid to set a last-gasp time. Added tension exists with speculation that the two are battling for a single seat on the 2026 grid, with rumours that Isack Hadjar will join Red Bull and Formula 2 driver Arvid Lindblad could make the step up to F1 with Racing Bulls. I don't care about him, to be honest." Tsunoda, who will start the United States Grand Prix in 13th – one place behind Lawson – was further irked by blocking from one of the Alpine drivers, although he brushed this off as “maybe just miscommunication from their side”. So far, I just can't have normal Qualifying. “I think traffic is always a little bit tough around here, to be honest. We got hit real bad yesterday in sector one. “I can't possibly think where I could have been to be in front of him, but it's just one of those things.” Racing Bulls have shown strong pace across the weekend so far, but a heavy crash for Hadjar in Q1 and Lawson's Q2 exit leaves plenty of work to be done on Sunday if the team is to add to its points haul. Of his final effort, Lawson added: “We had a very fast car, we just got hit by a massive gust of wind at the start of the lap and then, from there, you're trying to make up lap time. We're all dealing with it, but we get hit at different points and unfortunately, it's cost us quite a lot of lap time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 United States Grand Prix DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 United States Grand Prix The United States Grand Prix weekend served up another entertaining affair as Max Verstappen's dominant performance further ignited the thrilling battle for this year's Drivers' Championship title. Max Verstappen had already been on a good run of form when F1 touched down in Austin for the United States Grand Prix weekend, having collected two Grand Prix victories across the last three rounds. This had brought his deficit to championship leader Oscar Piastri down to 63 points with six events remaining – but a near-perfect outing in Austin has reduced that gap even further, setting up a thrilling title fight as the 2025 F1 season nears its conclusion. Verstappen laid down a gauntlet early on by grabbing pole in Friday's Sprint Qualifying, while he avoided the chaos that unfolded behind him on Lap 1 of Saturday's Sprint – a melee that eliminated both McLarens – to seal another win. While he had to nurse his tyres to the finish, Verstappen still crossed the line some 7.959s ahead of Lando Norris in second. One thing's for sure – the fight is well and truly on. The squad had attracted attention on Thursday's media day after stating that Norris would face “repercussions” for his first-lap contact with Piastri last time out in Singapore, though they opted not to reveal the nature of this. After losing out on pole for the Sprint to Verstappen, Norris and Piastri lined up in second and third respectively – but both were dramatically out on the opening lap after a collision into Turn 1, a nightmare outcome for the Teams' Champions. Each car was repaired in time for Qualifying a few hours later, and Norris again had to settle for P2 behind Verstappen. Piastri, meanwhile, admitted he “didn't feel comfortable” in the session after taking P6. Sunday's race was not entirely straightforward for either driver. Further back, Piastri struggled to make ground and crossed the line in fifth. Ferrari's weekend in Austin certainly had its highs and lows, with Friday marking the low point for the Scuderia at a venue where they claimed a triumphant 1-2 last year. Leclerc had a gearbox problem in the sole practice session, severely limiting his running, before both he and Hamilton were left dejected following Sprint Qualifying. However, this paid off as he was able to jump Norris at the start and engage in a race-long battle for the position. Although he dropped back to third in the closing stages Leclerc was still happy with his podium because "it has been a tough second part of the year". Hamilton followed his team mate home in fourth place, completing a 27-point haul for Ferrari on Sunday and moving them to within seven points of Mercedes in the Constructors' Standings. More important for the seven-time World Champion, however, was a growing feeling that he is “finally getting on top of the car”. Actor Matthew McConaughey, golfer Ian Poulter as well as Olympic and Paralympic gold medal-winning duo Tara Davis-Woodhall and Hunter Woodall all took in the paddock, while Adele was seen posing with the drivers in the Mercedes garage. Keeping with a musical theme, singer Shaboozey also waved the chequered flag.</p>
