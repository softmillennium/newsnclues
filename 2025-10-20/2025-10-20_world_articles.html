                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marjorie Taylor Greene criticizes House speaker's strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately The US government shutdown extended into its 20th day on Monday with no resolution in sight, as a prominent Republican lawmaker publicly broke ranks with party leadership over the decision of Mike Johnson, the House speaker, to keep Congress shuttered for weeks. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative of Georgia, on Monday morning criticized Johnson's strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately. “The House should be in session working,” Greene wrote on X. We should be passing bills that make President Trump's executive orders permanent. The callout from Greene, who is aligned with the right flank of her party, is a noticeable crack in support for Johnson's hardline approach from the GOP over an extended congressional recess. Since 19 September, when members last cast votes, the chamber has not been conducting legislative business, although members have staged press conferences. Only the 35-day partial shutdown during Donald Trump's first term, from December 2018 to January 2019, has lasted longer. Johnson has defended his strategy as necessary to pressure Senate Democrats into passing the House's clean continuing resolution without policy additions. But Democrats have refused to support the measure without provisions addressing healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at year's end. We've explained from the very beginning, the shutdown is about one thing and one thing alone: Chuck Schumer's political survival,” Johnson said. The shutdown's impact grew more severe on Monday as the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration began furloughing approximately 1,400 federal employees responsible for maintaining and modernizing the US nuclear weapons arsenal. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, is scheduled to address the furloughs at a press conference in Las Vegas later on Monday, a spokesperson told the Guardian. Previous votes have repeatedly failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster. “I think the [Senate minority leader Chuck] Schumer shutdown is likely to end sometime this week,” Hassett said in a CNBC interview. He reasoned that some Democrats had been reluctant to reopen the government ahead of last Saturday's No Kings protests against Trump, which drew millions of demonstrators nationwide to rebuke corruption and authoritarianism.</p>

This past weekend, several large U.S. cities were the site of a second round of “No Kings” protests, held to express opposition to President Donald Trump over myriad issues — particularly his unilateral, autocratic approach to governance. While these cities had huge turnouts, protests in smaller localities had proportionally large crowds of their own, showcasing that the movement against Trump's authoritarianism is indeed growing, including in areas of the country where Trump had strong showings of support in the last presidential election. Over 2,600 No Kings protests, estimated to involve over 7 million people, took place in the U.S. on Saturday, including around 60 events in Wisconsin alone. Participants' last names have been retracted to preserve their anonymity. Monona hosts the largest (and longest-running) annual Memorial Day parade in the entire state of Wisconsin, and its Fourth of July Festival regularly draws in crowds more than five times its population size every year.

Although the protest disrupted traffic, most who were held up by their march honked their car horns in support and gave thumbs-ups as they drove past. Barbara, a participant in Stoughton's No Kings protest, indicated that she felt Trump was “a big, big mistake for our country,” and that it was important “to stand up for what we believe in.” “I don't like the idea that he's sending ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in and taking people without any warrant, they don't get any trial or have lawyers or anything,” she said. Craig and Laura, a married couple who had traveled to a No Kings protest in Delavan, also expressed frustration with the president's refusal to abide by constitutional norms. Around 1,500 participants took part in this small city's No Kings protest. Delavan is also the hometown of far right former Gov. Despite this, participants expressed outrage with the current administration's actions, especially its refusal to follow checks and balances. Laura also noticed that, since the first No Kings protest they had attended in June, participation seems to have gone up. “You can see the numbers increasing,” she said, with her husband nodding in agreement. Later on Saturday, a much larger protest took place in Madison, the state's capital and its second-largest city. Demonstrators held signs in support of LGBTQ rights, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in the face of Israel's genocide, and affirming the right of immigrants to live in the U.S. and be afforded due process. “Some media outlets have decided to go soft, and not tell the story of what's happening in America,” Nichols said. “Brothers and sisters, there are others that will keep telling the story, because we know this: Donald Trump doesn't want the full report of what is happening in America today, to the American people, because if it happened, the American people would know that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have gathered to say today, ‘No Crowns, No Kings! Rowan Attala, co-host of a local radio program called Salamat, also spoke at the rally, decrying the administration's attacks on free speech. Especially when, after two years of constantly protesting and speaking up, we have what, quite honestly, may only be a lull in a genocide paid for with your tax dollars,” Attala said, referring to Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell — who recognized that his presence at the rally may get him “in trouble on Monday” — said it was important for him to be there. The current administration's methods are overwhelming, Mitchell noted, stating that “the anxiety being built after every five-minute news cycle or tweet and breaking headline changing from one controversial and consequential issue to the next is leaving the most passionate advocate grasping for breath, with little or no time to organize.” Mitchell also warned against people sitting back or taking a break in this moment: The only way is for us to go forward. There may be a reason for their cautious optimism. Studies have demonstrated that, even when a small portion of people participate in protests, they are often successful at bringing about positive social change. One examination of nonviolent social movements has found that, when at least 3.5 percent of the population takes part in protests, serious political change typically results. The cities listed above not only reached that threshold but likely exceeded them. And in Madison, which has around 285,000 residents, the 15,000 or so who took part in its second No Kings protest is equal to about 5.2 percent of its population. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes. We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks. Resist the right-wing agenda: make a tax-deductible one-time or monthly donation to Truthout now!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Image of hunting stand circulated by the Secret Service showed it was in a tree, near president's Mar-a-Lago estate Federal agents are investigating after saying they found a hunting stand within sight of where Donald Trump typically exits Air Force One before a recent trip to West Palm Beach, Florida, by the president. Kash Patel separately provided a statement reported by Fox News which described the hunting stand as being “elevated” and “within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone”. The hunting stand in question was reported about a month after a state jury in Florida convicted Ryan Routh, 59, of trying to assassinate Trump on his West Palm Beach golf course two months before clinching his second presidency in the 2024 White House election. The agent fired on Routh, who initially fled but was later captured driving north. Meanwhile, on 13 July 2024, Trump narrowly survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In the earlier case, Thomas Crooks, 20, fired eight shots at Trump, with one bullet grazing his ear, officials have said. Officials said Crooks also killed one spectator while wounding two others before being shot to death by Secret Service counter-snipers. The cases involving Routh and Crooks have often been mentioned alongside several other instances of political violence just before and during Trump's second presidency, which began in January. In June, related shootings killed Minnesota's former House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, while wounding John Hoffman – her fellow Democrat, a state senator – and his wife, Yvette. And in September, conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was shot to death while speaking at Utah Valley University.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Hegseth also defended a bombing of another boat without providing evidence that it was moving drugs. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The United States carried out another deadly attack on a boat it claimed was being used by a left-wing Colombian revolutionary group to transport drugs in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump alleged without evidence that Columbia's president “is an illegal drug dealer.” Hegseth said the strike, which took place on Friday, targeted “a vessel affiliated with Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), a designated terrorist organization.” ELN has been accused of using proceeds from drug trafficking to fund its insurgency. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are — they will be hunted, and killed, just like al-Qaeda.” On October 17th, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), a Designated Terrorist Organization, that was operating in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility.The… pic.twitter.com/1v7oR879LC Hegseth's announcement followed a post by Trump on his Truth Social network calling leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro “an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs.” The US president further alleged that drugs have “become the biggest business in Colombia, by far, and Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long-term rip off of America.” Petro, a low-rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely. Trump has ordered attacks on at least seven alleged drug-running boats without providing concrete evidence to support his claims. In a series of posts on the social media site X, Petro said that “US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” repeating claims that some victims of the US strikes, including Thursday's, were fishermen. “They are not my enemies, nor do I feel them as such. Refuting Trump's accusation that he has “done nothing to stop” drug trafficking, Petro noted that “we have reduced the coca leaf crop growth rate to almost 0%. In past governments, there were years with nearly 100% annual growth. Today, half of the total coca leaf crop area has crops that have been abandoned for three years.” “I said in New York, on one of its streets, that I asked the officers of the US military forces not to aim their weapons at humanity.” The Trump administration revoked Petro's US visa following his speech. Perhaps Commander Alvin does not know it, but he is a true officer of the armies of Washington and Bolívar,” Petro added, referring to George Washington and the great South American liberator Simón Bolívar. On his first day back in the White House in January, Trump signed an executive order designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the president reportedly signed a secret order directing the Pentagon to use military force to combat drug cartels abroad, sparking fears of renewed US aggression in a region that has endured well over 100 US attacks, invasions, occupations, and other interventions since the issuance of the dubious Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne arrives at a cabinet meeting on Parliament Hill in October. The 2025 federal budget will include plans for a new financial crimes agency that will target money laundering and online fraud, the government announced Monday. Opinion: Canada lags allies in providing financial-crime guidance to banks, other businesses The new office will investigate sophisticated schemes that are often linked to organized crime. You need something which is best in class in the world,” he said when asked if the new agency would duplicate work that is already taking place by existing federal organizations. Monday's announcement did not include a specific cost for the new agency. A government document said it will be funded by “leveraging investments in federal law enforcement capacity.” Ottawa will also be launching consultations on a voluntary Economic Abuse Code of Conduct for financial institutions. The news release does not describe how the new financial crimes agency would interact with existing national organizations that focus on financial crime. There is currently a Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre that is described on its website as “a national police service that gathers intelligence on fraud across Canada and assists Police of Jurisdiction with enforcement and prevention efforts.” There is also a federal body called FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo met with survivors of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy for the first time on Monday, participants said, days after the Vatican's child protection commission accused senior Church leaders of being too slow to help victims. Leo held a meeting with Ending Clergy Abuse, an international coalition of survivors, the group said. The encounter, which included four victims and two advocates, lasted about an hour with “a significant moment of dialogue,” they said. The 1.4-billion-member Church has been shaken for decades by scandals across the world involving abuse and cover-up, damaging its credibility and costing it hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. An unusually critical report from the Vatican's own child protection commission, issued on Thursday, faulted senior bishops for not providing information to victims about how their reports of abuse were being handled, or whether negligent bishops had been sanctioned. Gemma Hickey, a Canadian survivor who took part in Monday's meeting, said Leo met with the victims in his office at the Vatican's apostolic palace, took pictures with them, and listened carefully. Opinion: The Vatican was looking for an improved Francis model, and just might have found one in Leo XIV Timothy Law, an Ending Clergy Abuse co-founder, said he mentioned to Leo that the U.S. bishops have a zero tolerance law, which was enacted in 2002 after extensive reporting on abuse scandals in Boston. “Why can't we make it universal?” Law said he asked the pope. Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is known to have met with survivors earlier in his career, when he was a missionary and bishop in Peru. Francis, who died in April, made addressing abuse by clergy a priority of his 12-year papacy, with mixed results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian energy supplies by 2028 will deprive Hungary of almost all of the gas currently consumed by industry and households, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said at a meeting of the EU Energy Council, which was held in Luxembourg concurrently with the Foreign Affairs Council. This year, Hungary is expected to receive 8-8.5 billion cubic meters of gas through it and expects to receive a similar volume next year. "The European Commission's proposal could make 8.5 billion cubic meters unavailable to us, while Hungary's total annual consumption is approximately 9 billion cubic meters," the Foreign Minister said, his remarks broadcast by M1 TV Channel. Szijjarto warned that Brussels' initiative would deprive Hungary not only of gas but also of oil, which currently flows from Russia via the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline and from Croatian seaports via the Adriatic pipeline. "This decision includes a ban on the purchase of both pipeline and liquefied natural gas from Russia. It is to be implemented in stages, with the full ban coming into effect on January 1, 2028," the Council's statement says. To enter into force this decision must be approved by the European Parliament. "Short-term contracts concluded before 17 June 2025 may continue until 17 June 2026, whereas long-term contracts may run until 1 January 2028," the document says. The European Parliament is pushing for an even stricter ban, demanding a halt to all Russian gas supplies to EU countries from January 1, 2027. Earlier, Hungary expressed its intention to seek an exemption from these requirements. The decision adopted by the EU Council stipulates that "amendments to existing contracts will be permitted only for narrowly defined operational purposes and cannot lead to increased volumes, except for some specific flexibilities for landlocked member states affected by recent changes in supply routes."</p>

MOSCOW, October 20. /TASS/. Russia expects the summit in Budapest to yield some progress toward resolving the Ukrainian crisis and hopes to address bilateral relations with the United States, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.

"First, we would like to make some progress on the Ukrainian settlement track. And to use this meeting to discuss our bilateral relations," he told reporters when asked about Moscow's expectations from the Budapest summit.

On October 16, following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US leader Donald Trump announced that the two leaders had agreed to meet soon in Budapest. Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov confirmed that Moscow and Washington would "without delay" begin preparations for a new summit between Putin and Trump, possibly to be held in the Hungarian capital. In response, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ordered the formation of an organizing committee to facilitate the summit, stating that the preparations "began Thursday evening."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Louvre museum in Paris announced it would remain closed Monday as investigations continue into Sunday's extraordinary theft of historic jewelry – and experts say the prospects of recovering the treasures are slim. Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases. The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre. Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds. Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for. “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn't been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “The French people all feel like they've been robbed,” he added. “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said. “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “It's the easiest way to clean dirty money.” The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said. “They don't appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.” Historic jewels stolen in ‘national disaster' for France: What we know about missing Louvre treasures “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.” Jewelry heist at the Louvre is latest problem to beset France's most famous museum “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we're going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN. It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned. More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found. More recent heists at other European museums include the theft of four ancient gold artefacts from a museum in the Netherlands in January. Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.

The catch also establishes a new Polish record, with the previous national record measuring 261 cm. According to Pyra, the struggle to reel in the massive catfish lasted over 90 minutes. “When we finally saw it, we couldn't believe our eyes - a huge, enormous fish, a real monster,” he said. After measuring and photographing the fish, it was released back into the water. The Rybnik reservoir is known for producing exceptionally large catfish due to warm water discharged from a nearby power plant. Pyra described the catch as proof that these creatures can reach truly extraordinary sizes. New Catfish World Record : 292 cm from Poland Krzysztof Pyra Adrian Gontarz Mamy tooooo ! We did it !

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Precious artifacts snatched from Paris's Louvre Museum Sunday include an emerald necklace set among more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife and other treasures of “inestimable” value. In the course of a brisk seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France's culture ministry. The thieves left on motorcycles, police said. One item, an ornate gold crown worn by Empress Eugénie, during her reign in the 1800s, was recovered near the scene, the ministry said. Art recovery expert Arthur Brand said the thieves stole important pieces of history in what was a “national disaster” for France. So these are the natural pride of France,” Brand told CNN. This diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland; Marie-Amélie, Queen of the French; and Isabelle d'Orléans, Duchess of Guise is among the items snatched by four thieves during the 7-minute heist. The diadem — a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty — features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre. The origins of the set are unknown, though some suggest it once belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette. A wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, this ornate set was crafted by the jeweler François-Régnault Nitot includes 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds. After Napoleon's empire collapsed, Marie-Louise bequeathed the original set, which also included a tiara, to a relative, and it was passed through generations of her descendants. In 1953, the set was sold to jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, after which the emeralds of the tiara were sold and later replaced with turquoise stones by an American collector. The necklace and earrings, however, were preserved in their original form and sold to the Louvre in 2004 for a reported 3.7 million euros ($4.3 million). Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was the original owner of this diamond-encrusted brooch, which was crafted by Paul-Alfred Bapst in 1855 specially for her, according to the Louvre's website. A Spanish countess, Eugénie was Empress of the French from 1853-1870 and considered one of the most fashionable women of the time. Comprised of 94 diamonds, the brooch includes the 17th and 18th Mazarin diamonds, which were given to King Louis XIV by former chief minister Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, according to the museum. The silver, gold and diamond bow brooch originally formed the buckle of a diamond belt of 4,000 stones which was exhibited at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, before it was worn by Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre's website. Eugénie is said to have worn the belt, crafted by François Kramer, during a visit by Queen Victoria to the Palace of Versailles in August 1855, and again in June 1856 for the baptism of the Prince Imperial. Eugénie later decided to transform the belt into a brooch and had one of her own jewelers fashion it into a more elaborate standalone piece, adding cascading diamond tassels. In 1887, the brooch was purchased by jeweler Emile Schlesinger for New York socialite Caroline Astor at auction for 42,200 French francs, according to auction house Christie's. The pearl diadem was made for Eugénie by jeweler Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier in 1853 and contains 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds, according to the Louvre. Thieves attempted to steal Empress Eugénie's crown, but it was found outside the Louvre, according to France's culture ministry, The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Orenburg gas processing plant was forced to halt gas intake from Kazakhstan on Oct. 19 following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry announced. Regional Governor Yevgeny Solntsev reported that a fire had broken out within a workshop of the plant, causing damage to the Gazprom-owned facility. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. The news comes as Kyiv continues to escalate its campaign against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service was asked to impose maximum prices at gas stations as fuel shortages worsen across the country. Russia regularly targets Ukrainian gas infrastructure and has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian cities ahead of the anticipated harsh winter. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. Basmat has a Master's degree in Political Management from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Governance from Toronto Metropolitan University. Only Russia friendly Hungary and Slovakia, refused to back the bill, which terminates Russian pipeline and liquified natural gas imports. The news follows a string of similar cases across Europe in recent weeks, which have already caused air traffic disruptions in Germany, Norway, and Denmark. Among the projects Kyiv is discussing with the U.S. is a terminal in Odesa to import American liquefied natural gas (LNG). Ukraine expects Russia to face a nearly $100 billion budget deficit by next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 19, underscoring Moscow's growing economic challenges amid the war. According to Zelensky, the proposed contract for 25 Patriot systems would be carried out over several years, "with different quantities each year." "We are expecting this week, also, to adopt a 19th package of sanctions. Unfortunately, not today, but we have also a leaders' meeting coming up on Thursday," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. "He's won certain property," Trump told Fox News, indicating that Putin would lay claim to Ukrainian lands as part of a U.S.-brokered peace deal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This item has been updated with additional comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump onboard Air Force One late on Oct. 19. Russian President Vladimir Putin has "won certain property" during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and should be expected to take Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired Oct. 19. The interview was taped a few days earlier, directly following his phone conversation with Putin on Oct. 16. The call came ahead of Trump's White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — talks that ended in disappointment for the Ukrainian delegation, with no promise of Tomahawk missiles. But in comments to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, who asked whether Putin would accept a peace deal without territorial concessions, Trump was cavalier about the loss of Ukrainian lands. "I mean, they fought and uh, he has a lot of property. Trump made no mention of Ukraine's sovereignty or international law, taking it as a given that an invading force has a right to "property" it seizes through strength of arms. "You know like we did under President Bush in the Middle East. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump echoed these sentiments on social media, writing that Ukraine and Russia should make a peace deal "with property lines being defined by war and guts." In an interview with NBC after his talks with Trump, Zelensky said he took this to mean Ukraine and Russia could freeze the war along the current line of contact, but that Kyiv is not interesting in surrendering "additional" territory to Putin. "We will give nothing to the aggressor," Zelensky later said in his nightly address on Oct. 19. Putin told Trump he was willing to give up parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for the entirety of Donetsk, the Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials. The Financial Times (FT) later reported that Trump pushed Zelensky to accept these terms during their meeting. "If (Putin) wants it, he will destroy you," Trump reportedly told Zelensky. Trump also said the Russian economy is "doing great." According to the official, Trump also grew frustrated with Ukraine's battlefield map and tossed it aside, saying he was "sick" of seeing these maps. Reuters reported later on Oct. 19, citing its sources, that Trump suggested providing security guarantees to both warring parties, leaving the Ukrainian delegation taken aback. Later in the evening on Oct. 20 while answering reporter questions on Air Force One, Trump denied telling Zelensky Ukraine would need to cede the Donbas in order to secure a ceasefire. "I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. They can negotiate something down the line," Trump added. Putin's latest proposal marks a shift from his earlier position in April, when he insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. While a small concession, it would require Ukraine to hand over territory that Russia has failed to seize after years of fighting despite significant advantages in manpower and military equipment. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 19 that Ukraine should not be pressured to give up its territory. "We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. The news follows a string of similar cases across Europe in recent weeks, which have already caused air traffic disruptions in Germany, Norway, and Denmark. Among the projects Kyiv is discussing with the U.S. is a terminal in Odesa to import American liquefied natural gas (LNG).
