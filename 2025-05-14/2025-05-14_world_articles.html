                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Badar Khan Suri's only “crimes” were his marriage to a US citizen of Palestinian origin and support for Palestine. Badar Khan Suri's only “crimes” were his marriage to a US citizen of Palestinian origin and support for Palestine. I was excited to begin a new phase of my academic career. On March 17, as I was returning home from Iftar [the sunset fast-breaking meal during Ramadan], a convoy of black unmarked cars blocked my path, and masked agents abducted me, without giving me any explanation. Later, after putting me in a car, they told me my visa was revoked by someone high up at the Secretary of State's office for my social media posts. I would be deported to my home country of India that day, they told me. On my flight to Louisiana, I was put in chains with hundreds of other chained people. We experienced such extreme turbulence that I was afraid the plane would be crashed deliberately. Between that night and the next evening, I was moved four times to different locations. I was never informed where I was going and not allowed to call my wife (aside from the first night) or attorneys until March 21, when I was transported to my present location in Alvarado, Texas. The whole process was started by dangerous pro-Israeli groups that are infamous for witch-hunting. Rather than protect me from this vicious campaign, the Trump administration came after me under the pretense of protecting national security and foreign policy. As a student of peace and conflict studies, I was introduced to many conflicts, and the Palestinian cause in particular stuck with me. I unapologetically support Palestinians, and their inalienable rights guaranteed by international law. Or is it true that elites are protected by laws, but not bound by them, while the unprivileged are bound, but never protected? To say it all started on October 7, 2023, is a cynical lie. Palestinians have suffered ethnic cleansing for more than a century. The United Nations is made dysfunctional through vetoes; even when the Security Council or General Assembly passes resolutions sanctioning Israel, they are ignored. This dysfunction has allowed Israel to commit crimes against humanity with impunity as it destroys hospitals, schools, universities and all life-supporting infrastructures. Those of us who have cared to look have seen videos of Israeli soldiers destroying kids' toys, raping Palestinian detainees in notorious prisons and killing medical staff. Nonetheless, the attack of October 7 was a crime against humanity, as many innocent Israelis lost their lives. It was inhumane and against Islamic principles: if you kill an innocent human, it is as if you have killed the entirety of humanity. It also defies Mahatma Gandhi's principle that means should justify the ends, and not vice versa. Gandhi's principle of nonviolent resistance to misery or tyranny is what I believe and practice. We can neither forget the Holocaust of Jews in Europe nor that Palestinians were not responsible for it. We must remember that Palestinian resistance has often taken nonviolent forms, such as the Great March of Return in 2018 and 2019. Unfortunately, their demands for justice were ignored by the world, and Israeli snipers killed more than 200 Palestinian nonviolent protesters, medics, and journalists, including forty-six children. As a matter of fact, Marwan Barghouti – the Palestinian Gandhi — has been in jail for more than two decades. Still, Gandhian nonviolent resistance is the best means to an inalienable free Palestine: a single state with unshakable guarantees of rights to Jews, Muslims, Christians, and others, which any factor — including a majoritarian electoral democracy — can never disturb. We can neither forget the Holocaust of Jews in Europe nor that Palestinians were not responsible for it. My Indian upbringing and education have shaped my stance on Palestine, as it comes from the great teachers, not only Gandhi but also Ashoka and Siddhartha (Gautama Buddha). My beliefs do not allow me to ignore the pain of Palestinians. The time-honored principles I have adopted as my own also empower me to leave no avenue unexplored in defying the witch hunt unleashed upon me and others who believe in freedom for Palestinians. We will reject authoritarianism and oppose this travesty of justice. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex trafficking trial is being shown images of “freak-off” sex parties involving his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Ventura, whose 10-year relationship with the music mogul ended in 2018, claims she was forced to have sex with male escorts in the drug-fuelled sessions, that could last as long as four days. “I'm going to put out two embarrassing videos of you,'” he is alleged to have told her when she began dating someone else. On a flight, coming back from the Cannes Film Festival, she said Combs played videos of the “freak-offs” while there were other passengers around. Combs' teenage daughters, Chance, D'Lila and Jessie, were not present for the third day of their father's trial, having left partway through proceedings on Tuesday. Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex-trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, and could face life in prison. Sean “Diddy” Combs's security guard cried when he saw Cassie Ventura's injuries, the R&B singer said. “He punched me, kicked me, I was trying to run away and I made it into the bathroom,” she said, adding that she tried to hide underneath a toilet to get away from him. When members of Combs's security team finally came into break things up, she had “black eyes” and “golf ball-sized knots” on her forehead, causing one of the guards to burst into tears. Ventura said she had to stay at Combs' home for nearly a week to recover from the injuries, where she was staying with the rapper's son. Sean Combs threatened to blow up Kid Cudi's car when he realised the rapper was dating his ex-girlfriend. Ventura said she broke things off with Kid Cudi, real name Scott Mescudi, in 2011, stating there was “too much danger, too much uncertainty of what could happen if we continued to see each other”. Combs had said he would blow up Mescudi's car, Ventura said, and that Combs wanted the rival rapper's friends to be present when it happened. At some point, Mescudi's car blew up, after which he, Ventura and Combs had a meeting at Soho House about their relationship. Cassie Ventura says Sean Combs lunged at her with a wine bottle-opener when he realised she was dating Kid Cudi, the rapper. Ventura then reads from an email she sent to her mother about Combs, in which she said the music mogul said he would “hurt” her and Cudi, and would be out of the country when it happened. Cassie Ventura says she did not have the “resources” to leave Sean Combs after he allegedly beat her at a party in Los Angeles. “I didn't have the resources I needed to get out and move, to get out and not have anybody stop me,” she testifies. Cassie Ventura says she ran away from Sean Combs after a drunken fight, but was brought back by his security team. She had drunkenly punched him in the face, prompting him to beat her and stomp on her, she says. Cassie Ventura says she was “shocked” the first time Sean Combs hit her. “I was just shocked, and I didn't necessarily understand what happened and why he was so angry except for the little bit he said as he was hitting me in the car,” she testifies. A photo of the Los Angeles hotel room where Sean Combs allegedly attacked Cassie Ventura has been entered into evidence at the court. Ventura claimed earlier today that the record producer threw a vase at her head, which missed her and shattered on a wall instead. Three of them are escorts whom she has previously mentioned in her testimony: Dave, Greg and Jules. Of one image, she says: “There is baby oil on me and I am standing there during a freak off with a candle and lubricant on the table.” One female member of the jury exhaled sharply when they were shown sexually explicit images from the Sean Combs' “freak-offs”, CNN reported. A male juror is said to have glanced at one of the pictures before looking away quickly. Cassie Ventura texted Sean Combs in 2017 saying: “You treat me like you're Ike Turner”, referring to Tina Turner's abusive former husband. “It's also the just sheer embarrassment, like how he treated me in front of other people.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The number of victims killed rose to three, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported at 8:42 p.m. If confirmed, the decision would mark the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion that President Volodymyr Zelensky is absent, either physically or virtually, from a NATO summit. The disclosure follows a warning from Digital Affairs Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski, who on May 6 said Moscow was carrying out an "unprecedented" interference campaign. Earlier reporting from the Washington Post cited a former Russian official who claimed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, would represent Moscow in the talks. Vyshyvanka, a traditionally styled embroidered shirt or dress, is the central feature of Ukraine's national clothing. Viktoria Roshchyna, 27, disappeared in August 2023 while reporting from Ukraine's Russian-occupied territories. Moscow admitted she was in Russian detention the following year. Turkish officials told Bloomberg that while they don't expect Trump to visit Istanbul, they are not ruling it out, and preparations for any scenario are underway. Editor's note: This story has been updated with the reaction of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Germany gave Russia until the end of May 12 to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, warning that failure to do so would trigger preparations for new sanctions, government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said during a briefing, Tagesschau reported on May 12. "The clock is ticking — we still have 12 hours until the end of this day," Kornelius reportedly said, adding that Berlin is coordinating with European partners on additional sanctions. The ultimatum follows Russia's refusal of a 30-day unconditional ceasefire starting May 12, proposed by Ukraine and its allies last week when European leaders visited Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reacted to the remarks, saying that "ultimatum language" in talks with Russia is "unacceptable." "This kind of ultimatum language is unacceptable for Russia. You cannot talk to Russia in this language," Peskov told a pool of Russian journalists on May 12. Over the past 24 hours, Russian attacks injured at least 22 people in Ukraine. This includes at least seven people injured in drone attacks overnight on May 12, a date from which the 30-day unconditional truce should have started. The Kremlin continues insisting on negotiations without an unconditional ceasefire. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, a federal appellate court ruled that an injunction barring the enforcement of Florida's drag show ban could remain in place pending the outcome of the case in lower courts, finding that the ban is likely in violation of First Amendment speech freedoms. Ron DeSantis, doesn't explicitly mention drag shows in its text. But the regulation of “adult live performances” in front of audiences with children present — including shows that use “prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts” — undoubtedly targets drag shows. Venues that violate the statute face fines and the possibility of having their liquor license suspended or revoked, while individuals could be charged with a misdemeanor. The law was challenged by Hamburger Mary's restaurant in Orlando, Florida, which regularly hosts family-friendly drag shows for its patrons. In a 2-1 decision before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, the court's majority ruling, authored by Judge Robin Rosenbaum, found that the law was not specific enough in detailing what should be regulated, adding that the plaintiffs had a very high likelihood of success in showing their First Amendment speech rights would be violated by enforcement of the law. Although the law itself never mentions drag show performances, those involved in its passage — including DeSantis and one of the bill's legislative cosponsors — directly alluded to targeting drag shows. The court recognized this fact in its opinion. “Though the Act applies to a range of ‘adult live performances, its enactors focused on how it would restrict one particular type of performance: drag shows,” Rosenbaum wrote. Brian Wright, a spokesperson within DeSantis's office, decried the ruling. “No one has a constitutional right to perform sexual routines in front of little kids. We will do everything possible to have this lawless decision overturned,” Wright said. “For them, lewd and inappropriate is just a drag queen dressed in clothes not exposing anything.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Georgetown postdoctoral fellow Badar Khan Suri had visa revoked and was arrested by immigration officials in March A Virginia federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Georgetown academic Badar Khan Suri from Ice detention during a hearing on Wednesday. Khan Suri was among several individuals legally studying in the US who have been targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestinian activism. He was previously being held at an immigration prison in Alvarado, Texas. Immigration officials revoked his J-1 student visa, alleging his father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, was an adviser to Hamas officials more than a decade ago in addition to claims that he was “deportable” because of his posts on social media in support of Palestine. Yousef, who has not been an adviser to Hamas in over a decade, has said Khan Suri was not involved in “political activism” on behalf of Hamas. On March 15, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a determination that Khan Suri's presence in the US “would have potentially serious foreign policy consequences”, according to a statement filed in the case by a Virginia immigration office. Khan Suri, who is married to a Palestinian American US citizen, Mapheze Saleh, is a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution's Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU). Many students and alumni of the institution signed a letter opposing his detention by Ice. Giles prohibited federal officials in March from deporting the postdoctoral fellow after his wife filed an emergency court request to prevent deportation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine faces a difficult balancing act — sanction more Chinese firms for aiding Russia's war machine without alienating Beijing, which could be key to ending Russia's invasion. Kyiv is currently considering imposing new sanctions against Chinese firms providing raw materials to Russia's defense sector, a source close to the matter told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. But doing so could risk pushing Beijing — an important economic partner for Kyiv — further from Ukraine and closer to Russia, the source said. As momentum builds around peace talks, with President Volodymyr Zelensky heading to Istanbul on May 15, Kyiv is hoping China can nudge its Russian ally toward negotiating a ceasefire and bringing end to the invasion, Ukrainian officials said. China could be a key country in ending Russia's war and ushering in a “sustainable” peace, the press service of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine has largely abstained from publicly bad-mouthing China, but the relationship has taken a hit in recent weeks as Kyiv grows more vocal against Beijing's support for Russia. Days after Chinese troops were captured in Donetsk Oblast fighting alongside Russians, President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 18 slapped sanctions on three Chinese companies. In an speech, he accused Beijing of supplying Moscow with gunpowder and weapons. While claiming to be neutral in the full-scale invasion, China provided 76% of Russia's battlefield goods in 2023, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE).Top Ukrainian sanctions official Vladyslav Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine is “concerned about some apparently Chinese-made components found in weapons used to attack civilians and count on our partners to take some serious action to stop it.”Ukraine sanctioned two Chinese firms — ​​Beijing Aviation and Aerospace Xianghui Technology Co. Ltd — as well as Zhongfu Shenying Carbon Fiber Xining Co. Ltd, for supplying carbon fiber to Russia used in Iskander ballistic missiles that frequently target cities across Ukraine, according to an official document seen by the Kyiv Independent.Days later, Zelensky said Chinese citizens were working in Russian drone production factories, even claiming Russia could have “stolen” drone technology from China, during a news conference in Kyiv. On May 9, as Xi Jinping watched Russian soldiers march through Moscow during the WWII Victory Day parade, Ukraine followed up with sanctions on the Hong Kong-based firm Smart Kit Technology. The company was already subject to U.S. sanctions for shipping raw materials and technology like chip-making machines to Russian enterprises.Meanwhile, Ukrainian media reported in February that Chinese companies were also investing in occupied territories and working with the occupying authorities. The recent sanctions are Ukraine's first proper slap on China's wrist. Zelensky previously accused Beijing of “disrupting” the peace process and supplying “elements of Russia's weaponry” during a conference in Singapore in June 2024, but took no tangible action. Prior to the crackdown on the Chinese companies, Zelensky's administration turned a blind eye to Beijing's “no limits” partnership with Moscow, despite China helping Russia, including by skirting Western sanctions and supplying dual-use goods for military purposes. There is little anti-China rhetoric from the Ukrainian government, and unlike other countries that support Russia, Kyiv hasn't cut ties with Beijing. Ukraine is unlikely to divest from China, as Beijing remains the top producer for goods that it needs, including radio equipment for military use, drones, generators, and equipment that props up the energy grid after attacks. Chinese exports to Ukraine reached a record high last year. While Ukrainian exports to China dipped from $8 billion in 2021 to $2.4 billion last year, this is largely due to blocked trade routes and war-time complications rather than any political decision, Dmytro Goriunov, an expert at the KSE Institute and Head of the “Russia Will Pay” project, told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine is unlikely to divest from China, as Beijing remains the top producer for goods that it needs, including radio equipment for military use, drones, generators, and equipment that props up the energy grid after attacks, he added. Kyiv's budgetary constraints mean it is stuck with China, for now. Issues began piling up when Kyiv failed to woo Beijing with its 10-point peace plan presented in 2022. Zelensky said he agreed with only some of China's points. Beijing hasn't recognized Russia's 2-14 annexation of Crimea nor the occupied Ukrainian territories Moscow claims to have annexed in 2022.A year later, China snubbed Kyiv's invitation to the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland that gathered nations supportive of Ukraine's peace formula. By June, Zelensky's frustrations reached a tipping point, and he accused China of “working hard… to prevent countries from coming to the peace summit.” Beijing maintained its neutrality and refuted “fanning fire or fueling the flames.” On China's end, it wants to make sure the status quo within Russia remains steadfast, Dr. Marina Rudyak, an international development consultant and a lecturer at Heidelberg University's Center for Asian and Transcultural Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.“It's in China's interest to keep its border (with Russia) stable and secure and keep Russia stable. After several attempts to engage with Chinese officials in Ukraine failed, Kyiv realized it needed a different approach. While Ukraine can't simply cut trade with China, it knew it had scope to go after Chinese companies involved in Russian weapons production, as well as two Chinese captains sailing sanctioned Shadow Fleet vessels. China strongly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulations,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a press briefing on April 22. Ukraine wants to open up dialogue with China so that tensions don't boil over. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis cautiously assured Ambassador Shengkun on April 22 that Ukraine “values its strategic partnership with China” while urging Beijing to “stop supporting Russia.” This does not bode well for their bilateral relations.“Further delaying or avoiding such contacts could lead to a crisis of confidence, which is highly undesirable,” the ministry added.

Canada Post says it's pressing pause on negotiations with the union representing postal workers with a little over a week before the deadline to get a deal.

The Crown corporation says the past few days of negotiations with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers have been fruitless, and this temporary pause will allow the postal service to come back to the table with “comprehensive proposals” that it hopes can move discussions forward.

The union calls the pause “reprehensible,” in part because there's no clear date for when these new proposals will arrive.

Ottawa asked the federal labour board to send workers back to the job in December when talks were at an impasse and a strike was disrupting holiday mail deliveries.

That reprieve expires on May 22, at which point a labour dispute could again grind Canadians' mail service to a halt.

Canada Post says any proposals will reflect the significant financial challenges that put the postal service's future in jeopardy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Venezuelan toddler who had been kept in US government custody after her parents were deported has been returned to Venezuela. Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal arrived at the Simón Bolívar International Airport on Wednesday on a repatriation flight from the US. “Today we have a great victory,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said. Venezuela had been demanding that the United States return the girl for weeks, accusing US officials of kidnapping her. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously denied the allegation, arguing the family was separated in an attempt to protect Maikelys from her parents, whom they accused without evidence of being part of criminal group Tren de Aragua (TDA). Related article Trump administration asks Supreme Court to resume deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants The mother Yorelys Bernal was later deported on a flight to Venezuela without her daughter. President Nicolás Maduro said Venezuelan officials had coordinated with lawyers and rights groups in the US to secure the girl's return. “I have to thank in fairness Ambassador Richard Grenell, special envoy of (US) President Donald Trump, for his efforts. And with Ambassador Richard Grenell, thank President Donald Trump, as well,” he said. CNN has reached out to DHS and the US State Department's Venezuela Affairs Unit for more information. The toddler and her parents entered the US in May 2024 to seek asylum, according to a court document filed by legal advocacy groups. In July, he received a deportation order under the Biden administration. Between October and March, the couple had weekly, in-person visits with their daughter, Espinoza stated. On March 29, Espinoza was sent to a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where DHS has transferred migrants, according to court documents filed by his lawyers. They said he was flown the following day to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison, which the US is using to detain hundreds of Venezuelan migrants it accuses of being violent gang members, though it hasn't provided strong evidence to back that claim. The girl was kept in ORR custody, with DHS saying, “We will not allow this child to be abused and continue to be exposed to criminal activity that endangers her safety.” This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce chief Howard Lutnick's firm backed controversial crypto giant Tether as Bukele ties deepened Trump administration's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and his family have had extensive business interests linked to El Salvador, whose authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele has grown close to the White House and who has courted controversy by imprisoning people deported from the US in an immigration crackdown. El Salvador also plays host to a booming cryptocurrency and new media industry, which has numerous ties to Donald Trump allies who are seeking to make money from various ventures which have sometimes drawn the attention of authorities or ethics watchdogs. Securities and Exchange Commission and Office of Government Ethics (OGE) filings, along with public records in the US and El Salvador, indicate that Cantor Fitzgerald, the firm Lutnick headed until weeks ago before handing off to a management team including two of his sons, holds an effective 5% stake in the cryptocurrency firm Tether, has negotiated several investments on behalf of the highly profitable company, and is custodian of the US treasury holdings from which those profits arise. Just ahead of that deal closing, Rumble inked another deal to provide cloud services to El Salvador's government, with Bukele's regime saying the arrangement rested on shared values of “freedom, innovation and prosperity”. Tether relocated to El Salvador in January, where the regime allows crypto firms to operate tax- and regulation-free – and has taken advantage of further tax breaks to accumulate real estate in downtown San Salvador alongside transplanted US crypto influencers and members of Bukele's family. Cantor and Lutnick's El Salvador deals raise further questions about the Trump administration's deepening involvement with Bukele's authoritarian regime, which has imprisoned 2% of its population during a two-year “state of exception”, which has consolidated Bukele's power during a harsh crackdown on criminal gangs. They also raise questions about the direction of cryptocurrency regulations after Tether's founder, Giancarlo Devasini, reportedly told associates in November that Lutnick would “use his political clout” to lift the regulatory scrutiny that has plagued the troubled firm for almost a decade. Tether – which reportedly mints the world's most traded cryptocurrency – has attracted controversy since it was founded in 2014 alongside sister company Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange by Devasini, an Italian former cosmetic surgeon who has relocated to El Salvador. As recently as October, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Manhattan US attorney's office was investigating Tether for its use in sanctions busting, money laundering, and “to fund illegal activities such as the drug trade, terrorism and hacking”. Many previous investigations and prosecutions alleged a fundamental fraud at the heart of Tether's business. As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to offer a stable reservoir of value amid the volatility of crypto markets, allowing investors to trade, invest and transfer funds in dollar-equivalent values. Its dollar equivalence is purportedly secured by an amount of US dollars, or easily converted equivalent assets, so that any holder can convert their USDT into dollars at any time. But cryptocurrency traders, critics, government agencies and law enforcement have persistently questioned whether Tether holds reserves equivalent to the USDTs it has issued. In 2021, Tether and Bitfinex agreed to jointly settle a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) suit with a payment of $42.5m, with $41m of that coming from Tether. The attorney general's office alleged that Tether had commingled client and corporate funds to cover up an $850m shortfall in their reserves. As part of the settlement, Tether and Bitfinex were not required to admit wrongdoing. The company has also resisted compliance with regulations designed to ensure that stablecoins including USDT have sufficient backing. Tether is not currently listed on European exchanges because of the company's refusal to comply with the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (Mica) framework, effective from 1 January. It requires stable issuers operating in Europe to obtain authorization as an electronic money institution, and to hold at least 60% of their reserve assets in European banks. The extent of Lutnick's relationship with Tether only fully came to light during his confirmation hearings in January, when US senators including Democrat Elizabeth Warren sought to shed light on how entwined Lutnick's business affairs were with the cryptocurrency firm. On 27 January, just ahead of those hearings, Warren sent a letter to Lutnick that in part said: “Your deep involvement with and support for Tether, a known facilitator of criminal activity that has been described as ‘outlaws' favorite cryptocurrency,' raises concerns about your judgment and ability to put the interests of the American people ahead of your own financial interests.” The relationship began at a time when Tether was in perhaps its deepest crisis. After they had paid the combined $61m in settlement funds to the New York attorney general and CFTC, Tether's Bahamian bankers lost their ability to process international payments, cutting them off from customers. Reportedly, an investment adviser from their original bank connected them to Lutnick. Last July, he told a crypto conference that at that time, “I said: ‘Show me the money'”, and that “we found every penny, and they had every penny, but they had it in what I would call some pretty godforsaken places.” Previous reports have suggested that at times, Tether's backing has carried significant proportions of so-called “commercial paper”: undertakings from other companies to repay loans at a future date. Cantor later became Tether's asset manager, and its position as a so-called primary dealer in the treasury market meant that it could liquidate assets with relative ease. Salvadoran media reports show that Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, US crypto advocates who head El Salvador's national bitcoin office, are also investors in Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange that was founded by Tether's Devasini and whose management overlaps with the stablecoin firm. That year, Tether announced a $250m investment in Bukele's project that sought to harness geothermal energy to fuel bitcoin mining at a so-called “Volcano Energy” park. More recently, Tether identities have been on a real estate spending spree in the country. According to reports, Devasini bought a house in San Salvador for $2m. This purchase of “a prime location in the historic center”, according to El Faro, came into force after the regime exempted investors in that part of town from income tax. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, bought two plots of land in the port city of La Libertad, in a deal that revealed he had been naturalized as a Salvadorian citizen. Tether is also set to receive tax concessions for a planned 70-storey headquarters tower in San Salvador. Weeks after the announcement, Rumble and El Salvador announced their partnership on cloud services infrastructure, despite the country announcing a separate deal with cloud titans Google in 2023. But the deal also put constraints on Tether's influence over Rumble. According to Rumble's 20 December press release and the SEC filing announcing the deal, “Rumble's existing Board and governance structure, including Chris Pavlovski's super-majority voting control, will remain unchanged”, and “Tether will own a minority position in our outstanding common stock but will not have the right to designate any members of the Board”. The company's central offering is an “anti-woke” video platform that won favor among Maga influencers beginning in 2020, amid crackdowns on pandemic and election disinformation on leading platforms such as YouTube. At that time, Rumble leaned into an anti-“cancel culture” pitch, offered signing deals to rightwing, conspiracy-minded and contrarian creators such as Andrew Tate, Tulsi Gabbard and Glenn Greenwald, and positioned itself as a pillar of a rightwing “parallel economy” of explicitly ideological, Maga-forward companies advocating for an ideologically inflected vision of “free speech”. Vance and Thiel reportedly exited their investments after Rumble went public in September 2022. In 2022, Trump's Truth Social platform, operated by Trump Media and Technology Group, became the first outside publisher to adopt Rumble's ad network, an alternative to dominant players such as Google's AdSense. At that time, Rumble's CEO said the ad network's mission was to “fight back against cancel culture”. On 12 February, Pavlovski was given a “new media” seat at the White House's daily press conference, where he told spokesperson Karoline Leavitt “Rumble was a victim of censorship at the hands of multiple foreign governments” and asked: “Can you describe what the administration will do to protect US interests and values worldwide?” Under Lutnick, Cantor “made a fortune, thanks to a favorable deal structure”, according to Forbes when it sponsored the special purpose acquisition company that took Rumble public in 2022. They have been popular in the last half-decade because they enable companies to avoid the investor and regulatory scrutiny that comes ahead of a more conventional initial public offering. Prospectuses filed by Rumble show that at the time the company went public, several people and entities related to Lutnick and his family had also been dealt in. Finally, Cantor was the placement agent for Tether's buy-in to Rumble. Normally such a role attracts fees, but Lutnick said at his confirmation hearing that on this occasion Cantor waived them. Rumble had several officers and shareholders besides Lutnick who have since gone on to serve in the Trump administration. Tech-right ideologue and venture capitalist David Sacks resigned from Rumble's board in December “to pursue a position in government”, according to a 13 December SEC filing. Sacks joined the board in 2023 after Rumble acquired Callin, the podcasting and livestreaming platform he founded, and Locals, a crowdfunding platform fronted by rightwing comedian Dave Rubin that Sacks had backed. Any share sales he made in the February deal were not subject to insider trading disclosures. Ethan Fallang, formerly a board member of Rumble and Narya Capital – the Vance-founded venture firm – resigned in January to work in government, according to SEC filings. Although he is not subject to insider trading disclosures, filings show that Trump's deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, has maintained his 5.72% share in Rumble since it went public. No OGE agreements or disclosures for Bongino have been made public to date. Patel, Gabbard and Lutnick all undertook to divest themselves of holdings including their interest in Rumble within 90 days of taking office, according to their OGE agreements.</p>

MOSCOW, May 14. /TASS/. The Brazilian embassy in Russia has confirmed that the plane of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will make a stopover in Moscow.

"The Brazilian embassy is aware that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will make a technical stop in Moscow. The embassy does not have any additional information on this issue," an official at the Brazilian diplomatic mission told TASS.

Earlier, Lula da Silva said that he intends to return to Moscow after his visit to China to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the upcoming Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul.

Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin will inform the press if Putin holds a meeting with the Brazilian leader today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin were still “maybes” for what could be the first direct peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years after the Kremlin on Wednesday held off disclosing who would represent Russia. But he did not say who would be attending from Moscow's side and his spokesman was unable to give further details on the matter on Wednesday. Trump earlier this week urged Ukraine to attend the talks and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly said he would be there, but only if Putin showed up, setting up a diplomatic standoff as part of an apparent contest to show Trump who wants peace more. Trump said on Wednesday he himself was still considering whether to attend the talks in Turkey but did not know whether Putin would go, something that Zelensky has challenged the Kremlin leader to do “if he's not afraid”. Trump wants the two sides to sign up to a 30-day ceasefire in what is Europe's biggest land war since World War Two, and a Russian lawmaker said on Wednesday there could also be discussions about a huge prisoner of war exchange. Zelensky backs an immediate 30-day ceasefire, but Putin has said he first wants to start talks at which the details of such a ceasefire could be discussed. Trump, who is growing increasingly frustrated with both Russia and Ukraine as he tries to push them towards a peace settlement, said he was “always considering” secondary sanctions against Moscow if he thought it was blocking the process. “Everything will depend on whether Putin is scared of coming to Istanbul or not. Direct talks between negotiators from Ukraine and Russia last took place in Istanbul in March 2022, a month after Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Some unconfirmed Russian and U.S. media reports had said that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy aide, would be in Istanbul and ready to meet their Ukrainian counterparts. But Russia's Kommersant newspaper, which is regarded as having good sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Kremlin, said on Wednesday evening that Lavrov would not attend. Trump has said he will send Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg to Turkey, while also offering to attend himself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's newly tabbed pardon attorney said on May 13 that his work will include scrutinizing pardons that former President Joe Biden issued just before leaving office in January. “I do think that the Biden pardons need some scrutiny. And they need scrutiny because we want pardons to matter and to be accepted and to be something that's used correctly,” Ed Martin, the pardon attorney, told reporters during a press briefing in Washington. “So I do think we're going to take a hard look at how they went and what they did and if they're, I don't know, but null and void, I'm not sure how that operates,” he added. Biden's pardons, issued in his final hours in office, went to multiple individuals, including former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). Martin said on Tuesday that the pardons were not particularly reasonable but that he did not necessarily think the use of an autopen would nullify them. That kind of conduct “does make you pause,” Martin said. “That's what you're supposed to do, is pause, just like if the Biden pardons are unprecedented in their extent. Right back to when Hunter Biden was whatever age you say, 'that's uncommon, we ought to take a look at that. He said that under him, the group will be giving more updates on its work and is exploring the launch of a portal that will enable people to provide them tips.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The composition of the Russian delegation will depend on the agenda to be discussed at the Istanbul talks with Ukraine, which are expected to address political and technical issues, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin. "The delegation needs to address both political and, I'd say, a billion of technical issues," the official said. "So the composition of the delegation will be determined based on that," he pointed out. Ushakov did not answer whether he himself is part of the Russian delegation. "I work here," he said as he headed to the Russia-Malaysia talks in the Kremlin. When asked whether the Istanbul talks could begin at 12:00 a.m. on May 15, the Kremlin aide said with a smile: "I've been thinking about it since early morning." Ushakov recalled that Moscow's proposal is to resume the 2022 talks "that were suspended by the Ukrainian side at the urging of Western colleagues and partners." On May 11, Vladimir Putin, speaking to reporters in the Kremlin, suggested that the Kiev authorities resume without preconditions the direct talks Ukraine broke off in 2022. The Russian delegation will wait for the Kiev representatives on May 15 in Istanbul. At the same time, he, supported by EU countries, started putting forward demands regarding the composition of the Russian delegation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel's weekly newsletter. Fighting jelly legs and vertigo, she can barely answer. This desert makes up 83% of Africa's largest country. It's the focus of a government master plan for tourism development by 2030 that aims to make Algeria a major tourist destination after decades of self-reliance post-French colonialism, which ended in 1962. Atanof takes the woman's camera bag — he's already carrying her small backpack. With nothing weighing her down, plus a push upwards, she becomes sure-footed again. Meanwhile, 20 donkeys carry extensive camping gear and supplies for a dozen people without faltering. In worn-out sneakers, a chèche (head-and-face scarf for Touareg men) and daraa (long, loose gown), topped with his own backpack and a large solar power bank, Atanof stabilizes the tourist. The 57-year-old father (“baba” in Arabic) of seven has made this challenging climb many times as a guide for 30 years. Atanof works for Touareg Voyages, an accredited travel agency that facilitates visas for international visitors to the Algerian desert. In January 2023, the government introduced a visa-on-arrival program for all non-exempt foreign tourists traveling to the Sahara — essentially everyone except citizens of Mahgreb countries (five neighboring states), Malaysia and Seychelles. That December saw the launch of an Air Algerie flight between Paris and the oasis town of Djanet. In 2023, Algeria had an all-time record of nearly 3.3 million tourists, including almost 2.2 million foreigners — a year-on-year increase of 44% and 65% respectively, according to the Algerian Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts. There are reportedly also plans to strengthen connections with various European capitals, particularly for visiting the desert. Atanof leads the tourists to the top of Tassili n'Ajjer National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with giant, sandstone “sculptures” by Mother Nature — “forests of rock” eroded over seven million years. Among these rock formations are an estimated 15,000 prehistoric paintings and engravings dating from 10,000-750 BCE. Atanof is one of the few people who knows where they are. Related article This 136-year-old London coffee store doesn't need to move with the times The Algerian Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts reckons this might be the world's largest open-air museum — a place where concave rock bases were “canvases” for paintings made of natural pigments like red and yellow ocher. Those are Kel Essuf (over 9,875 years old, the oldest form of engraved anthropomorphic rock art in the area), Round Head (7,575-4,575 years ago), Bovidian (6,575-4,575 years ago, depicting cattle and herdsmen), Caballine (3,575-2,075 years ago, known for its representations of horses) and Cameline (from 750 BCE, famous for its depictions of camels). Later he points out black fossils estimated to be a million years old on shards of red rock, and shows how colored stones can be pulverized into pigments. “Make-up,” he jokes, streaking some on the tourists' cheeks. The quest to see this prehistoric art involves an extraordinary adventure: a trek of about 75 miles across the craggy plateau where there is nothing but nature. These tourists think of it as a “desert spa,” they say, with daily exercise, healthy food, no alcohol, pure air, serenity and plenty of sleep. On this trip “I am returning to my primitive life … It's a very beautiful feeling.” Fresh breads are even baked with hot coals. A dedicated tea-maker ceremoniously mixes green tea with powdered sugar, pouring it back and forth from the teapot to a metal cylinder until it's well blended and frothy (the froth makes it easy to remove any wayward sand). “No tea, big problem,” says Baika, who explains that teatime is for storytelling — part of the Touareg oral culture. Baika shares several stories, including about “jinn” (Arabic for “genies”), invisible spirits believed to do bad or good. They pull wool blankets over themselves as he opens an offline stargazing app on his phone to show constellations in the clear starscape. Touaregs traditionally use the stars and sun to navigate, and time to measure distance.Based on the hours of walking, Baika estimates they've gotten as close as 30 miles from the Libyan border on this trip. Related article The hidden ‘Little Marrakech' oasis town that most tourists don't know about The Algerian government has also made recent efforts to secure borders with other neighbors: Tunisia, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco and Western Sahara territory. These are among several actions that have positioned Algeria — which now views tourism as an imperative for sustainable development — to slowly open up to the world. “In one week, you can review all of your life.” The visitors are completely unplugged in another world. There is not a car, building or sign of modern civilization in sight except for the brief passing of a few other tourists. Tassili n'Ajjer has spiritual and cultural significance for Touaregs. It contains endangered Saharan cypress trees that are more than 4,000 years old, says Baika, as well as medicinal plants and other organic materials used to treat a variety of ailments. (Who knew that steam from dried camel poop helps a cold?!) Sefar, a stunning part of Tassili that the group visits, even means “medicine” in the Touareg language Tamahaq. To the visitors' surprise, there is a virtual pharmacy in plants, plus a few freshwater ponds and even rain one night in the dry winter. “It's a myth that the desert has no water,” Baika says. “If that were the case, nothing could live here. The Algerian Sahara is also home to several animals like the desert fox, wild sheep, jackal and gazelle. They also become attuned to silence and the power of non-verbal communication. “If you look for peace and want to take rest for your mind, from your stress, you go to the desert,” Baika says. That's true throughout Algeria, which has remnants from several civilizations over the centuries from Neolithic, Numidian (Berber) and Roman to Arab, Ottoman and French. Its northern coastal strip, the Tell, includes the port capital Algiers, Mediterranean beaches, vineyards, mountains — and abundant Roman ruins, including the UNESCO-listed archeological sites Djémila, Timgad and Tipasa, which have spectacularly well preserved ancient Roman cities. After descending a steep gorge leaving Tassili, monster trucks drive the tourists to the sand “sea” of Erg Admer, where they walk upon golden dunes of epic proportions. Three sandstone inselbergs (isolated mountains) rise high on flat sand — one has prehistoric etchings of cows. The visitors see each other on top of dunes — mere dots among infinite grains of sand rippled by wind — and realize how small they are in the magnificence of nature.As streaks of sunlight diffuse over the ethereal landscape, from the top of the highest dune at least 300 feet up, one says, “Salam alaikum” (“peace be upon you” in Arabic). In fact, it is all about the journey.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. After six years of stagnation, the real GDP has plateaued and is almost ten percent below where it should be according to pre-pandemic trends. The energy crisis also fueled inflation and led to the largest one-year drop in real wages since World War II. Despite some gains in 2024, real wages are still eight percent lower than where they were trending before the pandemic. This economic malaise has helped the extreme right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, make startling and troubling gains. It managed a historic second-place finish in February's federal election. The new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, claimed: “Germany is back.” To be sure, fiscal policy reform was long overdue. But the new exceptions will not be enough to put the German economy on a sustainable growth path that benefits workers. Such an agenda will not solve the problems caused by real wage losses and heightened economic insecurity. It is bound to produce constant tension with the center-left coalition partner. Germany's economic success in prior decades relied on demand for its exports; reliable energy imports from Russia; affordable housing and food that together helped prop up living standards at competitive wages; and global leadership in the form of major companies of the mechanical and fossil fuel age. All these key planks of German power have been falling away. The war in Ukraine has led to rising energy prices; Chinese manufacturing success has made it more difficult to hold a leadership position in key industries such as clean technology; U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war is threatening export markets; and domestic policy mistakes have made this difficult situation worse. Beyond rearmament and infrastructure investments, Germany would benefit from a comprehensive fiscal reform that gives it greater latitude to advance policies that ensure the affordability of essentials and the creation of good jobs, speed up the green transition, and strengthen safety nets to encourage domestic consumption and less reliance on external demand. Such a program can generate shared prosperity and allow people to regain control of their lives. Since the 2008–9 financial crisis, Germany has maintained strict limits on spending, capping its deficit at 0.35 percent of GDP. That bar remains intact, but the coalition added major exceptions. Most notably, defense spending is no longer subject to deficit limits, a development that the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall hailed in its earnings call in March. To get the SPD and Greens on board, the new fiscal rules also include exemptions for deficit spending on infrastructure investment of 0.8 percent of GDP (about $40 billion) and on climate protection of 0.2 percent (about $10 billion) annually until 2037. Once the German economy is back on track, Merz and his allies reasoned, social problems would presumably solve themselves; Merz is an advocate for free markets and espouses “trickle-down economics.” When it comes to the military sector, however, Merz has pushed Germany into a Keynesian world of industrial policy and unlimited government spending. For everything else, the government is taking a back seat. Public spending on infrastructure and climate change is capped, while spending on social benefits is in danger of being cut. Merz is not planning to reverse rollbacks such as that cut. This laissez-faire approach could have a devastating effect on Germany's industrial base: Volkswagen, for example, is planning to reduce its workforce in Germany by more than one-fourth until 2030 while freezing workers' wages. Merz's far more generous approach to military spending will not boost domestic growth in the coming years as much as its advocates suggest. The defense sector is already operating near capacity, and in the short run, increasing government spending on weapons and tanks will have only a limited effect on production. Arms companies such as Rheinmetall have seen soaring profit margins, revealing their market power and the lack of competition they face even amid rising demand. Significant additional public spending may go into boosting their margins further. Rheinmetall's 15-fold stock surge reflects expectations of continued windfall profits. Of course, the government has insisted that this military spending will create well-paid manufacturing jobs. Yet Merz's cabinet is full of business executives and lacks a strong voice for labor issues, an absence that has drawn criticism from the CDU itself. Rheinmetall's profits almost doubled between 2020 and 2024, but the number of its employees based in Germany rose just 25 percent in that period. The conversion of civilian plants to military use does not offer much more hope. In the East German town of Görlitz, a former Alstom train factory was taken over by the German-French defense company KNDS and now produces tanks, but the factory's workforce has been slashed in half. The arrival of KNDS was clearly better than nothing, but it is unlikely to turn things around in a place such as Görlitz with a high unemployment rate of 7.7 percent. Given stagnant growth and precarious external demand, the government would be well advised to stimulate consumer spending and inspire greater confidence among consumers. Instead, Merz and his party have advocated for social spending cuts, partly to offset rising defense costs. It is unlikely that large cuts will materialize since no party, so far, wants to touch the two biggest spending pots—public retirement benefits and public health care. But the rhetoric alone can dampen consumer sentiment and affect spending habits. In addition, such messaging amid prolonged economic strain may further alienate voters. If citizens believe that their government is spending freely on defense while forcing them to shoulder the burden of a six-year economic crisis, Germany's mainstream parties may hemorrhage more support to far-right populists. Only 30 percent of Germans believe the new government will bring positive change. The AfD now has a narrow lead in some polls. For the first time since World War II, a right-wing extremist party (it was classified as such by German intelligence this year) has a realistic chance of winning federal power. Trump's tariff rollout in April triggered a major bond selloff and shook the trust in what used to be one of the world's most important safe haven assets. Loosening the fiscal rules to allow Germany to sell more of its debt would consequently grant the government greater fiscal firepower. Investments that create public ownership of critical infrastructure come at a lower cost than investments owned by private equity since public infrastructure does not have to generate profits. Enhanced European coordination can increase the effectiveness of military spending and enable some rebalancing of fiscal resources away from defense spending toward needed areas of investment such as clean technology and elder- and childcare. Germany urgently needs an ambitious industrial policy that delivers sustainable economic growth and good jobs. Key industries such as the automotive sector must regain competitiveness, in part by pioneering clean production techniques. Targeted green industrial policy with the right mix of incentives and conditions is needed to steer firms toward catching up with the technological frontier in clean tech. To ensure that workers benefit, firms should receive subsidies only if they pay decent wages and maintain domestic production sites. For large companies coming from China and other countries outside the European Union, joint venture agreements that require strong labor standards can be made a requirement for market access in key sectors—much as China requires joint ventures for foreign firms to access critical areas of the Chinese market. This could help secure jobs and technology transfers where Germany has fallen behind. To this end, Germany should strengthen domestic demand for goods and services. The government should raise the minimum wage from its current level of around 13 euros to 15 euros and give preferential treatment in procurement to companies that pay union-level wages. The government must also help keep down the price of essentials, such as housing, food, and energy, so that they do not eat up people's purchasing power. Authorities should craft an ambitious program to address the cost-of-living crisis through effective national rent control, energy price stabilization, and strict antitrust enforcement in the food processing and grocery sectors to reduce food prices. To be sure, its coalition agreement includes several useful ideas for a pro-worker growth model, but it is unlikely that Merz, an unreconstructed free-marketeer, and his conservative ministers will advance these ideas into workable policy programs. If mainstream parties can't offer an alternative playbook for economic policy that really addresses the current crisis, they will end up ceding even more ground to the extreme right—with terrible consequences for Germany's democracy. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that real GDP growth in Germany was almost ten percent below where it should be according to pre-pandemic trends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ALLISON CARNEGIE is Professor of Political Science at Columbia University. President Donald Trump may have backed off, for now, from the sweeping tariffs he proposed placing on almost every country in the world. Trump has established baseline ten percent tariffs on most imports. He has made those levies higher for a variety of specific goods, including steel. And he slapped 145 percent tariffs on imports from China, the world's largest manufacturer, although he has now agreed to cut this rate to 30 percent. The result has been a raft of trade wars between Washington and other governments, Beijing foremost among them. Trump's disruptions to the global economy are serious, and they may feel novel. Until those bodies helped standardize commerce, countries frequently used trade to extract concessions from one another. They created and exploited what economists call “hold-up problems”: when one state or firm makes an investment in another in which profits depend on the continuation of the relationship. Once such deals are concluded, powerful countries can coerce their partners simply by threatening to change the terms of the agreement. In the near term, countries can benefit from wielding trade as a cudgel. But in the long term, trade wars leave almost everyone worse off. Countries that once cooperated because of commercial ties turn into competitors. Trump may think his tariff regime will make the United States richer, safer, and stronger. But history suggests it will do just the opposite. Initially, this deal worked reasonably well for Hawaii, which grew much richer from the exports. But it made the kingdom ever more dependent on the United States, which was able to exploit this reliance to its advantage. American officials then eliminated tariffs on all foreign sugar in the 1890s and gave domestic producers a subsidy to shield the U.S. industry from foreign competition and keep prices low. Hawaiian planters were crushed, increasing support among the islands' U.S. elite for annexation. Hawaii was hardly the only country victimized by trade dependence. Their banks and railways in China were attacked by the Qing dynasty. Western investments in Cuba were sabotaged under Spanish colonial rule. Perhaps most famously, Germany used its status as one of the largest importers of eastern European agriculture to gain political influence in that region before World War II. These risks, in turn, suppressed overall economic exchange. Qing China feared that trade dependence was a security vulnerability and likewise held back from global markets. Imperial Russia embraced autarky in the late nineteenth century to avoid vulnerability. In this rough-and-tumble era, trade wars were frequent and destabilizing. Most famously, after the United States placed tariffs, embargoes, and export controls on Japanese oil, scrap metal, and aviation fuel, Tokyo struck Pearl Harbor in 1941. Trade tensions have featured in many other military conflicts, as well. Trade pressure and maritime coercion, for example, also helped lead to the War of 1812. There still were bright moments for trade in the pre-WTO era, especially after World War II ended. But for two decades, the U.S. Congress had to vote yearly to renew China's normal trade status, which legislators conditioned on Beijing making human rights and nonproliferation concessions. Although Congress always granted this status, the recurring uncertainty depressed trade and investment, as firms hesitated to engage deeply with a partner whose access to the American market could be revoked at any time. Economic actors, after all, require stable, predictable frameworks to make long-term investments. This effort sparked fierce debate within the United States about whether to permit accession. Advocates of integration argued that tying China's economy to the world's would deter China from launching military conflicts, lest it risk a cutoff, and encourage political liberalization. Opponents feared that economic integration before political liberalization would only strengthen an authoritarian competitor. The Chinese economy, already expanding at a healthy rate, began to grow even faster. For the WTO, Chinese accession was a triumph. The organization was created to increase trade everywhere and stop countries from using commerce as a weapon, and integrating the world's most populous country (and a former U.S. adversary) suggested the body was having its intended effect. And at the time, it was—countries typically obeyed the WTO's common rules, listened to its adjudicators, and played along with its enforcement tribunals. The resulting system was hardly perfect; it failed, for example, to stop China from using industrial policy as a means to promote specific sectors or companies, often at the expense of foreign firms, or from restricting exports to countries that criticized Beijing. Trade flourished, and the global economy grew more quickly than it otherwise would have. It adopted trade practices that outright violated the body's rules. Hold-up problems, once thought tamed, returned with a vengeance. Long-term investment and cross-border economic planning became riskier as geopolitical considerations reasserted themselves. During Trump's first term, these policies helped spur a more defensive posture by the United States' trade partners. The EU, for example, devised new geoeconomic policies such as its anti-coercion instrument, which allows the bloc to respond to economic coercion by imposing tariffs, restricting access to EU markets, or suspending international obligations. China and the United States began to separate out investments. But even if Trump's policies mattered little the first time around, that does not mean they will have trivial effects now. As a result, Chinese companies are already intensifying efforts to eliminate foreign components from their supply chains. Trump's tariffs are unlikely to help the U.S. economy. They will probably fail at their main stated goal—bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States—because businesses will be reluctant to invest more at home when Washington keeps making and breaking trade agreements. The White House, after all, could instantly render whatever domestic factories companies build unprofitable by slashing tariffs. Unlike in a multilateral system, bilateral agreements are difficult to enforce and thus difficult for countries and firms to trust. The result is even more uncertainty and thus less investment. Trump has already apparently used tariffs in an effort to annex Canada (in a strange redux of U.S. policy toward Hawaii), saying that Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming an American state and threatening “economic force” if it doesn't. In response, Canadians have pivoted away from the United States, including by boycotting U.S. products. So have people in other countries; for example, overall favorability ratings of the United States have fallen across Western Europe since Trump won. The United States is unlikely to attack any of these countries outright, although Trump has threatened Danish-controlled Greenland. But by reducing mutual dependency, his tariffs do lower the costs of military confrontation. If the United States reduces its economic reliance on Taiwanese semiconductors, for instance, Beijing might decide that Washington won't respond if China blockades or invades the island. Conversely, in a more transactional world, countries could use whatever dependencies still exist to gain a political advantage—as Berlin did with agriculture in the 1930s. Russia, in particular, has long used such tactics by manipulating the price of oil and gas to extract political concessions from countries in its periphery, contributing to regional conflict. Moscow's tactics have naturally led many nearby states to diversify away from Russia. Now, similar tactics are also costing the United States. Washington's ability to stand by its agreements has been the backbone of many essential global institutions, including NATO. He has already made a trade deal with the United Kingdom. In doing so, he is ushering in an era not of renewed American strength but of stagnation, fragmentation, and danger. History, after all, shows that this is what trade wars create.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvard University expanded its lawsuit against the Trump Administration's federal funding cuts on May 13 to include the additional $450 million in grants that administration officials announced were being terminated earlier that same day. That grant money, which was to come from eight different federal agencies, added to the already $2.2 billion in terminated federal grants. It was announced by the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, which includes representatives from the Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services, and was designed to “root out anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses,” according to one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. “Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus,” the task force said in a statement. “Jewish students were subjected to pervasive insults, physical assault, and intimidation, with no meaningful response from Harvard's leadership.” It asked U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs to block the grant terminations. Education Secretary Linda E. McMahon has accused Harvard of “engaging in a systemic pattern of violating federal law,” and alleged other issues such as political bias on campus and upholding an admissions process not based on merit. “Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government, since none will be provided.” In one instance, Harvard was criticized when a pro-Hamas protester, who faced criminal charges for allegedly assaulting a Jewish student on campus, was awarded a $65,000 fellowship grant by the Harvard Law Review. Harvard argued in its complaint that it was committed to combating anti-Semitism and ensuring its campus is safe for Israeli and Jewish students, and called the administration's actions a threat to academic freedom at the institution.</p>
