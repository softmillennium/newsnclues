                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem testified before the House of Representatives on Wednesday. In one contentious moment, Noem defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man with a protection order preventing his removal to El Salvador — and whom the Trump administration admitted was deported in error. Multiple federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have since ruled that Abrego Garcia's rights were violated. Last month, President Donald Trump insisted during an interview with ABC News that an edited image of Abrego Garcia's knuckle tattoos — over which the letters “MS-13” had been sloppily superimposed — was a real photo of his hand, and clear proof of his supposed gang affiliation. In a complete break with reality during Wednesday's hearing, Noem repeatedly refused to acknowledge that the photo had been edited, instead doubling down on unsubstantiated claims that Abrego Garcia was a human trafficker and refusing to directly answer questions from Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.). I don't “have any knowledge of that photo you're pointing to,” Noem claimed at one point. “It's so telling that you won't look at the photo,” Swalwell said. Swalwell wasn't the only Democrat to press Noem about Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia, “is an El Salvador resident” who has “been treated appropriately,” Noem said. “Why does your opinion […] have more authority than the Supreme court?” Noem claimed that three members of Congress — Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, all of New Jersey — attempted to “storm” the facility, and accused them of “slamming their bodies into our law-enforcement officers, shoving them, screaming profanities in their faces, striking them with their fists and otherwise assaulting law enforcement.” Trump's ICE Used a Woman's Kids and Grandchild as ‘Bait' to Arrest Her Trump Is Trying to Take Control of Congress Through Its Library Trump Admin Accuses Dem of ‘Assaulting an ICE Agent' at Newark Detention Center ‘There Is No Evidence': Judge Orders Release of Tufts Student Detained Over Op-Ed On Tuesday night, Noem accused the lawmakers of “committing felonies” during a Fox News interview and called for Republicans in Congress to remove the representatives from their committee assignments. A video filmed at the gates of the facility shows a chaotic scene as ICE agents pushed and jostled lawmakers and protesters as they moved to arrest Baraka. “I understand it's hard to keep them all straight because you've deported multiple U.S.-citizen children.” You need to change course immediately before more innocent people are hurt on your watch.” Control, ‘Freak-Offs,' Abuse: 7 Takeaways from Cassie's Testimony at Sean Combs Trial Trump's ICE Used a Woman's Kids and Grandchild as ‘Bait' to Arrest Her Noem has staged several photo ops in which she dons tactical gear and poses with ICE officers as they move to deport people. Magaziner wasn't the only Democrat to call out Noem's dress-up act. Swalwell also dunked on her publicity push around the administration's deportation efforts. “I have put people away for life sentences who are gang members.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: BAFTA-winner Aimee Lou Wood (Sex Education), coming off a lauded turn in HBO's The White Lotus S3, is set to star opposite Oscar winner Angelina Jolie in the Marc Forster feature adaptation of Anxious People, the Black Bear and Hope Studios project we told you about coming into the Cannes market. The synopsis reads: “The day before Christmas Eve, investment banker Zara (Jolie) begrudgingly finds herself mingling with a group of strangers at an open house. When a reluctant bank robber, Grace (Wood), inadvertently takes the group hostage, chaos and oversharing ensues, secrets are revealed and literally nothing goes according to plan. A film about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.” Cannes 2025 Is Only A Day Old But Already Has Its First Raved About Movie...Let The Bidding Wars Begin For Mascha Schilinski's 'Sound Of Falling' Japan's Imagica Group Selects 'Maria' As First Project For Financing Scheme Supported By Hirokazu Kore-eda Based on A Man Called Ove, author Fredrik Backman's novel, the film is being sold for international at Cannes by Black Bear and WME Independent for domestic. The story has been adapted for the screen by Oscar-nominated screenwriter David Magee, known for movies including A Man Called Otto, Life of Pi, and Finding Neverland. Hope Studios' Fredrik Wikström Nicastro (A Man Called Otto) and Renée Wolfe (A Man Called Otto) of 2DUX2 will produce, with A Man Called Otto and World War Z director Forster, Magee and Neda Backman executive-producing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the man Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress put in charge of the nation's health systems, doesn't think he's qualified to dispense medical advice. The United States is currently facing its most significant measles outbreak in decades, one that Kennedy has tried to downplay while simultaneously touting the vaccine and several dubious alternative medicine remedies. Kennedy hesitated before saying “probably,” then adding that his opinion is “irrelevant” and stressing that he doesn't want it to seem like he is advising people on how to protect their children against measles — despite the vaccine's proven effectiveness, as well as the fact that he is literally the nation's chief health official. “I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me,” Kennedy said. “That's kind of your jurisdiction, because the CDC does give advice,” Pocan replied. “Again, I don't want to be giving advice,” he said. “The administration has fired or pushed out thousands of experts and experienced staff who help keep Americans safe from infectious diseases, including Measles, HIV, and tuberculosis.” DeLauro was ready to grill Kennedy during the hearing on Wednesday. “Are you planning to break the law by impounding congressional-appropriated funds?” she asked, noting how Kennedy is cutting $18 billion from the NIH and wants to cut more. Kennedy replied by saying that if Congress appropriates the money, he will spend it, to which DeLauro emphasized that the money has indeed been appropriated. “I'm not sure the administration has internalized that,” DeLauro said, noting Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought's contention that the president can impound congressionally appropriated money. Kennedy kept repeating that he will spend money if it's appropriated, though, and DeLauro ultimately said the committee would hold him to it. Kennedy was again grilled about cuts to the NIH during a Senate hearing later on Wednesday. “How many staff have been cut from the NIH's clinical center?” asked Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) after telling the story of one of her constituents who needs cancer treatment. Kennedy said he didn't know and he'd provide that information later, which Murray said was “not acceptable.” Murray then asked if Kennedy genuinely believes that cutting the NIH by half isn't going to lead to more stories about Americans who cannot receive the care they need. Control, ‘Freak-Offs,' Abuse: 7 Takeaways from Cassie's Testimony at Sean Combs Trial Trump's ICE Used a Woman's Kids and Grandchild as ‘Bait' to Arrest Her Kennedy may be confused about congressionally appropriated funding for the nation's health management and research and how cuts are hitting the NIH, but he's certainly correct in that it's probably not a good idea for Americans to take medical advice from him: He recently posted pictures of himself swimming with his grandchildren in a creek where the National Park Service barred swimming due to sewage runoff and fecal contamination.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter For two years, we were fed a steady stream of why Warner Bros. The short version: it was too limiting, Max is the streaming home to more than just prestige TV, etc, etc. Well, now HBO Max is back — albeit in an improved app — and the rebranding (debranding?) Discovery reported its March-quarter earnings, CNBC's David Faber had a report of his own: WBD is “moving towards…a split.” “It's become relatively clear to me from the many conversations that I've had that we could get some sort of an announcement in the not-too-distant future that they are planning to try to split the company,” Faber said. The only split that makes sense for Warner Bros. Discovery, which was just formed in April 2022 as the combination of WarnerMedia (under AT&T) and Discovery, Inc., would be to pair the WB studios with Max and spin the Discovery linear cable channels off into a new company. Faber's reporting concurs, but we can also just source our intuition and logic on this one. A WBD split-and-spin would not come without hurdles: like the fact that (HBO) Max also houses most of the same programming that populates Discovery+. We're not quite there yet, but it sure feels imminent. The absurdity of it all was met with laughter, light applause and exactly one whistle. Bloys did follow with a solid joke: “I know you're all shocked, but the good news is I have a drawer full of stationary from the last time around.” Though he oversees both the HBO and Max brands, a re-elevation of HBO is a further endorsement of Bloys. The press release got in on the joke with a meme of its own: Ross (David Schwimmer) from Friends, in bed between the Max and HBO logos, shouting, “We were on a break!” HBO Max first launched in 2020; it was a buggy user experience, so the Max platform was built from scratch for a 2023 launch. This summer that new platform stays but the name reverts. Zaslav literally ordered Jack Warner's desk out of storage; he now rules the iconic Warners lot from behind it. Zaslav is one split away from fully turning his former position atop a withering bundle of cable channels into the man exclusively in charge of HBO and Warner Bros., two giant brands in Hollywood history — and its present. The looming question: What to do with that $35 billion in remaining debt as created by the literal creation of Warner Bros. We don't have that answer, yet, but it'd sure be nice to bury billions with a Discovery SpinCo. Speaking of a SpinCo., Zaslav is watching the very blueprint unfold in front of him as NBCUniversal spins out its own cable channels into a company now called Versant. The former NBCUniversal president, Jeff Shell, is keeping a close eye on the happs as well: Shell will be president of Skydance Paramount (our guess at a name, but names are getting real dumb) when that merger goes through — it's expected to happen by this summer. And hey, maybe Versant will buy all of their leftovers. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

The latest installment in Collins' bestselling dystopian YA franchise was published on March 18. Our protagonist, 16-year-old Haymitch, is a clever and resourceful boy from District 12 who's unexpectedly chosen for this edition of the games, which will feature a deadly twist: twice the number of tributes, with 48 children sent into the arena to battle for their lives. Francis Lawrence has returned to direct from a script by Billy Ray. Slated for release on November 20, 2026, the new film comes on the heels of five Hunger Games entries that have grossed more than $3.3 billion worldwide. Best known for her role as Robin on Netflix's Stranger Things, which is expected to return this year for its final season, Hawke recently voiced Anxiety in the global hit Inside Out 2, also taking on roles in prestige projects including Bradley Cooper's Maestro, father Ethan Hawke's Flannery O'Connor biopic Wildcat, and Wes Anderson's Asteroid City.

Taylor Sheridan is coming back to the big screen and has written the script for “F.A.S.T.,” an original crime story that is set up at Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio announced during its Upfronts on Wednesday. Brandon Sklenar of Sheridan's “1923” will star in the film, and “1923” series director and cinematographer Ben Richardson will make his feature directorial debut on the film. Warner Bros. has even already set a release date for “F.A.S.T.,” April 23, 2027 in theaters. “F.A.S.T.” follows a former special forces commando who is tapped by the DEA to lead a black ops strike team against CIA-protected drug dealers. Sheridan has an overall deal with Paramount, but Warner Bros. commissioned the script prior to that deal beginning, and Paramount ultimately granted Sheridan's request to make the film, albeit within Paramount's exclusive window. As a result, Sheridan is currently in negotiations along with Jenny Wood of Bosque Ranch Productions to produce “F.A.S.T.” Related Stories Denzel Washington, Robert Pattinson, Daisy Edgar-Jones to Star in Fernando Meirelles Heist Thriller for Netflix Neon Sets First Look Deal with — Who Else?

Gunn, who is the co-CEO of DC Studios with Peter Safran, wrote the feature which is decidedly not an origin story about Clark Kent embracing his alienhood to save the world. There will be plenty of world saving, but he is already well known to his colleague and love interest Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and nemesis Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sheridan, who has been building a massive television empire for Paramount since the late 2010s, is back in the movie business thanks for a unique deal being finalized now. It may have taken the slow route of almost a decade, but Taylor Sheridan's action thriller F.A.S.T. In a deal involving high-level talks between Warner Bros. Streaming Ratings: 'The Pitt' Hits High Mark With Season Finale Dwayne Johnson, Joe Ballarini Get 'Ripped' for 20th Century Studios (Exclusive) David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford of Heyday Films will produce the project with Sheridan and Jenny Wood of Bosque Ranch Productions in negotiations to join them. “The breadth of Taylor Sheridan's body of work is simply astounding and unparalleled in sheer excellence and consistent quality and we could not be more honored to be making this film with him,” Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group's Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy said in a statement. And it also exposes the tricky nature of navigating inter-studio relations. concerns a former special forces commando, down on his luck after he returns Stateside, who is tapped by the DEA to lead a black op strike team against CIA-protected drug dealers in his town. Sheridan wrote the script in the mid-2010s, when he was an established feature scribe with movies such as Sicario and Hell or High Water Under his belt. Warners, then owned by Time Warner, picked it up in 2018, with Sheridan initially signaling he wanted to direct and Chris Pratt circling to star. Gavin O'Connor later came on board as director in 2019, but by then, the studio was owned by AT&T, which didn't see a financial upside of releasing a movie with the budget in the $60 million to $70 million range theatrically. It was also, however, thought as too expensive to make as a streaming movie for its then-launching streaming service HBO Max. This was against a backdrop of a pandemic that was savaging the moviegoing experience and a streaming war that had gripped studios with the hallucinatory idea that streaming was the only future coming. into turnaround (only to have Amazon briefly flirt with it). But studios and movie releasing aren't the only things that have changed. Sheridan's lot in Hollywood has changed plenty as well. He created modern western Yellowstone for the Paramount Network in 2018, and it quickly became the most watched series on cable — a title it hasn't relinquished. Soon, Yellowstone spinoffs such as 1883 and 1923 sprouted on Paramount+, becoming a major draw for the service. Sheridan grew to one of the biggest showrunners in Hollywood, scorching his brand on Paramount+ with shows Tulsa King, Lioness, and Landman, among others. The showrunner also has a strict exclusive deal with Paramount, which initially made moving forward on F.A.S.T. Sources say that dealmaking is still being finalized to give Sheridan a carve out from his Paramount pact to render screenwriting and producorial duties. That wrinkle is making the setting of a budget for F.A.S.T. It will likely be considerably less than the $65 million or so from over a decade ago, when it was initially judged to be too high for a theatrical release. Sheridan is repped by CAA, LBI Entertainment, and Meyer & Downs. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Future Ruins will take place November 8 at the Equestrian Center in Los Angeles. “It's about giving people who are, literally, the best in the world at taking audiences on an emotional ride via music the opportunity to tell new stories in an interesting live setting,” said Reznor in a statement. This is a stacked lineup of visionaries doing something you might not see again.” Future Ruins will take place across three stages at the Equestrian Center, and prides itself on encouraging its artists to “take big swings and reimagine their work for a live audience.” Rounding out the lineup are Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow, Danny Elfman, Hildur Guðnadóttir, Isobel Waller-Bridge, Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein, Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe, Tamar-Kali, Terence Blanchard, Volker Bertelmann, and a performance of Howard Shore's score for Crash by David Cronenberg. Reznor and Ross seem always to be in the studio working on film scores these days, and that also extends to racking up nominations at awards shows for their compositions, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The star hasn't released music since 2022's "Lift Me Up" for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Rihanna fans who are desperate for new music don't need to feel blue any longer — the superstar finally has a new song coming out soon, recorded for the Smurfs movie soundtrack. As revealed Wednesday (May 14) with the release of the film's new trailer, Ri will drop a track called “Friend of Mine” on Friday (May 16). Starring Ri as the voice of Smurfette opposite John Goodman, James Corden, Nick Offerman, Sandra Oh and more, the Smurfs movie is set to hit theaters July 18. In addition to the “Umbrella” singer's new song, its soundtrack will also feature Tyla as well as a song called “Higher Love” by DJ Khaled, Cardi B and DESI TRILL, which dropped in February. The new teaser opens with a shot of Rihanna — aptly wearing a blue jacket and blue beads in her hair — dancing in the studio as she records some of Smurfette's lines. While announcing the project back in 2023 at that year's CinemaCon alongside Paramount and Nickelodeon, the musician — who was pregnant with second son Riot Rose at the time — said, “I get to show up in my PJs in my third trimester … I hope this gives me cool points with my kids one day.” “Friend of Mine” will mark Ri's first release since 2022's “Lift Me Up” from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack. She hasn't dropped an album since 2016's Anti, which spent two weeks at No. On the red carpet, she showed off her baby bump, revealing that she's expecting her third child with the rapper. And though fans have been waiting for a new Rihanna album for nine years at this point, the musician says that her latest pregnancy isn't going to stop her from working on Anti‘s follow-up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With so many talented artists, it can be difficult for The Voice coaches to decide who to pick and eliminate. This is why John Legend, Adam Levine, Kelsea Ballerini, and Michael Bublé were so excited about the Super Save option. For Ballerini, this meant bringing back Derby singer Jaelen Johnston. He had been eliminated in favor of Iris Herrera and Alanna Lynise. While she stands by her decision, she understands why fans were disappointed that Johnston wasn't one of her first picks. “As much as I represent country, I want to represent good music and I want to represent artists that are storytellers, and I believe Alanna and Iris to be two of the best on the show that do that,” Ballerini told Parade, defending her decision to choose them initially. “My goal as a coach was never to only support country artists, it was just to support great artists.” But she also recognizes that Johnston is a great artist and country singer. “If Jaelen were to win, I would not be surprised at all,” Ballerini admitted. “Then everybody would be like, ‘Kelsea, we told you so.' After seeing the Super Saves perform, they realized they may have made a mistake with their initial choices. “Everybody was so good and everyone had done so well that there was just no version of this that was going to make everybody happy, including myself, I don't think, unless I could take everybody with me.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But it looks like she might have given too much during rehearsals for her upcoming gig hosting the 2025 American Music Awards. On Tuesday (May 13), the singer/actress posted a series of pictures on her Instagram Story chronicling a nasty workplace injury she suffered during walk-throughs for the show. The third slide featured a patched-up JLo standing next to Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Jason B. Diamond, with her nose looking no worse for the wear. “Thank you for stitching me up Dr. Diamond,” she wrote. “A week later and a whole lotta ice, I'm good as new.” At press time Lopez had not revealed how she she suffered the injury. In her second go-round hosting the event — she first hosted in 2015 — Lopez will also perform on this year's show; she is just the fourth music artist to solo-host the AMAs twice, following Lionel Richie (1984-85), Diana Ross (1986-87) and Pitbull (2013-14). Tickets are available now on Ticketmaster, with fan voting open via VoteAMAs.com and the @AMAs Instagram profile in all award categories.
