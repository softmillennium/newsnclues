                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is the Beast of Bray Road calling Illinois home now? This Northern Illinois resident's bizarre encounter is raising questions, and eyebrows. For those that don't know, a cryptid is an animal or being that people claim exists, but science has never proven is real. READ MORE: Illinois Mothman Sightings Featured on 'Unsolved Mysteries' Here's a video featuring some of Illinois's most famous cyptids... While Illinois may claim creepy cryptids like the Chicago Mothman and Big Muddy Monster, one of Wisconsin's most famous cryptids, (besides The Hodag), is the Beast of Bray Road...but is the Beast venturing into Illinois now? The Phantoms and Monsters: Pulse of the Paranormal website recently posted a comment they received about a run-in someone had with an "upright human-like canine monster towering 3-4 feet taller than my 54-inch (give or take 2-3 inches) tall horse fence" in northern Illinois. Here's the description of what they saw: I saw the animalistic glowing eyes when I flashed my headlamp in its direction, and a "human-like" figure, as It followed me to the north separated by an electric fence, my firearm drawn, aimed, and unlocked. Was this the Beast of Bray Road roaming south of the Wisconsin border, or was it something else?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Newsmagazine of Long Beach Island and Southern Ocean County In the opening act of its 50th year of operation, the Long Beach Island Historical Association hosted its fourth Psychic and Wellness Fair at the LBI Museum in Beach Haven on Saturday, May 10. Tarot is a popular tool for personal readings. “We thought that the museum, and the ambience, lends itself to being spiritual, so we thought, ‘Let's do something like that. Erin Stamm finds stillness and feels the transfer of energy. “I think people are intrigued by the unknown,” she said. Among the vendors was Emily Perchalluk, proprietor of StayFresh Creations, who hawked her framed and flower-pressed tarot cards, stones and digital art pieces. The colors denote chakras, aspects of life or personality traits. Blue, for instance, generally represents honesty and creative expression. Kasandra Chasmar, who runs Waretown's Charmed In Company with her daughter, Victoria, read for visitors in the warmly lit Victorian Parlor. A mainlander, Chasmar has been a reader for over 60 years and was first taught to read playing cards by her mother. “I think the veil has become very thin, and people are experiencing more,” Chasmar said. The water definitely has a lot to do with it. I think you feel it a lot stronger. Brittany Histing performs healing touch as Surfing Waves of Light. Kehr partook in a session with Toms River-based medium Leslie Lagani, who helped develop the first fair. “It's comforting if you have a parent or someone who has passed, who comes back – through her – and says, ‘I'm fine,'” Kehr said. It's not just the end when you pass away.” Betty Lou Cote, an attendee, echoed Kehr's sentiment. So, I like that, it gives me immense comfort.” South Jersey seems to hold a patent inclination toward supernatural and spiritual subjects. Stories of hauntings are plentiful on LBI, and over half a dozen psychics have stores across Southern Ocean County. Pinpointing a sole cause for the area's marked receptiveness to the supernatural is difficult, though it likely derives from regional folklore and culture. Stories of the Jersey Devil first took root in Leeds Point in the Pine Barrens, while LBI and the towns along local shores are suffused with the famously superstitious and tall-tale traditions of fishermen and sailors who composed so much of their early populations. So, the legend of the Jersey Devil, it kind of hits close to home, and it gets people interested in it,” said Erin Stamm, who recently began interning for the LBIHA. Ron Marr, former president of the LBIHA, offered another interpretation. We all grew up going to church or synagogue. Nonetheless, Marr recognizes the human need for an empathic presence in times of grief or strife and how helpful such a voice can be. You must be logged in to post a comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In fact, you don't have to persuade most Americans that supernatural phenomena are authentic. They're already convinced.”  He cites findings from 2023 Pew Research Center and Gallup studies: •    Nearly 50% report having sensed something from the spiritual realm. One aspect of the supernatural world that Lee found most intriguing is death-bed visions. In an NDE, a person is found clinically dead for a time, but comes back to life, reporting what he saw in an out-of-body experience. For this topic, Lee interviewed Dr. Steve Miller of Kennesaw State University, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on death-bed visions, based on eight hundred relevant sources. An example of one such death-bed vision is quoted by Miller about a woman named Doris in 1920's London. Dying after giving birth, Doris looked toward one corner of her room with a radiant smile and talked about the lovely brightness and wonderful beings she saw, as well as God Himself. “I've been a Christian since 1981,” Lee says, “and I've never heard a sermon on angels, though the Bible clearly teaches their existence.”  While studying what Scripture teaches about angels, he acknowledges that there are many false notions which have arisen from a variety of sources. “For instance, the idea that people become angels when they die seems to persist, despite having no biblical support. “The primary focus of Scripture is on God and our relationship with him. This means that a lot of details about angels aren't spelled out with specificity. Because they are a sidelight to the central plot of the Bible and unnecessary information for us to have at this point.” Talking with Professor Douglas Potter of Southern Evangelical Seminary, Lee asked Potter to describe what Scripture clearly tells us about these celestial beings. “First of all, angels are not eternal like God is. Angels are greater in both knowledge and power than humans. Angels rank lower than God, but higher than humans.”  Potter went on to affirm the idea of guardian angels, based on Matthew 18:10, where Jesus says, “For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven,” and in Acts 12:15, where Peter, having escaped prison, shows up at the gathering of disciples, who don't believe it's him, saying, “It must be his angel.” Lee shines a light on the countless Muslims who have experienced supernatural visions or dreams – many of them corroborated by outside events – which led them out of Islam to a saving faith in Christ. “In fact, more Muslims have become Christians in the last couple of decades than the previous fourteen hundred years since Muhammed, and it's estimated that a quarter to a third of them experienced a dream or vision of Jesus before their salvation experience. If those statistics are accurate, this phenomenon of Jesus supernaturally appearing to people is one of the most significant spiritual awakenings in the world today.” Lee interviewed Middle East missionary and expert, Tom Doyle, who told him much more about Jesus dreams to Muslims, along with a number of examples. One story revolves around Kamal, an underground church planter in Egypt. Strongly impressed to go the busy, Friday market in Cairo one day, Kamal didn't have time, but heeded what he believed was God's leading. The encounter led to a three-hour discussion about faith, and Noor left wanting to know more about Jesus and counting the cost of leaving Islam. Realizing there are many misunderstandings, a thirst for sensationalism, and just plain error regarding the supernatural realm, Lee consulted with expert Ron Rhodes, who debunks much of what is believed to be spiritual, but is in fact, demonic. Rhodes offers a number of ways to exercise discernment in the supernatural arena: •    Immerse ourselves daily in the Scripture to know truth versus error. •    Pray for discernment, asking God to keep you from false and misleading ideas. Lee adds, “The Bible warns about the dangers of pursuing answers about life from sources that aren't grounded in God's truth.”  He reminds us to assess spiritual experiences though a biblical lens to ensure they align with God's nature and Christian doctrines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is the Turing test still relevant in today's AI landscape? The advent of large language models has challenged its importance. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. That's the core question legendary mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing posed in October, 1950. Turing wanted to assess whether machines could imitate or exhibit human-level intelligent behavior, and so he came up with a test called the "imitation game." This later became known as the Turing test, which is commonly used to assess how well a machine can mimic human behavior. The challenge is that evidence of original thought could be denied with the argument that a machine was simply programmed to seem intelligent. From there, Turing proposed a test whereby a remote interrogator is tasked with asking questions to a computer and human subject, both unseen, for five minutes in order to determine which is sentient. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The Turing test was created as more of a philosophical thought experiment than a practical means of defining machine intelligence. Turing predicted that by the early 2000s, a programmed computer would be able to “play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.” That resoundingly beats Turing's prediction of 30%, despite being two decades on from the mathematician's predicted date. Nevertheless, this research still shows how such AIs can at least imitate humans with some success. Turing himself detailed and addressed nine objections to his test and theory in proving machines could think; these range from the theological concept of thought and the idea that machines can't feel emotions, or have a sense of humor, to logical mathematical limitation that will simply prevent a machine from answering a question or getting it correct. But perhaps the most relevant objection comes from mathematician Ada Lovelace, who when commenting on computing pioneer Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, suggested that a machine cannot "originate anything" and can only do whatever we order it to perform. Turing's retort in his paper was to ask whether humans can indeed ever do anything really new in a deterministic world bound by the laws of nature and the boundaries of the universe. Turing also noted that computers may be constrained but could still potentially do unexpected things — in the same way that humans can despite being constrained by our genetic makeup and biology. Beyond this is the fact that the Turing test does not, per se, indicate consciousness or intelligence; rather it works to critique what is understood as thought and what could constitute thinking machines. Then there's the argument that the Turing test is designed around how a subject acts, meaning a machine can merely simulate human consciousness or thought rather than actively having its own equivalent. This can lead to the Turing trap — in which AI systems are excessively focused on imitating humans rather than being designed to have functions that allow humans to do more or boost their cognition beyond the possibilities of the human mind. While the Turing test might be held as a benchmark for AI systems to surpass, Eleanor Watson, an expert in AI ethics and member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),told Live Science that "The Turing Test is becoming increasingly obsolete as a meaningful benchmark for artificial intelligence (AI) capability." Watson explained that LLMs are evolving from simply mimicking humans to being agentic systems that are able to autonomously pursue goals via programming "scaffolding" — similar to how human brains build new functions as information flows through layers of neurons. However, the real challenge isn't whether AI can fool humans in conversation, but whether it can develop genuine common sense, reasoning and goal alignment that matches human values and intentions," Watson said. "Without this deeper alignment, passing the Turing Test becomes merely a sophisticated form of mimicry rather than true intelligence." —Meet 'Chameleon' — an AI model that can protect you from facial recognition thanks to a sophisticated digital mask —'Put glue on your pizza' embodies everything wrong with AI search — is SearchGPT ready to change that? As such, scientists "need to develop new frameworks for evaluating AI that goes beyond simple human imitation in order to assess capabilities, limitations, potential risks, and most importantly, alignment with human values and goals," Watson said. Unlike the Turing test, these frameworks will need to account for the strengths of AI systems and their fundamental differences from human intelligence, with the goal of ensuring AIs "enhance, rather than diminish, human agency and wellbeing," Watson added. "The true measure of AI will not be how well it can act human,” Watson concludes, “but how well it can complement and augment humanity, lifting us to greater heights."
