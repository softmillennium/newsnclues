Hannah Dugan

A Wisconsin state judge indicted for allegedly obstructing the arrest of a Mexican immigrant by federal authorities said the charges should be dismissed because she's immune from prosecution for her official acts.

The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan, who was arrested last month for events that allegedly occurred in and around her courtroom, “is virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional,” her lawyers argued Wednesday in a court filing seeking dismissal of the charges.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled a budget proposal that aims to close a $12 billion deficit, marking the third consecutive fiscal year in which state lawmakers need to plug significant shortfalls. 

Newsom, a second-term Democrat, said that a projected $363 million discretionary surplus for the upcoming fiscal year has morphed into a deficit in the months since his office unveiled his January budget proposal as new federal trade policies under President Donald Trump have dampened California's revenue projections and its economic outlook. </p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's plans to receive a luxury jet from Qatar, saying he doesn't think the gift raises ethics concerns. 

Trump's first major second-term foreign trip touring the Middle East this week has provoked criticism over a spate of business deals his family has made across the region and revelations the president is considering accepting a 747 jet from the government of Qatar. He said will use the jet temporarily as Air Force One, indicating he intends to accept the gift.</p>

Apple Inc. is developing a feature for its Vision Pro headset that lets users scroll through software with their eyes, aiming to enhance the device with a novel interface.

The eye-scrolling capability is being tested as part of visionOS 3, an upcoming version of the Vision Pro's operating system, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Already, the headset lets users navigate the software by looking at objects and then selecting them by pinching their fingers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of stock brokerage platform eToro popped in their Nasdaq debut on Wednesday after the company raised almost $310 million in its initial public offering. The stock opened at $69.69, or 34% above its IPO, pushing its market cap to $5.6 billion. Shares were last up more than 40%. The Israel-based company sold nearly six million shares at $52 each, above the expected range of $46 to $50. Almost six million additional shares were sold by existing investors. Wall Street is looking to the Robinhood competitor for signs of renewed interest in IPOs after an extended drought. Many investors saw President Donald Trump's return to the White House as a catalyst before tariff concerns led companies to delay their plans. Fintech company Chime filed its prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, while digital physical therapy company Hinge Health kickstarted its IPO roadshow, and said in a filing it aims to raise up to $437 million in its offering. EToro had previously filed to go public in 2021 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that would have valued it at more than $10 billion. It shelved those plans in 2022 as equity markets nosedived, but remained focused on an eventual IPO. The company makes money through trading-related fees and nontrading activities such as withdrawals. The company has steadily built a growing business in cryptocurrencies. Revenue from crypto assets more than tripled to upward of $12 million in 2024, and one-quarter of its net trading contribution stemmed from crypto last year. EToro said that for the first quarter, it expects crypto assets to account for 37% of its commission from trading activities, down from 43% a year earlier. Spark Capital is the company's biggest outside investor, with 14% control after the offering, followed by BRM Group at 8.7%. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft, the White House said Wednesday. The deal for the 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines is Boeing's "largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order," according to the White House. Boeing did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Boeing has yet to deliver any 777X planes. The 426-seat jetliner is years behind schedule and has still not been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha earlier Wednesday for a signing ceremony on the aircraft deal. The deal could be a boon for Boeing, which has not posted a profit since 2018. The plane maker has been beset by major safety concerns, manufacturing defects, cost overruns and a nearly two-month-long machinist strike last year. Its business dealings have also been disrupted by Trump's trade war. China stopped accepting deliveries of Boeing planes to its airlines in response to U.S. tariffs, Ortberg said last month. But the company has recently narrowed its losses as it addresses a backlog worth more than $500 billion, Ortberg said in Boeing's first-quarter earnings call. "This is great news for South Carolina and Boeing," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., calling the deal "a gamechanger." Graham's office said the new planes will be assembled at Boeing's Charleston facility. The deal announced Wednesday would nearly double Qatar Airways' fleet of 233 aircraft, according to its website. It could also draw more scrutiny toward Trump's acceptance, and defense, of Qatar's offer to gift the U.S. a luxury 747 jet that will act as the new Air Force One. — CNBC's Michele Luhn contributed to this report.

Morten Christensen says he and four crypto-loving friends will be attending the dinner next week being held for the top holders of President Donald Trump's memecoin for just about $1,200 each. 

The five were among the 220 people with the highest time-weighted holdings of the memecoin in the last three weeks on a special leaderboard used to keep track of the biggest buyers of the cryptocurrency. While it took at least $54,500 or so in time-weighted holdings during that period to secure a spot at the event on May 22, the actual amount Christensen and his friends spent basically boils down to trading fees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, it will be HBO Max once more. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform again starting this summer, restoring a name it ditched just two years ago. The change comes as Warner Bros. Discovery seeks to scale back its volume of content and focus on quality programming and storytelling. "The powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming," said David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. "Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead." The company's streaming business has turned around its profitability by almost $3 billion over the past two years and scaled globally with around 22 million subscribers added in the past year. Discovery aims to have more than 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026. Discovery lost live rights to National Basketball Association games beginning next season. The company has focused on paying down debt rather than spending on new content to compete with Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers. Ironically, the HBO Max branding was first introduced in 2019 to showcase HBO's competitive global streaming ambitions. Discovery is bringing back the same name, but emphasizing the opposite — quality over quantity. "We will continue to focus on what makes us unique — not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families," said JB Perrette, president and CEO of streaming at Warner Bros. Competitor Disney has taken a similar tack, with CEO Bob Iger noting in recent investor calls that the way to win in streaming will be quality content. The legacy media companies have all struggled to achieve profitability in their streaming businesses since launching their own services in recent years. That has led to an increased emphasis on advertising tiers, crackdowns on password sharing and more streaming service bundles. The Upfronts week in New York has already been heavy on naming news. Last week, Comcast's cable portfolio spinoff announced its new holding company name, Versant. Discovery first launched its stand-alone streaming service HBO Max in 2020 when the brand was still owned by AT&T. The "Max" moniker was added to signify that the platform would have a wide array of content, from reality TV, documentaries, kids programming and movies, as well as the prestige branding of HBO titles. At the time, leadership believed HBO had too small of an audience, much of which was U.S.-based, and that there was more value in making HBO a sub-brand within a larger streaming offering. The service was later renamed Max in 2023. That change came after the merging of Discovery Communications and WarnerMedia, which was divested from AT&T in 2022. Content from Discovery+ was added to HBO Max under the new name. Now, two years later, Warner Bros. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC. Versant will be the new parent company of CNBC under the proposed cable portfolio spinoff. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Volkswagen and Rivian are teaming up to build more affordable electric vehicles, but that doesn't mean they're planning to skimp on high-tech features. The Tesla rival is partnering with Volkswagen to provide technology for a new $22,500 electric car, and Wassym Bensaid, Rivian's chief software officer, said the coming EV wouldn't compromise on tech despite its low price point. The 13-foot-long four-seater is set to go on sale in Europe by 2027 for about 20,000 euros, roughly $22,500. "It's something which is extremely close to my heart because it's a way to bring that technology into many more cars," Bensaid told Business Insider. Bensaid said the lower-cost hatchback would leverage Rivian's software architecture to cut costs. Rather than individual computers controlling components like seats, lights, and doors, all of ID Every1's features are set to be handled by a central computer built on Rivian's technology, which Bensaid said would save VW money because it uses fewer parts and simplifies the design. A lack of affordable EVs remains one of the main reasons customers are reluctant to go electric, and VW is betting that its cheapest-ever battery-powered offering will help fill that gap. The startup Slate Auto caused a stir last month when it unveiled a $25,000 pickup truck, which is set to go on sale in the US in 2026. The base model lacks power windows, a radio, and any kind of built-in infotainment system, with Slate's CEO telling BI that the company had focused on simplicity to keep the price as low as possible. So far, consumers haven't seemed that bothered by the lack of bells and whistles, with the Jeff Bezos-backed startup receiving 100,000 refundable $50 reservations in just two weeks. When asked about Slate's approach, Bensaid said Rivian welcomes more competition in the EV market but had made a "different choice" in how it approaches making electric cars more affordable. "Inexpensive cars shouldn't be cars with limited features," he said, adding that Rivian believed it was possible to deliver a "rich user experience" at a low price point by making vehicle technology more efficient. "We would like to enable choice for customers but without such severe compromise in terms of the overall experience."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kraft Heinz is spending $3 billion to upgrade its U.S. factories, its largest investment in its plants in a decade, even as executives say consumer sentiment is at its second-lowest point in 70 years, and it has cut sales and profit forecasts. The upgrades will help lower costs by making the plants more efficient, which in turn may help offset President Donald Trump's tariffs, which factored into the company's decision to make the investment, said Pedro Navio, Kraft Heinz's president of North America, in an interview with Reuters. The investment also allows the packaged food maker to come up with and sell new products faster, he said. Kraft Heinz manufactures its market-leading Heinz ketchup, Kraft macaroni and cheese and Philadelphia cream cheese, among other products, at 30 plants across the United States. Kraft Heinz told Wall Street analysts last month that tariffs were adding to its costs and that consumers were buying less due to economic uncertainty. But the company is moving forward and making the new investment now to defend its market share, Navio said. "It goes beyond just efficiencies or dealing with the current tariff challenges," he said, saying the investment allows Kraft Heinz to produce food for the long term. The company is currently facing tariffs on imports such as coffee, after the United States last month implemented a 10% levy on all imported goods. Its imports from China, which faces higher tariffs, are negligible, a spokesperson said. Kraft Heinz, which also roasts and sells Maxwell House coffee, asked suppliers for a 60-day notice before putting through price hikes. Nearly all of what Kraft Heinz sells in the United States is made domestically, Navio said, adding that the company grows its own tomatoes in California and potatoes in Idaho, for example. It exports some of what it manufactures in the United States to Canada, Navio said. Facial tissue manufacturer Kimberly-Clark and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev have made similar announcements in recent weeks. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A landmark resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to lay the ground for further so-called "minerals for muscle" agreements. Washington and Kyiv signed a highly anticipated minerals deal earlier this month. The agreement, which has since been ratified by Ukrainian lawmakers, is designed to deepen economic ties, bolster Ukraine's reconstruction and position the country as a supplier of strategically important minerals to the U.S. Long coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the partnership followed months of tense negotiations and came more than three years since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. So, 'give me your minerals and I'll give you security,' or other forms of trade agreement," Dhawan told CNBC by video call. Natural resources could also play a pivotal role in the thawing of "pretty frosty" diplomatic ties between the U.S. and South Africa, Dhawan said, as well as the U.S. and Canada. We've seen the first act, probably, with Ukraine, and I think there are a few more twists and turns to come in the way that this now starts to take shape," he added. These minerals, which tend to have a high risk of supply chain disruption, include metals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements. U.S. officials have previously warned that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to low-carbon energy sources. Assuming they are commercially recoverable, Crebo-Rediker said Ukraine's vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements could "provide a future potential secure supply chain of many materials the United States needs." Timothy Puko, director of commodities at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said he was "a little bit skeptical" about the prospect of a wave of bilateral "minerals for muscle" agreements. I think that's what you're seeing in Ukraine. I think that Kinshasa is very clearly trying to pursue that right now, with their cobalt-copper situation and the [Rwandan-backed] M23 rebels," Puko told CNBC by video call. Aside from Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, however, Puko said he was "hard-pressed" to foresee any further agreements. Canada, Australia, Indonesia and several mineral-rich Latin America countries would all be unlikely to pursue minerals for muscle-type deals with the U.S., he added. "Outside of Ukraine and DRC, and possibly not even DRC, no other country right now really wants to trade away all that midstream business. I'm sure it's coming up right now in the ongoing bilateral trade talks but there are huge barriers to replicating what Ukraine is trying to do with a lot of other countries." Trump's trade tariff policy and repeated calls to make Canada the 51st state has strained diplomatic ties between the neighboring countries and fueled a swell of national pride and anger at the U.S. Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told Trump at the White House earlier this month that his country is "not for sale" — and "won't be for sale ever." Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a public policy think tank based in Ottawa, said Canada does not need a minerals for muscle agreement with the U.S. "What we need is more certainty in our trade relationship. That is the biggest hurdle right now to reshoring mineral production and processing to North America in order to combat Chinese manipulation of global mineral markets," Exner-Pirot told CNBC via email. Canada and the U.S. have developed interdependently over the course of 150 years and through world wars, Exner-Pirot said, noting that the countries are each another's largest suppliers and destinations of mineral exports. What's more, Exner-Pirot said Canada and the U.S. already collaborate in both NATO and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). A binational organization between Canada and the U.S., NORAD is primarily responsible for aerospace control and maritime warning in the defense of North America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Ukrainian drone maker released footage on Tuesday showing what's believed to be the first time a grenade launcher was fired in combat from a first-person-view uncrewed aerial system. With a 15- to 17-inch frame, the quadcopter is among the largest FPV drones commercially produced for combat in Ukraine, and it's typically used as a bomber. Wild Hornets did not say when the footage was shot, nor did it specify which grenade launcher was used. The platform is meant to be reusable. The Bulspike AP fires a 2-kilogram fragmentation grenade at an effective range of about 100 meters, or 328 feet. A drone mounted with such a weapon could thus give Ukrainian operators far more options to strike, since FPV combat drones are typically either used to fly directly into a target as a munition or to drop explosives from above. "From now on, an ordinary rocket launcher can work at a distance of 5+ km. This opens up new opportunities for the military," Wild Hornets wrote at the time of testing in September. 💥 Successful test of the world's first rocket launcher droneThe Bulava drone unit of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Bohdan Khmelnytsky installed a rocket launcher on the Queen Hornet FPV drone and conducted a successful test.From now on, an ordinary rocket… pic.twitter.com/AAkaHgcS7z Still, it's unclear whether Ukraine can or will produce and deploy these drone-mounted launchers at scale. Dozens of Ukrainian companies have developed and tested a massive variety of drone weapons, such as mounted shotguns and Kalashnikov rifles, but troops are still widely relying on loitering munitions and bombers as their bread and butter. Wild Hornets, in particular, has been recognized for producing some of the war's most exotic drone weapons, including FPV drones that spew thermite from above or interceptors designed to fly faster than 100 mph.</p>
