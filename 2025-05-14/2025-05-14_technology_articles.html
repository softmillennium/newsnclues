                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) has been reintroduced into Congress. As it currently stands, KOSA would be able to hold social media platforms legally accountable if it's proven that these companies aren't doing enough to protect minors from harm. The bill includes a long list of possible harms, such as eating disorders, sexual exploitation, substance abuse, and suicide. “And the people who will be determining what speech is harmful? However, KOSA has garnered support from companies like Microsoft, Snap, and X; X CEO Linda Yaccarino even worked with Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) on the most recent draft of the bill. “Apple is pleased to offer our support for the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA). Everyone has a part to play in keeping kids safe online, and we believe [this] legislation will have a meaningful impact on children's online safety,” Timothy Powderly, Apple's Senior Director of Government Affairs, said in a statement. Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture. She has also written for publications like Polygon, MTV, the Kenyon Review, NPR, and Business Insider. She is the co-host of Wow If True, a podcast about internet culture, with science fiction author Isabel J. Kim. Prior to joining TechCrunch, she worked as a grassroots organizer, museum educator, and film festival coordinator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, RFK Jr. appeared before both the House and Senate in two separate committee hearings. This morning, Kennedy spoke in front of the House Appropriations Committee. Though he reiterated that he would follow the law and spend the money appropriated to HHS, Kennedy also attempted to justify Trump's cuts at times; other times, he promised that he has and would safeguard the most essential programs, such as Head Start and those related to tribal health, from current or future cuts. True to his reputation, Kennedy also delivered some whoppers. When asked about how he would further protect the health of Native Americans, RFK Jr. singled out ultra-processed food as a major factor behind their poorer health outcomes in particular. “Ultra-processed food is a genocide on the American Indian,” he stated. In response to Representative Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.)'s question about how he would further the pro-life agenda, RFK Jr. said “every abortion is a tragedy.” Kennedy went on to boast that HHS has cut federal funding to programs overseas that fund, provide, or counsel people about abortions—a reinstatement of the so-called global gag rule. According to a report released yesterday by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Minority Staff, the Trump administration has terminated at least $13.5 billion in health funding since taking over, including 1,660 grants awarded by HHS. Kennedy has also overseen the planned elimination of 20,000 jobs and over a dozen agencies within HHS, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). He and other officials have attempted to justify these cuts as part of a restructuring, with the responsibilities of SAMHSA and other shuttered agencies expected to be collapsed within a new organization called Administration for a Healthy America (AHA). This restructuring is currently on pause following a temporary restraining order placed by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston last week as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed against HHS by several union and public health organizations. When asked by Rep. Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) how the elimination of agencies and programs related to minority health would improve the existing disparities among Americans, RFK Jr. argued that “Trump's vision for this country is the same as Martin Luther King Jr.'s.” Kennedy also refused to answer whether he would vaccinate his children against polio and chickenpox, arguing that his personal opinion was irrelevant and that he didn't want to be seen as giving medical advice (he did state that he would probably vaccinate them against measles). Kennedy has infamously long misrepresented the safety of vaccines, particularly the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, for decades, and he has continued to state falsehoods about vaccines during his tenure at HHS. Millions of Measles Cases Could Hit U.S. Over Next 25 Years If Vaccination Rates Drop “We are doing a better job at CDC today than any nation in the world controlling this measles outbreak,” Kennedy said at one point.

A new trial suggests a combination vaccine may offer equal or better protection against both flu and covid-19 compared to current vaccines. Roughly 200 more employees at the National Institutes of Health will be laid off, reportedly to balance out recent rehires. Even if measles vaccination rates stay the same, there could still be over 850,000 cases according to new research. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While a number of AI-powered apps can generate audio, like Suno and Udio, most rely on cloud processing, meaning that they can't be used offline. Stability also claims that Stable Audio Open Small's training set is made up entirely of songs from the royalty-free audio libraries Free Music Archive and Freesound. Stable Audio Open Small is 341 million parameters in size and optimized to run on Arm CPUs. (Parameters, sometimes referred to as “weights,” are the internal components of a model that guide its behavior.) Stable Audio Open Small only supports prompts written in English, and Stability notes in its documentation that the model can't generate realistic vocals or high-quality songs. The model also doesn't perform equally well across musical styles, Stability warns — a consequence of its Western-biased training data. In another potential wrinkle for devs, Stable Audio Open Small has somewhat restrictive usage terms. It's free to use for researchers, hobbyists, and businesses with less than $1 million in annual revenue, but developers and organizations making over $1 million in revenue have to pay for Stability's enterprise license. In the last few months, Stability has hired a new CEO, appointed filmmaker James Cameron to its board of directors, and released several new image-generation models.

Delock has introduced a new front-panel USB hub designed to enhance your case's connectivity by providing 10 additional USB Type-A ports for connecting peripherals and other devices. Though we've progressed significantly from the bulky old PC cases, the number of USB ports on today's best PC cases hasn't changed much. Unless you opt for a specialized case, you're likely to find only two to four USB Type-A ports these days. The shift towards USB Type-C ports further complicates things. Over recent years, the availability of USB Type-A ports has declined, with some modern cases featuring just one. This is why front-panel hubs will remain relevant since some users will always require more traditional USB Type-A ports to be available at the front of their cases. Sometimes you may want to connect a card reader or something that doesn't require a lot of bandwidth, so it doesn't make sense to use up one of the faster USB interfaces on your motherboard. Delock's front panel fits into a standard 3.5-inch bay inside your case. The panel utilizes the VLI VL813 hub controller, so we're looking at USB 3.0 specifications with maximum transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps. Logically, they're backward compatible with older USB specifications. You receive the 3.5-inch hub, four Philips head screws to install it inside your case's 3.5-inch bay, and a user manual in case you have any questions about the product. It appears on Amazon U.K. but does not have pricing or stock information. In Germany, it can be purchased from a Delock retailer for €84.59 (~$94.76), suggesting a price of approximately $79.63 before the 19% VAT (value-added tax) is added. Delock's hub is certainly expensive, especially since USB 3.0 front panel hubs begin around $13, with top-tier models nearing $30.

This model is part of Shark's Rocket lineup and is built to move, so you can get around your house and finish up vacuuming fast. It's a 2-in-1 design, meaning you can use it as a full-length stick vacuum or convert it into a handheld unit when you need to clean upholstery, stairs, or even your car. Weighing just 7.5 pounds, it's light enough to carry up and down the stairs and can get around furniture super easily. The high-speed brushless motor gives it enough suction to pick up everything from pet hair to fine dust across both carpets and hard floors. It has a pretty big dust cup too, so you won't need to stop and empty it as often, and the CleanTouch system makes dumping debris super easy and hands-free. It also comes with a crevice tool and pet multi-tool, which are great for tight spaces and picking up stubborn hair from couches or bedding. You'll get up to 40 minutes of runtime on a full charge, which is usually plenty to get through a full clean if you work fast enough. And because it's cordless, you're not constantly switching outlets or getting tangled up in cords. That all makes for a much more efficient clean, so you'll be getting things done fast. If you want a vacuum that actually feels substantial enough to use on a regular basis, this Shark pet-centric cordless should be your next buy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AlphaEvolve finds new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more. This time the firm has shown that its approach can not only tackle unsolved theoretical puzzles, but improve a range of important real-world processes as well. Google DeepMind's new tool, called AlphaEvolve, uses the Gemini 2.0 family of large language models (LLMs) to produce code for a wide range of different tasks. LLMs are known to be hit and miss at coding. “You can see it as a sort of super coding agent,” says Pushmeet Kohli, a vice president at Google DeepMind who leads its AI for Science teams. “It doesn't just propose a piece of code or an edit, it actually produces a result that maybe nobody was aware of.” Google DeepMind claims the company has been using this new software across all of its data centers for more than a year, freeing up 0.7% of Google's total computing resources. That might not sound like much, but at Google's scale it's huge. “It makes the approach applicable to such a wide range of problems,” he says. “AI is becoming a tool that will be essential in mathematics and computer science.” AlphaEvolve continues a line of work that Google DeepMind has been pursuing for years. Its vision is that AI can help to advance human knowledge across math and science. In 2023, it revealed AlphaDev, which discovered faster ways to perform a number of basic calculations performed by computers trillions of times a day. FunSearch, which arrived in late 2023, swapped out game-playing AI and replaced it with LLMs that can generate code. The tool was used to crack a famous unsolved problem in pure mathematics. This makes it applicable to a much wider variety of problems. Here's how it works: AlphaEvolve can be prompted like any LLM. Give it a description of the problem and any extra hints you want, such as previous solutions, and AlphaEvolve will get Gemini 2.0 Flash (the smallest, fastest version of Google DeepMind's flagship LLM) to generate multiple blocks of code to solve the problem. It then takes these candidate solutions, runs them to see how accurate or efficient they are, and scores them according to a range of relevant metrics. When it gets stuck, AlphaEvolve can also call on Gemini 2.0 Pro, the most powerful of Google DeepMind's LLMs. These rounds of generation, scoring, and regeneration continue until Gemini fails to come up with anything better than what it already has. The team tested AlphaEvolve on a range of different problems. Matrix multiplication is a basic computation that underpins many applications, from AI to computer graphics, yet nobody knows the fastest way to do it. The tool not only produced new algorithms that could calculate 14 different sizes of matrix faster than any existing approach, it also improved on AlphaTensor's record-beating result for multipying two four-by-four matrices. AlphaEvolve scored 16,000 candidates suggested by Gemini to find the winning solution, but that's still more efficient than AlphaTensor, says Balog. AlphaTensor's solution also only worked when a matrix was filled with 0s and 1s. “The result on matrix multiplication is very impressive,” says Moosbauer. “This new algorithm has the potential to speed up computations in practice.” Manuel Kauers, a mathematician at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, agrees: “The improvement for matrices is likely to have practical relevance.” By coincidence, Kauers and a colleague have just used a different computational technique to find some of the speedups AlphaEvolve came up with. The pair posted a paper online reporting their results last week. “It is great to see that we are moving forward with the understanding of matrix multiplication,” says Kauers. “Every technique that helps is a welcome contribution to this effort.” In total, Google DeepMind tested AlphaEvolve on more than 50 different types of well-known math puzzles, including problems in Fourier analysis (the math behind data compression, essential to applications such as video streaming), the minimum overlap problem (an open problem in number theory proposed by mathematician Paul Erdős in 1955), and kissing numbers (a problem introduced by Isaac Newton that has applications in materials science, chemistry, and cryptography). Google DeepMind then applied AlphaEvolve to a handful of real-world problems. As well as coming up with a more efficient algorithm for managing computational resources across data centers, the tool found a way to reduce the power consumption of Google's specialized tensor processing unit chips. Google DeepMind plans to continue exploring potential applications of its tool. Moosbauer also points out that while AlphaEvolve may produce impressive new results across a wide range of problems, it gives little theoretical insight into how it arrived at those solutions. That's a drawback when it comes to advancing human understanding. Even so, tools like AlphaEvolve are set to change the way researchers work. “I don't think we are finished,” says Kohli. What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A key question in artificial intelligence is how often models go beyond just regurgitating and remixing what they have learned and produce truly novel ideas or insights. A new project from Google DeepMind shows that with a few clever tweaks these models can at least surpass human expertise designing certain types of algorithms—including ones that are useful for advancing AI itself. Matej Balog, one of the research leads on AlphaEvolve, says that it is often difficult to know if a large language model has come up with a truly novel piece of writing or code, but it is possible to show that no person has come up with a better solution to certain problems. Sanjeev Arora, a scientist at Princeton University specializing in algorithm design, says that the advancements made by AlphaEvolve are relatively small and only apply to algorithms that involve searching through a space of potential answers. But he adds, “Search is a pretty general idea applicable to many settings.” AI-powered coding is starting to change the way developers and companies write software. The latest AI models make it trivial for novices to build simple apps and websites, and some experienced developers are using AI to automate more of their work. AlphaEvolve demonstrates the potential for AI to come up with completely novel ideas through continual experimentation and evaluation. DeepMind and other AI companies hope that AI agents will gradually learn to exhibit more general ingenuity in many areas, perhaps eventually generating ingenious solutions to a business problem or novel insights when given a particular problem. Josh Alman, an assistant professor at Columbia University who works on algorithm design, says that AlphaEvolve does appear to be generating novel ideas rather than remixing stuff it's learned during training. “It has to be doing something new and not just regurgitating,” he says. Alman says this raises the prospect that human scientists could collaborate with a system like AlphaZero. AlphaEvolve is not the only DeepMind program to demonstrate real ingenuity. The company's famous board-game-playing program AlphaZero was able to devise original moves and strategies through its own form of experimentation. Two previous DeepMind projects also used AI to push the boundaries of computer science. AlphaTensor, from 2022, used the reinforcement learning method to produce novel algorithms. Fun Search, from 2024, used an evolutionary method to generate more efficient code for a given problem. Neil Thompson, a scientist at MIT who studies the way algorithms affect technological progress, says that a key question is not just whether AI algorithms can exhibit original ideas, but how generally this may apply to scientific research and innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The startup's seen a steep uptick in usage since it launched a year ago, mostly thanks to word of mouth among VCs and founders, but a big driver seems to be the fact that people are using it for doing more than its core pitch — automated notetaking for meetings. Granola's co-founder, Chris Pedregal, told TechCrunch that the company's users are increasingly using Granola for taking personal notes, which helps them make all their information, both from work and otherwise, available to the app's AI to parse and surface insights from. Pedregal said Granola's organic popularity among the tech crowd and diversifying use cases has helped its user base grow 10% every week since its launch, though he didn't specify how many users it currently has. Off the back of that rapid growth and popularity, Granola on Wednesday said it has raised $43 million in a Series B funding round led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross's venture firm, NFDG, at a valuation of $250 million. The round also saw participation from existing investors Lightspeed and Spark, as well as angel investors including Vercel's Guillermo Rauch, Replit's Amjad Masad, Shopify's Tobias Lütke, and Linear's Karri Saarinen. Alongside this funding, Granola is also extending its remit beyond its current single-user focus to make itself more useful for businesses: It's launching a new collaboration feature that lets users share transcripts and notes with teammates, and enable the app's AI take to advantage of a broader pool of notes and details to surface insights. Users in an organization can create custom folders for various collaborative use cases like sales calls, customer feedback, and hiring. The app will also let users share meeting notes with people who don't use Granola to let them chat with its AI and ask it questions. Building on that, the company will now allow users to ask questions about specific folders as well. Granola's new collaborative focus is part of a broader trend — many AI-powered meeting transcription and notetaking tools are expanding their focus and building integrations with other tools as they try to become a hub that stores and lets users search through knowledge from various sources. For instance, Notion just yesterday launched an AI meeting notetaking tool. Lightspeed's Mike Mignano believes that Granola has an edge in this space because of its interface and user experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zhao Weiguo stepped down as chairman in 2022 after being placed under investigation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The former billionaire chairman of Tsinghua Unigroup, Zhao Weiguo, has been handed a suspended death sentence after being found guilty of corruption and embezzlement. The punishment in such cases is normally commuted to life imprisonment if he doesn't commit any further crimes during the suspension period. Once thought to be worth nearly $2.8 billion, Zhao was accused of corruption and embezzlement by China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The Commission alleged that Zhao, "as a manager of a state-owned enterprise, was blinded by greed, acted recklessly, betrayed his duties and mission, misused public resources for personal gain, turned public property into private property, and regarded the state-owned enterprises he managed as private territory." He was also accused of deliberately seizing state-owned assets, illegally giving profitable business to relatives and friends, purchasing goods from said businesses at inflated prices, and more. According to the CCTV's report, the court said that Zhao's activities involved "extremely huge sums" and "caused especially severe losses to state interests." CCTV also claimed that Zhao admitted guilt, had shown remorse, and had tried to return misappropriated funds, which allegedly included state assets worth $65 million and company losses worth $124 million. Tsinghua Unigroup was supposed to be an integral part of China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry, and was known for making high-profile and aggressive acquisitions funded by the state and bonds. Zhao stepped down as chairman a year later, coinciding with reports of an investigation. In March last year, YMTC claimed to have made a flash memory breakthrough in creating QLC NAND that matches the endurance of TLC NAND.

The RTX 5090 laptop GPU arrived in late March 2025, but its launch was plagued by several issues, including delayed review units. A few reviews were available soon after the GPU became available, like Tom's Hardware's review of the Razer Blade 16, but it took some time for us to see an RTX 4090 vs. RTX 5090 comparison on nearly identical units. Jarrod's Tech has released a video evaluating two XMG Neo 16 laptops that were equipped with both GPUs, and the results are interesting, to say the least. Because of these specifications, one would expect the newer laptop to run faster, especially as it has a newer top-of-the-line laptop CPU, faster memory, and the RTX 5090. Unfortunately, Jarrod's Tech's test results tell a different story. Alan Wake 2, Ray Tracing Low + High Settings + Upscaling, No Frame Gen,  DX12 Black Myth: Wukong, Ray Tracing Very High + Cinematic Settings + Upscaling, DX12 Cyberpunk 2077 v2.21, Ray Tracing Ultra Settings + Upscaling, No Frame Gen, DX12 The Last of US Part II, Very High Settings, DX12 And if you prioritize FPS over quality, the older GPU was found to hit a higher average FPS by 0.04% at 1080p gaming. This meant that it used less power and allowed gamers to play on battery for much longer. Unless you consider yourself an on-battery laptop gamer, need 24 GB of VRAM, or love Nvidia's Frame Gen tech, you're much better off getting the slightly older RTX 4090 when it comes to FPS per dollar.

You get muffled dialogue, flat action scenes, and lackluster music. And for some people, setting up a full surround sound system can feel like too much. If you still want decent sound but don't want complicated setup times and an extremely expensive entry price, a soundbar should be at the top of your list. Right now, you can head to Amazon to grab the JBL Bar for just $200, which is $100 off its normal price of $300. Together, both serve up a punchy 300 watts of power, which is more than enough to fill a living room with crisp highs, clear dialogue, and deep, punchy bass. The sub makes a real difference and connects wirelessly to deliver targeted bass wherever you think you might need it most in the room. It supports Dolby Digital and features JBL's Surround Sound processing, which simulates a wider, more immersive audio experience without needing extra rear speakers. You won't get true surround sound, but for most users, the effect feels cinematic enough, and it's way more convenient than setting up a whole surround system when you don't have the time or money. Or maybe it's the patience you don't have. It uses HDMI ARC to connect to your TV, but it also has optical and Bluetooth options. You can use Bluetooth to get it set up, and swap between connections from there if you want to use something else to listen or watch with. This soundbar is super easy to set up right out of the box, and it won't cost you very much to invest in. If you want a better sound setup at home and don't want to spend too much money, this really is the way to go. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. When I tested the Light Phone III in March—a phone designed to strip away apps and focus on the basics—I quickly found how many little things I needed my smartphone for, from accessing my home's security cameras to authentication apps so I could sign in to web services on my laptop. Sometimes it's just not easy to go cold turkey. But that's where the Minimal Phone steps in. Unlike most anti-smartphone products that offer a curated suite of basic phone functions, the Minimal Phone lets you access any app through the Google Play Store like a normal Android phone. This frustrating smartphone experience is sort of the point. I got into bed one night, ready for my usual bedtime doomscrolling ritual. This is not to say that I magically woke up the next day with the best sleep of my life—using your phone before bed can affect sleep—but it did prove one thing: The Minimal Phone did its job of cutting my time spent on social media. It feels lightweight, and I have to say, a little cheap. It doesn't help that immediately after unboxing it, the phone's back was already grubby with smudges, almost like I had just eaten a bag of Cheetos (I wish). Maybe that's why the company sells Dbrand skins to cover it up. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. On the left edge is the SIM tray, which supports microSD cards for storage expansion if 128 GB isn't enough. That brings us to the 4.3-inch touchscreen, which is … not great. This is largely because when you scroll or move through web pages and menus, there's a lot of ghosting—a faint image of the previous text you were staring at. Even one or two scrolls and you'll want to hit that e-paper refresh button liberally to remove these artifacts—that quickly becomes an annoying step. It also doesn't help that the monochrome screen doesn't play well with lighter colors on select websites, though pages with mostly black and white text, like WIRED.com, look fine. Thankfully, I had no problems reading the matte screen in any lighting situation. From a performance standpoint, it seems to chug along fine with the MediaTek Helio G99 chipset inside. Granted, I do not recommend trying mobile games. The home screen shows a list of shortcuts to core apps, like Phone, Messages, Camera, Calendar, and Calculator. There's a Notes app, and it defaults to opening Google Keep. I've used the phone like any other I test, even using Google Maps to navigate and Google Wallet for tap-to-pay at physical retailers, though you'll have a subpar experience with some apps more than others. You won't want to do certain things on the Minimal Phone. Watching videos, playing games, and scrolling through social media do not mesh well with an e-paper screen and the slow refresh rate. YouTube videos and Instagram Reels alike feel like you're staring at a strobe light, with the screen flashing with every frame. Press and hold the e-paper refresh button, and you'll find an “ultra” refresh setting that makes this a little better, but the quality significantly diminishes, and everything looks like a blob. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. And truly, it does work in this regard. I was barely on social media during my time with the Minimal Phone, and didn't miss it. The one thing to remember is that since you can install apps like Slack and connect your work email, I found myself still “online” and responding to colleagues even away from my desk. There are some overall quirks with the software. Most Android apps nowadays ask if you want to allow notifications, but I barely got this prompt on the Minimal Phone, which might be by design. I also had trouble scanning QR codes in the camera app—it wouldn't register. So I took a picture and then used Google Lens to scan them, which worked as an alternative. All the photos look grainy, blurry, and overexposed or underexposed. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's also no 5G support, but I didn't find this a problem. After all, it's not like I was streaming much. That said, I expected battery life to be better. With average use, the 3,000-mAh cell got down to roughly 50 percent at the end of a day, and it lasted me nearly two full days before needing a top-up. At least there's wireless charging support, and you can even get a MagSafe case to connect it with MagSafe wireless chargers. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The company claims it'll support the software for five years, but Minimal is a new company, and this is its first product. If you don't want to outright ditch your smartphone and swap your personal SIM, Minimal has cell plans (with call and text) starting at $15 per month, if you don't mind having a second number. That makes it more of a full-fledged distraction-free smartphone alternative. (The cell plan is through Gigs, which uses T-Mobile's and AT&T's networks.) It comes down to what you want and knowing this phone's limitations. I didn't enjoy using the Minimal Phone, despite enjoying my time with the Light Phone III, which has fewer features. If your goal is to limit screen time without sacrificing access to specific apps, the Minimal Phone does the job, or you could buy a cheap smartphone and be selective of what you install. I think the company will hit its stride in version two. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maverick Silicon, Nexus Venture Partners, and Prosperity7 also participated in the round. Tariff-related price hikes on components like server racks and chips could contribute to overall data center build costs increasing by 5% to 15%, per an analysis by TD Cowen. Overcapacity is reportedly one of the factors delaying OpenAI's ambitious $500-billion Stargate data center project. Las Vegas, Nevada-based TensorWave claims that it hasn't seen a slowdown in business, however. But TensorWave embraced AMD early on, aiming to provide cloud services at lower prices. TensorWave recently deployed a “dedicated training” cluster of around 8,000 AMD Instinct MI325X GPUs. Other data center providers placing bets on AMD's AI chips range from startups like Lamini and Nscale to larger, more entrenched cloud providers such as Azure and Oracle. Tatarchuk had previously launched cloud vendor VMAccel with Horton and sold another startup, Lets Rolo, to digital identity firm Lifekey. As for Tomasik, he co-launched influencer marketer site Influential and is the second co-founder of Lets Rolo.
