                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Delhi [India], May 14 (ANI): Italy's Jannik Sinner, the number one-ranked tennis star, who had an off day in the ongoing Italian Open on Wednesday, went to the Vatican City and met Pope Leo XIV. Sinner, his parents Johann and Siglinde, his manager Alex Vittur and a delegation from the Italian Tennis Federation, including president Angelo Binaghi, were among those present during the meeting with Pope Leo XIV. During his audience, the 23-year-old presented Pope Leo XIV, who was elected just six days ago, with one of his racquets. In a video posted by Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Instagram, Pope Leo XIV asked Sinner about his Tuesday night victory against Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo, to which the Italian replied, "Yes, we managed." After Sinner presented his racket, Pope Leo XIV shared a laugh with Sinner. Last Thursday, the Vatican conclave chose a new Pope, Robert Prevost, the first American Pope, Vatican News said. Cardinal Protodeacon Dominique Mamberti, the senior cardinal deacon appeared on the St. Peter's balcony that overlooks the St Peter's square and announced, "Habemus Papam!" Meanwhile, Sinner will be keen on continuing his scorching form in the Italian Open when he squares off against Casper Ruud in the quarter-final clash on Thursday. Especially now trying to get used to so many difficult situations on the court. Game wise, I felt a little bit better. The crowd helped me, so I'm happy to go through," Sinner said after the win, as quoted from ATP. (The story has come from a syndicated feed and has not been edited by the Tribune Staff.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A day after becoming the first man born in the 2000s to reach the quarterfinals of every single Masters 1000 event, Carlos Alcaraz kept his run going in Rome, reaching the semifinals in the Italian capital with a 6-4, 6-4 quarterfinal victory against Jack Draper.And that win had major implications—literally.The Spaniard is now guaranteed to rise from No. 2 when the new rankings come out next Monday, after Rome, switching spots with Alexander Zverev, who will dip from No. 2 seed in Paris, meaning he can't play guaranteed No. 1 seed Jannik Sinner until the final.Zverev can't be passed for No. 4 seed at the second major of the year will be either Taylor Fritz or Casper Ruud—if Ruud goes on to win the title in Rome he'll snap it up, otherwise Fritz will round out the Top 4.

Draper snapped that streak, breaking back for 1-all, and the two went into a holding pattern until 4-all, where Alcaraz pounced one last time, breaking at love for 5-4 and then serving it out. "I think the most important thing I did today was not thinking about the result," Alcaraz said in his on-court interview. "Not thinking if I was up, if I was down, just trying to do the things that make me happy on the court—just try to play aggressive, hitting good shots, drop shots, coming to the net. That's what I like to do on the court. "I think that made the difference today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COCO Gauff told the tennis fans they were welcome to boo her during a 'controversial' on-court interview. Gauff, 21, just won her quarterfinal clash with Mirra Andreeva at the Italian Open in Rome. The 2023 US Open champion was grilled about her food preferences. Gauff was asked why she prefers Cacio e pepe pasta over carbonara. The 21-year-old gave an awkward laugh before admitting she could be about to cause controversy. "I just think Cacio e pepe is better," she laughed. "I don't know if that is controversial here - I just like that better. Turning to the crowd, Gauff added, "I don't know if you guys agree. The crowd's response was muted with no audible boos heard for Gauff's bold claim. She is one of the favorites for the French Open at Roland Garros in Paris later this month. 7 seed Andreeva 6-4, 7-6 in the last eight. She's also beaten Emma Raducanu, Magda Linette and Victoria Mboko on the way. Gauff's only slam title to date was in New York two years ago. She won the US Open title in front of her home crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The tennis star was selected as a US Olympic team flag bearer for the Paris 2024 Games. Her French Open campaign ended in tears when she was beaten by Iga Swiatek and she made her feelings clear at an umpire's call.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has reportedly anointed Mark Petchey as her coach for the grass court season after an impressive partnership so far. The 22-year-old is set to go into Wimbledon with the man who has helped her to eight wins in 11 matches in two months. It comes as a blow to Andy Murray's hopes of an immediate return to coaching with Raducanu after his split with Novak Djokovic on Tuesday. Murray named Raducanu as his dream women's player to work with in 2022 but kicked off his coaching career with a six-month stint helping Djokovic. But Raducanu, who also worked with Petchey in the summer of 2020, would like to extend her progress with her current aide as per The Telegraph. Petchey is her eighth trainer in four years but has helped the youngster relax on an ad-hoc basis, putting emphasis on fun warm-ups such as spikeball or football. Emma Raducanu has reportedly agreed for Mark Petchey to continue coaching her It comes as a blow to Andy Murray, who on Tuesday split from Novak Djokovic Petchey, 54, is employed by the Tennis Channel but they do not have the rights to Wimbledon, meaning he should be free to work with Raducanu on her favourite surface this summer. But his TV commitments could prevent a more serious, permanent position being taken up with Raducanu. As for Murray, he finds himself looking for a new gig just six weeks before Wimbledon, where Raducanu ended his SW19 career by pulling out of the doubles arrangement last summer. He Murray stunned the tennis world in November by announcing he would be coaching his old rival, but results tailed off after a positive start. ‘And thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months. Djokovic said: ‘Thank you, coach Andy, for all the hard work, fun & support over last six months on & off the court, really enjoyed deepening our friendship together.' The retired star worked with Novak Djokovic for six months but they have split amicably Djokovic played some of his best tennis of the last 12 months in reaching the semi-finals, when a muscular tear forced him to retire against Alexander Zverev.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top half quarterfinal matches of the ATP Italian Open men's singles draw will be played on Thursday in Rome. Now it's time for him to face Casper Ruud, who's on a 9-match winning streak after claiming the title in Madrid. Hubert Hurkacz has been struggling with different injuries for a while now, one of them keeping him out of Miami, Monte Carlo, and Munich. The Pole returned with a very weak performance in Madrid, but he's back on his feet now after spending a week doing some heavy training. The win over Jakub Mensik was kind of vintage Hurkacz with not much action on return and two tie-breaks won. Opponents like Mariano Navone and especially Francisco Cerundolo didn't need to be easy for Jannik Sinner after spending three months off the court. But pushing through them is going to be massive for the Italian, who's hoping to get himself ready for the French Open with this one tournament. Especially as the next matchups coming up might be more pleasant for him. Even when they played in 2020/21, he wasn't dropping sets against Casper Ruud. Wimbledon finalist Jasmine Paolini and Peyton Stearns reached the WTA Rome semifinal after dramatic quarterfinal matches. Two of the four ATP Italian Open quarterfinal matches will be held on Wednesday in Rome. The Italian Open, one of tennis's most prestigious clay-court tournaments, has taken a firm stance against disruptive behaviour that aims to influence gambling outcomes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner paid a visit to Vatican City on Wednesday, where he met with Pope Leo XIV during a break in the Italian Open. After receiving the racket, Leo XIV turned to Sinner with a smile and asked, “Could I play at Wimbledon with this?” While Wimbledon remains a major goal for Sinner, his immediate focus is on Roland Garros, just weeks away. Pope Leo XIV receives professional tennis player Jannik Sinner in the Vatican and asks for some sporting tips. After Pope Leo XIV revealed his lifelong passion for tennis and joked about which player he'd prefer to avoid in a charity match, Sinner reacted with a thoughtful message about the Pope's influence on the sport from the Vatican. Sinner surpasses Del Potro's milestone after latest win in Rome, sets sights on Andy Murray next “Obviously, I heard that he played as a kid. I think it's a good thing for us tennis players to have a pope who likes this sport that we're playing,” Sinner told the media ahead of the Italian Open, marking his return to international competition. Sinner has enjoyed a strong return to the ATP Tour. With a place secured in the Italian Open quarterfinals, the home favorite is preparing for a key clash against Madrid Open champion Casper Ruud. The matchup presents a major opportunity for Sinner, who has never lost to Ruud. Santiago Tovar is a bilingual sports journalist who joined Bolavip US in 2024.

After letting a 6-2, 4-2 lead slip through her fingers, the unseeded Stearns rallied from a double-break down in the third set to outlast No. Stearns will now have to face not just Paolini, but the weight of a partisan crowd when she meets Italy's top player in Thursday's semifinals. 6 seed Paolini advanced to her first Rome semifinal with a three-set win over No. 42, Stearns is into the first WTA 1000 semifinal of her career, which guarantees her a new career-high ranking in Monday's updated PIF WTA Rankings. It will potentially also garner her a first-ever Grand Slam seeding at Roland Garros. It has been a tremendous Rome journey for 2022 NCAA champion Stearns (U. of Texas), who is making her tournament debut this year, but has been playing like an Internazionali BNL d'Italia veteran. Coming into the event, Stearns had not reached a quarterfinal this season, but it all clicked into place for her at the Foro Italico. In her last two rounds, Stearns toppled Grand Slam champions Madison Keys and Naomi Osaka in third-set tiebreaks, setting up her history-making streak. Now Stearns has ousted one of this season's top clay-court performers in Svitolina. The Ukrainian had won 12 of her 13 WTA matches on clay this year (including a title at Rouen and a semifinal at Madrid) but she could not close out Stearns in Rome. Stearns had already shown that she can play much of her best WTA tennis on this surface. Topsy-turvy contest: Stearns is the tournament leader in forehand winners, and she used that shot spectacularly to reel off eight straight games and lead 6-2, 2-0 on Tuesday. Stearns was a point away from leading 6-2, 5-2 before Svitolina pulled back on serve in the second set. At that juncture, Svitolina ramped up her aggression to match the American's, and she saved four break points in a crucial hold for 4-4. Suddenly, Svitolina wrested the momentum away from Stearns, and it was her turn to dominate. But Stearns doubled down on her power plays, going for even more bold winners, and it paid off as she pulled back on serve. Svitolina reclaimed her advantage at 4-3, but Stearns struck right back, cranking a backhand winner for 4-4. Svitolina hit two consecutive aces to move into the tiebreak, where she again led 3-1. The American forced a rally forehand from Svitolina long to seal another marathon victory. Peyton Stearns made history at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia by edging past No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu will reportedly be coached by Mark Petchey at Wimbledon, with their partnership expected to span the entirety of the grass-court swing. They previously worked together in 2020 before rekindling their alliance during this year's Miami Open. Since then, Raducanu has won eight of her 11 matches and recently entered the world's top 50 for the first time in three years. It means they will be together at Wimbledon and the other grass events, which will include a women's tournament at Queen's Club for the first time since 1973. Their next outing will be in Strasbourg later this month as Raducanu prepares for the upcoming French Open. He also works as a tennis commentator but has reportedly cleared his schedule for the grass-court swing, a big sacrifice that will benefit the young Brit. Warm-up exercises like football and spikeball have also helped the former US Open champion to stay relaxed. It comes just days after Raducanu insisted that she was in a positive frame of mind leading up to the French Open. Speaking after her one-sided defeat to Coco Gauff in Rome, she made it clear that she was not looking to 'hide in a hole somewhere'. I don't want to go and hide in a hole somewhere. I want to get back out there, so that's good. But, for now, I've played a good 12 days on the trot, so I'm looking forward a day off or so and then getting back to it." Don't miss...

"It doesn't make the losses feel as bad, because I just know that every day I'm trying to be the best version of myself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: Former British No 1 Mark Petchey will be working alongside 2021 US Open champion for entire grass-court season Sir Andy Murray is highly unlikely to develop a Wimbledon tie-up with Emma Raducanu this summer after ending his coaching relationship with Novak Djokovic. Rather, it is because Raducanu's coaching vacancy has already been filled – at least for the grass-court season. Telegraph Sport understands that former British No 1 Mark Petchey – the old ally who has combined broadcasting work with assisting Raducanu during her last three tournaments – has made himself available for the entirety of the grass-court swing, without any competing commitments to distract him. In three previous appearances at Wimbledon, she has reached the last 16 twice. Raducanu has entered Strasbourg next week as a final build-up event before the French Open. The appointment of an experienced fitness trainer – Yutaka Nakamura – in December, has delivered a swift impact, even if hindsight suggests that this basic step should have been taken several years ago. Since he began helping her on an initially ad hoc basis in Miami two months ago, she has won eight matches from 11: a solid return which would, if continued, carry her well inside the seeded positions at the majors. Petchey has helped Raducanu relax by using light-hearted warm-up exercises such as spikeball or football. The results were evident in Rome last week, where Raducanu played some eye-catching tennis to reach the fourth round before eventually running into an in-form Coco Gauff. The fact that Petchey had worked with her before she rose to international fame is clearly an important aspect of their relationship. While Petchey will be present during the French Open, he will be working for TNT Sports, now part of the Discovery group, alongside an eye-catching commentary team that also includes John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Chris Evert and Jim Courier. It is anticipated that Petchey should be able to find gaps in his schedule to assist Raducanu, although TV commitments could also clash with his coaching work at times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON — Novak Djokovic is splitting with coach Andy Murray just two weeks ahead of the French Open, following a dismal start to the clay-court season. Murray's representatives announced Tuesday that the two former No. 1-ranked players will “no longer be working together.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When asked about the players' schedules, former world number one Jim Courier revealed that he was ‘shocked'. “With someone like [Jannik] Sinner, there is a lot of insurance at play,” he said. “For [Novak] Djokovic, he needs the matches because he has not played, and he is going to try and do what he did last year, which is get two or three matches and maybe try and pull the cord with a little bit of match toughness. “But I am really shocked honestly, to see some of the names on here.” “Let's set the table, these tournaments can pay appearance fees so some of these players will have accepted a big guarantee, I am talking hundreds of thousands of dollars just to show up and play and they don't have to win a match to get that money, so there is some commercial aspect to this,” he said. “But the serious players who think they are going to win Roland Garros or challenge for Roland Garros, they do not play these tournaments. “That does not happen before Wimbledon or Australia. It does not happen before the US Open. There are [ATP] 250 tournaments around which you just don't see the top players playing.” “There is a new bonus pool for ATP 500 this year. Six players who play at least four of these ATP 500 tournaments will share $3 million in extra money, so there are substantial financial benefits for players to play who are in that conversation,” said Courier. “So there is a lot that goes into this. But one thing which I know is that there is no amount of appearance money or bonus money that can replicate the kind of money you make if you win Roland Garros. 2003 US Open champion, Andy Roddick, agreed with Courier for the most part and shared whether he would've scheduled a warm-up tournament before the French Open during his playing days. “Sinner, this is an insurance entry, in my opinion. I don't know if Jim [Courier] thinks he has already done enough getting two matches, even three matches guaranteed going into Roland Garros. “Taylor [Fritz] wants to play the week before. Novak, taking a wildcard, he had to have some matches. Is a guy like Lorenzo Musetti looking for more matches the week before? Courier is worried that players who travel to Geneva and Hamburg could be risking their chance at French Open glory, but what happened last year? None of the seven went on to win the title in Paris, although that's not to say some didn't enjoy strong tournaments. 2024 Geneva Open champion, Ruud, qualified for the French Open semi-finals, but came up short against Alexander Zverev in four sets. Only time will tell if the likes of Ruud, Sinner, and Djokovic will be able to perform at both their warm-up tournaments and the French Open in 2025.</p>
