                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no significant difference in the effectiveness of how autistic and non-autistic people communicate, according to a new study, challenging the stereotype that autistic people struggle to connect with others. The findings suggest that social difficulties often faced by autistic people are more about differences in how autistic and non-autistic people communicate, rather than a lack of social ability in autistic individuals, experts say. Autistic people often communicate more directly and may struggle with reading social cues and body language, leading to differences in how they engage in conversation compared to non-autistic people. The study, led by experts from the University of Edinburgh, tested how effectively information was passed between 311 autistic and non-autistic people. Participants were tested in groups where everyone was autistic, everyone was non-autistic, or a combination of both. Researchers found there were no differences between autistic, non-autistic, and mixed groups. Researchers found that non-autistic people preferred interacting with others like themselves, and autistic people preferred learning from fellow autistic individuals. This is likely down to the different ways that autistic and non-autistic people communicate, experts say. They say the new evidence should lead to increased understanding of autistic communication styles as a difference, not a deficiency. Autism has often been associated with social impairments, both colloquially and in clinical criteria. Researchers have spent a lot of time trying to 'fix' autistic communication, but this study shows that despite autistic and non-autistic people communicating differently it is just as successful. With opportunities for autistic people often limited by misconceptions and misunderstandings, this new research could lead the way to bridging the communication gap and create more inclusive spaces for all."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A first-in-human study of an investigational once-daily oral treatment for obesity (SYNT-101) demonstrated positive preliminary data for the safe and effective redirection of nutrient absorption into the lower intestine, the weight loss and metabolic management mechanism behind gastric bypass surgery. In the study, being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May), participants were surveyed for adverse events, tolerability markers, as well as modulation of satiety hormones that influence hunger and weight loss. "These data validate the potential of SYNT-101 to induce metabolic changes that support glycaemic control, weight loss and energy balance," said Rahul Dhanda, chief executive officer of Syntis Bio, the Boston-based biopharmaceutical company developing SYNT-101. "We believe that SYNT-101 will provide a convenient, more sustainable oral alternative and/or complement to systemic therapies such as GLP-1 drugs. The millions of people living with obesity need novel treatment options that are safe, effective and avoid the high costs and severe side effects that often accompany available treatment options." Many obesity medications, like GLP-1 receptor agonists, are effective in aiding weight loss, but loss of lean muscle remains a common concern. There are also ongoing issues with these drugs around accessibility, gastrointestinal side effects and long-term maintenance. In addition, this "duodenal nutrient exclusion" effect improves satiety and metabolic regulation, and has been shown to better preserve lean muscle mass compared to GLP-1 drugs. The polydopamine lining is designed work for up to 24 hours, after which it is naturally cleared from the body. SYNT-101 will ultimately be delivered in a once-daily oral pill. In preclinical studies, SYNT-101 has shown promising effects on glycaemic control and produced weight loss of 1% a week for six weeks while preserving 100% of lean muscle mass in rodent models. Two participants were given 25% of the target dose, three received 50% and four received the full target dose. Blood tests were also conducted before and after treatment with SYNT-101 to assess the effects on satiety and metabolic hormone levels, including liver enzymes, leptin (a hormone that regulates appetite) and ghrelin (a hormone that causes hunger). Endoscopic imaging confirmed that the polymer coating formed as expected across the upper small intestine, and tissue samples showed that SYNT-101 was safely eliminated within 24 hours of administration. During the 10 days following treatment, liver enzymes including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and bilirubin remained stable for each participant, consistent with normal liver functioning. Additionally, gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent, with no changes noted in the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and all participants reported an average pain rating of 0. Although the pilot study was not designed to measure weight loss, participants receiving a full dose of SYNT-101 also received blood tests, which showed elevated levels of leptin and lower levels of ghrelin, consistent with findings from preclinical in vivo models showing reduced food intake. Syntis Bio plans to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the second half of 2025. We are eager to replicate these data in our upcoming Phase 1 clinical trial and further explore the ability of SYNT-101 to produce sustainable, safe, effective weight loss by reducing fat, preserving lean muscle and stimulating natural production of satiety hormones to prevent weight regain."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These conversations, which largely happen in primary care settings, give providers an opportunity to impress upon their patients the importance of keeping their blood glucose levels under control. But these discussions must also be intentionally tailored to each individual patient's understanding of the disease and their role in caring for themselves. Research suggests low levels of health literacy can be a barrier to good self-management and positive outcomes, which makes this assessment — followed by education — especially crucial. “It's good to gauge their understanding of what this [disease] actually is,” said Absalon Gutierrez, MD, an endocrinologist with The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He often starts by asking patients what they know about the disease and if they have any relatives with diabetes and what that has meant for them. Bryan Cochran, MD, family medicine physician at MedStar Health Primary Care in Alexandria, Virginia, tailors each conversation to the individual patient because every patient has a different level of preparation for hearing such news. “For some patients, they've been anticipating the diagnosis, and they may have been prediabetic or have a family history, so they are ready to hit the ground running with dietary changes or medications,” said Cochran. “For others, it can feel like a blind-sided diagnosis. They can feel shocked and overwhelmed to have to start a myriad of new lifestyle rules and restrictions, as well as potentially a whole host of new medications.” Type 2 diabetes is associated with a wide range of possible comorbidities, including a higher risk for certain kinds of cancer, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, liver and kidney disease, and cognitive decline. Neil Soskel, DO, primary care physician at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Lynbrook, New York, noted that some newly diagnosed patients don't quite grasp the seriousness of the diagnosis. “I tell them that this is a lifetime disease,” Soskel said. They're just going to control it, and then I go into all the secondary complications.” “You've kind of got to go with tough love,” he added. Gutierrez said it can be useful to specifically tell patients that they likely won't feel a difference just from having elevated blood glucose levels. “You're trying to stop some things that are silent killers down the line,” Gutierrez said. Some patients may have struggled with their weight their entire adult lives, and suddenly they are finding out that they have diabetes. Nadkarni agreed about the need for care, noting that his program holds seminars for residents to learn how to break bad news, including sharing with patients they have a chronic illness like diabetes. A type 2 diabetes diagnosis may be particularly difficult for some younger adults (< 45 years) to receive, according to a 2021 study in Journal of General Internal Medicine. In some cases, it also requires patient adherence to medication regimens that may change over time. The primary care clinician can help newly diagnosed patients figure out what motivates them to change their behavior. “Do you want to be around for your grandchildren and to be a part of their life?” Smith might ask a patient. “If you do, we need to start making some changes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carrying eagle feathers and chanting prayers, Western Apache runners hit the road on a roughly 80-mile journey this month to try to save their sacred land from being fast-tracked by President Donald Trump into a copper mine. This nationally watched battle, which hinges on religious freedom, awaits the U.S. Supreme Court. The prayer run aimed to defend a 6-square-mile piece of land in rural Arizona outside of Phoenix called Chi'chil Biłdagoteel, or Oak Flat, where tribes have held ceremonies for centuries. The U.S. Forest Service, which owns the site, plans to trade a portion of it to a foreign-owned mining company, Resolution Copper, in exchange for other environmentally sensitive properties. The proposed land swap, which Congress approved in 2014 through a defense spending bill, has been stalled by three lawsuits. But it also would destroy most of Oak Flat, leaving behind a sinkhole nearly 2 miles wide and as deep as the Eiffel Tower. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit that aims to protect sacred lands including Oak Flat, won a reprieve on May 9, when U.S. District Judge Steven Logan granted an injunction blocking the land swap while the Supreme Court considers its case. "The federal government and Resolution Copper have put Oak Flat on death row — they are racing to destroy our spiritual lifeblood and erase our religious traditions forever," Wendsler Nosie Sr., founder of Apache Stronghold, said in a statement. "We are grateful the judge stopped this land grab in its tracks so that the Supreme Court has time to protect Oak Flat from destruction." The prayer run drew 60 runners, running in segments. Eighty-five faith groups and 44 tribal nations are supporting Apache Stronghold's Supreme Court appeal. The fight over Oak Flat offers a glimpse into environmental, public health, and religious battles that may intensify as Trump prioritizes tapping into domestic sources of minerals such as copper, a key ingredient for electronics and renewable energy projects. The case also could set a legal precedent for whether religious freedom grants tribes the right to pray on ancestral lands outside of their reservations. The Oak Flat case highlights some of the health concerns that arise when ancestral Native American lands owned by the federal government are opened to mining, from physical illness — due to water and air pollution — to psychological, spiritual, and existential distress. In roadside prayers and rallies along the run, members of various tribes offered visceral accounts of the harm they've experienced after sacred lands were tapped for minerals, fossil fuels, and heavy metals. They described attacks on health, identity, religion, and culture that many referred to as ongoing genocide. At Oak Flat Campground, Apache Stronghold supporters gathered for a ceremony before the prayer run began. Runners were blessed with ashes to protect them on a route that would traverse vast fields of cacti, narrow mountain passes, and even two combative drivers on city streets. Among those lacing up running shoes was Nizhoni Pike, 24, one of Nosie's granddaughters. Oak Flat is where Pike had her sunrise ceremony, a coming-of-age ritual, at age 13. During the ceremony, she built her own wickiup, a traditional Apache dome-shaped dwelling made of wood and thatch from the land. Her family named the area Nizhoni's Butterfly Canyon. The sunrise ceremony creates a cord by which women are forever connected to the land where they came of age, she said. Tribal elders have told her that women may suffer illness if the cords are cut. “I'm really worried for me and the other girls that had their sunrise dances there,” she said. She already had anxiety, she said, and it has grown worse because of the drying up and pending destruction of Oak Flat. “I've never felt so much pain in my heart or spirit before,” she said. She and other Apache members attribute the dryness to Resolution Copper, which has been pumping water out of a 7,000-foot-deep mining shaft on its adjacent property for years. He said the company treats the removed water then gives it away to farmers to grow crops so they can "pump less fresh groundwater themselves.” He said the company has made significant changes to its proposed mine to "reduce potential impacts on Tribal, social, and cultural interests." Along the run, supporters gathered for blessings from various faith leaders, some of whom sprinkled them with holy water. But opponents in Superior warned that mining has left the area with high cancer rates, toxic dumps, and ghost towns. In the city of Mesa, runners stopped at an ancestral site of the O'odham people to receive support from two Native leaders with roots there. Su:k Chu:vak Fulwilder, a council member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, said loss of land and identity is taking a toll on her people. Other supporters raised concerns about water quantity and quality in a time of long-term drought. Resolution Copper's plans to conduct block-cave mining would require nearly 250 billion gallons of water and the natural water systems would be "altered forever and, in many cases, destroyed in perpetuity," according to a federal environmental impact statement and hydrology report. Henry Muñoz, 69, who worked in mines for nearly 24 years and is now chair of the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition in Superior, noted that the mine would require scarce water to pipe away toxic waste and copper concentrate. The toxic slurry would be sent to a tailings site, he said, where it would require more water so that dust laden with arsenic and sulfur doesn't blow away. He noted that Resolution Copper is owned by foreign mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP, so much of the profit would go overseas. Cadence Hardy, 16, who is Diné, said she grew up in Black Mesa, Arizona, where intensive coal mining depleted an aquifer and its springs, deeply affecting Hopi and Diné communities. In the May 7 federal court hearing, Victoria Peacey, president of Resolution Copper, took the stand, facing a courtroom packed with Apache Stronghold supporters, and testified that it would be at least 16 years until Oak Flat would begin to sink. Sixteen years is a short time, and the consequence would be huge, she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ada Carol Adkins lives with her two dogs in a trailer tucked into the timbers off Upper Mud River Road. "I'm comfortable here, but I'm having health issues," said the 68-year-old, who retired from her job as a school cook several years ago after having a stroke. Her trailer sits halfway up a ridge miles from town and the local health clinic. Her phone and internet are "wacky sometimes," she said. Adkins — who is fiercely independent and calls herself a "Mountain Momma" — worries she won't be able to call for help if service goes out, which happens often. To Frontier Communications, the telecommunications company that owns the line to her home, Adkins says: "Please come and hook me right." But she might be waiting years for better service, frustrated by her internet provider and left behind by troubled federal grant programs. A quarter of West Virginia counties — including Lincoln, where the Mud River bends its way through hollows and past cattle farms — face two barriers to health care: They lack high-speed internet and have a shortage of primary care providers and behavioral health specialists, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Years of Republican and Democratic administrations have tried to fix the nation's broadband woes, through flawed attempts. Blair Levin, a former executive director of the Federal Communications Commission's National Broadband Plan, called one rural program rollout during the first Trump administration "a disaster." It was launched before it was ready, he said, using unreliable federal maps and a reverse-auction process to select internet carriers. Locations went to the lowest bidder, but the agency failed to ensure winners had the knowledge and resources to build networks, said Levin, who is now an equity analyst with New Street Research. The fund initially announced awards of $9.2 billion to build infrastructure in 49 states. By 2025, $3.3 billion of those awards were in default and, as a result, the program won't connect 1.9 million homes and businesses, according to a recent study. A $42 billion Biden-era initiative still may not help Adkins and many others shortchanged by earlier federal broadband grants. The new wave of funding, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, has an anti-waste provision and won't provide service in places where previous grants were awarded — even if companies haven't delivered on their commitments. The use of federal money to get people connected is "really essential" for rural areas, said Ross DeVol, CEO and chairman of the board of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development. "Internet service providers look at the economics of trying to go into some of these communities and there just isn't enough purchasing power in their minds," DeVol said, adding that broadband expansion is analogous to rural electrification. Without high-speed internet, "you're simply at a distinct disadvantage," he added. In January, while bean soup warmed on the stove, she opened a notebook: "I got books full. Her finger traced the page as she recounted outages that occurred about once a month last year. Each time she went for days without service. Frontier did not respond to requests for comment on Adkins' and other customers' service. Adkins, a widow, spends most of her time at home and said she would do video calls with her doctors if she could. She also has high blood pressure and arthritis and uses over-the-counter pain patches when needed, such as after she carries 30-pound dog food bags into the house. She does not own a four-wheel-drive truck and, for three weeks in January, the snow and ice were so severe she couldn't leave. "I'm stranded up here," she said, adding that neighbors check in: "'Do you have electric? The pale-yellow cord was tied off with green plastic ties around a pole outside her trailer. Adkins said a deer stepping on the line has interrupted her phone service. Inside, an old hunting dog sleeps on the floor. Belcher pointed out a window toward where he said Frontier's cable has remained unrepaired for years: "It's laying on the ground in the woods," he said. Frontier is West Virginia's legacy carrier, controlling most of the state's old landlines since buying them from Verizon Communications in 2010. Twelve years later, the company won nearly $248 million to install high-speed internet to West Virginia through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, an initiative launched during President Donald Trump's first term. "Big Daddy," as local transit driver Bruce Perry called Trump, is popular with the people of Lincoln County. But the Belchers needed better internet access for work and could afford to pay $700 for a Starlink satellite internet kit and insurance, they said. Their monthly Starlink bill is $120 — a price many cannot manage, especially since Congress sunset an earlier program that helped offset the cost of high-speed plans for consumers. Meanwhile, the latest broadband program to connect rural Americans is ensnared in Trump administration policy shifts. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, announced his state would take an extension. The plan that was in place would have brought high-speed fiber lines to homes ahead of schedule and under budget, he said. When Feinman resigned in March, he sent a lengthy email stating that the new administration wants to take fiber away from homes and businesses and substitute it with satellite connections. Morrisey, whose office declined to respond to requests for comment, said in his announcement that he wants to ensure West Virginia spends the money in a manner "consistent with program changes being proposed by the Trump Administration" and "evaluate a broader range of technology options." Commissioners from Grant County responded with a letter supporting fiber-optic cables rather than satellite-based connections like those provided by Elon Musk's Starlink. Nationwide, 115 lawmakers from 28 states sent a letter to federal leaders stating that changes could "delay broadband deployment by a year or more." For Adkins and others, the wait has been long enough. While legislators in Washington and across the country bickered over the broadband program, Adkins went without phone and internet. By late March, she said, her 42-year-old son was increasingly worried, noting "you're getting up in age." He told her: "Mom, move out, get off of that hill." He said his company has been trying to "build up there for a while." He grew up in the community, and parents of a high school friend live off Upper Mud River. But he said "it's very difficult" to build fiber along the rocky terrain to homes where "you are hoping that people will hook up, and if they don't, well, you've lost a lot of money." A 2022 countywide broadband assessment found that stringing fiber-optic lines along telephone poles would cost more than $5,000 per connection in some areas — work that would need big federal subsidies to be feasible. Yet Vance said Armstrong cannot apply for the latest BEAD funding to help finance connections. And while he likes that the federal government is "being responsible" by not handing out two federal grants for the same area, Vance said, "we want to see people deliver on the grants they have." If Frontier hadn't already gotten federal funds from the earlier Trump program, "we definitely would have applied to that area," Vance said. High-speed internet brings more jobs and less poverty, said Claudia Persico, an associate professor at American University. Persico, who is also a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research, co-authored a recent paper that found increased broadband internet leads to a reduction in the number of suicides as well as improvements in self-reported mental and physical health. More than 30% of Lincoln County's population reports cases of depression, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lincoln Primary Care Center offers telehealth services such as electronic medical records on a patient portal and a pharmacy app, said Jill Adkins, chief quality and risk officer at Southern West Virginia Health System, which operates the clinic. Vance and her husband, Isaiah, live off a gravel road that veers from Upper Mud River. There is a tall pole with black wires dangling across the road from their small home. Pointing to the cables, Isaiah Vance said he couldn't get phone service anymore. Verizon announced plans last year to buy Frontier for an estimated $20 billion. The deal, which must be approved by federal and state regulators, is expected to be completed in early 2026, according to an investor's press release. In its federal merger application, Frontier stated that it had taken on too much debt after emerging from bankruptcy and that debt would make it difficult to finish the work of installing fiber to customers in 25 states. In West Virginia, Frontier's Allison Ellis wrote in March 3 testimony, seeking approval for the merger from state regulators, that Verizon will honor the rural program commitments. Kelly Workman, West Virginia's broadband director, said during a November interview that her office has asked federal regulators for "greater visibility" into Frontier's rural program construction, particularly because those locations cannot win the Biden-era infrastructure money when it's available. Frontier's progress installing fiber-optic lines and its unreliable service have frustrated West Virginians for years. Michael Holstine, a longtime member of the West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council, said the company has "just used West Virginia as a money cow." Across the state, people like Holstine and Adkins are eager for updated networks, according to interviews as well as letters released under a public records request. Chrissy Murray, vice president of Frontier's external communications, acknowledged that the company was "building back our community efforts" in West Virginia after a bankruptcy filing and reorganization. It has also invested in other infrastructure projects across the state, she said in a January email, adding that the company donated high-speed fiber internet to West Virginia University's rural Jackson's Mill campus. According to data tracked by a federal agency, Frontier has connected 6,100 — or fewer than 10% — of the more than 79,000 locations it was awarded in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund program. The agency did not respond to a request for comment. In April, a new batch of letters from West Virginia residents filed as "support" for Frontier's merger with Verizon appeared in the state regulatory docket: "My support for this case depends on whether Verizon plans to upgrade or replace the existing Frontier infrastructure," wrote one customer in Summers County, in the far southern corner of the state, adding, "West Virginians in my neck of the woods have been held hostage by Frontier for a generation now because no other providers exist." Adkins moved to Upper Mud River with her husband, Bobby, decades ago. For years, Bobby and Ada Carol Adkins ran a "carry-out" on Upper Mud River Road. It was the type of store where locals kept a tab — which Bobby treated too much like a "charity," Adkins said. I got arthritis, they're treating me for high blood pressure." Her doctor has begun sending notes over the internet to refill her blood pressure medicine and, Adkins said, "I love that!" But Adkins' internet was out again in early April, and she can't afford Starlink like her neighbors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN DIEGO — Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics were linked to as much as a 74.5% reduction in the risk for alopecia areata (AA) in patients with psoriasis, a new retrospective cohort study reported. “We could choose a medication for their psoriasis to give them some protective benefit,” she added. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that the pooled prevalence rate of AA in patients with psoriasis was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3-0.7%). The pooled risk for AA in patients with psoriasis was estimated at 2.71 (95% CI, 2.29-3.21). Some DMARDs and biologics are used to treat AA off-label, while others have not been evaluated as treatments for the disease, Rohr said. “We wanted to investigate if our drug choice for these patients who require systemic therapies could have some protective benefit,” Rohr said. Via the TriNetX international electronic record database, she and her coauthors tracked 48,724 patients with psoriasis who were on DMARDs (average age, 52.6 years ± 16.3; 56.6% women; 70.4% White individuals; 21.9% with overweight/obesity) vs a propensity-matched cohort who were not taking systemic medications. Researchers also tracked 66,837 patients with psoriasis who were on biologics (average age, 52.9 years ± 16.9; 54.8% women; 71.5% White individuals; 21.5% with overweight/obesity) vs a propensity-matched cohort who were not taking systemic medications. No statistically significant difference was seen between the DMARD and biologic groups (P = .322). Study lead author Nada Hentati, a medical student at Case Western Reserve, told Medscape Medical News that the researchers had to group many medications together because the sample size was small. “We lost some of the granularity regarding which medications might be independently protective,” she said. Part of that is because we constrained our data to make sure that all the cases we were seeing were within 5 years of starting the drugs.” “However, it's important to remember this is a pilot study,” she added, and the data has limitations. “Ideally,” she said, “it would be nice to have a really large prospective study following individual drugs and patients with similar body surface area and severity of psoriasis to better understand the significance of our data.” Asked to comment on the study findings, Deshan Sebaratnam, MBBS, MMed, associate professor of dermatology at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, told Medscape Medical News many DMARDs are used to treat AA, and “there have been small-volume case reports where patients with alopecia areata have improved on biologics.” However, for psoriasis, he noted, “I don't think this is really going to change management. You wouldn't immunosuppress someone to decrease the likelihood of developing AA.” Sebaratnam disclosed relationships with AbbVie, Galderma, Bristol Squibb Meyers, Pfizer, Amgen, Novartis, Leo, Viatris, iNova, and Sun.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From vector-borne illnesses to pavement burns, climate change poses wide-ranging threats to skin health, particularly in vulnerable populations, according to some of the authors of a clinical image series recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine's Images in Clinical Medicine section. One case was a 65-year-old man who presented with an itchy rash on his hip 1 week after removing an adult female Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) from the area. The rash's bull's-eye appearance helped authors led by Eva R. Parker, MD, DTMH, assistant professor of dermatology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, diagnose southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). There is no diagnostic test for STARI, since the causative organism remains unknown. “This change in distribution is attributable at least in part to climate change, and further geographic spread of the vector and a longer active season are anticipated as temperatures increase,” they noted. In a separate case, a 3-year-old boy who had recently immigrated from Venezuela to the United States presented with a 6-week history of painless bumps and ulcers on his leg, which developed after he had insect bites on his foot. Histopathology showed severe lymphohistiocytic infiltration, but no organisms were identified by routine stains. Polymerase chain reaction testing identified Leishmania guyanensis, a parasite transmitted by phlebotomine sandfly bites, and he was diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis. While intoxicated, he had walked barefoot on asphalt for 1 minute during a regional heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that created maximum air temperatures of 108°F, about 38°F higher than historical averages. At press time, all three featured cases had resolved or were resolving with standard treatment. In an interview, Rosenbach said that clinicians should be talking about climate-related issues because these issues are changing when, where, and which patients present with skin diseases and other manifestations. Having climate change impacts highlighted in The New England Journal of Medicine helps to emphasize that such issues can affect every organ and medical subspecialty, said Rosenbach. “While many physicians are becoming more familiar with climate impacts on disease in general,” Parker told Medscape Dermatology, “there are still large gaps in our knowledge.” Many medical schools and residency programs fail to teach this curriculum, she explained, and practicing physicians have limited opportunities to learn it. Additionally, a sustainability session at the upcoming AAD Innovation Academy meeting will address how dermatologists can limit the environmental impacts of care delivery. Dermatologists who wish to help raise awareness can join the AAD's Climate Change and Environmental Affairs Expert Resource Group (ERG), Parker added. Additionally, Parker and Rosenbach plan to coedit an early 2026 issue of Dermatologic Clinics. “It's all existing diseases that are exacerbated by climate change,” said Parker. “Or the epidemiology has changed because of climate change. So a heightened awareness among clinicians to consider climate impacts on skin disease when evaluating patients and to collect environmental histories and act on that information, is critical. It means a pivot in our way of thinking.” Along with helping physicians recognize the shifting patterns, she said, “it's an opportunity for us to educate our patients.” One of her recent patients could not believe she had a tick bite in April. “In Tennessee,” said Parker, “I sometimes pull ticks off in January and February now.” Accordingly, she said, people who do outdoor activities must protect themselves year-round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The skin microbiome plays an important role in health and disease. Researchers have now substantiated that certain skin bacteria can protect us from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation specifically by metabolizing cis-urocanic acid using an enzyme called urocanase. Commensal microbes, also known as normal microbiota or indigenous microbiota that live in a beneficial or neutral relationship without causing harm, adapt their metabolism to the resources available in their microenvironment, feeding on our skin's nutrients and producing various molecules that affect their environment and interact with our skin cells. Lead investigator VijayKumar Patra, PhD, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie; Lyon, France, and Research Unit for Photodermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria, explains, "To date, many internal and external factors have been identified that influence the composition of the skin microbiome. These include various individual parameters such as race, gender, age, hormone levels, diet, and hygiene, but environmental factors and the effects of occupation, pollution, and climate also have a major influence. We have known for a long time that UV radiation modulates immune responses directed against environmental antigens on the surface of the skin and, more recently, that the skin microbiome also plays a role in regulating these responses. What intrigued us was the idea that certain microbes could be actively involved in or even interfere with UV effects. Researchers used a combination of microbiome sequencing, immunological assays, in vitro cultures, and gnotobiotic mouse models, in which all microorganisms present are defined, to study how skin bacteria respond to UVB radiation, the type of UV radiation that typically causes sunburn. They discovered that certain skin bacteria specifically metabolize cis-urocanic acid, a photoproduct of a major UV-absorbing chromophore of the stratum corneum, trans-urocanic acid, using an enzyme called urocanase. This microbial metabolism then limits the ability of cis-urocanic acid to inhibit immune responses, which means that skin bacteria fine-tune our skin's response to UV radiation. Co-investigator Marc Vocanson, PhD, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Lyon, France, notes, "This is the first time we have demonstrated a direct metabolic link between UV radiation, a host-derived molecule, and bacterial behavior that affects immune function. As interest grows in both microbiome research and personalized medicine, understanding these microbe-host interactions could reshape the way we think about sun protection, immune diseases, skin cancer, or even treatments like phototherapy." Co-investigator Peter Wolf, MD, Research Unit for Photodermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria, concludes, "These findings open the door to microbiome-aware sun protection, where we not only protect the skin from UV radiation, but also consider how resident microbes can alter the immune landscape after exposure. In the future, topical treatments that modulate microbial metabolism could be used to minimize, maintain, or enhance UV-induced immunosuppression when clinically beneficial, such as with phototherapy." Commenting on the findings, noted expert in the field Anna Di Nardo, MD, PhD, University of California San Diego, and San Gallicano Dermatological Institute IRCCS, Rome, says, "This pivotal study shows that microbial communities are not passive victims of environmental stress but dynamic regulators of immune responses, capable of metabolizing UV-induced skin products such as cis-urocanic acid. This newly uncovered role of microbial metabolism in modulating UV tolerance reshapes our understanding of the skin barrier — not just as a structural shield but as a metabolically active, microbially regulated interface. With increasing concerns about UV exposure, skin aging, and cancer, a deeper understanding of this axis offers promising avenues for therapy and prevention." Urocanase-positive skin resident bacteria metabolize cis-urocanic acid and in turn reduce the immunosuppressive properties of UV radiation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May), reveals that 3- to 4- year olds in rural areas are more likely to be living with overweight and abdominal obesity (excess fat around waist), and spend more time on screens than their urban counterparts. Around 1 in 3 children in the WHO European Region is living with overweight or obesity [1], with an estimated 17 million boys and 11 million girls (aged 5-19 years) predicted to be living with obesity in Europe by 2035 [2]. Identifying those children most at risk and the environmental and geographic factors that contribute to this risk is critical to focusing prevention efforts. Movement behaviours-insufficient physical activity, excessive sedentary behaviour (such as screen time) and poor sleep-are potential risk factors for overweight and obesity in children, but evidence in young children is inconsistent and primarily focused on body mass index (BMI), which may misrepresent true adiposity, as it fails to account for differences in body composition, such as fat distribution and muscle mass. Additionally, the effects of urbanisation on movement behaviours and adiposity in young children remain poorly understood. To explore these issues further, researchers examined the urban-rural differences in movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary time, screen time, and sleep) and adiposity indicators (BMI and waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]) in 1,080 3–4 year-old participants (46% girls) from the SUNRISE Finland study [3]-part of the international SUNRISE study, which aims to monitor the WHO Guidelines on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under 5 years globally [4]. The results were adjusted for potentially confounding factors like age, sex, data collection area, household education, sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks (and additionally for accelerometer wear time for physical activity and sedentary time) . The analysis revealed clear rural-urban differences in patterns of adiposity, with 24% of 3-4 year olds in rural areas living with overweight or obesity compared to 16% of those in urban areas. Similarly, around 19% of rural preschoolers had abdominal obesity compared to 13% in urban environments. The researchers also found that higher moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (e.g., running and energetic play) in urban environments and higher light physical activity (e.g., low-energy play) in rural areas were linked with a higher risk of overweight (based on BMI), but not with abdominal obesity (based on WHtR). "This finding may reflect that waist-to-height ratio is a better indicator of adiposity, whereas BMI does not distinguish between fat and muscle mass, which tends to increase with higher physical activity," said Uusitalo. Only in rural areas was more screen time associated with a higher risk of both overweight and abdominal obesity. According to co-author Dr. Elina Engberg from the Folkhälsan Research Center and the University of Helsinki in Finland, "The stronger association between screen time and adiposity indicators in rural areas may be partly explained by the higher screen time observed among rural children, whereas other factors appear to play a more significant role in adiposity in urban areas." She continues: "The health consequences and persistence of young childhood obesity into adulthood highlight the need for efforts to improve society and family-oriented preventive strategies at the local level, which could narrow the gap in risk for young children in rural settings." This is a cross-sectional study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause. The study also relied on parent assessment rather than objective measures of screen time and sleep patterns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Radiation sterilization technology destroys the DNA and cellular structures of bacteria and microorganisms using electromagnetic waves with far higher energy than ultraviolet radiation. This technique has become indispensable for sterilization in various fields, including medical devices (e.g., disposable syringes, catheters, artificial joints), pharmaceuticals (e.g., raw materials, tissue grafts), and food products (e.g., sprout inhibition in potatoes). Traditionally, it has been believed that the effectiveness of radiation sterilization depends solely on the total irradiation dose. However, this assumption has now been challenged by a research team led by Professor Matsumoto and Associate Professor Iwata at Nagoya City University. (b) Conversely, in a nutrient-rich environment, short-term irradiation at a high dose rate achieved more than ten times the sterilization efficiency compared to long-term irradiation at a low dose rate. These findings were further analyzed using stochastic differential equations-a cutting-edge mathematical tool-enabling a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms by which radiation damages bacterial and cellular structures. This research not only provides a scientific foundation for optimizing sterilization and disinfection protocols using radiation, but also introduces a novel framework for designing irradiation strategies that can selectively eliminate rapidly proliferating lesion cells (e.g., cancer cells) while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. These insights hold great promise for the development of safer, more effective, and patient-friendly radiation therapies using X-rays and proton beams.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. The HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) plays a crucial role in viral replication by orchestrating nuclear entry through interactions with host nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Recent research has revealed that HIV-1 CA actively disrupts NPC architecture via phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat nucleoporin interactions, thereby enabling nuclear translocation of viral components. Lenacapavir competitively blocks CA-NPC binding, stabilizes cytoplasmic capsids, disrupts viral maturation, and demonstrates pan-stage antiviral efficacy and long-acting pharmacokinetics. Clinical trials have indicated its 100% prophylactic efficacy and potential to decrease global HIV incidence. Advances in structural biology, molecular dynamics simulations, and nanotechnology are expected to further inform next-generation therapeutic strategies targeting CA-host interactions. These findings not only redefine HIV-1 treatment paradigms but also have broader implications for combating CA-dependent viruses.
