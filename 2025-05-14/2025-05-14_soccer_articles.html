                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Star-power and Supersubs – both proved crucial in the 2025 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Round of 32. We take a look at three U.S. Men's National Team players – each with multiple caps for their country – who powered their respective Major League Soccer (MLS) sides to glory and spots in the Round of 16. So when Los Verdes were down by two goals to Division II (USL Championship) side El Paso Locomotive in the 72nd minute at home in their 2025 opener, it smelled like more of the same disappointment in Cup play. That all changed, however, in the space of six second-half minutes when Brandon Vazquez, the burly 26-year-old former FC Cincinnati striker, flexed his muscles and showed precisely why he's been called in on 11 occasions to play for the United States (tallying four goals in those appearances). It may come as a surprise to some readers that Vazquez knows what it feels like to lift this country's oldest prize – having finished top-scorer for Atlanta United in their run to the 2019 Open Cup title.“Wild stuff will happen when you least expect it in the Open Cup,” he told ussoccer.com of the threat posed by lower-league teams in the topsy-turvy world of the U.S. Open Cup. “When you least expect it, you'll get bit,” he added, knowing well the pitfalls that exist in domestic Cup play. “It happens when your head goes down and these games [against lower-level teams] are really dangerous. Slipping in behind the Locomotive defence, Vazquez hit home a slick pass from Owen Wolff. It was just two minutes later when Vazquez, a master of hold-up play with his big frame, chested a long ball down for Myrto Uzuni to hammer home the equalizer. This time Vazquez took the time to celebrate his goal – and the huge comeback that saw Austin FC match their best-ever run in the Open Cup (a place in the Round of 16) and book another home date with our two-time Open Cup Champs Houston Dynamo on May 21 (LIVE on Paramount+). He had to weave his game-changing magic after coming off the bench in the 78th minute for Charlotte FC. Teams from all the levels getting to play against each other – it's crazy,” Agyemang said earlier this year, while in his first camp with the U.S. Men's National Team. “You don't know what's gonna happen. The massive target man took control in an overtime session that produced five goals and an eventual 4-1 win for Charlotte FC. The striker rose highest and headed home off the inside of the post to earn a lead that Charlotte FC wouldn't relinquish – and which sent them through to a Round of 16 date with D.C. United on the road (LIVE on Paramount+). “It's all about moments,” Agyemang has said about the historic Open Cup, and he couldn't be more right. He also had a hand in Nikola Petkovic's third goal for Charlotte FC and an assist on the insurance strike by Kerwin Vargas, in the dying seconds, that sealed the 1-4 win for the MLS men from North Carolina. Curiously enough that matchup between our 2018 and 2023 Champs Houston Dynamo and Phoenix Rising (of the Division II USL Championship) also ended 1-4 after the extra-time session. The highlight of those bonus 30 minutes in Arizona was a wonder goal for four-times capped Jack McGlynn (with one goal for the USMNT so far in his international career). The youngster, just 21 and with a big future ahead, arrived in Houston after coming through the youth system at Philadelphia Union and breaking into the club's first team. He carved open some space on the right side in the 99th minute, cut inside and unleashed a wicked curling volley with his left foot that was always destined for the top corner. “He's a monster!” enthused Dynamo coach and three-time Open Cup winner Ben Olsen about young McGlynn's performance. It was the go-ahead goal (1-2) and the Dynamo strolled on to an eventual 1-4 result (after regulation time ended 1-1). Aside from being a frontrunner candidate for Goal of the Round, McGlynn's wonder-strike helped the Dynamo seal a tricky contest on the road and book a place in the Round of 16 against Brandon Vazquez and his swashbuckling Austin FC (LIVE on Paramount+).You can WATCH all EIGHT Round of 16 GAMES on Paramount+ on May 20-21 with select GAMES on the CBS Sports Golazo Network and on air at CBS Sports Network.Angelo Maduro is a senior reporter at large forwww.ussoccer.com/us-open-cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The attempt to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold has taken a form that is very much liked in the offices of Valdebebas. The contacts between the white leadership and the English right-back's entourage have allowed positions to be brought closer more than notably, making his signing a practically 'closed' operation. Liverpool is willing to make that need of Real Madrid a reality, but it has imposed three well-known conditions in the European football elite. But Trent Alexander-Arnold himself will also be forced to make a double sacrifice. That would not make the white sports management less interested in his incorporation, but it would put the new first-team coach, Xabi Alonso, in a bind. The lack of right-backs has been a constant this season, and Alexander-Arnold is the solution to that problem. In this situation, Trent Alexander-Arnold faces the double sacrifice of salary and his vacations. Playing the Club World Cup with Real Madrid not only implies not receiving the last month of his contract with Liverpool. It also means going directly into action, with barely two weeks of preparation and 'rest' typical of mid-season, to achieve victory in the Club World Cup. Trent Alexander-Arnold seems willing to make that double sacrifice a reality to play as soon as possible with the Real Madrid jersey... while the white club hopes it is not too much to demand from the player. Because Trent Alexander-Arnold could well 'regret' signing for Real Madrid, given what he has to lose if he wants to play the Club World Cup, and change his mind. Such a decision would be catastrophic for the short-term future of the first team, because it has relied on one of the most critical positions on a footballer who would arrive as a free agent. For now, Real Madrid is prepared to receive Trent Alexander-Arnold between June 1 and 10.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Labourers are already dying from preventable workplace accidents in the country, according to Human Rights Watch and FairSquare which have both published reports today. Many such deaths are wrongly classified as having occurred due to natural causes and the families of workers are not compensated, the reports say. "The 2034 Saudi World Cup will be the largest and most expensive ever, but it could also have the highest cost in human lives, as millions of migrant workers build infrastructure, including 11 new stadiums, a rail and transit network, and 185,000 hotel rooms," Minky Worden, director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said. FIFA – football's global governing body - says it has a "steadfast commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in the context of its operations." Data on migrant deaths is hard to come by in a country where human rights groups have very limited access and labour unions are banned. But Human Rights Watch interviewed the families of 31 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal who fell from heights, were crushed or decapitated by heavy machinery or were electrocuted. Heat is another major concern, as Saudi Arabia ramps up construction work in preparation for hosting the 2034 tournament. In March, a Pakistani foreman, Muhammad Arshad, was reported to have fallen from a construction site at a stadium being built in the eastern city of Al Khobar – the first death related to the World Cup. Last year, the Saudi government said that there had been "tangible achievements" in occupational health and safety, with rates of deaths and injuries decreasing. FIFA also praised "significant steps" taken by Saudi Arabia to reform its labour laws since 2018. But the global construction worker's union, BWI, said there had been an "alarming rise" in accidents that could have been prevented. "Hundreds of thousands of young men, many of whom have young families, are being pitched into a labour system that poses a serious risk to their lives, a medical system that doesn't have the capacity to determine the cause of their deaths, and a political system that doesn't appear to either protect them or find out how they died, let alone compensate the families shattered by Saudi Arabia's negligence," FairSquare co-director James Lynch said. He described FIFA's human rights policies as a "sham." "While FIFA praises Saudi Arabia to the rafters and highly-paid western law firms generate vast profits for curating Saudi's reputation, children in places like Nepal grow up without their fathers and never even learn how they died, he said." FIFA told Human Rights Watch that it plans to establish a workers' welfare system dedicated to mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms for World Cup-related construction and service delivery in Saudi Arabia. In a letter it said: "We are convinced that the measures implemented to ensure construction companies respect the rights of their workers on FIFA World Cup sites can set a new standard for worker protection in the country and contribute to the wider labour reform process, helping to enhance protections for workers on World Cup sites and beyond." But Human Rights Watch said no further details were provided on how the welfare system would work.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The scathing criticism of world football's governing body is detailed in two new reports on migrant-worker deaths in the Gulf state published on Tuesday by FairSquare and Human Rights Watch (HRW). And they come a day after FIFA boss Gianni Infantino accompanied U.S. President Donald Trump on visit to Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, where they met the Gulf state's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The research, which is based on investigations into the recent deaths of 48 migrant workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal, paints a picture of a host nation that still pays lip service to safety on building sites, has no interest in properly investigating accidents and is painfully slow to compensate bereaved families. “The gruesome workplace accidents killing migrant workers in Saudi Arabia should be a huge red flag for businesses, football fans and sports associations seeking to partner with FIFA on the 2034 Men's World Cup and other Saudi ‘giga-projects',” said HRW's deputy Middle East director Michael Page. The HRW study includes accounts of workers dying in awful accidents but also dropping dead due to heat exhaustion. The families of these men are usually left with no information about what really happened and often face long delays in repatriating the bodies of their loved ones or in receiving any financial compensation. “Millions of workers are going to be pitched into this system,” said FairSquare's founding co-director Nick McGeehan. “The inevitable result is there will be a surge in deaths in construction and most of those of deaths will be unexplained. FIFA's response to the risks was amateurish, and that's being kind. They gave Saudi Arabia's bid the highest score of any they had received with scant regard to any of the very obvious risks. At the time that felt like quite a bold claim but it now it just feels like a statement of the obvious.” As part of its bid for the world's biggest sports event, Saudi Arabia has committed to building 11 new stadiums, eight of which it is yet to start, 134 training facilities, 185,000 new hotel rooms, fan zones, conference centres and a railway between Riyadh and Jeddah. Saudi Arabia's bid team did not respond to a request for comment from The Athletic but FIFA shared with us the letter it sent to HRW from its general secretary Mattias Grafstrom. The letter, which was sent last month, lists the steps FIFA has taken in recent years to integrate human-rights commitment into its statutes and points out that Saudi Arabia has “been investing heavily in the development of its society and economy”, efforts that have been helped and encouraged by western companies and governments. Grafstrom, who is preparing for FIFA's 2025 Congress in Paraguay this week, continues by noting the various steps the Saudi government has taken to reform its labour laws since 2018, such as abolishing parts of the kafala system which ties workers to their employers, and introducing standardised workers' contracts. “It is against this background that the FIFA Congress composed of all its 211 member associations has awarded the FIFA World Cup 2034 to Saudi Arabia,” he wrote. FairSquare and HRW, however, are far from convinced and have called on FIFA to demand that the Saudis make four seemingly straightforward commitments: In a briefing with journalists to explain their reports, FairSquare and HRW were joined by Ambet Yuson, general secretary of Builders' and Wood Workers International (BWI), a global federation of construction workers' trade unions from 111 countries. Earlier this year, the BWI filed a forced labour complaint against Saudi Arabia at the ILO on behalf of 21,000 migrant workers who are still owed unpaid wages by two bankrupt Saudi construction firms. Qatar, on the other hand, did allow him and his colleagues to make visits. Based in North West England, Matt Slater is a senior football news reporter for The Athletic UK.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two reports published today catalogue ‘gruesome yet avoidable accidents' on construction sites despite the Gulf kingdom's claims that work-related deaths have fallen Thousands of migrant workers are likely to die in Saudi Arabia as a result of a building boom fuelled by the 2034 Men's World Cup and other major construction projects, human rights groups have warned. “While Fifa praises Saudi Arabia to the rafters,” he said, “children in places like Nepal grow up without their fathers and never even learn how they died.” In a separate report on migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Fifa of “knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost”. The HRW report documented a catalogue of deaths caused by “gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents” in Saudi Arabia, including by decapitation, electrocution and falls from height, leaving the families of victims devastated and impoverished. Under Saudi law, when a worker dies in the course of their job their family members should receive compensation from a government insurance scheme or directly from the employer. Many deaths may be misclassified as “natural” when it is likely they are linked directly or indirectly to the working and living conditions faced by workers. That view is supported by a 2019 study by a Saudi pathologist, who examined all death certificates from a hospital in Riyadh between 1997 and 2016 and found that in every case the cause of death was “either incorrect or absent” and that in 75% of cases there was no cause of death provided at all. This work involves a close collaboration with its Saudi counterparts and engagements with relevant international labour organisations … we are convinced that measures implemented … can set a new standard for worker protection.” The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development in Saudi Arabia was approached for comment.</p>
