                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Project Pine demonstrated that central banks can effectively implement monetary policies using blockchain-based smart contracts in tokenized asset environments. It comes against a backdrop where tokenization — the digital representation of money and securities — has emerged as an innovation reshaping global financial markets, with major players launching tokenized money market products. In many ways, it's no longer a question of when blockchain technology will go mainstream across financial services. It's becoming a question of when regulations will catch up for its use. But when, or even if, cryptocurrency policy frameworks are brought to life, many observers from the traditional financial space are asking: what happens next — and how do any resultant fiscal policies get implemented across on-chain and tokenized asset environments? After all, traditional monetary policy tools may struggle to operate efficiently in tokenized markets without adopting new technology. To study this, Project Pine built a flexible toolkit prototype for central banks using smart contracts, which are blockchain-based computer programs that execute financial transactions automatically once predefined conditions are met. The findings come against a backdrop where major traditional players have already announced plans to register money market funds on blockchains, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said Monday (May 12) that it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Read also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks' Tokenization Projects The mainstream integration of tokenized financial infrastructures could mark a profound shift in how assets are traded, managed and regulated. Tokenization transforms assets including real estate, commodities, stocks, bonds and even intellectual property into blockchain-based digital tokens. The New York Fed's primary ambition with Project Pine was straightforward yet critical: to demonstrate how central banks could practically and effectively use smart contracts to manage monetary policy within tokenized financial infrastructures. Tokenization effectively bridges traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets, which can create new hybrid opportunities. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” “By bringing U.S. Treasuries on-chain, we are providing investors with a secure, transparent, and liquid tool for cash management, further integrating digital assets into mainstream financial markets,” VanEck Director of Digital Assets Product Kyle DaCruz said in the announcement. Read more: Crypto's Institutional Future Could Hinge on Solving the Risk Puzzle The resulting system, built on a permissioned blockchain platform using Hyperledger Besu and Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, specifically sought to address central banks' unique operational needs. Each of these tools utilized ERC-20 tokens — widely accepted digital standards — to represent money and securities. This toolkit allows the central bank to swiftly alter monetary policy conditions, such as interest rates or collateral requirements, directly through smart contracts. For instance, during a simulated market crisis, the toolkit demonstrated rapid response capabilities by automatically adjusting collateral haircuts, managing collateral substitutions and deploying new emergency facilities, all in real time. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says he's prioritizing developing new regulations for crypto asset issuance, custody and trading. A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” In terms of issuance, Atkins says he will direct SEC officials to draft “clear and sensible guidelines” for distributions of crypto assets that are securities or subject to an investment contract. “I have asked the Commission staff to consider whether additional guidance, registration exemptions, and safe harbors are needed to create pathways for crypto asset issuances within the United States. “It is important to provide clarity on the types of custodians that qualify as a ‘qualified custodian' under the Advisers Act and Investment Company Act, as well as reasonable exceptions from the qualified custody requirements to accommodate certain common practices within crypto asset markets. Additionally, the new SEC chair says he supports broker-dealers that want to offer securities and non-securities trading and other financial services all in the same app. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technology evolves every day, while student curricula don't. Important political voices are shaping the general opinion on crypto and blockchain. Statements about potentially including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the national reserve contribute to drastic market fluctuations and leave the industry uncertain. Universities and education systems are lagging behind in educating students about financial opportunities. Many students are already calling for better educational programs on campus. Studies show that gambling is becoming a more popular form of entertainment in the US. While technology advances, the potential risk of cyberattacks is also growing, leaving many worried about handling money online. This is where blockchain technology becomes relevant: Since blockchain operates with a decentralized system, meaning that there is not a single person or entity overseeing transactions, it promises better security measures and builds trust between companies and customers. Students who enjoy entertainment like online gambling and sports betting are increasingly interested in payment options based on blockchain. When evaluating platforms that support cryptocurrencies, BetOnline and Bovada often come up in comparison. While preferences are subjective, a detailed breakdown of how BetOnline measures up to Bovada in terms of payments, bonuses, and user experience can help make an informed decision on which features best fit students' needs. Considering the rising popularity of technology-based entertainment and the fact that transactions today are almost exclusively conducted online, many agree that crypto knowledge should be common sense. To really prepare students for their future outside of campus, many argue that crypto and financial education should be part of the curriculum. In January 2025, Bitcoin experienced major fluctuations, which also led back to these events. Considering the rising value of cryptocurrencies, they can be a smart alternative to traditional investment and payment methods. Because blockchain isn't regulated by any government or bank, it offers better security. Blockchain creates a record of every transaction with a time stamp that can't be changed, which rules out unauthorized access and the possibility of fraud. Additionally, the data is stored across multiple networks, which makes it almost impossible to hack. Blockchain technology also limits privacy concerns since user data is stored anonymously. Compared to conventional investment methods like stocks and funds, investing in cryptocurrencies can be more lucrative. Of course, a stock fund, too, can be lucrative, but it will take several years to grow. To make informed decisions, education on these topics is crucial. Additionally, banks often charge high transaction fees while crypto payment doesn't. According to TripleA, the number of people owning crypto is growing worldwide. They estimated the global market penetration to reach 6.8% with more than 560 million people owning crypto by 2024. Of course, this fast-developing industry poses challenges for many sectors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of choppy action and bearish sentiment, bulls are clearly back in control. ETH has reclaimed several key levels with conviction, signaling a potential continuation toward higher targets. Price action now looks structurally bullish, with Ethereum pushing through resistance zones that previously capped upside for weeks. This rally has reignited investor confidence and brought renewed attention to Ethereum's medium-term outlook, especially as altcoins start to show strength alongside Bitcoin's recent consolidation. This level, derived from pricing bands, now defines Ethereum's current trading range and will likely dictate price direction in the coming sessions. With volatility returning and sentiment improving, Ethereum appears poised for a critical breakout or a decisive retest of support, depending on how bulls handle the next leg. This explosive move has not only flipped sentiment from bearish to bullish, but also reignited speculation around a broader altseason — a period in which altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. After months of heavy selling pressure that began in late December, Ethereum is now showing sustained strength for the first time. Market participants are watching closely to see if Ethereum can maintain this pace and confirm a longer-term trend reversal. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared Ethereum's MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, offering a clear technical framework for what's next. According to the data, the next key resistance level is at $3,100 — a region that could act as a short-term ceiling if buying pressure fades. As Ethereum continues to climb, these levels will become increasingly important. For now, ETH remains in a bullish structure, supported by growing volume, on-chain signals, and renewed investor enthusiasm. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,604, consolidating after a sharp surge that lifted it from under $1,400 to a high of $2,725 in just two weeks. This zone also coincides with recent local highs from early February, making it a critical area to break for further upside continuation. This is a positive sign for trend reversal after months of sustained bearish pressure. However, today's pullback signals that bulls are losing some steam as the price tests this crucial resistance. On the downside, maintaining support above $2,435–$2,450 is essential to avoid a deeper correction. The coming days will reveal whether Ethereum can turn this consolidation into a true breakout or if further cooling is needed before the next leg up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. A positive shift in the MACD histogram is interpreted as a transition from bearish to bullish momentum and is widely considered a buy signal by traders. BTC's weekly chart MACD has crossed above zero, indicating a renewed bullish momentum. The latest bullish signal follows bitcoin's bounce from the 50-week simple moving average (SMA), replicating patterns observed in mid-2024 and early 2023. On both occasions, BTC subsequently experienced strong rallies. Note how the MACD flipped positive in the second half of October, warning of a big move higher. The latest signal is consistent with the bullish macro picture and analysts' calls for a rally to higher levels. Early this week, Standard Chartered said that institutional adoption and investment lows could lift bitcoin as high as $200K. In a report shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday, analysts at Bitfinex said BTC is evolving into a global macro reserve asset and could rise to $150K-$180K in 2025-26.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks. Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market's 15.25% gain. The strong recovery in Ethereum's crypto market share has pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI) to its most overbought zone since May 2021, raising red flags for traders betting on further upside, at least in the short term. Historically, such extreme RSI levels on ETH.D have marked the beginning of major pullbacks. One notable instance occurred in early July 2024, when ETH dominance peaked near similar RSI levels. This resistance level has repeatedly capped Ethereum's dominance during previous recovery attempts. Previous overbought pullbacks have initially pushed Ethereum's market share toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave). The ETH.D metric, therefore, risks declining toward its current 50-day EMA support at around 8.24% by June, suggesting potential capital rotation out of Ethereum markets to other coins in the coming weeks. On the four-hour ETH/USD chart, a classic bearish divergence is emerging, where Ethereum's price continues to print higher highs, but momentum indicators trend lower. Crypto trader AlphaBTC noted that ETH is showing “three clear drives of divergence,” a setup often preceding trend exhaustion. He added that key Fibonacci levels align with potential support zones, suggesting a pullback could be imminent. Independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests ETH's decline in the coming weeks could serve as a “buy-the-dip opportunity,” indicating that the cryptocurrency would eventually climb over $3,500.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum leads the broader crypto market rally with a 9% gain, reaching $2,700, while other altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin show 4-10% increases. Altcoins are showing major strength once again in today's broader crypto market rally as Ethereum leads with over 9% gains, moving all the way to $2,700. Market analysts have already started predicting the start of a full-blown altcoin season. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are abuzz as a key market signal has reappeared, sparking hopes of an incoming altseason. The last time this pattern emerged during the 2021 bull run, altcoins surged by an astonishing 28,000% with investors minting heavy returns. Now, in 2025, the same setup has materialized, fueling speculation of a repeat performance. On the other hand, Bitcoin seems to have entered a strong consolidation period as BTC price continues to flirt around $103,500 levels. In the meantime; #Altcoins are significantly breaking out and continuing their momentum. Ethereum price is up by another 9% today, trading at $2,690 levels, while extending its weekly gains to more than 45%. The recent ETH-BTC pair upside screams for a major rally moving ahead. Market analysts believe that once ETH price claims $3,000, it will set the stage for the next leg of rally to $4,000 and beyond. On the other hand, Ripple's XRP is up 3.5% to $2.58 resistance levels, with its weekly gains standing above 20%. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports that XRP faces no significant resistance clusters ahead, suggesting the potential for further upward momentum. On-chain data indicates that the key support level to monitor is at $2.38, which could serve as a strong foundation for XRP's price stability. On-chain data shows $XRP has no major resistance clusters ahead, while the key support zone to watch sits at $2.38. If altcoin/BTC pairs show resilience, Bitcoin dominance could test range lows near 60%, presenting opportunities for altcoins to capitalize on the momentum. If BTC Dominance were to grind back to the highs then I think it's safe to say this was just a big squeeze on ETH/BTC and alts and BTC takes the spotlight back for a while.

The Bank of France is actively testing Ripple's private ledger for a potential Euro CBDC. This trial signifies strong institutional validation for Ripple's blockchain technology in the EU. Ripple's readily available ledger gives it a potential first-mover advantage in the global CBDC race. A recent academic study from Ulster University has revealed that the Bank of France is officially testing Ripple's private ledger as a foundation for a Euro-based Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The update was shared on X by crypto analyst WrathofKahneman, marking what appears to be the first confirmed trial of Ripple's blockchain for a national CBDC in France. According to Kahneman, the findings show that Ripple's private ledger is currently undergoing active testing by the Bank of France. This positions Ripple as a serious contender in the fast-evolving race to provide blockchain infrastructure for government-issued digital currencies. As more governments explore blockchain-backed currencies, France's involvement is especially significant due to its influence as a leading member of the European Union. Ripple's ready-to-deploy solution gives it an advantage over other platforms that are still in development. Ripple's quiet entry into CBDC testing in France might just be the beginning of something much bigger. As central banks around the world look for trusted partners to power the future of money, Ripple is positioning itself as a key player in the next phase of digital finance. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS ― French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau is organizing an emergency meeting with cryptocurrency entrepreneurs in the country to discuss their security after a brazen kidnapping attempt on Tuesday. “I will be bringing together at Beauvau [France's interior ministry] the cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, there are a few in France, to work with them on their security, to make them aware of the risks, and to take together measures to protect them,” Retailleau said in an interview with French media Europe1/CNews Wednesday. On Tuesday, four people attempted to abduct a woman and her son off the street in broad daylight but were stopped thanks to the quick work of those nearby. Much of the ordeal, which took place in Paris' 11th arrondissement, was caught on camera. Ledger cofounder David Balland was abducted in January and the father of another crypto entrepreneur was kidnapped earlier this month. Retailleau said the assailants in the early May case also threatened to pierce their victim's knee with a drill. U.S. president's tariff threat will be a hot topic at this month's Cannes film festival. As U.S. productions flock overseas, Trump wants to target foreign moviemakers, opening a new front in the transatlantic trade war. The European Commission chief and the French president are trying to woo American researchers with a new program called “Choose Europe for Science.” German lawmaker Nils Schmid argues there is no need to open the subject as the U.S. has not said it would withdraw its nuclear umbrella.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a meeting of European Union finance ministers, Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe said there's been progress on legislation for the digital euro central bank digital currency (CBDC). Mr Donohoe said that the European Council (of governments), the Commission and Parliament have been working on a new draft and have made “good progress, but there are some areas that require further work.” MiCAR restricts the scale of foreign currency stablecoin usage and gives authorities intervention powers if monetary sovereignty is threatened. However, from the early days a key digital euro motivation of the European Central Bank (ECB) has been to reduce retail payment dependence on foreign companies such as Visa and Mastercard. “We agreed again that this initiative is crucial, given the changing geopolitical landscape and the importance of diversification of strategically important payment systems,” said Mr Donohoe. The digital euro refers to a CBDC targeted at retail users. During 2024 the European Central Bank, Eurosystem and 64 institutions participated in trials of three wholesale DLT settlement solutions, including a wCBDC solution from the Banque de France, DL3S. In February this year, the ECB announced plans for an interim solution, with the aim of introducing a wholesale CBDC as a longer term solution. During a speech yesterday, Denis Beau, First Deputy Governor of the Banque de France, indicated that a wholesale CBDC will be launched first. He said, “Our first objective is to develop a wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) for use by market participants, followed by a CBDC for everyday retail payments (digital euro). Then, in the medium term, we need to develop a European unified ledger to modernise securities transactions.” He continued, “The US authorities' recent announcements in support of crypto-assets and stablecoins make it even more vital we complete this project, to maintain our monetary and financial sovereignty in the new world we are entering. Hence, it should be easier to roll out a wCBDC far quicker.</p>

Share your coffee stories with us by writing to info@comunicaffe.com. MILAN – According to data contained in the latest Coffee Market Report from the International Coffee Organization (ICO), world coffee exports remained stable in March. Exports of Colombian Milds increased by almost a third (24.1%) to reach 1.432 million bags. Other Milds also saw an increase in volumes (+9.7%), amounting to 2.655 million. Brazilian Naturals fell slightly to 3.792 million (-1.1%). Arabica exports increased by 3.3% to 42.298 million. Colombians Milds saw a strong leap forward (+20.4%), soaring to 8.056 million. Exports of Brazilian Naturals increased to 23.776 million (+2.8%). Conversely, there was a negative trend for Other Milds, which fell by 5.9% to 10.466 million. Robusta exports were 10% down to 25.433 million, compared to 28.263 million in the first half of CY 2023/24. In April, the ICO Composite Indicator Price (I-CIP) marked the second consecutive monthly decrease (-3.5%) to reach an average of 335.76 cents. On the Arabica side, Colombian Milds, Other Milds and Brazilian Naturals fell by 2.7%, 2.8% and 3.6% respectively. The New York indicator was down by 3.2%. It is interesting to observe the development of the daily price, which fluctuated between a low of 308.93 cents on 8 April (the lowest since 21 January) and a peak of 357.21 cents on 28 April. The ICO report particularly emphasises the fact the recovery in prices since 9 April was partly triggered by Trump Administration's decision to suspend tariffs for 90 days, which had a positive impact on the market mood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Dubai's Department of Finance signed a memorandum of agreement with Crypto.com, which allows individuals and business customers to pay government service fees using crypto. The move aligns with Dubai's Cashless Strategy, which aims to shift 90% of transactions in the public and private sectors to cashless by 2026. Meanwhile, Thailand's Ministry of Finance revealed on Tuesday that it will issue 5B baht worth of digital investment tokens in the next two months. Called the G-Token, it will allow the Thai government to raise funds while empowering citizens to join the country's digital economy, as they can purchase government bonds for as little as 100 baht. The increased adoption of digital tokens and cryptocurrencies by governments worldwide will also drive more individuals to use wallets to store their digital assets. By 2029, over two-thirds of the world's population is expected to own a digital wallet, with top crypto wallets like Best Wallet in a strong position to address this demand. Best Wallet is a crypto wallet that lets you buy, sell, and swap crypto within a constantly evolving DeFi ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An academic report by Professor Daniel Broby of Ulster University has reintroduced discussions around Ripple's involvement in the development of the digital euro CBDC. This comparison connected Ripple's private ledger to European CBDC experimentation. Ripple designed the ledger for central bank use cases, and it delivers 1,500 transactions per second, well above public blockchain options like Ethereum 2.0, and competing against Visa's capabilities. While the report does not suggest there is official adoption, its inclusion of Ripple's technology among CBDC test platforms by the Bank of France has brought renewed speculation over Ripple's potential involvement in the digital euro CBDC project. Yet, in assessing global CBDC efforts, Broby's included Ripple's private ledger. This mention arrives amid a series of earlier disclosures and community observations that have hinted at Ripple's involvement with the European Central Bank's digital euro project. By June 2024, Ripple CBDC advisor Antony Welfare publicly highlighted key components of the digital euro project, including progress on privacy, offline transaction capabilities, and standardized rules. Additionally, several posts on X from last year claimed that the Central Bank of France had praised Ripple's infrastructure. However, despite these signals and indirect acknowledgments, no formal confirmation has been issued by either Ripple or European monetary authorities that Ripple's technology is officially selected or integrated into the digital euro's development. Nonetheless, Ripple's involvement in other CBDC projects has been clear. In 2021, Bhutan's Royal Monetary Authority launched a CBDC pilot on Ripple's private ledger. That same year, Ripple partnered with the government of Palau to explore a USD-backed stablecoin. More recently, Colombia's central bank began testing Ripple's ledger for financial use cases, while in 2023, Ripple announced CBDC pilot collaborations with both the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Central Bank of Montenegro.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) continue to show strength as the broader crypto market sustains its bullish momentum. Bitcoin faced resistance at around $105,000 on Sunday, declining by 2% until the next day. However, BTC recovers slightly on Tuesday and retests the $105,000 level. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades down to around $103,600. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 69, slipping below its overbought level of 70 and pointing downwards, indicating a weakening bullish momentum. If the RSI continues to decline and moves below the neutral level of 50, it would lead to a sharp fall in Bitcoin prices. Ethereum price retested and found support around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $2,436 on Monday and rallied 7.38% the next day. If the 200-day EMA at $2,436 continues to hold as support, it could extend the rally to retest its key psychological level at $3,000. However, traders should be cautious as the chances of a pullback are high due to its overbought condition. If XRP continues its upward trend and closes above its daily resistance at $2.72, it could trigger a rally toward the psychological $3.00 barrier. However, the RSI on the daily chart reads 66, rejecting from its overbought levels at 70 on Tuesday, indicating fading bullish momentum. Conversely, if XRP faces a pullback, it could extend the correction toward its 50-day EMA at $2.26. The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains. Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency. Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

Ripple's price trades broadly stable at around $2.60 on Wednesday, upholding the recent bullish trend as crypto markets cheer amid improved sentiment. An increase in exposure to XRP among the whales, especially those holding more than 10 million XRP, could accelerate the rally. The technical breakout, eyeing almost a 60% increase to $0.000034, is part of a broader bullish wave in the cryptocurrency market, accentuated by high risk-on sentiment. Ukraine-Russia negotiations in Istanbul this week could act as a bullish catalyst for risk assets, including BTC, if talks bear fruit. Monero price extends its gains for a seventh consecutive day on Wednesday, trading above $340 for the first time since August 2021. Bitcoin price stabilizes around $103,000 on Friday after rallying nearly 10% this week. Risk-on sentiment prevails as Trump announced a trade deal with the UK and ahead of the meeting with China this weekend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum rallied nearly 50% to over $2,700 after the Pectra upgrade and is now around 6% below what it held when Eric Trump publicly promoted the asset, TradingView data shows. The president's son voiced bullish sentiment toward Ethereum in a Feb. 3 post, tweeting, “In my opinion, it's a great time to add $ETH. His post came on the heels of a market-wide selloff tied to President Trump's tariff proposal, during which Ether lost more than 15% over February 2 and 3, bottoming out at around $2,300 at the time. Despite brief recoveries, the downturn intensified amid mounting fears of escalating trade tensions and inflation, following Trump's early April announcement of sweeping tariffs. On April 7, Ether briefly fell below $1,400—its lowest level since November 2023. The current price rally is fueled by the activation of the Pectra upgrade on May 7, renewed bullish sentiment driven by positive developments in US-China trade relations, and rising institutional accumulation. Pectra introduces a suite of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to enhance staking efficiency, wallet usability, and layer 2 scalability. This helps lay critical groundwork for Ethereum's next phase of network growth. On the institutional front, UK-based investment firm Abraxas Capital has acquired 211,030 ETH, valued at approximately $477 million, over the past six days, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Ethereum has again exceeded Alibaba and Coca-Cola in market capitalization to rank as the 33rd most valuable asset, after its price jumped over 40% in five days post-Pectra upgrade, CompaniesMarketcap data shows. On Monday, the second-largest crypto asset briefly overtook Alibaba with a market cap of $308 billion, but the Chinese tech giant regained the lead after its stock surged roughly 6%, lifting Alibaba's market cap to over $317 billion, per Market Watch data.</p>
