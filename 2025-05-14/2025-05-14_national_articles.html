                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump‘s first foreign trip of his second term is underway. The exclusion of America's historic Middle Eastern ally from Trump's itinerary is a marked example of Trump's declining sympathy for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. In contrast, Trump appears ecstatic at his evolving relationship with Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff, and others, insist that there is no daylight between Trump and Netanyahu. But this rhetoric plainly doesn't stand up to reality. But there are also more specific examples of Trump and Netanyahu being in disagreement. For a start, Israel is manifestly opposed to Trump's diplomatic effort to secure a new nuclear agreement with Iran. Instead, Netanyahu, supportive Washington think tanks, and some Republican allies have pushed for immediate joint U.S.-Israeli military action to degrade Iran's nuclear infrastructure. And even if there is little reason to think it possible, Trump seems to believe a nuclear deal will facilitate a broader political rapprochement with Iran. Israel is similarly concerned about Trump's recent agreement with the Yemen-based Houthi rebels. In return for the Houthis' suspending strikes on U.S. and commercial vessels in the Red Sea, Trump has ended U.S. military action against them. Still, the Houthis are continuing to launch ballistic missile attacks on Israel. Then, there's Israel's confrontation with Hamas in Gaza. Today, Trump is increasingly comfortable pursuing negotiations with Hamas independent of Israel. That led to this week's release by Hamas of dual American Israeli citizen Edan Alexander. The Times of Israel reports that the Trump administration told Hamas that it would pressure Israel to agree to a 90-day ceasefire/10 hostage release deal in return for Alexander's freedom. Trump's recent social media posts also suggest he wants an end to Israel's war against Hamas. The prime minister has an obvious moral interest in imposing maximal damage on Hamas following its Oct. 7, 2023, atrocity. This issue-centric discord is exacerbated by Israel's inability to match the Sunni Arab monarchies in dangling financial investments to earn Trump's favor. Qatar used Trump's visit to announce $243 billion in new U.S. defense, energy, and technology contracts. The figure includes a vast aircraft purchase from Boeing, following Qatar's earlier offer to Trump of a $250 million jet to replace the aging Air Force One aircraft. Lubricating these investments is an Arab pageantry of extraordinary scale and opulence. From red carpet ceremonies to mobile McDonald's restaurants, Salman has spared no effort in treating Trump as American royalty. Salman and his fellow monarchs in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain recognize that the surest way to win Trump's favor is twofold: by investing heavily in the U.S. and flattering Trump's person. Salman also hopes Trump will then pressure American businesses to support the crown prince's modernization project to turn Saudi Arabia into a world-leading center for entertainment, tourism, and business investment. And far more than other American presidents, Trump tends to view foreign policy through the prism of immediate transactional opportunities rather than that of historic partnerships. Former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush would likely all be far more reticent to tolerate Qatar's funding of various jihadist groups were they in power in 2025. This limits Netanyahu's ability to earn Trump's unique favor from acts such as Israel's elimination last year of numerous terrorists responsible for killing Americans. At the same time, Netanyahu has risked Trump's anger by conducting Israeli intelligence operations on U.S. soil and by sharing high-end Israeli technology with China. But by Trump's establishing a new relationship with Sharaa, Israel will have to consider U.S. interests before taking future military action. This is a complicating rather than complementary U.S. intervention into Israeli-Syrian relations. Netanyahu will fear that Trump's Arab agenda may now lead to escalating pressure to end Israel's military action in Gaza. Or perhaps even Trump's unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state, a key ask of Salman in return for his willingness to join the Abraham Accords. But it's clear that the Arabs are getting far more access to and impact on Trump's open ear than Israel would like.</p>

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of Badar Khan Suri, the Georgetown University postdoctoral researcher detained by immigration officials in March for allegedly spreading propaganda in support of Hamas. Federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles issued her order from the bench during a court hearing in Virginia, saying that the government presented no evidence to refute Suri's claims that he was being punished for his views on the war in Gaza. Suri, who is married to an American citizen, was being held in federal detention in Texas following his arrest. Suri, an Indian national in the U.S. on a student visa, was accused of "actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media," a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said in a statement in March. Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown University, was arrested by ICE on Monday over allegations claiming that he spread Hamas propaganda on social media. "Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas," the DHS statement continued. DHS did not name the suspected terrorist or Hamas advisor. Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined on March 15 that Suri's activities and presence in the U.S. "rendered him deportable" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the senior official said. The act is a rarely used legal statute that gives Rubio sweeping power to deport those who pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States." Secretary of State Marco Rubio rendered Badar Khan Suri "deportable" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a senior DHS official said in March. Suri was duly granted a visa to enter the U.S. to perform doctoral research on peace building in Iraq and Afghanistan, a Georgetown University spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News following his March arrest.

A former Michigan Army National Guard member was arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting at a military base on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, 19, was taken into custody Tuesday after he traveled to an area near the U.S. Army's Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) facility at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, and "launched his drone in support of the attack plan," officials said. "I recommend everyone have about seven magazines because you don't want to be in there and run out of ammo," Said allegedly told an undercover FBI agent in the leadup to the foiled plot, according to a criminal complaint. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years per count if convicted. Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, of Melvinville, Mich., was arrested on Tuesday, May 13, for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired attack at the Tank-Army Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) in Warren, shown right. "This defendant is charged with planning a deadly attack on a U.S. military base here at home for ISIS," Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement. The Justice Department said that in April, "two undercover officers indicated they intended to carry out Said's plan at the direction of ISIS" and "in response, Said provided material assistance to the attack plan, including providing armor-piercing ammunition and magazines for the attack, flying his drone over TACOM to conduct operational reconnaissance, training the undercover employees on firearms and the construction of Molotov cocktails for use during the attack, and planning numerous details of the attack including how to enter TACOM and which building to target." Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said is seen posing in front of an ISIS flag, according to the Justice Department. The criminal complaint stated that around June 2024, Said started communicating with an undercover FBI agent whom he had thought was a fellow ISIS supporter. "During the course of their interactions, which were audio- and/or video-recorded, Said described his longstanding desire to engage in violent jihad, either by traveling to ISIS-held territory abroad or by carrying out an attack in the United States," the complaint said. "On July 18, 2024, FBI agents executed a search warrant for Said's iPhone by performing a covert search of that device... when SAID provided it to personnel with the Michigan Army National Guard prior to boarding a military aircraft. During that search, FBI agents identified a Facebook message exchange (in Arabic) that took place on or about October 5, 2023, between Said and another Facebook user located in the Palestinian territories," the complaint continued. "In that Facebook message exchange, Said stated, ‘I want to go for Jihad,' and the other Facebook user replied, ‘Talk to me on Telegram.' Agents also determined during the search that Said was a member of multiple channels in the encrypted messaging application Telegram, one of which contained videos and images with ISIS flags," it also said. He later reported to the Michigan Army National Guard Taylor Armory before being discharged around December 2024. Greg Norman is a reporter at Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Equipment sits inside the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant, which processes water for much of New Hanover County in Wilmington, N.C., Monday, April 28, 2025. Water is processed through carbon filters inside large reservoirs designed to remove a forever chemical, known as PFAS at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington, N.C., Monday, April 28, 2025. Vials containing samples of forever chemicals, known as PFAS, sit in a tray, April 10, 2024, at a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lab in Cincinnati. The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some “forever chemicals” in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones. The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and don't easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people. Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply. “We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. Vials containing samples of forever chemicals, known as PFAS, sit in a tray, April 10, 2024, at a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lab in Cincinnati. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones. “With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules. Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals. Water is processed through carbon filters inside large reservoirs designed to remove a forever chemical, known as PFAS at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington, N.C., Monday, April 28, 2025. Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources. The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. “This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm. Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS. “You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said. Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits. “This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again' but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? About 30 million people in the United States, aged 12 and older, have hearing loss in both ears, and about two-thirds of people end up with hearing loss, which can range from mild to severe, by their 70s. But talking to your parents or grandparents about getting hearing aids can be tough — I've done it. They might not like the idea of sticking things in their ear canals or confronting the difficult realities of aging and health. They surely shy away from the price tag of hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars and are not covered by insurance or Medicare. But plugging tiny and exorbitantly expensive speakers into your ears isn't the only way. Your mom might already own hearing aids without even knowing it. Hearing aids have never been more accessible — or futuristic. In April, a company called Nuance started selling glasses that double as hearing aids thanks to microphones and beam-forming speakers built into the frame. Although at $1,200, they're not cheap, they cost far less than a pair of prescription hearing aids, which tend to range from $2,000 to $7,000. The Nuance glasses joined an increasingly crowded market of FDA-regulated over-the-counter hearing aids that includes everything from the latest Apple AirPods Pro, which gained the capability through a software update, to bean-sized buds from Sony. Hearing aids have never been more accessible — or futuristic. You can also buy something that's legally considered a personal sound amplification product (PSAP), which is not designed to treat hearing loss but does make things louder. Some of them can play music and handle phone calls too. In the age when earbuds are ubiquitous, these devices appeal to all ages. “It's good that we're seeing people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, talking about it, because it's totally changing the paradigm for them of engaging in hearing care earlier,” Nicholas Reed, a faculty member at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told me. I learned to read lips as a teenager and avoid conversations at loud parties in college. Some surgery in my 20s brought me closer to normal, but I could still use a little help. And while the Nuance glasses don't currently offer the option to stream audio, they do help you hear what your friend is saying in a loud bar. The AirPods Pro 2, which retail for $250, work equally as well. After Apple announced last fall that a software update would unlock an accessibility setting — it's appropriately called Hearing Aid — I started using it all the time, toggling between listening to podcasts to ordering cold brew in a crowded coffee shop. In instances where I may have needed to ask people to repeat themselves in the past, I hear them fine the first time. If you've ever been to a busy restaurant with your parents or grandparents, you know this can be alienating for the person left out and frustrating for the hearing person, too. Nevertheless, neither traditional clinical hearing aids or the newer category of devices are easy fixes. You can't put them in your ears and immediately have perfect hearing. Your brain adjusts over time, and so it may take weeks or months to adapt to the new frequencies hearing aids help you hear. “It's something that's vital to your existence and how you connect with other people.” Even though over-the-counter hearing aids have been available since 2022, when the FDA implemented new regulations for the devices, it's still an uphill battle to get people to wear them. “We are not seeing large increases in hearing aid uptake since over-the-counter hearing aids have become available,” said Tricia Ashby, senior director of audiology practices at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). “And I have to say that mimics other countries who had over-the-counter hearing aids before the US did.” Given the fact that the older people who need them most are potentially less likely to try the latest technology, it might still take a few years for over-the-counter hearing aids to go mainstream. Given the precedent set by companies like Apple and Nuance, though, it's possible that more devices will add hearing assistive features to existing products. You can imagine a future where you wear earbuds that are the interface for your voice assistant as well as your lifeline on a loud plane.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he will order the “cessation of sanctions against Syria to give them a fresh start,” and move to normalize relations with its new government. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said there is a “possibility” he will attend the Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Turkey on Thursday. Trump told reporters on Air Force 1 on his way to Doha that he does not know if Russia President Vladimir Putin will show up to the talks. US President Donald Trump opened his four-day Middle East trip on Tuesday by paying a visit to Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for talks on U.S. efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, end the war in Gaza, hold down oil prices and more.

DOHA, Qatar (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday he urgently wants “to make a deal” with Iran to wind down its nuclear program but Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the Mideast as part of any potential agreement. Trump, who is in the midst of a three-country visit to the region, also discussed Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program in one-on-one talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. But in comments earlier in the day, at a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting hosted by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump made clear he expected Tehran to end its role as the chief financial backer of the militant groups. Iran “must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons,” Trump told the GCC leaders. Al Thani did not directly address the Iran issue after his session with Trump in Doha. The two leaders, and others from their respective delegations, signed a series of agreements, including one between U.S. aircraft company Boeing and Qatar Airways. The U.S. and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month, and Trump has said he believes brokering a nuclear deal is possible but that the window is closing. Trump said that he also believed the moment was ripe “for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists.” Hezbollah is severely weakened after its war last year with Israel in which much of its top leadership was killed, and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a conduit for Iran to send arms. Trump met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a face-to-face engagement with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by U.S. forces after being captured in Iraq. Trump agreed to meet al-Sharaa at the end of his stay in Saudi Arabia. Al-Sharaa was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, stormed Damascus and ended the 54-year rule of the Assad family. Trump said he decided to meet with al-Sharaa after being encouraged to do so by Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He also pledged to lift yearslong sanctions on Syria. Trump told reporters that the meeting with al-Sharaa went “great” and described him as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past.” “He's got a real shot at holding it together,” Trump said. Prince Mohammed joined Trump and al-Sharaa for the meeting, which lasted 33 minutes. He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq. Al-Sharaa returned to his home country of Syria after the conflict began in 2011 and led al-Qaida's branch called the Nusra Front. He changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and cut links with al-Qaida. The sanctions go back to the rule of Bashar Assad, who was ousted in December, and were intended to inflict major pain on his economy. In Qatar, Trump was greeted at the airport by Al Thani. Air Force One was escorted by Qatari F-15 jets as it neared Doha, the capital city. Al Thani said he had high hopes for Trump's efforts with Iran and at ending the war in Gaza. “I know that you are a man of peace,” said Al Thani, who later on Wednesday was to honor Trump with a state dinner. Qatar, like the other Gulf Arab states, is an autocratic nation where political parties are banned and speech is tightly controlled. Trump has defended the idea even as critics argue it would amount to a president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government.</p>

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Over the last decade, plant-based meat has gotten a lot more meaty. Dozens of startups have launched in recent years to develop more realistic-tasting burgers, nuggets, and sausages as an alternative to factory farmed meat, which causes billions of animals to suffer terribly, pollutes our air and water, and accelerates climate change. Recently published data found a seven percent drop in plant-based meat retail dollar sales from 2023 to 2024 and an 11 percent drop in the number of products sold. To better understand what consumers really think about plant-based meat, a few months ago one organization conducted a huge blind taste test, which I recently covered: In December and January, Nectar — a nonprofit that conducts research on “alternative protein,” such as plant-based meat — brought together nearly 2,700 people in a first- and largest-of-its-kind blind taste test. Without knowing which version they were tasting, the participants tried 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, like burgers, hot dogs, and bacon, alongside one animal meat “benchmark” product per category. Each product was tested by at least 100 participants, who then rated them on texture, flavor, appearance, and overall enjoyment on a 7-point scale from “dislike very much” to “like very much.” The products were all served as part of a dish, like they'd be eaten in regular life — vegan meatballs were served with spaghetti, for example, and deli slices in a sandwich with fixings. While some of these products don't taste identical to meat when eaten on their own, when prepared in a meal, differences in taste become much less important. US plant-based meat companies have reliably churned out meat-free burgers for decades, in part because they're a beloved American staple, but also because ground beef is easier for food scientists to replicate than, say, a steak's complex fibrous structure. You can now find plant-based burgers at the vast majority of US grocery stores, and even at a lot of restaurants. They're among the easiest foods to make plant-based because chicken nuggets are already highly processed and bear little resemblance to whole chicken meat. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. But blind taste testers have a preference for two companies' products: Impossible Foods and Gardein, a Canadian company that's launched a number of delicious plant-based meat products over the years, which are widely available in the US. The only plant-based meatballs and hot dogs to win a Tasty award are made by — you guessed it — Impossible Foods. Its hot dogs are even good enough for Joey Chestnut, the world's top-ranking competitive eater, who signed an endorsement deal with the company in 2024. The list above only includes products available in the US, but a number of Nectar's winners appear to only be available in Europe: While a blind taste test is the best measurement of a plant-based meat's quality, I also want to share some of my personal favorites — and those from friends and fellow Vox colleagues — that didn't win a Tasty award but deserve the limelight just as much: If you can't find a product near you, or want to try something not widely available in the US, there are a number of online food retailers, like Vegan Essentials and Thrive Market, that carry specialty plant-based products. Nectar's blind taste test demonstrated that, overall, plant-based meat still has a long way to go to compete with animal meat on flavor, texture, price, and other attributes. But that so many of the plant-based products were rated just as good or better than their animal meat equivalents shows how far the industry has come in recent decades. In the years ahead, as the problems of our food system — animal cruelty, climate emissions, water pollution, and more — grow and worsen, its alternatives will improve. If we're lucky, they'll come to be seen less as substitutes and more as ethical, and tasty, options to satisfy humanity's desire for meat.

Collin County, Texas, DA Greg Willis discusses a judge reducing 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony's bond in the stabbing death case of Austin Metcalf on 'The Will Cain Show.' The teenager suspected of killing high school track star Austin Metcalf will be allowed to graduate from his Frisco, Texas, high school despite being charged with first-degree murder, according to a report. Students from that high school are set to graduate on May 22. "We are proud to share that Karmelo Anthony will graduate and receive his high school diploma, and that his academic achievements will not be disrupted," Next Generation Action Network (NGAN) President Dominique Alexander, a spokesman for Anthony's family, reportedly said. Karmelo Anthony, left, is charged with murdering Austin Metcalf, right. "NGAN has worked diligently alongside the Anthony family's legal team to bring about this fair and student-focused resolution," he said. Frisco ISD Superintendent Mike Waldrip addressed what he said were false rumors that Anthony would be able to attend the graduation ceremony. "Frisco ISD has learned that misinformation is being shared regarding Centennial High School's graduation via several media outlets and perpetuated through social media," he told WFAA. "It is disheartening that the incredible accomplishments and achievements of our Centennial seniors may be dampened by needless fearmongering, attention-seeking and media vitriol. No student who commits a serious criminal offense (Title V felony) is permitted to participate in the graduation ceremony. Additionally, anyone who trespasses on Frisco ISD property or at a District event will be subject to immediate removal and possible arrest by law enforcement," he said, adding that the school district does not condone violence. File photo of Austin Metcalf, a junior at Memorial High School in Frisco, who was stabbed in the chest, allegedly by 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony, a student-athlete from Frisco Centennial High School. "We work to ensure every student is safe to learn and feels part of our culture of respect, honor and integrity," he said. Anthony, now 18, is accused of stabbing and killing Metcalf over a dispute regarding Anthony's presence in the Memorial High School tent at the April 2 track meet. He and his supporters claim that he acted in self-defense, and that Metcalf pushed him out of the tent. That claim is tenuous, according to Julie Rendelman, a former homicide prosecutor from New York who now runs a private criminal defense firm. File photo of Jeff Metcalf with his son, Austin Metcalf, a junior at Memorial High School in Frisco, who was stabbed in the chest allegedly by 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony, a student-athlete from Frisco Centennial High School. "If the evidence is what it is right now, I think he's going to have an uphill battle claiming self-defense," she previously told Fox News Digital. "If the scenario is… that the victim told [Anthony] to leave, and then in some way physically touched him without more, then I'm not comfortable – I don't believe that a self-defense claim will work." Meanwhile, Alexander has compared Anthony to figures like Kyle Rittenhouse and Daniel Penny, who have won self-defense cases in criminal court. He also called Anthony's detractors bigots, in what has become a racially charged public discussion. Dominique Alexander of the Next Generation Action Network hosted a news conference on behalf of Karmelo Anthony's family on April 17. "Because these racist bigots try to prevent us from standing up for our baby, our boy, he should be afforded the same rights that Kyle Rittenhouse had, Daniel Penny and all the people who have claimed whatever their defense was. He should be afforded the same right," Alexander said. "What [Jeff Metcalf] has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism," he said of Austin's father. Anthony's attorney, Mike Howard, did not return a comment request. Jeff Metcalf did not return a comment request.

CANNES, France (AP) — Three years after flying into the Cannes Film Festival with “Top Gun: Maverick,” Tom Cruise returned to the Croisette on Wednesday with “Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning.” Christopher McQuarrie's latest “Mission: Impossible” installment is the biggest Hollywood tentpole wading ashore in Cannes this year. And its sizable impact at the French Riviera festival prompted shouts of “Tom! When Cruise stepped out his car, oohs and applause reverberated through the theater. Cruise spent several minutes signing autographs for fans lined up on the Croisette. Some had wondered whether Crusie might make a more daring arrival. Though selfies are frowned upon on the Cannes red carpet, McQuarrie took several of the group, including Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Angela Bassett and Hannah Waddingham. There was no press conference for the film, which meant Cruise and company faced no questions from reporters. But Cruise's surprise appearance allowed the 62-year-old star a moment to reflect on his 30 years with “Mission: Impossible.” As to whether “Final Reckoning” is a last hurrah for him, he demurred, calling it “the culmination of three decades of work.” “I'd rather just people see it and enjoy,” Cruise said. Whether Cruise has any Cannes stunt up his sleeve this time was much anticipated at the festival. When Cruise received an honorary Palme d'Or from the festival in 2022, the “Top Gun: Maverick” premiere included an impressively timed jet flyover. With McQuarrie, Cruise said he relishes the stunt work in “Mission: Impossible.” “I don't mind encountering the unknown. It's something that is not paralyzing,” Cruise said. Cruise, McQuarrie and Paramount Pictures, which will release “Final Reckoning” in North American theaters on May 23, are hoping the eighth “Mission: Impossible” installment returns the franchise to box-office heights. Their previous film, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One ” was considered a box-office disappointment, though it ultimately grossed $571.1 million worldwide. Still, with production budgets close to $300 million for these films, a lot is riding on “Final Reckoning.” Cruise has been traversing the world — with stops in Japan, South Korea and England in the run-up to Cannes — to drum up excitement. Cruise and McQuarrie, as they did around the release of “Top Gun: Maverick” (which McQuarrie co-wrote and produced), have made themselves passionate pitchmen for the big-screen experience. McQuarrie on Wednesday granted: “I worry for the fate and survival of cinema.” “Streaming is in danger of driving the industry into extinction,” said McQuarrie.

A research team in China got creative in its efforts to save a critically endangered species by turning to ancient poems. With fewer than 1,300 individuals left in the wild, scientists in eastern China have made huge efforts to better understand the animal's past habitat range to better inform future conservation initiatives. Related article Ancient giant dolphin discovered in the Amazon “Some older fishers told me they used to frequently see porpoises in areas where they've now disappeared completely,” study coauthor Zhigang Mei told CNN in an email. “That really sparked my curiosity: Where did these porpoises historically live?” This creates a problem known as shifting baseline syndrome, explained Mei, a professor at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Wuhan. “(This research) answers important questions about what constitutes a healthy population,” he said, which will help with setting realistic management goals. “Without historical baselines, there is a risk of shifting expectations downward over generations, accepting an ever-declining status as ‘normal. When Mei and his colleagues started poking around archives for answers, they were surprised. Official records such as local gazettes and county chronicles didn't have any information about the porpoises — only terrestrial megafauna like tigers and elephants, species that have frequent conflict with humans. Porpoises, in contrast, are less likely to have close encounters with humans. Instead, sightings were typically by local, less-educated anglers or wealthy travelers — who caught glimpses of the elusive porpoises while traveling the Yangtze River by boat — and weren't formally recorded, Mei said. Facing this dead end, the scientists realized ancient poems could come in handy. “We were amazed,” Mei said of the researchers efforts to explore written documentation via literature. The authors sorted through hundreds of poems dating back to AD 830 that referenced porpoises. Related article New footage reveals key clues to understanding mysterious orca group, scientists say “Emerald seals the jade-green tiles as idle dawn clouds drift / Specks of porpoises vanish between the waves' swift lift,” reads one Qing Dynasty poem by Gu Silì  顾嗣立 called “Crossing the River in Rain, Looking at Jinshan,” as translated by lead study author Yaoyao Zhang, an ecologist at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. “It's beautiful, actually,” said Paulo Corti, a conservation ecologist at Austral University of Chile who was not involved in the research. “They did something great with some very simple information.” Using historic materials for science isn't uncommon — especially in paleontology or archaeology — but it's less often used for wildlife research, Corti said. Such studies need to be conducted carefully, adds Corti, who has written journal articles about responsibly using historical records for wildlife studies after noticing that some scientists were using such data inappropriately. One major limitation of cultural records is human error, he explained. That's why the study authors researched each poet's background, such as where they lived and traveled, to verify their observations. Related article Wild dolphins off US Southeast coast found with microplastics in their breath, study says The Yangtze finless porpoise looks distinct, with a short snout, dark gray color and signature lack of a dorsal fin, which sets it apart from its dolphin relatives. As mammals, porpoises need to surface for air, making them visible to humans, said study coauthor Jiajia Liu, a professor of biodiversity science at Fudan University in Shanghai. And because finless porpoises did not historically hold cultural importance, it was less likely for poets to write about them without a literal observation, he added. But this species was much bigger, lighter-colored, and touted a long snout — its most distinguishing feature, Mei said. As a top predator, the porpoise eats fish that feed on aquatic grasses. The rare mammal is also an ecosystem engineer by facilitating a process called nutrient cycling. By migrating long distances, the finless porpoise carries nitrogen and phosphorus from the river bottom to its surface, and from downstream to upstream. Now that there is some evidence that the finless porpoise lived not only in the main river, but also in tributaries and lakes, scientists have a better idea of where the porpoise historically thrived — and whether it might thrive in those locations once again. With captive breeding — a process in which endangered species are bred in captivity and released back into the wild — underway since 1996, the authors hope their new findings may help inform future conservation efforts, such as identifying areas where they can be released. Using such information for modern-day wildlife management requires a thorough understanding of species behavior, morphology, diet and other factors, he said. “You can make a lot of mistakes” extrapolating historic observational data to inform future management decisions, he added. “If you are trying to see what happened with the species in the past, you need to know what is going on now,” Corti said. Related article Scientists say they have resurrected the dire wolf Importantly, Mei noted, this study creates a link between endangered species and culture, which could attract public attention.</p>

The animal was around 2 ½ feet long (80 cm) and its feet has long fingers and claws, which are visible in newly discovered fossil footprints.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists in Australia have identified the oldest known fossil footprints of a reptile-like animal, dated to around 350 million years ago. “We had thought the transition from fin to limb took much longer,” said California State University paleontologist Stuart Sumida, who was not involved in the new research. Previously the earliest known reptile footprints, found in Canada, were dated to 318 million years ago. The ancient footprints from Australia were found on a slab of sandstone recovered near Melbourne and show reptile-like feet with long toes and hooked claws.

The footprints are highlighted in yellow (front feet) and blue (back feet) and show the movements of three similar animals, researchers say. Scientists estimate the animal was about 2 1/2 feet (80 centimeters) long and may have resembled a modern monitor lizard. The findings were published Wednesday in Nature. The hooked claws are a crucial identification clue, said study co-author and paleontologist Per Ahlberg at Uppsala University in Sweden. Only animals that evolved to live solely on land ever developed claws. But the branch of the evolutionary tree that led to modern reptiles, birds and mammals – known as amniotes -- developed feet with nails or claws fit for walking on hard ground. “This is the earliest evidence we've ever seen of an animal with claws,” said Sumida. Australia was part of the supercontinent Gondwana. The fossil footprints record a series of events in one day, Ahlberg said. One reptile scampered across the ground before a light rain fell. Some raindrop dimples partially obscured its trackways. Then two more reptiles ran by in the opposite direction before the ground hardened and was covered in sediment. Fossil “trackways are beautiful because they tell you how something lived, not just what something looked like,” said co-author John Long, a paleontologist at Flinders University in Australia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans and Democrats grew weary in the early hours of Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill as they slogged through at-times contentious debate over provisions in President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package. Each committee is ultimately expected to move elements of the broader bill one step closer to a full floor vote in the chamber. If that goes as planned, House Republicans believe they'll be on track to take up what the president has dubbed his “one big, beautiful bill” in a floor vote by Memorial Day, a target that even some members of the GOP conference once described as overly ambitious. Related article Here's what's in the House GOP's sweeping tax and spending cuts package House Ways and Means, the GOP's powerful tax-writing panel, clocked nearly 18 hours of debate before advancing the tax portion of Trump's agenda Wednesday morning. Lawmakers at times shared personal stories as they argued for changes to the measure, which failed amid GOP opposition. Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin argued Republicans wanted to pay women to have children but wouldn't “feed the ones we have.” An amendment being offered by a member of her party, Moore said, was “about the 17 million children like me.” “I was smart, intelligent, but I went to school every day and ate the crumbs and the garbage off of kids' plates until I got brave enough one day to stand in line and demand something to eat. … What's up with this Charles Dickensian attitude that you know you gotta work, somebody's got to have income before we can help kids?” she said. “We should start at 9 a.m. … This is the longest in 33 years I have ever been in this room at any one time for a markup,” he remarked. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, meanwhile, has shown no sign of slowing as Democrats continue to hit Republicans with emotional stories from their constituents about Medicaid. In a contentious moment overnight, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez charged that she “will not yield to disrespectful men” after Republican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas asked her to yield her time following an exchange over addressing the camera instead of members of the panel. The exchange came as Ocasio-Cortez posed a question about work requirements and how those having miscarriages might be affected. The panel's record for a markup – set in 2017 – is 27 hours.</p>

President Donald Trump commended Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for their longtime friendship and for his country's purchase of Boeing planes following an agreement signing ceremony in Doha, Qatar. President Donald Trump signed a series of agreements with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday. The agreements involved a purchasing agreement by Qatar for Boeing aircraft, as well as letters of intent and "joint cooperation" between Qatar and the U.S. The emir also signed an intent agreement to purchase MQ-9 drone aircraft. Al Thani said he had a "great" conversation with Trump prior to the signing ceremony on Wednesday, adding that the agreements have elevated the U.S.-Qatar relationship to "another level." The deepening U.S. relationship with Qatar has drawn fresh scrutiny this week, both due to Trump's visit and amid reports that his administration may accept a free jet from the Qatari royal family to temporarily replace the current Air Force One. U.S. President Donald J. Trump attends a meeting with Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad al Thani at the Amiri Diwan, the official workplace of the emir, on May 14, 2025, in Doha, Qatar. "Qatar is not, in my opinion, a great ally. U.S. relations with Doha have come a long way since 2017, when Trump accused Qatar of harboring terrorism: "The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level," Trump said at the time. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani welcomes President Donald Trump during an official welcoming ceremony at the Amiri Diwan in Doha, Qatar, Wednesday, May 14, 2025. From there, Qatar became a major non-NATO ally to the U.S. in 2022 under President Joe Biden and is home to Al Udeid Air Base, one of the U.S.'s largest Middle Eastern bases and a key hub for U.S. Central Command operations. Qatar has been at the forefront of peace and hostage negotiations, especially in the war between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli delegation traveled to Doha on Tuesday to hash out a potential agreement on a hostage exchange and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. In March, weeks of negotiations led by U.S. and Qatari mediators led to the release of American George Glezmann, who had been imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan for more than two years. Doha's negotiators were also involved in the U.S.-Hamas deal to release the last living American hostage, Edan Alexander, on Monday. Qatar's government signed an intent agreement to purchase MQ-9 reaper drones. The Trump Organization has also cinched a new deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar, partnering with Qatari Diar, a real estate company backed by that country's sovereign wealth fund.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Justice Department announced 189 illegal immigrants were arrested in Washington, D.C., last week after an operation that occurred roughly around the same time federal immigration officers visited several restaurants in the area. Outgoing Interim U.S. Attorney for D.C. Ed Martin said the arrests are “a major step forward in making Washington, D.C., safer for legal citizens and their families.” Several restaurants in Washington reported visits last week by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with requests for completion of I-9 forms to verify the legality of their employees. “Working with our partner agencies, ICE officers and agents arrested 189 illegal aliens and removed them from the streets of our Nation's Capital. Evil is powerless if the good are unafraid,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations D.C. Field Office Director Russell Hott said in a statement. “I commend the efforts of everyone involved, as all were truly committed to the success of this operation. ICE Washington, D.C., remains dedicated to our mission of prioritizing public safety by arresting and removing criminal offenders from our Nation's Capital and surrounding communities,” Hott added. The Trump administration has taken a keen interest in Washington, vowing to curb crime and improve public safety in the district. President Donald Trump urged local officials to clean up homeless encampments and make other changes, and he threatened federal intervention into the district's home rule if improvements are not made. The president's March executive order, “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,” called for “directing maximum enforcement of Federal immigration law and redirecting available Federal, State, or local law enforcement resources to apprehend and deport illegal aliens in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area,” among other efforts.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? We can keep saving lives when foreign aid is dying. If the year 2025 has had a message for developing countries, it's this: “You're on your own.” Most notably, the Trump administration began with an unprecedented and ongoing assault on foreign aid, including global health programs. Other rich countries, including the UK and France, followed the US example by cutting their own aid programs as well. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's tariff campaign has hit poor countries that had been achieving export-driven growth, like Bangladesh, especially hard. If there's a silver lining for the Global South, it's that being on their own in 2025 means something very different than what it meant in, say, 1990. Countries where poverty was once near-universal, like India or Indonesia, are now considered middle-income. Some populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, like Kenya or Nigeria, are, if not completely politically stable, now possessed of enough real state capacity to try ambitious projects like universal health coverage. The resources available to these nations are still highly limited by rich-world standards. But they're still enough to achieve very impressive feats, and I recently heard of an intriguing project that could serve as a perfect test case. If it works, it could show that major international health projects, saving hundreds of thousands of lives, can be funded largely by the countries they're meant to help, rather than by forces of philanthropy and foreign aid that have suddenly become unreliable. The program targets an extremely common and preventable cause of death in young infants: neonatal sepsis. Sepsis is a catch-all term for infections that provoke an overwhelming immune response, damaging internal organs, and in the worst cases, leading to death. In another way, it's bad: The risk of antibiotic resistance means you don't want to overuse them. The tests we have now for bacterial sepsis in infants are slow and expensive. The main technique is “blood culturing,” which involves taking blood from the patient, putting it in a liquid “culture” that reacts if bacteria are present, and waiting to see the reaction show up. This is expensive and often takes two to three days, potentially delaying life-saving treatment. It also has very high “false negative” rates, with studies showing that a large share of neonatal sepsis cases occur in babies who test negative. Other studies go lower (more like 200,000) but, because they exclude infant deaths from pneumonia-caused sepsis, underestimate the number of deaths that could be saved by better targeting antibiotics to babies. The team behind NeoTest — which includes physician and global health research Akhil Bansal, Center for Global Development head Rachel Glennerster, economist and House of Lords member Jim O'Neill, and Nobel-winning economist Michael Kremer — aims to improve that targeting by getting a better test, one that gives results within minutes and is cheap to produce. The NeoTest team does not, itself, consist of medical test manufacturers. But in Glennerster and Kremer, it includes two of the inventors of a tool called an “advance market commitment” (AMC). The participants, which can include governments or other businesses or philanthropists, commit to buying a set amount of the new product, at a set price, from any manufacturers who meet the deal's specifications. The first AMC, for better vaccines against pneumococcal bacteria at a time when that disease was killing as many as 1 million children a year, resulted in three new vaccines being developed, and in the number of vaccine doses growing from just 3 million in 2010 to around 150 million in 2016. By one estimate from Kremer and co-authors, the new vaccines enabled by the AMC saved some 700,000 lives between 2010 and 2020. NeoTest is an attempt to put together funds — about $120 million in total — for an advance market commitment for a better neonatal sepsis test. More famously, Operation Warp Speed, the US effort that got effective vaccines against Covid-19 on the market less than a year after the pandemic began, used a purchasing mechanism that worked quite a bit like an AMC. The government purchased hundreds of millions of doses from vaccine manufacturers months before the vaccines were in fact approved — giving the pharma firms confidence to start producing doses in large numbers, and encouraging them to keep up their R&D work. NeoTest is an attempt to put together funds — about $120 million in total — for an advance market commitment for a better neonatal sepsis test. Neonatal sepsis experts have been saying we need better diagnostics for years; there's a whole Neonatal Sepsis Diagnosis Working Group that puts out papers explaining the problem. Rapid, point-of-care tests that can give answers in minutes are common at this point for viruses like Covid and the flu, and already exist for some bacterial infections like syphilis. But in part because neonatal sepsis is so concentrated in poor countries, developing a test for it hasn't been a priority for profit-driven firms to date. Dangling $120 million in front of them might change that. One of the most intriguing aspects of NeoTest to me is that Akhil Bansal, the physician who first devised the idea, is pitching it first to governments of middle- income countries (India, Kenya, South Africa, etc.) that might actually use the test in large numbers. Of course, money is money, and if any foreign aid professionals in upper-income countries or philanthropists reading this piece want to support NeoTest, they should — they're still actively fundraising and are in need of support. But I found the approach of going first to countries directly benefiting for funding intriguing, and surprisingly heartening at what is otherwise a dark time for global health For one thing, it's remarkable and encouraging that enough middle-income countries have gotten to the point where funding an initiative like this is within their budgets. More importantly, though, it serves as a reminder that the work of development will continue with or without Western governments' support. That support is invaluable, and I hope it returns. But the Global South is resilient, and increasingly shows an ability to solve big problems for itself. A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Trump administration is not known for particularly prioritizing animal welfare. But in its first few months, alongside announcements that it would seek to gut federal funding for scientific research, Trump officials have taken steps toward a goal that animal advocates have been championing for decades: the end of animal experimentation. On April 10, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to phase out animal testing requirements for the development of monoclonal antibodies — used to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer and Covid-19 — and a range of other drugs. The Environmental Protection Agency, which has long required animal testing for substances including pesticides and fuel additives, also plans to revive an agency ban on animal testing that dates back to the first Trump administration. The Biden administration eliminated those deadlines, but now, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin “is wholly committed to getting the agency back on track,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou told Vox in an email. Estimates suggest NIH-funded research relies on millions of animals every year in the US. That includes mostly rodents, but also monkeys, dogs, pigs, rabbits, and others. But Trump's NIH cited scientific literature that finds animal models can have limited relevance to human outcomes. Together, these moves represent a potentially monumental shift in American science — one that could spare millions of animals from painful experiments and, advocates hope, speed up the adoption of cutting-edge technologies to produce better, more reliable research than animal models ever did. But if the goal is not just to benefit animals, but also to make science better, the Trump administration is surely going about it in a strange way. It hasn't committed any new funding toward its goal of advancing animal-free research methods. Putting animal research on the chopping block, many believe, could merely be a convenient and popular way to slash support for science across the board. This has created a diverse, sometimes-uneasy coalition of animal welfare advocates, science reformers, and far-right political figures — some are willing to accept reforms any way they can get them; others are more wary of moves made by this administration, even when their agendas align. • Animal rights advocates are ready for Trump's war on science • What can caged lab monkeys tell us about free human beings? Evolving beyond the pervasive use of animals in science undoubtedly ought to be one of those priorities: Lab animals experience immense suffering in labs, living in intensive confinement and undergoing painful experiments involving blood draws, tube feeding, forced inhalation of substances, and other procedures. It's unclear whether a moonshot for alternatives to animal research can emerge from an administration that's imposing widespread austerity on science. And there may be reason to worry that the Trump administration's broader anti-regulatory approach could have negative consequences for the welfare of animals that still remain in labs. For decades, animal advocates, and a growing number of scientists, have disputed whether animal trials are the most effective tools available in modern science. Historically, animal dissection laid the groundwork for early medicine, and breakthroughs from animal research have helped lead to polio vaccines, the preventative HIV medication PrEP, and treatments for Parkinson's disease. But animals are not necessarily suitable proxies for humans, and more than 90 percent of drug trials fail between animal and human testing trials, according to a 2023 review by animal welfare advocates. It's a problem many scientists acknowledge, albeit not always publicly. Former NIH director Francis Collins in 2014 privately discussed “the pointlessness of much of the research being conducted on non-human primates” in emails obtained by PETA via public records request. But how these planned cutbacks and phase-outs will actually unfold is more complex. In its announcement, the NIH said it will establish an Office of Research Innovation, Validation, and Application to scale the use of non-animal methods, expand funding for these approaches, evaluate human relevance, and include experts in alternative animal-free methods on grant review panels so that more of the agency's funding is allocated toward those methods. Scientists are often incentivized to use animals in their research, as Celia Ford wrote for Voxearlier this year, a phenomenon sometimes called “animal methods bias.” Academic journals prefer to publish studies using animals, and internal research ethics review boards are mostly comprised of animal researchers. Advancing technologies, such as computational modeling or organ-on-a-chip technology, offer alternatives to animal testing, and many scientists around the world are embracing these new methods. But the scientific community has been slow to adopt them. To change that, the NIH's new initiative will “address any possible bias towards animal studies” among its grant review staff. The agency will also publicly report on its annual research spending, something it hasn't done in the past, “to measure progress toward reduction of funding for animal studies and an increase in funding for human-based approaches,” according to the recent announcement. The EPA, meanwhile, requires toxicology tests on animals for many substances that it regulates, including fuel and fuel additives, certain pesticides, and wastewater from industrial facilities. It has not yet announced an official plan to reduce animal research, though a 2016 agency reform required increased reliance on non-animal methods. Many are hoping the agency — which previously estimated that between 20,000 and 100,000 or more animals are used in toxicology testing every year — will recommit to its 2019 directive to end animal testing requirements by 2035, Baker says. Of course, announcements are meaningless without plans — and the FDA is the only agency to announce a plan that lays out a three-year timeline and alternative testing strategies. The FDA's current requirements for animal testing in new drug approvals are somewhat unclear. As a result, in practice, most drugs approved by the FDA are still tested on animals. According to the FDA, current regulations still require animal testing for monoclonal antibodies, which are lab-made proteins that can bind to and kill specific targets in the body. The FDA's phaseout of animal tests will start with these antibodies and expand to other treatments. Safety risks may go undetected in animals, and the stress of laboratory life can affect their immune function and responses, a significant confounding factor in animal research that scientists have noted before. While advancements like organ-on-a-chip and computer modeling are both exciting and laudable, counting on them to replace animals may be premature, Naomi Charalambakis, director of communications and science policy for Americans for Medical Progress, a nonprofit that supports the use of animals in research, said in an email. These tools, many of which are still under development, can't fully replicate “the complexity of living organisms” — which is why she says they should be integrated “alongside traditional animal studies.” “Animal models remain vital for answering complex biomedical questions — particularly those involving whole-body systems, long-term effects, and unpredictable immune responses,” she says. In 2022, the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 paved the way for alternatives to animal testing, and in December 2023, an NIH advisory committee made similar recommendations to develop non-animal methods. But for animals, the news is “fantastic,” argues Jeremy Beckham, a law student and animal advocate who's worked for organizations including PETA, PCRM, and the Beagle Freedom Project. While indirect costs are not a “meritless concept,” Beckham says, he believes universities renew research grants that harm animals while yielding little to no benefit in order to continue receiving operational funding. Universities “are allowing a lot of extremely pointless and cruel animal experiments to happen, because it's such a gravy train for them for these indirect costs,” he says. Wayne State receives an indirect cost rate of 54 percent, according to a recent statement from the university. In a statement about its dog experiments, Wayne State argued that it's important to continue the cardiovascular research, even if “science does not move at the pace we would like.” Critics of the cuts to indirect costs, including Harvard immunologist Sarah Fortune, have argued that funding cuts will mean labs are forced to euthanize their animals. But many, if not all, were already going to be killed in experiments, Delcianna Winders, director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School, points out. In March, a federal judge blocked the NIH's proposed cap on indirect costs, and universities are looking to negotiate. Despite its promises to reduce the number of animals in labs, the Trump administration's disdain for regulation may mean those animals that still remain in labs will suffer more. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the agency tasked with implementing that law, removed thousands of animal welfare reports, which had previously been publicly posted for decades, from its website. Given this precedent, Winders fears that going forward, the research industry will violate animal welfare laws “with complete impunity.” Research animals are already at a disadvantage under the Animal Welfare Act, and critics have insisted for decades that the act is insufficient and poorly enforced. The proverbial lab rat is not protected by the law — most mice and rats, birds, and cold-blooded animals are excluded from the Animal Welfare Act's definition of “animal.” By some estimates, it covers as little as 5 percent of research animals. Nor does the law place any legal limits on what can be done to animals in experiments. But for facilities that receive millions in funding and spend billions on research, fines — most of which are less than $15,000 — are so low that they're considered a “cost of doing business,” according to a 2014 USDA Office of Inspector General report. The USDA calculates these fines using an internal penalty worksheet, which factors in a facility's size, compliance history, and the severity of its violations. The worksheet was recently obtained by Eric Kleiman, founder of research accountability group Chimps to Chinchillas, and it revealed that the USDA does not take a research institution's revenue or assets into account when calculating fines. But this metric is flawed, Kleiman says, since many labs don't keep their animals on-site, instead contracting out with research organizations that perform the experiments on their behalf. And in recent months, there have been alarming signs of an anti-regulation shift. A 2024 Supreme Court decision, SEC vs. Jarkesy, calls government agencies' ability to issue fines into question. It's possible this ruling could be interpreted in a way that bars the USDA from assessing fines, Winders says. “We're still waiting to see how broadly the government interprets it,” she says. Winders has “never, ever seen that before,” she says, and it could set a new precedent for decreased transparency. “If inspectors aren't there, how are they going to have a window into what needs to be done?” says Sara Amundson, chief government relations officer for Humane World for Animals. Regardless, the US is witnessing a seismic shift in how we use animals for research — or even whether we use them at all. It's too soon to say what the Trump administration's reforms to animal testing will accomplish, or whether they'll produce durable changes in American science that manage to outlive an administration that has declared war on the scientific community. To have an administration that, within months of taking power, is already meeting with animal welfare groups, holding congressional hearings, and taking strong stances on animal research issues is unprecedented, experts say.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TRUMP: ‘I DON'T LIKE PERMANENT ENEMIES': President Donald Trump, basking in the glow of an effusively warm welcome in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, laid out a vision of a new age of cooperation in the Middle East —  praising countries in the region for a “great transformation” that he said has resulted in the “birth of a modern Middle East,” while criticizing Western “interventionists” who “had no idea how to do it themselves.” “In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they've built, and the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves … Peace, prosperity, and progress ultimately came not from a radical rejection of your heritage but rather from embracing your national traditions and embracing that same heritage that you love so dearly.” AN ‘OLIVE BRANCH' TO IRAN: Trump again professed a desire to resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear program peacefully, through negotiation, while underscoring his demand that they never acquire nuclear weapons. “We'll never allow America and its allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” as the room broke out in thunderous applause. “We're taking them all off and … now it's their time to shine.” If signing up doesn't work, shoot us an email and we'll add you to our list. HAPPENING TODAY: NEXT STOP, DOHA: President Trump has departed Saudi Arabia and will arrive in Doha, Qatar about 1:30 p.m. local time, where he will be honored with a state visit. After seven weeks of “unrelenting” U.S. bombings, Houthi leaders began reaching out around the first weekend in May to U.S. allies in the Middle East,” Reuters is reporting, citing two U.S. officials. On Monday, the New York Times reported U.S. Central Commander Gen. Michael Kurilla had proposed “an eight-to-10-month campaign in which Air Force and Navy warplanes would take out Houthi air defense systems” followed by “targeted assassinations modeled on Israel's recent operation against Hezbollah.” Citing sources, the New York Times said President Trump began to question the operation's progress, dubbed “Rough Rider,” by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, especially after losing a half-dozen expensive Reaper drones and three F-18 Super Hornet aircraft. With the U.S. strikes “burning through weapons and munitions at a rate of about $1 billion in the first month alone,” Trump was ready to take the Houthis at their word that they would stop shooting at American ships, even if Israel and its ships were still under fire. At some point, the newspaper reported, “General Kurilla's eight-to-10-month campaign was given just 30 days to show results.” “So many precision munitions were being used, especially advanced long-range ones, that some Pentagon contingency planners were growing increasingly concerned about overall stocks and the implications for any situation in which the United States might have to ward off an attempted invasion of Taiwan by China.” At this point, all we've heard about is something that might be a hypothetical,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD). “I think many people don't realize the current Air Force Ones are flying offices. And if they really wanted to bring it up to Air Force One standards, it would require significant overhaul for all kinds of reasons,” Bolton said. Because it's going to be a couple of years, I think, before the Boeings are finished,” Trump said. All over the world, countries wouldn't even exist,” he continued. “It helps us out because we'll have a relatively new plane instead of having 40-year-old planes. These planes are 40 years old and that's not representative of our country,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Costs have been creeping up for Chad Esslinger, who runs an interior design business outside of Chicago, ever since President Donald Trump first announced sweeping global tariffs in early April. One business Esslinger often relies on to provide light fixtures, rugs, furniture and all manner of wholesale home goods for clients implemented a “temporary tariff surcharge” of 14% on all goods from China and a 2% charge on items imported from any other country beginning on May 12. Another business that provides fabric, wallpaper and trim emailed Esslinger to say it would re-evaluate its pricing strategy on May 15. “I've seen it where sometimes they don't even warn you. For the last few years, the home renovation space has been booming, but Washington's ever-shifting tariff policies threaten to change that. That's because the US imports billions of dollars worth of home goods from around the globe, from Tuscan tilework to Chinese refrigerators. Those products, along with raw construction materials, have been hit by Trump's tariff agenda. Professionals in the home renovation space, from decorators to general contractors, told CNN their businesses have been bracing for higher prices since President Donald Trump first announced tariffs on imports from most countries in early April. Though Trump has temporarily placed many of the largest tariff increases on pause, high tariffs remain in effect, and uncertainty about future costs persists, many said. On the contractor side, they're waiting to see how it unfolds,” said Julie Kheyfets, the CEO of Block Renovation, an online platform that connects contractors with homeowners. Some home goods have already been pulled from the market entirely due to sharp changes in tariffs. Sandy Schargel, an interior decorator from Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recently informed that thousands of dollars in light fixtures she had ordered for a client were no longer available, due to tariff-induced discontinuations. Schargel told CNN that if she can no longer access some imported products, she would turn to American-made alternatives, which may add costs for homeowners. “When you come to the lower price points, American-made does limit things, somewhat,” Schargel said. Schargel said she has encouraged clients on tighter budgets to order what they need as soon as possible to avoid prices going up further down the line. In 2024, the country sent more than $438 billion worth of goods into American homes. Nearly 19% of that total was machinery and mechanical appliances, such as refrigerators, dish washing machines and laundry machines, according to data from the US International Trade Commission. Furniture, bedding, lamps and lighting were a further 4% of last year's imports from China. For a little more than a month, the 145% tariff Trump placed on imports from China vastly eclipsed tariffs on other nations' imports. However, on Monday, the US and China agreed to lower tariffs on each other – a positive step in trade relations between the two countries after tensions had ratcheted up in the last few weeks. Blanket 10% tariffs are also in place with most other US trading partners, though higher rates could kick back in on July 9. It is too early to tell whether the pause in the highest tariffs on China will reverse price hikes and shortages. Earlier this year, a report from the National Association of Home Builders estimated that the remodeling industry is poised for growth amid an aging housing stock. As fewer new homes have been built in the last decade and fewer Americans move, homeowners would be more likely to renovate their older homes, the report said. Esslinger, the interior designer from the Chicago area, along with other home renovation professionals CNN spoke to, said tariff whiplash was slowing down business, though. “The word that just keeps coming up is uncertainty,” Esslinger said. “I think some folks just don't feel super confident. I've had some clients say they're going to hold off for a little bit and see how things go, while some have scaled back a little bit.” Nina Sepiashvily, who runs I&N Builders, a New York City-based construction company, said that while she may have noticed a slight increase in prices so far, it pales in comparison to the soaring prices she experienced in the years after the start of the pandemic, when inflation began to take off. As a construction company owner, she generally doesn't handle buying finished goods like appliances and furniture, but rather handles purchasing building materials, like lumber. Although the US imports a significant percentage of lumber from Canada, the additional tariff increase on that import hasn't yet taken effect. “We haven't really seen (tariffs) affect our costs yet,” Sepiashvily said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump family's crypto empire is expanding rapidly, and it's making earlier ethics debates over his hotel and casino business interests look downright quaint. There are only so many rooms a foreign diplomat can book to curry favor with the president, and that might total into thousands of dollars, at most. And even President Donald Trump might have a limit on how many luxury Qatari jets he'd accept as gifts. But in the opaque world of cryptocurrencies, where transactions are often anonymous and unbound by national borders, there is virtually no cap on the amount of money a person or government could funnel to the president, his family and the growing list of entities they control. That list of entities already includes two “meme coins” — digital assets with no utility that serious crypto advocates tend to roll their eyes at — and an exchange called World Liberty Financial, which issues its own token. And soon, anyone with a brokerage account will be able to buy shares on the open market of American Bitcoin, a crypto mining firm backed by the president's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. News of American Bitcoin's plans to go public emerged Monday night, around the same time that another crypto side hustle was wrapping up: Bidding ended Monday in an auction for a private dinner with Trump, billed as an “unforgettable gala,” for the top holders of the $TRUMP meme coin. (Tl;dr: People working for the federal government can't receive gifts from foreign governments without Congress' approval.) But crypto offers a level of anonymity and scale that the White House has never seen. Over the past month, crypto investors plowed an estimated $148 million into Trump's meme coin, according to Reuters, which cited data from crypto research firm Chainalysis. The vast majority of the coin's supply — 80% — is held by two Trump Organization affiliates, which make money through transaction fees. Earlier this month, the New York Times' David Yaffe-Bellany reported that World Liberty Financial had secured a deal to take $2 billion in deposits from a venture fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi — a revelation that helped torpedo crypto industry-supported legislation in the Senate last week. Even crypto advocates on the right aren't loving the optics of a president directly enriching himself and his family through an industry that he is not only actively working to deregulate but also bolster through the establishment of a “strategic” bitcoin reserve. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, one of the sponsors of the stalled legislation, told the Times in an interview that Trump's profit-seeking “does give me pause because it complicates our work here.” On Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed a question about whether the president would conduct personal business meetings on his trip to the Middle East. “It's frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” Leavitt said. “This White House holds ourselves to the highest of ethical standards.” (Ethicists and legal experts disagree, as my CNN colleagues note in their investigation of Trump family's expansive financial interests in the Middle East.) Trump's crypto entanglements are particularly worrying, according to Libowitz, for two reasons. For starters, crypto is still niche, and a 2024 Pew study found just 17% of US adults have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency. (And if they know about the industry, they likely know it through names like Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, who is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud.) “There's almost a level of security by obscurity,” Libowitz said. “There's a limit to how many $800 hotel rooms you can book… And you're limited in the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars,” he said.
