                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 5% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity. In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a "solid start" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said "one data point does not make a trend." They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess what early demand is like for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched on Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more market share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug space. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity. Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, had around 1,300 prescriptions filled in the first week of its commercial launch, and roughly 8,000 in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. The TD Cowen analysts cited slightly different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements – no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water – that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday said he'd prefer to keep National Economic Council Director Hassett in his position as top economic advisor, a statement that could change the dynamic in the race to see who will replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. During an appearance in the White House, Trump said, "I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. Hassett has been considered a leading contender to take the central bank reigns, competing closely with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and has indicated he will replace Powell when his term as chair ends in May. Hassett and Warsh are two of five finalists for the position, a group that also includes current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Powell's term as chair ends in May. Turning to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, "We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out." After Trump spoke, traders on predictions market site Kalshi raised their bets to a 60% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared to just 16% for Hassett and 14% for Waller. "It is not certain this is a definitive signal – the President has given various signals at various times and appears to enjoy the drama of this Celebrity Apprentice season – but it does look as if the former Fed governor is for the first time the clear front-runner," wrote Krishna Guha, head global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh leading Hassett 60% to 15% and Waller at 13%. Traders are giving little odds to BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, the other two candidates considered finalists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The growth of China's biotechnology sector has been staggering. Beijing is pumping money into the industry, backing research efforts and helping launch a new wave of labs and incubators in the country. That's a problem for the U.S. biotech industry and also affects rare disease patients who are waiting for a cure. Crowley is something of a rock star in the rare disease community. When Crowley and his wife were told his two young children had Pompe disease, a fatal genetic disorder, Crowley left his job in marketing to try to find a cure. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Geeta Anand wrote a book about Crowley's story, which later became the Hollywood film "Extraordinary Measures," starring Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser. Crowley has certainly made his mark in the biotech space. He helped build two biotech companies focused on rare diseases that were later acquired by larger pharmaceuticals. Crowley left Amicus to become the CEO of BIO. Since stepping into that post, he has become increasingly outspoken about China's biotech sector, advocating for the U.S. to become more competitive. "We need to reduce the reliance on Chinese biotechs," Crowley said. Crowley has seen the growth of China's biotech firsthand. "I go back to even just 10 years ago, maybe, working in China. There were maybe a couple hundred true R&D biotech companies in China. By our count, there's over 4,000 today," he said. That's attractive to both major drug manufacturers and smaller researchers from around the world, who see developing drugs in China as a faster and cheaper option than in the United States. A recent article in STAT profiled the rise of one Chinese incubator, ATLATL, highlighting how it's been able to develop relationships with clients spanning the entire drug development pipeline. To Crowley, who is a former naval intelligence officer, China's rise in biotech is a threat not just to the industry he represents, but to the millions of patients who rely upon the rare disease research that comes out of American universities. "Our research grounded in our great academic institutions [is] a remarkable strategic advantage for the United States," Crowley said. "We can't let China win in biotech," he said. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a member of the CNBC Cures Advisory Board, devotes a chapter in his forthcoming book, "The Miracle Century," to China's rise in biotech. "If this drift continues and more drug discovery migrates from the U.S. to China, we could see our capacity for innovation begin to erode. As capital flows toward Chinese firms, U.S. biotechnology hubs like Boston and San Francisco, long the seedbeds of breakthrough science, may shrink. Restoring that American ecosystem would be anything but easy." And data gathered for another forthcoming book, "Innovation is the Best Medicine," by Dr. Roderick Wong, a physician and the founder and managing partner of life sciences investment firm RTW Investments, shows that from 2013-2025, China tripled its share of global clinical trial initiations. Political think tanks and lawmakers in the U.S. have taken notice. In November, the nonpartisan Atlantic Council published an analysis that identified pharmaceuticals as China's next trade weapon, likening the shift in biotech innovation to China to the offshoring of semiconductor chip manufacturing. But for people living with a rare disease, the issue isn't so clear-cut. And parents looking for a lifesaving treatment for their child don't care if it comes from the U.S. or China. Innovation in the rare disease space is a good thing. And in a field where there might be only two or three experts in the world on any given disease, that innovation is often the result of international collaboration. It's a conundrum that isn't lost on Gottlieb, who acknowledged the innovation from Beijing is good for rare disease patients. "If the end result, though, is that the fragile U.S. innovation sector gets hollowed out and we lose our own engine of innovation, that's bad," Gottlieb said in a text. "As China erodes other parts of our ecosystem, it could hollow out everything," he added. Both Gottlieb and Crowley said the real key to maintaining U.S. leadership in biotech is getting regulators to treat rare diseases, which might affect only a few hundred people, differently from those with larger patient populations. Rare disease researchers agree, arguing that a more streamlined approval process for rare disease treatments from the FDA would dramatically bring down the cost of bringing a new treatment to market in the U.S. David Liu, a pioneer in gene editing whose lab at Harvard University and the Broad Institute is at the cutting edge of genetic research, said he's asked the FDA to take a more lenient stance when evaluating new treatments for rare diseases. One example Liu pointed to: current guidelines for cell and gene therapies that require a company demonstrates three full-scale manufacturing runs before a treatment can get final approval. "One full-scale manufacturing run typically costs $7 million for rare genetic disease gene editing treatments," Liu said. "One production run can typically already treat more patients than exist in the whole world. So you're just asking companies to throw away an extra $14 million." Critics of current FDA policies argue that using a different set of standards for rare disease treatments would bring down development costs and help the drugs get to the people who need them more quickly, and that it could spur a new wave of investment in the space. "We need a system that works better," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in large part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. President Donald Trump wants PJM to hold an emergency auction in which the tech companies would bid on contracts for new electricity generation, a White House official told CNBC. Trump wants PJM to build $15 billion of new baseload power generation, the official said. He also wants PJM to cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, the official said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and governors from the mid-Atlantic region will announce an agreement Friday morning urging PJM to take these actions, the official said. "Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading a unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts," White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a "massive wealth transfer," the watchdog told PJM in a November letter. PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. The power shortage makes blackouts more likely, said Abe Silverman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 to 2023 under Democratic Gov. "Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often," Silverman said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norwegian lawmakers reacted with shock and dismay over Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado's decision to present U.S. President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal. "It's completely unheard of," Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international politics at the University of Oslo and former state secretary in the foreign affairs ministry, told public broadcaster NRK on Friday. Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was "incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes," according to a Google translation. It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3. The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a "wonderful gesture of mutual respect." The Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: "A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot." Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time." "Whoever has received the prize has received the prize," Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. "The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work," he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday. Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had "proved they place politics over peace." Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to. Dag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is "no doubt" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado. Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein. "Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize," Søreide said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The following day, Scandinavian Airlines operated its first flight with Starlink. However, as a budget airline, Ryanair is known for its no-frills offering.

In a subsequent interview on Irish radio on Thursday, the outspoken Ryanair boss said adding Starlink would cost the airline between $200 million and $250 million a year. "In other words, about an extra dollar for every passenger we fly, and the reality for us is we can't afford those costs," he told Newstalk. "Passengers won't pay for internet usage; if it's free, they'll use it — but they won't pay one euro each to use the internet." Musk then threw another shot on Friday morning, calling O'Leary an "utter idiot." "I don't want to hang around till 96 like Buffett," he said. Ryanair and its subsidiaries operate a fleet of 643 airplanes, which handled 206 million passengers last year. 2024's statistics showed that it was the world's third-largest airline group, behind American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. It focuses on quick turnarounds between flights, charging for add-ons like sitting next to your friends, and on-board sales, including scratchcards and duty-free cigarettes. Every airline that's announced Starlink deals so far has included free in-flight internet for everyone on board. So, even if O'Leary changed his mind, it seems unlikely that Musk's company would let him charge Ryanair passengers to use Starlink. SpaceX executives also took umbrage at what they said was incorrect information about the fuel costs incurred by installing Starlink. "You need to put [an] antenna on [the] fuselage — it comes with a 2% fuel ⁠penalty because of ​the weight and ​drag," O'Leary told Reuters. Michael Nicolls, the VP of Starlink engineering, said in a Wednesday X post that Starlink terminals have a more fuel-efficient profile than other airplane internet providers. He added that SpaceX's analysis showed a Starlink terminal instead increased fuel costs by 0.3% on a Boeing 737-800, the model that makes up the bulk of Ryanair's fleet. Ryanair declined to comment on Musk's and Nicolls' remarks when contacted by Business Insider. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adding an amenity like Starlink would be at odds with its business model, especially if it were free for passengers. Budget airlines have also struggled to compete on price with legacy carriers. Southwest Airlines' latest quarterly earnings were down nearly 20% year-over-year to $54 million.</p>

This week isn't even over yet, but I'm already gearing up for next week's big events: the World Economic Forum in Davos, a major Supreme Court case and Netflix earnings. S&P 500 futures are higher this morning after yesterday's winning session. Chip stocks led the market higher yesterday after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company released better-than-expected results, including a 35% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter profit. If you're disappointed to hear that Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman's parent company filed for bankruptcy, you're not alone. Amazon would also like to have a word with Saks Global. The e-commerce site asked a federal judge yesterday to block Saks' bankruptcy financing plan, accusing the retailer of failing to hold up its agreement. Amazon invested $475 million into Saks' 2024 acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but "that equity investment is now presumptively worthless," Amazon lawyers wrote in the filing. The company told the judge that it and other creditors would be hurt by Saks' bankruptcy financing plan because it would have the department store operator take on more debt. As CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Annie Palmer report, Amazon threatened to "seek more drastic remedies" if Saks doesn't resolve its concerns. President Donald Trump yesterday unveiled an outline of his health-care plan, which his administration said would reduce drug prices and insurance premiums. A fact sheet said the plan would also send money for health insurance "directly" to Americans, though some health policy experts say that's a bad idea. The announcement came as senators struggled to reach an agreement on the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The new plan does not include extending the Obamacare tax credits, which Democrats demand be part of a health-care deal. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Prediction markets could be getting a big bank backer. While Solomon pumped the brakes on the idea that Wall Street would rapidly embrace prediction markets, he noted that trading platforms regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission "look like derivative contract activities." "So I can certainly see opportunities where these cross into our business," he said. NBC Chief Marketing Officer Jenny Storms is calling it "Legendary February," and it's set to be a big test for the broadcaster, which spent billions of dollars on live sports rights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia called the Trump administration's threats to take over Greenland "extraordinary" on Friday, adding it would continue monitoring the situation. "The situation is unusual, I would even say extraordinary from the standpoint of international law," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to comments reported by Russian state news outlet Ria Novosti. U.S. President Donald Trump has talked up acquiring Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, since a daring military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. He said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and that only Washington can counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island. Peskov added that Trump "has said that international law is not a priority for him. The situation is developing along a different trajectory, and we, along with the rest of the world, will be watching to see which one." A spokesperson for the Kremlin was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC. The White House meeting, which was described as "frank but constructive" by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, ended on Wednesday without a diplomatic breakthrough, although they agreed to keep talking via a high-level working group. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he doesn't "need international law" and that only his "own morality" and mind can stop him. Several NATO members have deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a joint military exercise, meanwhile, seeking to beef up the military presence in and around the sparsely populated island. Denmark, which is responsible for Greenland's defense, Germany, France, Sweden and Norway have all confirmed plans to take part in the joint exercises, known as "Operation Arctic Endurance." Earlier in the week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that it was unacceptable to say that Beijing and Moscow were a threat to Greenland, accusing the West of double standards.

As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market. Arthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models. Instead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers. Mistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems. But Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available. As a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe. Mensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure. European governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms. The same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security. Open source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy. Long term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities. Do you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A survey released Friday by corporate insurer Axis Capital shows there's a growing divide across the C-suite on how executives view the risks, rewards and impact of cutting-edge AI technology. On one hand, artificial intelligence is rapidly improving cybersecurity defense technologies, but AI is also equipping cybercriminals with sophisticated tools and creating new risks. "When you think about AI, it is not merely a cyber challenge. This technology presents unique burdens, liabilities, challenges and opportunities to CEOs and boards alike," Axis CEO Vincent Tizzio told CNBC in an exclusive interview. Axis surveyed 250 CEOs and chief information security officers across the U.S. and U.K. on how AI is reshaping the cyber risk landscape. The survey found that while CEOs tend to view AI as a driver of productivity and competitive advantage, CISOs tend to see the technology as a source of increased exposure to risks like data leaks. Asked how confident they were that AI would strengthen their companies' cybersecurity, 19.5% of CEOs said they weren't confident compared to 30% of CISOs saying they lacked that confidence. The study also found that AI is generally viewed positively among both U.S. and U.K. executives, although U.K. respondents expressed more caution than those in the U.S. While 85% of U.S. leaders said they felt prepared for AI threats, only 44% in the U.K. said they felt prepared. Cybersecurity is a major investment priority for executives as ransomware attacks have nearly doubled over the past two years, with 82% of respondents saying they plan to increase their cybersecurity budgets over the next 12 months. "I haven't met a fellow CEO or board member that doesn't talk about the critical importance of discussing cyber as an exposure to the company's well-being," Tizzio said. We want to hear from you.

Hospitals, law firms, and tech companies are getting a preview of how AI is likely to reshape work: by automating tasks without eliminating the underlying jobs. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work. Huang's framing is straightforward: Most jobs contain repeatable tasks that technology can compress, and a broader purpose that remains human-led. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would eradicate many radiology jobs and advised students to avoid the field. While AI is automating many radiology tasks, there are actually more radiologists employed now than when Hinton made his prediction in 2016. Here are the killer stats, shared in this 2025 blog post that describes why radiologists are still in huge demand: In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions, a 4% increase from 2024, and the field's vacancy rates are at all-time highs. Huang argued that the job's purpose isn't "reading scans." The true purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, guide treatment, and support those efforts with research. Tools that automate writing don't eliminate the need for executives; they often expand the amount of work leaders and other employees can take on, he said. "The fact that somebody could use AI to automate a lot of my typing — I really appreciate that, and it helps a lot," he said. "It hasn't really made me, if you will, less busy. This "task versus purpose" framework is increasingly visible in knowledge work, where AI tools are speeding up and automating tasks such as drafting, summarizing, and generating code. Huang pointed to software engineering as a case where AI can reduce time spent on a core task (writing code) while raising demand for the job's purpose: solving problems and identifying new ones worth solving. Nvidia, he said, is hiring aggressively even as AI coding tools such as Cursor spread through the company's engineering teams, because productivity gains allow companies to pursue more ideas. That can boost revenue, leaving more money to hire new staff. Reading and drafting contracts are tasks, while the purpose of a lawyer is to protect clients and resolve disputes. AI can accelerate document-heavy work, but the role's true value relies on judgment, strategy, and accountability — and you need experienced, trustworthy human attorneys for that. This even applies to waiters working in a restaurant. Their task is taking food orders, but their purpose is to ensure guests have a great time, Huang said. But he contends the early evidence points less toward a wholesale collapse of employment and more toward job redesign. If it's anchored in outcomes — diagnosis, customer experience, problem-solving, conflict resolution — AI may be less a replacement than a lever, changing what you spend time on while keeping your job's purpose intact.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Why has the market fallen out of love with Disney? Bob Iger is nearing the end of a multi-year comeback run as CEO and has overseen several key improvements to Disney's business. The company has mapped out a major expansion pipeline for parks and experiences. ESPN is bolstering its streaming strategy as the pay-TV bundle continues to shrink. Despite this, the stock is sitting about 43% below its 2021 peak — and it could leave a dent in Iger's legacy. During Iger's 15-year first run as CEO, which ended in 2020, Disney's stock surged as he transformed the company through acquisitions — Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm — that powered its movies, TV shows, consumer products, and parks. Disney is trading around $114 — up about 24% from the start of Iger's second term as CEO. "Disney was the one stock in media that you could compare to everyone else," longtime Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said, referring to the broader market. "This is the lowest relative valuation it's had in more than 40 years." Disney is operating within a complicated environment for media giants during Iger's second run, which is reflected in the varied stock performance of its competitors. Disney has no exact peer, but shares of its biggest rival, the pure-play streamer Netflix, have gained nearly 206% since November 2022, when Iger returned to Disney. Disney employees and everyday investors who spoke with Business Insider said they were frustrated by the stock's performance, but most believed it would eventually rebound. "The fundamentals are there, and while the stock has lagged, it's part of a diversified portfolio, so I can afford to wait it out," said Dia Adams, a Disney fan and travel agent. Wall Street analysts — most of whom, including Bank of America, recommend the stock — describe Disney as comprising three separate but interconnected businesses, each with its own distinct risk profile. At any given time, one of them looks shaky enough to hamper Disney's overall growth story. Disney's Entertainment division, which spans linear TV networks, streaming services, and studios, is the most complex piece. However, skeptics are concerned about streaming's ability to replace linear TV's decline and point out that growth is increasingly coming from outside the US, where people are often more price-sensitive. The streaming wars could also get tougher for Disney moving forward. Netflix and Paramount Skydance are in a bidding war over Warner Bros. Discovery, and whichever combination emerges will create a larger rival that could put pressure on Disney. Wall Street was looking for Iger to work his magic on the movie business, and the films were "horrific" in Disney's 2025 fiscal year, Ehrlich said. The division's recent strength has relied heavily on price increases rather than a bump in attendance. That raises a key question: How much pricing power does Disney have left? Disney has also faced concerns about competition in Florida from Comcast's recently opened Epic Universe, and about the delayed debut of Disney Adventure in Singapore, now scheduled for March. Sports is the smallest segment of Disney's business by revenue, but it has a clear growth story. ESPN is modernizing for streaming with a newly enhanced app and big direct-to-consumer ambitions. That said, the cost of sports rights is increasing, and competition is intensifying — not only from traditional rivals like Fox, but also from deep-pocketed tech companies such as YouTube and Amazon. Disney's sports spending was a topic on its latest earnings call after it paid more than a 73% increase for NBA rights in its latest deal, which kicked off with the 2025-2026 season. Analysts want proof of steady, repeatable earnings growth, whether from a stronger film slate, improved streaming profitability, or an expected lift from the cruise business in late 2026. The stock price matters in ways that affect Disney operationally. Equity is critical to retaining top executives, and stagnant shares can dull the appeal of stock-based pay. Regardless of who is chosen, investors are hoping for steady leadership over reinvention. The desire for continuity limits Iger's ability to make sweeping changes in his final months. "Typically, CEOs will try very hard to exit on a high note," said Laurent Yoon, US media and telecom analyst at Bernstein.</p>

This means it benefits from the same fear-driven demand that lifts gold, while also being tied to long-term themes such as electrification, solar energy, and electronics. A physical short squeeze in London last year amplified the surge after inventories were left unusually thin by large flows of metal into US vaults amid tariff concerns. Even so, it may take time before slower buying and the use of existing stockpiles become visible enough to change the broader narrative around silver's boom, Hansen wrote. "Every rally eventually meets its limit, and for silver, the most likely brake is industrial demand destruction," wrote Hansen.</p>

When Motolani Adedipe moved from Oklahoma to Seoul, South Korea, in August, she didn't just pack her suitcase — she brought along her 6-year-old daughter, newborn baby, and mom. Adedipe, who is from Nigeria and moved to the US to attend grad school in Texas, first grew curious about South Korea while interning at a biotech firm in Boston, where she shared an apartment with a Korean roommate. "For that summer, I ate a lot of Korean food. She put me on K-dramas," Adedipe, now 39, told Business Insider. That early curiosity soon grew into an interest in Korea's history, economy, and language. Adedipe began learning Korean nine years ago online and continued after she moved to Oklahoma for work, where she became an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.

But of course, the anxiety, how do we start planning now?" "It required faith, sacrifice, structure, and for both of us to really imagine a life that looked very different from what we had planned," she said. Her physician husband couldn't accompany her to South Korea, but they agreed that she would bring both daughters along. "How many of her peers would ever say, 'Oh, I took a gap year in Korea'?" Her husband has visited them in South Korea several times and plans to make more trips over the coming months. "I saw it as an opportunity for my children to experience another culture, language, and way of life, while still having a clear sense of return," Adedipe said. Now, she homeschools her daughter in the morning before sending her to a "hagwon," a type of private academy that many Korean students attend after school. As she searched for housing, Adedipe had a long checklist: enough space for her family, easy access to the subway, flat streets her mother, in her early 60s, could navigate, and a neighborhood that felt safe for kids. Although the apartment was smaller than she initially hoped for, it turned out to be a great fit: It's surrounded by greenery and about a 30-minute commute to her workplace. She goes into her office at Seoul National University Hospital several times a week, while continuing to supervise her lab in Oklahoma remotely at night. A US veteran who had retired in South Korea previously told Business Insider that he appreciated the country's safety and culture of respect. Meanwhile, a millennial who moved from Switzerland to Seoul said she valued the convenience of city life, including how most stores stay open late. One of the biggest adjustments, Adedipe said, has been the extent to which technology is deeply woven into daily life in Seoul. Nearly everything is tied to having a registered phone number. Even though the city is known for its fast-paced lifestyle, Adedipe says she's been surprised by its human side. That could never happen in the US," she said. Watching her daughter flourish and adapt to their life in Seoul has been especially meaningful. "She's doing everything that I never could have been able to give her because in Oklahoma, if you're doing all those classes, you have to drive your kids to all those classes," she said. "But here in Korea, because of how the education is structured, she does all of that in a school, and she loves it." Living abroad with her mother has brought them closer. After leaving Nigeria for the US in her 20s, Adedipe went nearly eight years without seeing her mom because of visa issues. "And now that I get to live with her again, it's like a dream come true," she said. Looking back on her own experience, Adedipe says living and working in South Korea has felt like a "full circle moment," after years of interest in the country. "It felt like all the pieces of my life — research, storytelling, culture, and well-being — were suddenly being invited into the same room," she said.</p>
