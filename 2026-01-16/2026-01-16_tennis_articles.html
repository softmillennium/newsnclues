                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz arrives at the 2026 Australian Open with more than just the year's first major trophy in his sights. 1 is playing for a chance to complete the Career Grand Slam and join another exclusive list. 1 Club member — to win all four major titles at least once. Alcaraz would join Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Rod Laver famously captured all four majors in a single season in 1969, but the PIF ATP Rankings were not introduced until 1973. Since then, only four men have completed the Career Grand Slam, each carving a unique path through tennis history. “That was a day, in between the lines of a tennis court, when I knew I wouldn't have any more regrets,” Agassi reflected to Tennis Channel last year. It was one I could have won 10 years earlier a couple of times.” During his career, Agassi won eight major titles and spent 101 weeks at World No. Roger Federer Federer also completed his Career Grand Slam at Roland Garros, in 2009, when he finally conquered the one major that had eluded him. His straight-sets victory over Robin Soderling came after years of three consecutive final losses to great rival Rafael Nadal. The Swiss legend lifted 20 major trophies, including winning the other three major trophies at least five times each during his career. He reached the Roland Garros final once more in 2011, but was stopped for a fourth time by Nadal. Roger Federer wins the 2009 Roland Garros title. By winning the 2022 Australian Open, Nadal achieved the Career Grand Slam twice, winning each of the four majors at least two times — a testament to his adaptability beyond a record 14 Roland Garros titles. The Spaniard finished his career with 22 Grand Slam trophies and an enduring reputation for competitive intensity. Novak Djokovic Djokovic completed his Career Grand Slam at Roland Garros 2016, joining Federer and Nadal in a golden era defined by historic Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalries. He had fallen in three previous finals — two to Nadal (2012, ‘14) and one to Stan Wawrinka (2015) — but made no mistake with a four-set comeback win over Andy Murray. “It's incredibly flattering to know that Rod Laver is the last one that managed to do that,” said Djokovic, who held all four major titles at the same time. “There are not many words that can describe it. It's one of the ultimate challenges that you have as a tennis player. Djokovic would go on to complete the Career Grand Slam three times, becoming the only man in history to do so. Novak Djokovic celebrates winning the 2016 Roland Garros title. Alcaraz at the Crossroads Now, six-time major champion Alcaraz stands on the brink of joining this elite group. “It's my first goal, to be honest,” Alcaraz said after his triumph at the 2025 US Open, referring to completing the Career Grand Slam. “It is always the main goal for me to complete a Career Grand Slam, Calendar Grand Slam… So it's going to be great.” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

I think this is what tennis sometimes needs, to put the events out like that. Yeah, playing against Flavio was super fun. Honestly, I like to play against guys.

At 24 years old Swiatek, who began the year with a win for Poland at the United Cup, is part of a trio that includes Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner of active players with victories at three of the four major tournaments. But that's a narrative Swiatek insists she's not thinking too much about.“I think you guys are thinking more about it,” she said through another awkward—but decidedly less tense—exchange. “Since the beginning of the year, there are many people coming to me and talking to me about it. I'm really just focusing on, like, day-by-day work. This is how it's always been for me. This is how I actually was able to achieve the success that I already have, just focusing really on grinding, match by match.Winning a Grand Slam is tough. Obviously, it would be a dream come true. This is not, like, my clear goal that I wake up with. I'm thinking more about how I want to play, what I want to improve, like, day by day.”That day by day process will begin on Monday against Yuan Yue—an opponent about whom Swiatek will no doubt be duly informed. “I think you guys are thinking more about it,” she said through another awkward—but decidedly less tense—exchange. “Since the beginning of the year, there are many people coming to me and talking to me about it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many tennis fans have done a double take watching clips of Carlos Alcaraz's new service motion on social media in recent days. ‘Where have I seen that serve before? Could the Spaniard be channeling the technique of someone with even more Grand Slam titles than himself? When a reporter asked about the new motion in his Australian Open pre-tournament press conference Friday, Alcaraz was ready to have a little fun. I know you want to,” Alcaraz bantered. “I wasn't thinking about making the same serve as Djokovic. “I think everyone has to make changes, small details. For me the serve is something that I really want to be better every year, in every tournament. I'm just putting constant work on the serve.” Alcaraz is not in danger of losing his grip on the No. 1 PIF ATP Ranking this fortnight, even if rival Jannik Sinner completes an Australian Open three-peat. But that doesn't mean the 22-year-old is lacking purpose at Melbourne Park: He will attempt to become the youngest player in history to complete the career Grand Slam. “As I said before, this is my main goal for this year,” said Alcaraz, who already has won $60m in his young career. I'm really excited about the tournament beginning.” Alcaraz, who last year fell in the quarter-finals to Novak Djokovic, plays his first match against Australian Adam Walton on Day 1, Sunday. He is seeded to meet another Aussie, Alex de Minaur, in the quarter-finals. With Sinner and Djokovic in the bottom half of the draw, potential semi-final opponents for Alcaraz include No. Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the past eight Grand Slam titles in the past two seasons and have gone head-to-head in the past three major finals, with the Spaniard winning Roland Garros and the US Open and Sinner triumphing at Wimbledon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia—Roger Federer will bid a proper farewell to the Australian Open ahead of the 2026 tournament on Saturday, competing alongside ATP legends Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt, and Pat Rafter for a “Battle of the world No. 1s” doubles match that kicks off the event's inaugural Opening Ceremony.The six-time champion, who famously coined the “Happy Slam” nickname for the Australian Open, will be back on Rod Laver Arena for the first time since 2020, having officially retired from the sport at the 2022 Laver Cup.“I'm nervous, I'm excited, I'm happy I'm here,” Federer said in a press conference moderated by former ATP doubles No. He was one of my favorite players. Then Andre, I was fortunate enough to play against him maybe 10 times or so. Just being together with those guys is going to make me feel better, as well.“I have great memories of just being here,” he added. “It's been an incredible tournament for me and one of my favorite places to play tennis.” He was one of my favorite players.

Tennis is part of that.”Federer took a stroll down memory lane during the press conference, recalling a particularly iconic point that helped him win the 2017 Australian Open, but confessed that nostalgia for his playing days isn't as strong as some might assume.“If I would have won half of what I've done, I'd be equally proud sitting here because I achieved way more than I ever thought I would,” said Federer. “It's hard to make it a priority in the schedule when you have four children and so many other things going on,” said Federer, who for now prefers competing in doubles rather than singles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia—Sloane Stephens will be the first to tell you that ebbs and flows are natural parts of a tennis career.“In my career, I've had ups and downs that have been exciting, not exciting, anticlimactic, all the things,” Stephens said with a smile after booking her spot in the 2026 Australian Open main draw. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. “In my career, I've had ups and downs that have been exciting, not exciting, anticlimactic, all the things,” Stephens said with a smile after booking her spot in the 2026 Australian Open main draw. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. But even Stephens, a 32-year-old former Grand Slam champion currently ranked No. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. “I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. That journey took the 2017 US Open winner off tour for much of the last 12 months as she dealt with a persistent foot injury. Playing just six matches in 2025, Stephens watched tennis from the literal sidelines as an analyst for various networks, watching the game evolve—but remain recognizable—in her absence.“When you don't play a lot, there's a little lull. You don't feel as competitive and you don't feel as attached to the game,” she explained. “So, it was just being able to get back, train really hard, and play and have fun on court at home. Then, I was able to translate that into a match.”After starting the 2026 season with a three-set defeat at the ASB Classic, Stephens—along with her mom, aunt, and coach Kamau Murray—traveled to Melbourne early to compete in qualifying for the first time since 2011. For reference, the last time Stephens didn't gain direct acceptance into a Grand Slam main draw, the Harry Potter and Twilight film series were still in theaters.“I think I was the only Grand Slam champion to be in qualies, which was interesting,” Stephens said with a still-formidable side eye. I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.” You don't feel as competitive and you don't feel as attached to the game,” she explained. “So, it was just being able to get back, train really hard, and play and have fun on court at home.

I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.” She figured it out with few issues over three rounds, rallying from a set down to defeat Australian Olivia Gadecki on Wednesday and holding off a late surge to solve No. 2 seed Lucia Bronzetti to guarantee a 14th main-draw appearance in Melbourne.“It was weird to be in qualies and wonder how it even worked,” mused Stephens. “I didn't even know we played back-to-back from yesterday to today. A lot of times in my career, I haven't been afraid to put myself out there, win or lose. Sometimes you get rewarded and sometimes you don't.”Where past years have been rife with stress, the 2013 semifinalist is taking a different approach on the court and behind the scenes, vlogging her trip to Melbourne in a rare peek behind the curtain into Stephens' off-court life.“I would have never shown anything like that ever in life,” Stephens laughed. Being on the other side and doing TV and stuff, I can see how fans would want to see those kinds of moments.“Definitely one of the goals this year is just to have more fun and to enjoy it. “I didn't even know we played back-to-back from yesterday to today.

As mom Sybil texted near the small interview scrum, Stephens showed off her Free People Movement tennis dress, a lacey yellow ensemble evocative of Ted Tinling's iconic designs.“This was made in my living room, and it took about four fittings,” claimed Stephens, lifting her sweatshirt to show off the intricacies. “Maria Sakkari asked me if it was even a tennis dress and I was like, ‘Yeah girl. Free People Movement, they're growing and they're like the cool kids in town.”Win or lose, that's a role Stephens has inhabited flawlessly in over a decade on tour. “This was made in my living room, and it took about four fittings,” claimed Stephens, lifting her sweatshirt to show off the intricacies.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have played in the finals of the last three majors, and as they head toward their mid-20s, they're only getting better. Who could possibly derail a fourth straight final-round collision?126 other players will do their best starting on Sunday in Melbourne (Saturday evening Eastern Time). 126 other players will do their best starting on Sunday in Melbourne (Saturday evening Eastern Time). 👉 Bookmark: Where to watch the 2026 AO on Tennis Channel We'll see how he handles not hearing his voice.Read: Instant reaction to the men's draw reveal We'll see how he handles not hearing his voice.Read: Instant reaction to the men's draw reveal We'll see how he handles not hearing his voice.Read: Instant reaction to the men's draw reveal In the third round he might face either Corentin Moutet or Seb Korda. 6 Alex De Minaur is scheduled to be his quarterfinal foe.

Last year he dropped just two sets on the way to the title, and won his semifinal and final in lop-sided fashion. It's hard to think of a player in the field, outside of Alcaraz, who could be called a credible threat to Sinner at this tournament right now.He'll start against 94th-ranked Hugo Gaston; Sinner is 2-0 against him. In the third round, he could play 28th seed Joao Fonseca, who made a splash at this tournament last year; they've never met. His draw likely suits him, too, whoever is in it.
