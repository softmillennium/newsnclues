                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Make a list of complex animals as distantly related to humans as possible, and sea anemones would likely be near the top of the list. So it's surprising that this species in the phylum Cnidarians (along with jellyfish, corals, and other sea creatures) contains an ancient blueprint for bilaterians, of which Homo sapiens are a card-carrying member. “Not all Bilateria use Chordin-mediated BMP shuttling, for example, frogs do, but fish don't, however, shuttling seems to pop up over and over again in very distantly related animals making it a good candidate for an ancestral patterning mechanism,” University of Vienna's David Mörsdorf, a lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “The fact that not only bilaterians but also sea anemones use shuttling to shape their body axes, tells us that this mechanism is incredibly ancient.” To put it simply, BMPs are a kind of molecular messenger that signals to embryonic cells where they are in the body and what kind of tissue they should form. Local inhibition from an inhibitor named Chordin (which can also act as a shuttle) along with BMP shuttling creates gradients of BMP in the body. Mörsdorf and his colleagues found that Chordin also acts as a BMP shuttle—just as displayed in bilaterians like flies and frogs. Thi signals that this particular evolutionary trait likely developed before Cnidarians and bilaterians diverged. Seeing as these two phylums of the animal kingdom have vastly different biological structures, that divergence occurred long ago, likely 600 to 700 million years ago. “We might never be able to exclude the possibility that bilaterians and bilaterally symmetric cnidarians evolved their bilateral body plans independently,” University of Vienna's Grigory Genikhovich, a senior author of the study, said in a press statement. “However, if the last common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria was a bilaterally symmetric animal, chances are that it used Chordin to shuttle BMPs to make its back-to-belly axis.” We May Have Just Found a Hidden Shipwreck We May Have the Evolutionary Timeline All Wrong</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because Kazakhstan sits at such a crossroad of history, it's also one of the most archaeologically rich places on Earth—and a new discovery by unsuspecting fire crews once again proves this fact. While patrolling the Sandyktau region, an area located some 200 miles northwest of Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, Nursultan Ashkenov and Akhmet Zaripov, both employees of the district fire service, stumbled upon an austere face carved into the side of a granite boulder. The face is around 10.5 inches long and roughly 8 inches wide, and some archeologists hypothesize that the carving was likely part of some ritual complex. “The face is clearly visible,” Sergey Yarygin, a scientist at the Alkey Margulan Institute of Archaeology, said to Archaeology Magazine (click link to see images), “with large eyes, a long straight nose, and protruding lips. However, figuring out when this face was used for such ritualistic purposes is a bit more complicated. According to Yarygin, similar carvings have been found at Bronze Age sites across Central Asia and Western Europe, but the carving also holds a striking resemblance to other types of iconography found in Iron Age sites in southern Siberia or even medieval Turkish cultures. The mysteries of Kazakhstan's historical melange strike again. Teams investigating the carving will likely need more time to determine its age and what culture might've created the stunningly somber carving. Archaeologists uncovered a number of artifacts from the northwestern Pavlodar region, including pottery fragments, kitchen utensils, and an arrowhead dated to around the mid-13th to 8th century BCE. Other discoveries in the central Karaganda region also point to a variety of artifacts likely belonging to the Alakul culture, a subculture of the Andronovo culture, that thrived in this region around 2000 to 1700 BCE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from Nagoya University in Japan has identified a previously overlooked risk associated with widely used eye ointments. The study shows that petrolatum-based eye ointments can cause a popular glaucoma implant to swell and, in some cases, rupture. Using both patient cases and laboratory testing, the researchers demonstrated that these ointments can compromise the PRESERFLO MicroShunt, a device currently used to treat glaucoma in more than 60 countries. Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that damages the optic nerve and can result in permanent vision loss. Researchers estimate that glaucoma affects approximately 76 million people worldwide. One treatment option is the MicroShunt, a tiny filtration device surgically implanted in the eye to help excess fluid drain more effectively. Compared with traditional glaucoma surgeries, the MicroShunt is associated with fewer post-operative complications and often reduces the need for ongoing medication. This material is designed to be flexible, highly biocompatible, and less likely to cause inflammation or scarring inside the eye. Because it has a strong affinity for oils, petrolatum-based eye ointments can penetrate the implant. The MicroShunt manufacturer specifically cautions against this type of exposure. According to the instructions, "the MicroShunt should not be subjected to direct contact with petrolatum-based (i.e., petrolatum jelly) materials, such as ointments and dispersions." Despite this guidance, the warning is not always widely recognized or consistently followed in clinical settings. "Swollen MicroShunts can be structurally fragile," said ophthalmologist and Assistant Professor Ryo Tomita of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, the study's first author. If more clinicians are aware of this risk, they will be able to prevent similar problems." To investigate the issue more closely, Tomita worked with Assistant Professor Taiga Inooka and Associate Professor Kenya Yuki from Nagoya University Hospital and the Graduate School of Medicine. They collaborated with Dr. Takato Kajita and Junior Associate Professor Atsushi Noro from the Graduate School of Engineering to study how the MicroShunt changes after contact with petrolatum-based eye ointments. The results were published in Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology. The clinical analysis involved seven glaucoma patients whose MicroShunt implants were later removed for various reasons. A clear pattern emerged based on whether the implant had been exposed to petrolatum-based ointment. All three devices showed noticeable swelling, and two of them had ruptured. They recommend considering alternative post-operative treatments and note that further studies are needed to determine whether swelling affects implant performance even when rupture does not occur. "Our study found that commonly used medical materials can cause unexpected complications if their chemical properties and usage environments are not fully understood," Noro stated. "From both medical and engineering perspectives, we emphasize the importance of understanding the chemical properties of medical materials and appropriately managing their usage environments."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 14,400 years, the final meal of a Siberian wolf pup has contributed massively to science and our understanding of the now-extinct woolly rhinoceros. For the first time ever, researchers have sequenced an entire genome of an Ice Age animal thanks to what was found inside the stomach of another animal. Over a decade ago, a pair of Siberian wolf pups were pulled from the permafrost near the village of Tumat in northeast Siberia. The woolly rhino was a cold-adapted herbivore with a robust coat of hair that allowed it to better survive the harsh temperatures, though they still evidently fall prey to a hungry wolf pup (more likely an entire hungry wolf pack). “Sequencing the entire genome of an Ice Age animal found in the stomach of another animal has never been done before,” said Camilo Chacon-Duque, study author and formerly a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, in a statement. “Recovering genomes from individuals that lived right before extinction is challenging, but it can provide important clues on what caused the species to disappear, which may also be relevant for the conservation of endangered species today.” The team compared genome-wide diversity, inbreeding, genetic load, and population size changes in the new sample with two other Late Pleistocene Siberian woolly rhinos, one sample from around 18,000 years ago and the other from about 49,000 years ago. “It was really exciting, but also very challenging, to extract a complete genome from such an unusual sample,” said student Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir, the study's lead author who worked on the project while doing her master's thesis at Stockholm University. “Our analyses showed a surprisingly stable genetic pattern with no change in inbreeding levels through tens of thousands of years prior to the extinction of woolly rhinos,” said Edna Lord, formerly a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics. “We found no evidence of population size decline, nor any genomic erosion, shortly prior to the species' demise,” the study authors wrote. “Given the few long homozygous segments, typically indicative of recent inbreeding, we infer a stable population size only a few centuries before extinction.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers Spot Mysterious Bar-Shaped Cloud of Iron Inside an Iconic Nebula The Ring Nebula is a sight to behold. Located in the constellation Lyra, this kaleidoscopic doughnut of gas is the dying echo of a star not too unlike our sun. Astronomers spotted it using the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) in Spain using an optical spectrometer called the WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE). “When we processed the data and scrolled through the images, one thing popped out as clear as anything—this previously unknown bar of ionized iron atoms, in the middle of the familiar and iconic ring,” said Roger Wesson, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales and lead author of the new paper, in a statement.

Humanoid robots are on the brink of being commercially useful, say Chinese and US firms that have announced plans to produce them at scale in the past three months. In November, Chinese firm UBTECH announced that it had made “the world's first mass delivery of humanoid robots”. Whether humanoids are saving companies time or money remains to be seen. Battery time is limited to hours and many activities still require human operators, who use the robots as puppets to complete tasks while gathering data for future iterations. “They can do maybe one or two things autonomously, or semi-autonomously,” says Esyin Chew, a roboticist at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom, who is overseeing a project involving trialling more than 80 robots in service and health-care settings. “But they cannot react to real-world problems like our human brains,” she says. The AI revolution is coming to robots: how will it change them? The AI revolution is coming to robots: how will it change them? “A humanoid will fall over if it loses power,” he says. Humanoids are much closer to this dream than a decade ago, he says, thanks to denser batteries that fuel bots for hours rather than minutes, cheaper and more precise actuators (that convert electricity to movement) and AI learning algorithms in robot control systems. Developers are increasingly making use of generative models that enable robots to 'reason' and make sense of the world, as well as imbue them with the ability to learn tasks for which they are not pre-programmed. Some US robotics developers, including Boston Dynamics and Tesla, are running pilots of humanoid robots in their parent company's industrial plants. The automotive industry is “an ideal setting” in which to apply humanoids, says Carolina Parada, based in Boulder, Colorado, who leads the robotics team at Google DeepMind, which last week announced a partnership with Boston Dynamics. UBTECH and Boston Dynamics are applying the same technique in vast data-collection centres, in which humans remotely operate humanoid robots to teach them to perform a range of tasks. Factories in the country are willing to let UBTECH test out and improve their robots, says Zheng. The AI revolution is coming to robots: how will it change them?

Despite advances in lipid-lowering treatment, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality, underscoring the need to address residual risk. Targeting both the synthesis and clearance of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins is a promising approach. Liver X receptor (LXR) repression can reduce plasma TG and cholesterol and improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing de novo lipogenesis and intestinal lipid absorption and enhancing clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins, but its clinical utility remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate the role of LXR inverse agonists in lipid metabolism and metabolic diseases in preclinical models and humans. Given concerns that systemic LXR repression may impair reverse cholesterol transport, we developed TLC-2716, an orally administered, gut- and liver-restricted LXR inverse agonist. In human liver organoids modeling steatohepatitis, TLC-2716 reduced lipid accumulation and suppressed inflammation and fibrotic gene expression. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial, 14-day treatment with TLC-2716 was well tolerated (primary endpoints) and resulted in placebo-adjusted reductions up to 38.5% in plasma TG and 61% in postprandial remnant cholesterol (secondary endpoints). In conclusion, these results highlight the tolerability and therapeutic potential of TLC-2716 as a treatment for managing dyslipidemia and reducing residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in humans. Dyslipidemia encompasses a broad spectrum of lipid abnormalities, including hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride (TG) > 150 mg dl−1, a common dyslipidemia in adults1), elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Excessive circulating TG contributes to metabolic disorders, including acute pancreatitis2, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)3 and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)4. Elevated remnant cholesterol (RC), which represents the cholesterol in TG-rich lipoproteins, is also an independent risk factor for ASCVD5. Currently, management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg dl−1) focuses on lifestyle modification and fibrates as first-line therapy6. Given the increasing prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, research into more effective treatment strategies remains essential. Hypertriglyceridemia results from an imbalance between the production and release of TG-rich lipoproteins from the liver (very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)) and intestine (chylomicrons) and lipolytic removal of TG from these lipoproteins and their remnants5. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the main enzyme involved in hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins, and its activity is inhibited by apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) and angiopoietin-like proteins (for example, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4); therapies that inhibit ANGPTLs and ApoC3 to reduce plasma TG are under investigation7,8,9. Furthermore, inhibiting de novo lipogenesis (DNL)10 provides another strategy to reduce serum TG and potentially tissue inflammation attributable to lipotoxic mediators11. The liver X receptors (LXRs; LXRα (encoded by NR1H3) and LXRβ (encoded by NR1H2)) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and key transcriptional regulators of systemic lipid metabolism12,13. By contrast, repression of LXR activity in the liver reduces hepatic DNL and, consequently, plasma and liver TG and improves hypertriglyceridemia and related comorbidities in preclinical models19. Therapies that inhibit LXR target genes involved in lipogenesis (for example, ACACA and FASN) and lipid clearance (for example, ANGPTL3 and APOC3) show promising safety and efficacy in clinical trials20. Repression of LXR systemically carries potential risks, including the impairment of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells such as macrophages, which could promote atherogenesis and negatively impact cardiometabolic health21. In fact, LXR agonists increase ABCA1 expression and RCT22,23 and reduce atherosclerosis in mice24, but their clinical development was hindered by parallel increases in plasma TG and LDL-C. Together, these data formed the basis for the development of LXR inverse agonists that have shown beneficial effects on hyperlipidemia25, alcoholic liver disease26,27 or MASLD28 preclinically. However, to date, no LXR inverse agonist has been evaluated in humans. Here, we leveraged human genetic data, dysmetabolic rodent models, humanized experimental models, toxicology studies and a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of TLC-2716, an orally administered LXR inverse agonist, which to date has not been tested in humans19,29. In dysmetabolic rodents, TLC-2716 and an analog (TLC-6665) reduced serum and liver TG and plasma cholesterol; these results were validated in humanized liver mice and a human liver organoid (HLO) model of steatohepatitis. Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment of TLC-2716 revealed that its activity is primarily restricted to the liver and gut, thereby avoiding inhibition of peripheral RCT and reducing atherogenic risk. The preclinical safety of TLC-2716 was confirmed in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) toxicology studies, and its preliminary tolerability, efficacy and PK were demonstrated in a phase 1 trial in healthy participants. In conclusion, LXR repression by TLC-2716 improved lipid homeostasis without notable adverse effects (in preclinical studies and humans), supporting its further clinical development for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and associated cardiometabolic disorders. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the UK Biobank (UKBB)30,31. As expected32, genetic variants within NR1H3, but not NR1H2 (Extended Data Fig. 1a), are associated with lipid biomarkers, such as TG, HDL-C and ApoA, glucose and plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Fig. In two other unrelated human populations (FinnGen33 and the Million Veteran Program34), GWAS results confirmed the associations between genetic variants within NR1H3, but not NR1H2, and its target genes (for example, APOC3, APOE, IDOL and ACACA) and metabolism-related phenotypic traits, including hyperlipidemia and plasma TG (Extended Data Fig. Fine-mapping indicated that rs61731956, an NR1H3 locus, might be the potential causal signal for HDL-C and ApoA. Burden testing also suggested a link between NR1H3 function and lipid metabolism (Extended Data Fig. a, Lollipop plot showing the association between genetic variants within NR1H3 and metabolic-related phenotypic traits based on whole-exome sequencing (WES) data in the human UKBB.

The P value is two sided, and associations with a BH-adjusted P value of <0.1 are shown. We also analyzed human liver gene expression data from Gene Expression Omnibus35, Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx)36 and the Human Liver Cohort37. Consistent with previous studies, expression of NR1H3 correlated positively with genes associated with amino acid, fatty acid, TG and cholesterol metabolism, indicating its essential role in lipid regulation (Fig. However, associations between lipid metabolism and NR1H2 were less robust (Extended Data Fig. We then explored two human MASLD datasets38,39 and found that hepatic expression of NR1H3 is increased in individuals with MASLD Activity Scores (NAS) from 1 to 7, compared with those without MASLD (NAS = 0; Fig. Moreover, half of LXR target genes are upregulated in individuals with advanced hepatic fibrosis (stage > 2; Fig. Consistently, hepatic expression of LXR target genes, such as Fasn, Scd1 and Acaca, positively correlates with liver steatosis and liver TG in MASLD mouse models, whereas Srebf1 expression positively correlates with plasma TG40 (Extended Data Fig. In addition, we performed Mendelian randomization to test whether changes in NR1H3 expression are causally linked to lipid homeostasis. We confirmed that higher NR1H3 expression in blood causes an increase in TG in humans, and its expression is also associated with HDL-C and liver disease markers (Fig. 41) are two LXR inverse agonists. Information on these compounds is available in patent US11970484B2 (ref. Their potencies against LXRα and LXRβ were evaluated in biochemical binding assays, cellular mammalian two-hybrid interaction assays evaluating nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCOR) recruitment and cellular reporter assays evaluating transcriptional activity (Fig. Repression of LXR activity by TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced intracellular TG accumulation in primary human Upcyte hepatocytes with an EC50 of 289 ± 34 nM via inhibition of DNL19 (Fig. IC50, half-maximal inhibitory concentration; M2H, mammalian two-hybrid. b, TLC-2716 lowers lipid droplet accumulation in primary human Upcyte hepatocytes (PH).

Data were analyzed by two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test and BH adjustment (c–f and j–l), two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test (g and h) or two-way analysis of variance with Sidak's multiple comparisons test (i). Box plots indicate the median (center line), IQR (box bounds, 25th and 75th percentiles), and smallest and largest values within 1.5× IQR (whiskers; d–f, j and k). To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LXR inverse agonists in vivo, we used three different dysmetabolic rodent models, including high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice, HFD-fed Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and HFD-fed Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (Extended Data Fig. In these models, TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced hepatic expression of DNL genes and plasma and liver TG (Fig. The area under curve (AUC) for plasma TG and total cholesterol (TC) was significantly reduced at the highest dose of TLC-2716 (1 mg per kg (body weight) per day) in DIO mice and ZDF rats (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. Importantly, TLC-2716 did not impact liver injury biomarkers, including plasma alanine transaminase (Extended Data Fig. 3d) or aspartate aminotransferase (Extended Data Fig. Similarly, TLC-6665 also inhibited hepatic expression of DNL genes (Extended Data Fig. In addition to direct effects on hepatic lipid synthesis, LXR repression exerts pleiotropic effects to reduce dyslipidemia. TLC-6665 reduced intestinal lipid absorption, measured by the uptake of 3H-labeled triolein tracer, in DIO mice (Fig. Further, TLC-2716 dose dependently inhibited ileal Srebp1c expression in DIO mice (Fig. In ZDF rats, TLC-2716 reduced hepatic Angptl3 expression and plasma levels of ANGPTL3 (Fig. Similarly, liver expression of Angptl3, Angptl4 and Angptl8, as well as Apoc1, Apoc2 and Apoc3, was suppressed by TLC-6665 in ZDF rats (Fig. Together, these data confirm that LXR inverse agonists improve dyslipidemia via multiple mechanisms, including direct inhibition of lipid synthesis in the liver (Fig. 2j), reduced intestinal absorption of dietary lipids (Fig. 2i) and increased lipid clearance from circulation (Fig. The therapeutic effects of our LXR inverse agonists in MASLD were evaluated in the choline-deficient HFD and sodium nitrite rat model42 (Extended Data Fig. Over 6 weeks of treatment, TLC-6665 decreased liver fibrosis (assessed histologically with picrosirius red staining; Extended Data Fig. Liver TG (Extended Data Fig. 5e) and hepatic expression of DNL-related genes, stellate cell activation genes and fibrogenesis-related genes (Timp1) were also reduced (Extended Data Fig. The effect of LXR repression by TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight) per day) on insulin sensitivity in DIO mice was assessed after 4 weeks of treatment using a two-step hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp, where pioglitazone (30 mg per kg (body weight) per day) served as a positive control. The glucose infusion rate was higher in mice on TLC-6665 than in those treated with vehicle and was noninferior to pioglitazone, indicating enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. Hepatic glucose production suppression with TLC-6665 trended to be similarly reduced to pioglitazone during the 8 mU kg−1 min−1 insulin infusion (Extended Data Fig. Glucose utilization by muscle was also higher with TLC-6665, particularly in the oxidative soleus muscle (Extended Data Fig. A higher dose of TLC-2716 (15 mg per kg (body weight) per day) also improved glucose homeostasis in ZDF rats, as evidenced by an approximately 56% reduction in fasting plasma glucose after four weeks of treatment (Extended Data Fig. LXR inverse agonists hence improve insulin sensitivity in dysmetabolic rodents. Because cholesterol metabolism differs between rodents and humans, humanized liver chimeric PXB mice were used to confirm the effects of TLC-2716 on lipid metabolism43. TLC-2716 trended to reduce hepatic TG, despite the short duration (8 days) of dosing (Extended Data Fig. Moreover, hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol and TG metabolism was suggestively reduced (adjusted P < 0.1) with TLC-2716 (Extended Data Fig. Specifically, TLC-2716 reduced the expression of HMGCR, indicative of reduced cholesterol synthesis, and genes involved in hepatic LDL-C uptake (PCSK9 and IDOL) and bile acids synthesis (CYP7A1). Reductions in the expression of ANGPTL3 and DNL-associated genes were also observed with TLC-2716 (Extended Data Fig. The effect of TLC-2716 on lipid accumulation was also evaluated in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived HLOs established from human donors with different genetic backgrounds, including those with a known risk variant for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH; the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) rs1260326: C (GCKRCC) > T variant (GCKRTT))44. These HLOs were exposed to high concentrations of oleate for 3 days to induce a MASH-like phenotype (steatotic HLOs (sHLOs)) and then treated with TLC-2716 or vehicle (Fig. TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced intracellular lipid content in sHLOs (Fig. RNA sequencing revealed that sHLOs with different GCKR genotypes were segregated by principal component 1 (PC1), whereas PC2 separated sHLOs by TLC-2716 (5 µM; Fig. Gene set enrichment analysis further illustrated that TLC-2716 suppressed the expression of LXR-associated genes (Fig. 3e) and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis, with a more pronounced effect in the GCKRTT sHLOs, wherein lipid biosynthesis is upregulated45,46 (Fig. a, Schematic showing the experimental pipeline of studies in sHLOs. b, Representative images of lipid accumulation in sHLOs. Experiments were repeated four times, and similar results were observed. c, Dose-dependent reduction in lipid accumulation in sHLOs treated with TLC-2716 for 3 days.

Data are shown as mean ± s.d. h, Expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, metabolism and efflux/transport in liver, ileum and buffy coat in DIO mice dosed with TLC-2716 (0.3 and 1 mg per kg (body weight)) for 3 weeks (n = 6 per group). Significance was calculated using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test and adjusted by the BH method. Box plots indicate the median (center line), IQR (box bounds, 25th and 75th percentiles), and smallest and largest values within 1.5× IQR (whiskers; c and h). Plasma and tissue (liver and ileum) concentrations of TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 were evaluated in male DIO mice after 14 days of treatment. The compounds demonstrated different pharmacology in vivo, with TLC-2716 having lower plasma exposures and higher and sustained ileum and liver exposures (due to active uptake into hepatocytes) than TLC-6665 (ratio of AUCs of TLC-2716/TLC-6665 in plasma and liver of 0.17 and 6.24, respectively; Fig. TLC-2716 also dose dependently reduced the expression of transcripts involved in cholesterol synthesis (Hmgcr) in the liver and cholesterol efflux transporters (Abca1, Abcg5 and Abcg8) in the intestine (Fig. However, TLC-2716 did not alter the expression of the cholesterol efflux transporters Abca1 and Abcg1 in the buffy coat, the fraction of blood that primarily contains white blood cells (Fig. These data indicate that TLC-2716 acts primarily in the liver and intestine and does not inhibit LXR activity in white blood cells, which are responsible for RCT and associated with atherogenic risk. Given its lower plasma exposure, TLC-2716 was selected for clinical evaluation in the treatment of severe dyslipidemias and related disorders. The safety of TLC-2716 was assessed in preclinical toxicology studies in mice and NHPs. TLC-2716 was administered orally at 1, 5 and 15 mg per kg (body weight) per day (2- to 28-fold the maximum clinical dose based on allometric scaling) for 28 days to young, lean male and female NHPs. Dose-dependent reductions in plasma TG and TC were observed in TLC-2716-treated monkeys (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), without adverse clinical or histopathological observations at any tested doses. In mice, TLC-2716 was administered orally at 15, 60 and 120 mg per kg (body weight) per day (7- to 57-fold the maximum clinical dose) to lean male and female CD-1 mice for 26 weeks. Consistent with observations in dysmetabolic rodents, plasma TG and TC were reduced at all doses of TLC-2716 in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. No adverse clinical observations or changes in liver biochemistry or histopathology indicative of liver injury were present at any tested doses (Extended Data Fig. In both toxicology studies, the no-observed-adverse-effect level was the highest dose evaluated. Given the favorable efficacy and toxicological profile in preclinical species, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of TLC-2716 was conducted in humans (ClinicalTrials.govNCT05483998, from 27 July 2022 to 18 June 2023; Fig. TLC-2716 was first tested in a single-ascending dose (SAD) study in 50 healthy individuals in which single doses of up to 20 mg were well tolerated19,29 (Fig. To explore the PK and effect of multiple doses on safety-related endpoints and plasma lipids and biomarkers, another 50 healthy individuals were randomized into a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) trial (Fig. Participants were randomized to receive either placebo (two participants per dose) or TLC-2716 0.5, 2, 6 or 12 mg (eight participants per dose) orally once daily for 14 days. All doses were administered in a fed state except in an additional cohort of eight participants treated with 6 mg of TLC-2716 daily for 14 days after an overnight fast. PK analysis revealed a short half-life (mean t1/2 of 1.43–1.74 h) and time to maximal plasma concentration (mean tmax of 2.0–4.0 h) and low maximal plasma concentrations (mean Cmax of 0.95–6.37 ng ml−1) on day 14, consistent with rapid hepatic uptake of TLC-2716 (Extended Data Fig. a, Flow diagram for the CONSORT of the TLC-2716 phase 1 clinical trial. b,c, Baseline characterization of healthy participants enrolled in SAD and MAD cohorts in the phase 1 trial. Data are shown as median (minimum, maximum) or n (%). Following 14 days of treatment, TLC-2716 caused dose-dependent improvements in atherogenic plasma lipids (exploratory outcomes), including TG, RC, TC, non-HDL-C, LDL-C and the number of LDL and small LDL particles (Fig. Although a trend to reduced ApoB was noted (Fig. 5h), decreasing HDL-C in the placebo and the highest dose of TLC-2716 were observed (Fig. Consistent with preclinical improvement in insulin sensitivity, TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced the TG/HDL-C ratio47 and lipoprotein insulin resistance index (Lipo-IR)48, both exploratory surrogate markers of insulin resistance (Fig. a–k, Dot plots showing the therapeutic effect of 14 days of treatment with TLC-2716 at 0.5, 2, 6 or 12 mg on TG (a), RC (b), TC (c), non-HDL-C (d), LDL-C (e), the number of total LDL particles (f) and small LDL particles (g), ApoB (h), HDL-C (i), TG/HDL-C ratio (j) and Lipo-IR (k). The significance of comparisons between day 14 and day 1 within the same dose group was calculated by two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test and adjusted by the BH method, while the significance of relative (%) changes of each parameter following 14 days of treatment compared with placebo calculated by [(day 14 – day 1) / day 1] was calculated by two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test and adjusted by the BH method. The 6- and 12-mg doses of TLC-2716 had the most favorable effects on plasma lipids (Fig. Placebo-adjusted median percentage changes in TG from day 1 to day 14 were −37.6% (95% confidence interval (95% CI), −54.0 to −19.9) with 6 mg and −38.5% (95% CI, −67.9 to −7.2) with 12 mg (Fig. Likewise, placebo-adjusted reductions in RC in the 6- and 12-mg groups were −33.5% (95% CI, −50.3 to −16.9) and −29.5% (95% CI, −59.1 to 2.6), respectively, when measured predose (Fig. Finally, placebo-adjusted reductions in total LDL particles were robustly decreased: −20.3% (95% CI, −45.9 to −3.4) with the 6-mg dose and −36.5% (95% CI, −67.8 to −19.8) with the 12-mg dose (Fig. Corresponding placebo-adjusted reductions in the number of small LDL particles were −52.2% (−100.1 to 9.8) and −60.8% (−121.4 to 0.1), respectively (Fig. In exploratory analyses, reductions in TG, RC and LDL-C in participants treated with 6 or 12 mg of TLC-2716 were greatest in participants with higher baseline values of these parameters (Extended Data Fig. For example, in participants with baseline TG of ≥100 mg dl−1, the placebo-adjusted reductions in TG from day 1 to day 14 were −45.2% (95% CI, −61.3 to −27.9) with 6 mg and −60.8% (95% CI, −70.4 to −37.9) with 12 mg. In addition, both the 6- and 12-mg doses of TLC-2716 led to reductions in plasma levels of the LXR-related proteins ApoC3 and ANGPTL3 between days 1 and 14 (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), suggesting that the benefits of TLC-2716 are driven, at least in part, by the repression of LXR target genes, upregulation of LPL and increased clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins. Effects on RCT were assessed by measuring ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells on day 14, at predose (plasma TLC-2716 levels are undetectable) and 4 h postdose (approximate tmax of TLC-2716). TLC-2716 did not reduce the expression of either of these genes (Extended Data Fig. 8h), likely due to transient and low systemic exposure of the compound attributable to active hepatic uptake. TLC-2716 was well tolerated in this phase 1 study19,29. No clinically notable changes in vital signs or safety laboratory and electrocardiogram parameters, deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuations of study medication were reported. All treatment-emergent AEs in the TLC-2716 cohorts were mild (grade 1), except for a single moderate (grade 2) AE of thrombophlebitis in the 2-mg MAD group, which was considered unrelated to treatment. The most common AEs (reported in at least three participants overall) were mild diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, back pain and pruritus (Extended Data Fig. In general, the incidences of these AEs were similar between participants treated with placebo and TLC-2716 and were not dose dependent. First-generation LXR inverse agonists have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia and MASLD19,28. TLC-2716, developed based on this generation of LXR inverse agonists, has not been evaluated in humans, nor has any other compound of its kind19,29. Here, we demonstrated consistent metabolic benefits of an oral, gut- and liver-restricted LXR inverse agonist, TLC-2716, in rodent, NHP and HLO models and, ultimately, in healthy human participants, supporting the potential of this approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. As previously described32, genetic variants within NR1H3 are associated with lipid metabolism in human datasets, whereas such associations were not found for NR1H2. Similarly, hepatic expression of NR1H3 appears to play a more prominent role in regulating lipid metabolism, likely due to its greater hepatic expression than NR1H2 (ref. These observations may partially explain why Nr1h2-knockout mice exhibit lower plasma TG reductions in atherosclerosis models than Nr1h3-knockout mice49, further indicating the impact of LXR activity on the regulation of DNL and lipid metabolism12,50. Here, we used two LXR inverse agonists, TLC-2716 and an analog TLC-6665 (ref. 41), which potently suppress both LXRα and LXRβ. Both compounds reduced serum TG while improving cholesterol metabolism by three primary mechanisms: (1) repression of hepatic ANGPTL3 and APOC3 expression, causing increased LPL activity and clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins; (2) repression of hepatic SREBP1C, mediating reduced DNL and VLDL synthesis and release by the liver; and (3) reduced fatty acid absorption and chylomicron assembly in the intestine. Homeostasis of LXR activity plays an important role in maintaining global metabolic health. On the one hand, the LXR pathway is upregulated in metabolic diseases, including hypertriglyceridemia and MASLD (Fig. 1d), wherein exaggerated DNL leads to hepatic steatosis, lipotoxicity, inflammation and progressive fibrosis51. On the other hand, Nr1h3-knockout mice fed a high-cholesterol and/or HFD develop a MASH-like phenotype32,52,53. In two recent studies, knock-in mice carrying dominant-negative Nr1h3 mutations (W441F and W441R) exhibited more severe liver injury than Nr1h3-knockout mice following a MASH-inducing diet32,52. Overall, the exacerbation of liver damage caused by Nr1h3 loss-of-function/knockout or dominant-negative Nr1h3 mutations in MASH may be due to severely perturbed LXR activity in these settings. By contrast, LXR inverse agonists, which reduce the basal activity of this constitutively active receptor (favoring interaction with the co-repressor NCOR1), have demonstrated potential in reducing plasma lipids25 and hepatic fibrosis28. Here, two LXR inverse agonists reduced plasma TG and TC, without inducing a MASH-related phenotype in rodents or NHPs. In a MASH rat model, 6 weeks of LXR inverse agonist treatment reduced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis (Extended Data Fig. 5b–e), and, importantly, liver biochemistry remained stable with both short-term (2–3 weeks) and long-term (26 weeks) treatment (Extended Data Figs. RNA-sequencing analysis of sHLOs further confirmed that TLC-2716 does not elevate the expression of proinflammatory or profibrotic gene expression (Extended Data Fig. Indeed, consistent with alleviation of the MASH phenotype, the expression of fibrosis-related genes was downregulated following TLC-2716 treatment of sHLOs harboring a risk variant (GCKRTT) associated with enhanced lipogenesis (Fig. Together, our data provide evidence that LXR inverse agonists restore basal LXR homeostasis in dysmetabolic models, leading to improved lipid metabolism and hepato-protection. Dyslipidemia commonly accompanies insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and ectopic lipid accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle contributes causally to the development of insulin resistance54. Hence, we hypothesized that LXR inverse agonism may improve insulin sensitivity by reducing dyslipidemia. Indeed, TLC-2716 improved fasting glycemia in ZDF rats (Extended Data Fig. 5j), and TLC-6665 had comparable effects on insulin sensitivity to the approved PPARγ agonist pioglitazone55 in DIO mice (Extended Data Fig. These insulin-sensitizing effects of LXR repression may offer additional cardioprotective benefit to that attributable to improvements in circulating lipids56. Despite comparable therapeutic effects, TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 exhibit distinct PK profiles, with TLC-2716 showing restricted distribution to both the intestine and liver due to active uptake by hepatic transporters. The limited systemic activity of TLC-2716 likely minimizes the risk of disrupting RCT (as demonstrated by unchanged expression of relevant genes in rodents and humans) and potential proatherogenic effects that have been linked to systemic LXR repression21. These data provide a rationale for the evaluation of TLC-2716 to treat individuals with severe dyslipidemia and suggest that TLC-2716 may reduce residual cardiovascular risk due to benefits on both lipid and glucose metabolism. TLC-2716 was demonstrated to be safe in preclinical toxicology studies. In addition, all doses of TLC-2716 were safe and well tolerated in this phase 1 trial involving 100 healthy volunteers. TLC-2716 treatment for 14 days led to dose-dependent improvements in plasma TG and RC and other atherogenic lipids, including non-HDL-C and both total and small LDL particle number (Fig. Although these data must be interpreted cautiously due to our evaluation of healthy volunteers and multiple exploratory endpoints, we observed greater benefits of TLC-2716 in individuals with higher baseline lipids, potentially due to LXR upregulation in these individuals. For example, in individuals with baseline TG of ≥100 mg dl−1 or RC of ≥20 mg dl−1 (roughly one-half of included participants), TLC-2716 at 12 mg led to placebo-adjusted reductions in TG and RC of >60% after only 14 days of dosing. These improvements are within the range of other therapies that target TG-rich lipoproteins, including injectable inhibitors of ApoC3 (refs. 60), and support the potential of TLC-2716 to provide meaningful clinical benefit in individuals at risk for ASCVD. Inhibitors of ApoC3 and ANGPTL3 increase LDL-C concentrations, likely due to LPL-mediated conversion of TG-rich lipoproteins into LDL particles61. By contrast, the repression of LXR activity with TLC-2716 led to dose-dependent reductions in plasma LDL particles. This distinction, which is likely relevant from an ASCVD risk perspective, presumably reflects the pleiotropic mechanisms of LXR repression, including reductions in both ANGPTL3 and ApoC3 (as demonstrated in this study), decreased hepatic synthesis of TG-rich lipoproteins and reduced intestinal lipid absorption. Overall, the oral administration of TLC-2716 may offer a compelling advantage over these alternative therapies due to patient convenience, reduced cost and the potential to combine with other lipid-lowering therapies in fixed-dose oral combinations. Several additional findings of this phase 1 study warrant discussion. First, TLC-2716 caused dose-dependent reductions in the TG/HDL-C ratio and Lipo-IR index, both surrogate markers of insulin resistance, suggesting that TLC-2716 may improve insulin sensitivity, as observed in preclinical studies. However, because our study population comprised insulin-sensitive healthy volunteers, the potential benefits of TLC-2716 should be confirmed in insulin-resistant individuals with dyslipidemia. Similarly, because baseline lipids were relatively normal in these healthy volunteers and lipid-lowering therapies were contraindicated in this study, the benefits of TLC-2716 when added to background therapies for hypertriglyceridemia (for example, fibrates and statins) in individuals with disease require confirmation. Ultimately, these questions will be answered in upcoming phase 2 studies, including an ongoing phase 2a study of TLC-2716 in individuals with overweight/obesity with moderate-to-severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 350 mg dl−1) and MASLD (NCT06564584). In conclusion, this randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 study has demonstrated that TLC-2716 (a liver- and gut-restricted oral LXR inverse agonist) is safe and well tolerated and produces substantial improvements in plasma lipid metabolism. These clinical results are consistent with findings from genetic analysis and preclinical studies, reinforcing both safety and therapeutic promise of LXR repression in improving circulating lipids and addressing hepatic consequences of metabolic dysfunction. Biochemical binding of TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 to LXRα or LXRβ was determined by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biochemical assays evaluating the concentration-dependent displacement of a N-terminally biotinylated coactivator NCOA3 to recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged LXRα or LXRβ ligand-binding domain (LBD). Briefly, different concentrations of TLC-2716 or TLC-6665 were incubated with an assay buffer (Tris/HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 240 mM KCl, 1 µg µl−1 bovine serum albumin and 0.002% Triton X-100) containing 530 µg ml−1 recombinant GST-tagged LXRα/LXRβ LBD, 125 pg µl−1 GST-Tb cryptate (CisBio), 400 nM N-terminally biotinylated NCOA3 (coactivator) peptide, 1 μM 24(S)-25-epoxycholesterol (LXR agonist, only in the NCOA3 assay) and 2.5 ng µl−1 Streptavidin-XL665 (CisBio) for 1 h at 4 °C, following which fluorescence was measured in a VictorX4 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Science) using 340 nm as excitation and 615 and 665 nm as emission wavelengths. Assays were performed in triplicate. LXRα and LXRβ activity status was determined via detection of interaction with coactivator and co-repressor proteins in mammalian two-hybrid experiments. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with full length proteins of LXRα or LXRβ and their respective LBD domains under the pCMV-AD promoter(Stratagene). Interaction was monitored via activation of a coexpressed Firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of a promoter containing repetitive GAL4 response elements (vector pFRLuc, Stratagene). Four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with a concentration range of TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 for 16 h, after which they were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured sequentially in the same cell extract using a BMG luminometer. HT-29 or HepG2 cells were stably transfected with pGL4 luciferase reporter plasmid containing the ABCA1 or SREBP1C, respectively, promoter region upstream of the Firefly luciferase reporter gene and incubated with a concentration range of TLC-2716 or TLC-6665 for 16 h as described above. Human primary Upcyte hepatocytes were cultivated in medium containing high concentrations of glucose (25 mM) and palmitate (100 nM) for 5 days in the presence or absence of TLC-2716, and intracellular lipids were measured by Bodipy staining. The in vivo studies were performed at Synovo in accordance with their bioethical guidelines, which are fully compliant with ethical regulations and internationally accepted principles for the care and use of laboratory animals. Animal housing facilities were maintained at 20–22 °C with 30–50% humidity. Mice were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Eighteen-week-old male C57BL/6 DIO mice (14 weeks on HFD, Research Diets), purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, were dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (0.3 or 1 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for 3 weeks. Six- to 7-week-old male obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats (ZUCKER-Leprfa, Charles River Laboratories) were fed a HFD for a total of 5 weeks and dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (0.1 or 1 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for the last 2 weeks. In a second study, 6- to 7-week-old male ZDF rats (ZDF-Leprfa/Crl) were prefed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 2 weeks and dosed with vehicle or TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for 4 weeks. Six- to 7-week-old male SD rats (Charles River Laboratories) were fed a HFD for a total of 5 weeks and dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (0.1 or 1 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for the last 3 weeks. Six- to 8-week-old male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) were fed an L-amino acid rodent diet with 60 kcal% fat with no added choline and 0.1% methionine (Research Diets, A06071302) for a total of 12 weeks. After 4 weeks of diet feeding, animals started receiving sodium nitrite injections (25 mg per kg (body weight) intraperitonially) three times a week for the remainder of the study. After 6 weeks of choline-deficient HFD feeding, animals were dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for the last 6 weeks. Human liver chimeric PXB mice were purchased from PheonexBio, and in-life procedures were performed at InterVivo Solution in accordance with their bioethical guidelines, which are fully compliant with ethical regulations and internationally accepted principles for the care and use of laboratory animals. Briefly, animals were assigned to two groups (n = 5 male mice per group), vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (1 mg per kg (body weight) daily by oral gavage) for 8 days, after which animals were humanely killed by cardiac puncture, and plasma and tissues were collected for lipid and gene expression endpoints as described below. Liver tissue was dipped into ice-cold PBS for 1 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight for a maximum of 16 h. Afterward, samples were transferred to cold 70% ethanol/PBS to avoid prolonged fixation and embedded in paraffin before sectioning. Sections were stained with picrosirius red to visualize collagen. Plasma samples were analyzed for levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglycerides using respons 910 (Diasys Diagnostics Systems), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Collected frozen liver samples were ground to a fine powder with a pestle and mortar under liquid nitrogen. An aliquot was subjected to lipid isolation using organic solvents (hexane and isopropanol), and, after extraction, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were quantified using commercially available kits (FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals Europe). An additional aliquot was used for collagen determination after acid hydrolysis (Total Collagen Assay, Quickzyme Biosciences). The study was performed at Physiogenex S.A.S. in accordance with ethical regulations, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (revised 1996 and 2011, 2010/63/EU) and French laws. Twenty-four-week-old DIO mice (Jackson Laboratories) were fed a HFD (Research Diets, D12492) for 18 weeks and dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in phosphate-buffered saline), TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight)) or pioglitazone (30 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for 4 weeks. Animals were subjected to a two-stage hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp procedure after a 6-h fast and 2 h after the last dose. Briefly, animals received a bolus of D-[3-3H]glucose (30 μCi per mouse) followed by D-[3-3H]glucose (30 μCi min−1 kg−1) infusion (2 μl min−1) for up to 210 min. Insulin was simultaneously infused at 8 mU kg−1 min−1 for the first 100 min and at 18 mU kg−1 min−1 for the last 110 min. Blood glucose was measured from the tip of the tail every 10 min by a glucometer. The glucose infusion rate was adjusted according to blood glucose levels until a first euglycemic steady state was reached (from ~70 to 100 min of infusion) and similarly adjusted until a second euglycemic steady-state was reached (from ~150 to 210 min of infusion). During both steady states, blood (5 μl) was collected frequently from the tail tip for 3H-radioactivity measurements and calculations of glucose flux. A 26-week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study was conducted at Inotiv according to the protocol, Inotiv's Standard Operating Procedures and in compliance with the current US Food and Drug Administration GLP Regulations for Non-Clinical Studies (21 CFR Part 58). Animal housing facilities were maintained at 20–26 °C with 30–70% humidity. Mice were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Briefly, the safety profile of TLC-2716 was evaluated in CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) administered orally once daily at 0 (vehicle: 100 mM sodium phosphate puffer, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; pH 7.4) and 3% DMSO), 15, 60 and 120 mg per kg (body weight) per day for 26 weeks. This terminal study included comprehensive assessments of toxicokinetics and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis). Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs, with regular measurements of body weight, food consumption and vital signs. Necropsy and detailed tissue analysis were performed at study termination. A 4-week GLP toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (Guangzhou Xiangguan Biotech) to evaluate the safety profile of TLC-2716 administered orally once daily at 1, 5 and 15 mg per kg (body weight) per day. This terminal study included comprehensive assessments of toxicokinetics and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis). Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs, with regular measurements of body weight, food consumption and vital signs. Necropsy and detailed tissue analysis were performed at study termination. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Target organs (liver and intestine) were subjected to gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR). Aliquots of liver and ileum were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently homogenized with a pestle and mortar under liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of the homogenized tissues were processed for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Aliquots from the reverse-transcribed samples were used for the detection of specific mRNA transcripts of different genes of interest by RT–qPCR using commercially available mouse cDNA sequence-specific PCR primers and Taqman probes. Resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values were normalized to the housekeeping gene Tbp measured in the same sample. Results are plotted as fold change compared with vehicle controls. All primers or product codes for RT–qPCR are indicated in Supplementary Table 1. HLOs were generated as previously described63. Briefly, human iPS cells were differentiated into foregut progenitor cells using a published protocol44. To initiate organoid formation, foregut cells were resuspended in Matrigel at a final concentration of 750,000 cells per ml. Fifty-microliter droplets of the cell–Matrigel mixture were plated and cultured in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with B27, N2, 10 mM HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 5 ng ml−1 FGF2, 10 ng ml−1 VEGF, 20 ng ml−1 EGF, 3 μM CHIR99021, 0.5 μM A83-01 and 50 µg ml−1 ascorbic acid for 4 days. The medium was then replaced with the same basal formulation containing 2 μM retinoic acid and cultured for an additional 4 days. Finally, the organoids were maintained in hepatocyte culture medium (Lonza) for 6 days to promote hepatic maturation. To induce a steatohepatitis-like phenotype, HLOs were gently retrieved from the Matrigel and washed with PBS. HLOs were then exposed to 300 μM sodium oleate (Sigma) in hepatocyte culture medium for 3 days using ultra-low attachment six-well plates (Corning). For quantification of intracellular lipid accumulation, sHLOs were rinsed three times with prewarmed PBS and stained with 2 μM BODIPY 493/503 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for neutral lipid detection, along with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for nuclear counterstaining. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X710 automated fluorescence microscope. Lipid droplet volume was quantified using the Hybrid Cell Count application (Keyence) and normalized to nuclear signal intensity. For RNA sequencing, total RNA was extracted from iPS cell-derived HLOs using an RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality were assessed using a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and only samples with an RNA Quality Number of ≥8.0 were used for library preparation. Genotypes of GCKR variants were determined using an Illumina Infinium Global Diversity Array with the Enhanced PGx platform (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was extracted from undifferentiated iPS cells using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Genotyping was performed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Genomics Sequencing Facility using standard Infinium HTS assay protocols. Quality control steps included removal of samples with a call rate of <98%, excess heterozygosity or sex mismatch. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a call rate of <95%, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P of <1 × 10−6 or minor allele frequency of <1% were excluded from downstream analysis. Genomic positions were mapped to the GRCh38 (hg38) human reference genome. We analyzed metabolic-related phenotypic traits from the UKBB30,31 under Application Number 48020 by focusing on participants of European ancestry only (based on the UKBB return dataset 2442). A GWAS was performed using REGENIE. Step 1 involved the estimation of population structure using genotyping arrays (UKBB field 22418). Step 2 calculated genetic variant–phenotype associations based on the WES data (UKBB field 23159) using the following covariates: the first ten genetic PCs, age, sex and age–sex interaction. Gene-based testing (burden test) was performed using REGENIE step 2 by collapsing single-variant test statistics into gene-level results. Variants were grouped into functional sets defined by mask objects, where each mask represents a labeled variant category that combines different types of annotations. Summary statistics from the FinnGen33 study were downloaded from https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results, and those for the Million Veteran Program34 database were accessed through dbGaP under accession number phs002453.v1.p1 through the AgingX project (ID 10143). The significant (P < 5 × 10−8) associated phenotypic traits of genetic variants within candidate genes in each human population were further extracted. Fine-mapping results were downloaded from https://www.finucanelab.org/data (ref. Significant cis-eQTLs of LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) in liver or blood were obtained from the GTEx (version 8, 208 individuals)36 or eQTLGen (31,684 individuals)65. Linkage disequilibrium clumping for SNPs was estimated using Plink (genetics.binaRies R package, window size 1 Mb, minor allele frequency ≥ 1%) on the 1000 Genomes reference panel66. Only one independent SNP was found within NR1H3 using the GTEx liver cis-eQTLs, whereas eight independent SNPs were identified using the eQTLGen blood cis-eQTLs, suggesting that the eQTLGen blood cis-eQTLs are more reliable for Mendelian randomization analysis. Therefore, significant cis-eQTLs of LXR in blood extracted from eQTLGen were applied as exposures in the Mendelian randomization analysis. GWAS summary statistics for plasma lipid-related traits were derived from WES data in the UKBB and served as outcomes. The causal effects of NR1H3 and NR1H2 gene expression on lipid traits were estimated by Inverse Variance Weighted approach using the TwoSampleMR67,68,69,70 R package (v0.6.2). Liver gene expression datasets were obtained from GTEx36 and the Human Liver Cohort37. Correlation coefficients between each gene and LXRα (NR1H3) or LXRβ (NR1H2) were calculated by Pearson correlation. Genes were ranked by correlation coefficient, and gene sets were extracted using the msigdbr R package (version 7.5.1)71. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (4.12.6)72. RNA was sequenced by BGI with the DNBSEQ platform. The quality of the reads was then verified using FastQC (version 0.11.9). Low-quality reads were removed, and no trimming was needed. Alignment was performed against the human genome (GRCh38, v113) following the STAR (version 2.73a) manual guidelines73. Normalized effective library sizes were calculated by trimmed mean of M values. The voom function of the Limma R package (version 3.60.0)74 was applied to transform gene counts for linear modeling with precision weights. Genes were ranked by log2 (fold change), and gene sets were extracted using the msigdbr R package (version 7.5.1)71. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (version 4.12.6)72. The study protocol was approved by the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee (2022 FULL 12858). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration: NCT05483998) and was conducted at a single site in New Zealand (Auckland Clinical Research) from 27 July 2022 to 18 June 2023, in accordance with relevant local regulatory policies. Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment. The randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 study included SAD and MAD cohorts. In the SAD cohorts, healthy participants were treated with single oral doses of TLC-2716 (0.5, 2, 6, 12 and 20 mg) or placebo, and in the MAD cohorts, participants received once-daily oral doses of TLC-2716 (0.5, 2, 6 and 12 mg) or placebo for 14 days. For each cohort, eight participants were randomized to receive TLC-2716, and two participants were randomized to receive placebo; study medications were administered in a fed state within 5 min of completing a standardized breakfast. In an additional MAD cohort, eight participants received TLC-2716 (6 mg) after an overnight fast to evaluate the effects of fasted versus fed dosing on the PKs of TLC-2716. Participants were confined in the study center until 72 h following the last dose of study drug, and all participants returned to the study center 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up visit. To maximize participant safety in SAD cohorts, safety and tolerability of the study drug through day 2 were assessed in two sentinel participants (one randomized to TLC-2716 and one randomized to placebo) per cohort before dosing of the remaining participants in each cohort. In addition, TLC-2716 dose escalation was preceded by a review of safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data by a safety review committee consisting of the principal investigator and sponsor representatives. In brief, eligible study participants were healthy, nonsmoking men and women between 18 and 55 years of age and with a BMI from 19 to 35 kg m−2, inclusive at screening. All participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥80 ml min−1, normal liver biochemistry (total bilirubin 1.0- to 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal was permitted in participants with Gilbert's syndrome) and 12-lead electrocardiograms and screening laboratory evaluations (for example, hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) that were normal or considered to have no clinical importance by the investigator. In the MAD cohorts, an attempt was made to enroll participants with TG of ≥150 mg dl−1 and/or LDL-C of ≥130 mg dl−1 to enable preliminary assessment of the lipid-lowering benefits of TLC-2716. Key exclusion criteria included women who were pregnant or lactating, TG of ≥500 mg dl−1, LDL-C of ≥190 mg dl−1, the presence of serious active medical or psychiatric illness, excessive alcohol consumption (defined as greater than 21 units per week for men and 14 units per week for women), substance abuse or recent receipt of an investigational compound. Participants who had taken any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including herbal products, within 28 days before the start of study drug dosing, except vitamins, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and/or hormonal contraceptives, were excluded. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is available from the authors. Safety and tolerability assessments, including AE monitoring, laboratory tests, physical examinations and electrocardiogram evaluations, were performed throughout the study. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grading Scale v5.0. Intensive PK sampling over 72 h after dosing on day 1 (in SAD and MAD cohorts) and day 14 (in MAD cohorts) was conducted, and TLC-2716 plasma concentrations were determined using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay. PK parameters were estimated via noncompartmental methods using Pheonix WinNonlin 6.2.1 and 8.3.4 (Certara). Plasma lipid parameters, including ApoB, were evaluated by NMR LipoProfile (Labcorp). RC was calculated as the difference between TC and the sum of direct LDL-C and HDL-C. Unless indicated, lipid parameters were measured before dosing following an overnight fast. Plasma ApoC3 and ANGPTL3 were evaluated by ELISA (360biolabs), and the impact of TLC-2716 on peripheral RCT was evaluated by assessing changes in the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, before dosing and 4 h after dosing on day 14 (Gnomix). Due to its exploratory nature, no formal power or sample size calculations were used to determine the sample size for this study. Empirically, the sample size was selected to adequately characterize the safety, PKs and pharmacodynamics of TLC-2716. Given the skewed distribution of plasma lipid data, we applied the Hodges–Lehmann estimator in deriving placebo-adjusted percentage change from baseline values in lipid parameters. This method estimates the median (and 95% confidence interval) of all possible pairwise differences between treatment groups and addresses the potential impact of skewed data or outliers. For analyses of changes from baseline, two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for comparisons within groups) and two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests (for comparisons between groups) were used, which were adjusted using the BH adjustment method. In this clinical trial study, sex is self-reported. Due to the small sample size of each group, sex is not considered in the analysis.

Cancer interception is a preventative approach aiming to reduce cancer incidence by targeting precancers and early-stage cancers. Lynch syndrome (LS) is a prevalent hereditary cancer syndrome affecting ~1 in 300 individuals, with an overall lifetime cancer risk as high as 80%. LS is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes, leading to microsatellite instability (MSI) and accumulation of shared mutations. When these occur in coding regions, they generate frameshift peptides (FSPs). Nous-209 is a neoantigen-directed immunotherapy based on a heterologous prime boost using great ape adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus Ankara encoding 209 FSPs shared across MSI neoplasms. We present the results from cohort 1 of a phase 1b/2 single-arm trial of Nous-209 for cancer interception in LS carriers (n = 45). Vaccination was safe with no intervention-related serious adverse events (AEs). Neoantigen-specific immune responses were observed after vaccination in 100% of evaluable participants (n = 37), with induction of potent T cell immunity (mean response at peak of ~1,100 interferon-γ spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells). The immune response was durable and detectable at 1 year in 85% of participants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were induced, recognizing multiple FSPs. Peptide–human leukocyte antigen predictions allowed the identification of >100 immunogenic FSPs with demonstration of cytotoxic activity in vitro. Immunogenic FSPs were found in independent datasets of LS MSI colorectal precancers and cancers. These results highlight Nous-209 ability to efficiently stimulate immunity against neoantigens in LS, supporting its development for cancer interception (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05078866). Lynch syndrome (LS) is one of the most prevalent hereditary cancer syndromes affecting ~1 in 300 people1. Persons with LS carry heterozygous germline mutations in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6 and PMS2), conferring 50–80% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), 40–60% risk of endometrial cancer and increased risk of multiple other tumor types2. In the US, it is estimated that nearly 1 million individuals are affected by LS3. However, LS remains vastly underdiagnosed and current preventive options are limited to surveillance and prophylactic surgeries. However, the use of high-dose aspirin in clinical practice is limited because of perceived risks of side effects; therefore, novel strategies for cancer interception remain an unmet need for this population. The most common type of mutations in MS regions are frameshift insertions and deletions (indels)6. When they involve regions coding MS, indels result in the synthesis of frameshift peptide (FSP) neoantigens (neoAgs), which are expected to be highly immunogenic and dissimilar to native proteins. Recurrent and shared neoAgs across neoplastic lesions and different individuals have been identified in LS carriers, some of which have immunogenic features7. In this context, LS represents an ideal condition to leverage immune-interception strategies such as neoAg-based cancer vaccines targeting both precancers and cancers8. The development of ‘off-the-shelf' vaccines for LS carriers represents indeed a promising approach to cancer interception and prevention. By targeting shared neoAgs generated through the accumulation of genetic mutations, such vaccines could stimulate the immune system to recognize and eliminate precancers before they develop into cancers. The discovery of neoAgs has revived the interest in the field of cancer vaccines that are emerging as promising approaches for targeting personalized or shared neoAgs9. The first phase 1/2a clinical trial leveraging peptide-based neoAg vaccination in LS carriers involved the use of three recurrent FSPs (TAF1B, HT001 and AIM2) in 22 participants with a history of stage III/IV MMR-deficient (MMRd) CRC10. Another phase 1/2 study evaluated a neoAg-based dendritic cell vaccine in 23 LS carriers and reported the induction of neoAg-specific immune responses and no incidence of LS-related cancers in transforming growth factor-β receptor 2–responsive participants over a 10-year follow-up11. Recently, novel delivery platforms have been developed, including DNA, RNA and viral vectored vaccines. Several clinical trials have now demonstrated the safety, immunogenicity and initial evidence of antitumor efficacy of neoAg-based vaccines across cancer types and settings12,13,14,15. Therefore, the selection of the vaccine platform is key in determining the magnitude, quality and breadth of T cell responses to achieve effective and durable antitumor immunity. Among these new platforms, viral vector-based vaccines represent a powerful platform capable of inducing strong and durable T cell responses in human16,17. Their ability to deliver large gene inserts allows the targeting of many neoAgs simultaneously. This is a crucial aspect for cancer interception linked to the need to induce a broad T cell response for high coverage and for addressing the heterogeneity of their potential future tumors. Vaccination based on great ape adenovirus (GAd) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors encoding 209 shared frameshift mutations (Nous-209) was used to target shared neoAgs in persons with metastatic tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and demonstrated safety and potent immunogenicity18. Moreover, early signs of clinical efficacy, observed when the vaccine is used in combination with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 agent, are supported by evidence of vaccine-induced T cells infiltrating tumor biopsies after treatment, along with the expansion and diversification of the T cell receptor-β repertoire in persons showing clinical response18. Here, we present results from a phase 1b/2 open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Nous-209 monotherapy in 45 healthy LS carriers. Comprehensive characterization of T cell responses, including breadth, longevity and functional cytotoxic activity, is reported here to demonstrate the ability of Nous-209 to promote the induction of T cell responses targeting FSPs identified in colorectal precancers and cancers from an independent LS dataset. NCT05078866 is a phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label, clinical trial testing Nous-209 for cancer immune interception in LS carriers. Eligible participants included adults of age ≥ 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of LS and with no evidence of active or recurrent invasive cancers for at least 6 months before screening. Safety and immunogenicity were the primary endpoints of this study. Changes in the number of colorectal adenomas, advanced neoplasia and/or carcinomas were prespecified secondary endpoints. The trial enrolled two cohorts: cohort 1 (initial vaccination) reported in this study, and cohort 2, consisting of a subset of participants from cohort 1 who were revaccinated at 1 year to assess the benefit of annual boost. The safety and immunogenicity of cohort 2 will be reported in a separate manuscript. Nous-209 was administered intramuscularly (IM) as a ‘priming' dose of GAd20-209-FSPs on week 0 day 1, followed by a ‘boost' with MVA-209-FSPs at week 8. Before vaccination, all potentially eligible participants underwent standard-of-care screening colonoscopies or flexible sigmoidoscopy. Participants identified to have colorectal adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or diagnosis of invasive carcinoma at baseline were excluded from the study. More specifically, there were five screening failures. a, Overall schematic of Nous-209 administration and immunogenicity assessment. The initial priming GAd20-209-FSPs (GAd) was given on day 1 followed by booster MVA-209-FSPs (MVA) at week 8. Research blood samples were collected for immunogenicity evaluation over time. b, CONSORT flow diagram of study enrollment and analysis cohorts. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. All participants carried a pathogenic germline MMR mutation with the majority in MSH2 (47%), while the remainder were in MSH6 (24%), MLH1 (18%) and PMS2 (11%). The median age was 50 years (range, 24–71) and 42% of participants (19/45) were cancer survivors (Extended Data Table 1) and had no evidence of active malignancy within the 6 months before study enrollment. Most study participants were male (56%) and self-reported white (91%). AEs were reported by 98% (44/45) of participants during the first 9 weeks after vaccination with GAd-209-FSP prime (Fig. Overall, no treatment-related serious AEs (SAEs) were observed and vaccination was well tolerated. The most common treatment-related AEs included systemic reactogenicity symptoms and local injection-site reaction. Specifically, injection-site reactions of any grade occurred in 91% of participants following GAd-209-FSP prime vaccination and 76% following MVA-209-FSP boost vaccination; no grade 3 injection-site reactions were observed. All grade 3 symptoms occurred after the GAd prime dose. In all cases, symptoms were transient, lasting 1–4 days, did not require hospitalization and were managed with self-administered acetaminophen in some cases (Extended Data Table 2). All AEs reached full resolution and, indeed, all participants were able to receive the booster MVA dose as scheduled. Vaccine immunogenicity was the coprimary endpoint of the study and was evaluated using an ex vivo enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay against 16 peptide pools that covered the entire repertoire of the 209 FSPs encoded by Nous-209, with each pool covering multiple FSPs (Fig. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated at different time points before (baseline) and after vaccination. The presence of Nous-209-induced neoAg-specific responses before and after vaccination was evaluable in 37 participants. Nous-209 elicited a positive interferon-γ (IFNγ) T cell response at peak (week 9) in 100% (37/37) of evaluable participants determined according to the predefined protocol criteria for ELISpot positivity (Methods). Total responses at peak after vaccination reached a mean of ~1,100 spot-forming cells (SFCs) (Fig. Furthermore, 10% of participants (4/37) showed positive spontaneous T cell responses to neoAg peptide pools at baseline before vaccination. In these four subjects, Nous-209 either boosted or induced de novo T cell responses to the vaccine neoAg. Long-term immune responses at 6 months and 1 year after vaccination were evaluable in 33 participants, showing maintenance of elevated and long-lasting T cell immunity with a decline in immune response occurring after the initial peak response at 1 year. Positive T cell responses were indeed still detectable ex vivo in 97% and 85% of evaluable participants at 6 months and 1 year, respectively (Fig. Responses were directed against different peptide pools with the induction of a broad polytope response to vaccine neoAg (Fig. More specifically, the breadth of the cellular immune response was evaluated by counting the number of Nous-209 peptide pools targeted across visits with an average of eight immunogenic pools per participant. In exploratory analyses, we observed no statistically significant associations between the number of positive pools at peak and gender, age, self-reported race/ethnicity, mutated MMR gene or cancer previvor versus survivor status. However, the increase in positive pools at peak from baseline was significantly higher in females compared to males (P = 0.045; Supplementary Table 2). a, T cell responses assessed by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot at baseline and peak immune response. Each line represents data from an individual subject (n = 37), with circles representing the mean of three technical replicates per time point. Comparison of baseline versus peak immune response was performed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test; P < 0.0001. b, Kinetics of immune response over time showing durability of T cell response after vaccination (mean ± s.e.m. c, Representation of immunogenic peptide pools eliciting IFNγ reactivity by ex vivo ELISpot annotated for participant ID, mutated MMR gene, age, gender and cancer history (previvor or survivor). Right, bar plot showing the cumulative number of reactive pools across visits per each participant. d, Breadth of immune response assessed as the number of positive pools eliciting IFNγ reactivity across visits. Pie chart showing the frequency (%) of LS carriers with a number of reactive pools ranging from 1–3 (pink), 4–9 (dark pink) or 10–16 (violet). Full deconvolution of T cell responses against all 209 FSPs and relative minimal epitopes was not feasible given the high number of encoded neoAgs and the limited availability of PBMC samples. To further dissect immune responses after Nous-209 at the level of individual FSPs, we pursued an alternative approach that first determined the reactive peptide pools in each participant and then predicted the top epitopes included in the immunogenic pools on the basis of each participant's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genotyping, when full deconvolution of T cell response was not feasible (Fig. Following this strategy, we restricted the analysis to top FSPs and epitopes with the best participant's class I HLA-binding prediction (half-maximal effective concentration < 500 nM), which were considered the best target candidates of Nous-209 immune response. This work of deconvoluting the peptide pools, while not comprehensive for all 16 available pools, provides insights into the immunogenicity of specific individual FSP, thus leading to the identification of 115 immunogenic FSPs in our trial cohort of LS carriers (Supplementary Table 3). a, Schematic flowchart illustrating the steps involved in the deconvolution of reactive peptide pools and mapping of immunogenic FSPs in LS carriers on the basis of HLA-binding prediction and samples availability for each participant. b, Bar plot showing the number of Nous-209 FSPs found in independent dataset of cancer (n = 11) and precancer (n = 12) lesions by lookup approach (cutoff: VAF ≥ 10% and mutated tumor reads ≥ 3). d, Ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot responses on PBMCs before or after depletion of CD8+ T cells in presence of some identified reactive pools or FSPs. Bars represent the pre-CD8 and post-CD8 T cell depletion response for each subject, respectively. Data are shown as the mean number of SFCs per 10⁶ PBMCs ± s.e.m. To demonstrate the ability of Nous-209 to elicit an immune response against FSPs present in colorectal precancers and cancers of LS carriers, we leveraged available genomic and transcriptomic data from previously published work in an independent cohort of 12 MSI precancers (eight adenomas and four advanced adenomas) and 11 MSI CRCs7. Overall, we identified the presence of a median of 32 FSPs per lesion that are encoded by Nous-209 (Fig. Interestingly, when restricting the analysis to the 115 immunogenic FSP identified in our trial cohort, we specifically found that 94 of 115 (82%) were present in colorectal precancers and cancers (Fig. Ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed before and after depletion of CD8+ T cells in presence of the highest reactive pools or FSPs identified as immunogenic. Responses were defined as CD8+ mediated if IFNγ production was reduced after depletion and as CD4⁺ mediated if no substantial change was observed. To analyze the phenotype and killing activity of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells, we generated HLA class I dextramer-detecting neoAg-reactive CD8+ T cells against an FSP from SPEF2 that was identified among the most recurrent immunogenic FSP in multiple LS carriers (Extended Data Fig. The SPEF2 FSP sequence includes an 8-mer peptide (IAKKRIKL) predicted in silico to be a strong binder to HLA-B*08:01, which is shared by several trial participants and was confirmed as immunogenic by ELISpot in 11 participants (participants 16, 18, 19, 27, 29, 30, 31,39, 40, 10 and 32; Extended Data Fig. In two participants (participants 10 and 32) SPEF2 FSP was mapped as immunogenic after in vitro stimulation (Extended Data Fig. In participant 18, class I dextramer staining detected SPEF2 FSP vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells directly ex vivo at week 9 after MVA boost, representing ~1.64 % of all circulating CD8+ cells, which persisted at 6 months and 1 year after vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 2d), consistent with the longevity of T cell responses observed using ex vivo ELISpot assays. The analysis showed that, after Nous-209, antigen-specific T cells display a TemRA phenotype, thus demonstrating the induction of a long-term memory response by Nous-209 (Extended Data Fig. This was confirmed in additional participants who mounted an immune response against SPEF2 FSP after Nous-209 vaccination (Supplementary Fig. Lastly, the cytotoxic potential was investigated by flow cytometry analysis with intracellular cytokine staining in participant 18 PBMCs stimulated ex vivo with SPEF2 peptide. We observed antigen-specific IFNγ secretion and detection of CD8+ T cells expressing the degranulation marker CD107a, thus indicating a cytotoxic function that was stimulated after Nous-209 vaccination (Extended Data Fig. A second neoAg, CDC7, found recurrently immunogenic in participants with HLA-A*03:01, was selected to further evaluate the ability of Nous-209-induced T cells to eliminate tumor cells presenting the neoAg. This approach modeled T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing CDC7 FSP using PBMCs from participant 12. Our in vitro assay was based on the MMRd HCT116 human colon cancer cell line that was genetically modified to express the FSP from CDC7 and their matching HLAs (CDC7-HCT116 herein; Methods) and cocultured with in vitro-stimulated effector PBMCs obtained from the same participant before and after vaccination with Nous-209. HCT116 cells were cocultured with PBMCs at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 5:1. To assess both functional and cytotoxic responses, PBMCs were divided into two groups after in vitro stimulation; half of the cells were analyzed for IFNγ secretion using ELISpot and the remaining cells were used for the microfluidic coculture assay. After 48 h, target cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using luminescence-based assays. Our results showed a significant reduction in CDC7-HCT116 tumor cell survival when cocultured with T cells after Nous-209 vaccination compared to both baseline PBMCs from the same participant and all controls (Extended Data Fig. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we used multiple control conditions, including HCT116 cells transduced with CDC7 and HCT116 cells transduced only with the HLA of interest but without the CDC7 neoAg. These controls helped determine whether tumor cell killing was CDC7 dependent rather than influenced by HLA expression alone or intrinsic effects of CDC7 transduction. Quantitative viability assays revealed a marked decrease in tumor cell survival after Nous-209 vaccination compared to baseline and all control conditions (P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 4d), thus confirming antigen-specific T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing the CDC7 cognate pHLA. To strengthen these findings, we assessed the IFNγ secretion capacity of the stimulated PBMCs in response to CDC7 neoAg stimulation. At baseline, there was no significant difference between CDC7-stimulated PBMCs and the negative control (DMSO; P > 0.05), indicating that CDC7-specific responses were not detectable before vaccination. In contrast, PBMCs after Nous-209 vaccination from participant 12 exhibited significantly higher IFNγ secretion compared to both the negative control (DMSO; P < 0.0001) and baseline PBMCs (P < 0.0001), thus reinforcing the antigen-specific activation of Nous-209-induced T cells (Extended Data Fig. These findings demonstrate that Nous-209 vaccination induces a potent and durable neoAg-specific CD8+ T cell response capable of both cytokine secretion and direct tumor cell killing. The presence of long-lived TemRA CD8+ T cells, their ability to degranulate and their direct cytotoxic function provide compelling evidence that Nous-209 effectively primes the immune system to target and eliminate neoAg-expressing tumor cells in LS carriers. As a prespecified secondary endpoint of our study, we aimed to characterize the number, size and pathology features of colorectal neoplasia among 43 of 45 vaccinated participants who underwent their standard-of-care screening lower endoscopy at the end of the study. Two vaccinated participants withdrew from the study before undergoing the end-of-study colonoscopy and were not evaluable for this analysis. Overall, the majority of participants (n = 31) had no colorectal adenomas on their end-of-study colonoscopies. Interestingly, of the total 23 adenomas detected in 12 participants, none were classified as advanced adenomas (diameter > 10 mm, presence of high-grade dysplasia and/or villous histology), while two participants had advanced adenomas at baseline colonoscopy (Fig. Compared to baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed in the overall proportion of study participants with detectable adenomas or advanced adenomas or in the total counts at their end-of-study colonoscopy (Extended Data Tables 3 and 4). Genomic characterization of available precancers removed at baseline (n = 10) and end-of-study (n = 12) colonoscopies was performed by next-generation sequencing assessing both the MSI status and the presence of Nous-209 FSPs. Although not statistically significant, the analysis showed a decrease in the proportion of MSI-High (MSI-H) and MSI-Low (MSI-L) precancers observed at baseline compared to end of study. After vaccination, two precancers were MSI-H and one was MSI-L, while the remaining nine were microsatellite stable (MSS) (Extended Data Fig. b, Number of adenomas per trial participant at baseline and end of study; comparison of baseline versus EoS was performed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test; NS, not significant. c, Number of reactive pools measured at 6 months (n = 34 evaluable subjects) between the participants with and without adenomas. Comparison of participants with and without adenomas was performed using a one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test; *P = 0.0381. In exploratory analyses performed among 34 participants with evaluable immune response data at 6 months, we observed an association between the breadth of immune response (number of reactive FSP pools) at 6 months and the presence versus absence of any detectable adenomas on the end-of-study colonoscopy (mean: 1.5 versus 4 pools, respectively; Fig. A similar trend was observed at peak, whereas no statistically significant difference was detected at 12 months, likely because of the expected contraction of the immune response over time. Cancer interception aims to halt or reverse carcinogenesis at early stages by targeting aberrant cells within precancers. Vaccine-based interception strategies that induce tumor-specific T cells are especially promising in the context of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, where the immune microenvironment of precancers may be less immunosuppressive compared to that of advanced cancers, where immune suppression often blocks T cell activity against tumor antigens, thus preventing effective immune responses. Indeed, for solid tumors, there has been notable recent progress in the development of novel neoAg-based cancer vaccines targeting micrometastatic disease in the adjuvant setting. For example, a recent randomized phase 2 trial of adjuvant personalized mRNA vaccine combined with immune checkpoint blockade in participants with resected high-risk melanoma demonstrated significantly improved recurrence-free survival versus checkpoint blockade alone12. Similarly, among participants with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a phase 1 study of a personalized neoAg mRNA vaccine combined with checkpoint blockade in the adjuvant setting demonstrated a strong correlation between induction of neoAg-specific T cell responses and delayed tumor recurrence14. In both of these examples, the approaches relied on a pipeline of personalized vaccine design and production informed by somatic mutation profiling of surgical tumor specimens. However, when transitioning from adjuvant therapy to cancer interception, personalized vaccine approaches have limited practical application, primarily because of the absence of bulk tumor tissue for sequencing. Therefore, we propose that off-the-shelf vaccine strategies are optimally suited for clinical development towards cancer interception. Indeed, recent efforts have demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary signals of activity of an adjuvant off-the-shelf vaccine against the most common and recurrent somatic KRAS mutations observed in colorectal and pancreatic cancers19. LS carriers represent a well-defined, high-risk population of individuals who are likely to benefit from novel interception strategies against colorectal and other cancers8. Defects in the DNA MMR pathway lead to the development of MSI in LS-associated neoplasms (precancers and cancers) and the accumulation of many shared FSP. These peptides are non-self-antigens and foreign to the immune system, thus representing potentially the most immunogenic and safest type of neoAg. The rationale behind the use of a preventive neoAg-based vaccination study with Nous-209 relies on the induction of a broad T cell response against shared mutations targeting precancers and early-stage tumors to prevent cancer progression in this population. We reasoned that targeting a large number of neoAg is the most effective approach to achieve tumor control across a broad population, maximizing the likelihood of engaging and eradicating tumor cells. Therefore, a vaccine designed to target a wide range of shared neoAg could be particularly valuable in anticipating and targeting mutations that may emerge during tumorigenesis. One key distinction between the vaccine platform used in this study and other neoAg vaccines is that the latter have generally targeted a more limited number of neoAgs, as not all platforms allow for the inclusion of 209 neoAgs for an overall length of 6,000 aa. NeoAg-specific T cell response was elicited in all evaluable participants after Nous-209 by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot, with induction of broad and polytopic responses targeting multiple FSPs. Although we primarily focused on characterizing CD8+ T cell responses, induction of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was also observed following vaccination, in line with previous data on the capacity of the platform to induce both component of the T cell immunity13,22,23. This is a desirable feature, as several pieces of evidence suggest that promoting both subsets of T cells is beneficial for effective antitumor immunity24,25. Vaccination resulted in the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ with effector memory phenotype. In particular, the observed predominance of TemRA (CCR7⁻CD45RA+) cells among the dextramer+ CD8+ population possibly reflects a repeated antigen exposure in persons with LS, who may experience ongoing presentation of frameshift-derived neoAgs in MSI precancer lesions, contributing to a skewing toward more differentiated effector memory phenotype. Overall, these results are consistent with the findings from a phase 1 study in metastatic MMRd cancer showing that Nous-209 elicits broad T cell responses in most treated participants18. Taken together, these findings, including the in vitro cytotoxic activity against a tumor cell line expressing a second recurrent antigen targeted by Nous-209, are supportive for the tumor killing activity of the vaccine-induced T cells. The selection of our Nous-209 FSPs was initially validated primarily in sporadic metastatic MMRd tumors26,27 and more recently confirmed in a large dataset of 58 incident MMRd CRCs from LS carriers detected during routine surveillance28, thus providing further evidence of the vaccine's potential to target early-stage tumors. This observation underscores the potential of Nous-209 to target precancers and highlights its relevance in the context of cancer interception. At the yearly colonoscopy following vaccination, the frequency of study participants in which at least one adenoma was detected (~28%) was similar to the frequency observed at baseline before vaccination and in line with the expectations29,30. Moreover, when focusing on advanced adenomas, their baseline detection rate was 4.65%, consistent with previous reports31, whereas, following Nous-209 administration, no participants with advanced adenomas were found. Advanced adenomas are considered CRC precursors and previous reports have shown that the MMRd status is more frequently observed in advanced adenomas than in adenomas7,32. Therefore, although this trial was not powered to detect significant differences in advanced adenomas among participants, we consider the observed reduction in the frequency of advanced adenomas as a potentially encouraging early signal of efficacy. Nonetheless, these data will help inform the development of further larger and randomized studies of Nous-209 as a strategy for immune interception in LS. We acknowledge several limitations in our study, including the small sample size that limits the power of correlative analysis. In addition, most participants were self-reported non-Hispanic white, which limits the assessment for differences in safety and immunogenicity across races and ethnicities. By addressing barriers to accrual, future studies with larger cohorts that are representative of all who are affected by LS will be able to confirm the generalizability of our findings. We further acknowledge that deeper characterization of immune responses at the level of individual immunogenic FSPs was limited by the availability and volume of collected blood specimens. While our study provides important safety and immunogenicity signals, a larger randomized study will be essential to evaluate the clinical activity of Nous-209 toward a reduction in cancer incidence in LS. Lastly, except for cardioprotective aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was not allowed during study participation. Given the potential use of aspirin at different dosing as a chemoprevention in LS participants, future studies may need to consider combinatorial strategies. Overall, this clinical trial provides important proof-of-concept data of the safety and the robustness of induced immunogenicity of Nous-209 in LS carriers, representing a neoAg vaccine-based approach for LS and supporting its clinical development as a valuable intervention for cancer immune interception. Consistent with the primary objectives to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Nous-209 amongst healthy LS carriers, eligible trial participants had no evidence of active or recurrent invasive cancers for at least 6 months before screening and received no cancer-directed treatment (surgery, systemic therapy, hormonal therapy or radiation) within 6 months before screening. We excluded participants who had histologic evidence of high-grade dysplasia and/or invasive cancer at baseline screening. Eligible participants had adequate organ function and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1. Except for cardiopreventive aspirin (<100 mg daily), participants consented to refrain from the use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase inhibitors for the duration of the study treatment. At the study entry, a total of nine participants reported taking aspirin at a low dose (<81 mg orally daily) for cardiovascular or cancer prevention. Three of them decided to discontinue its use upon recruitment and six continued, with three stating the use for cardiovascular and three stating the use for cancer-preventive reasons. Participants consented to refrain from receiving other vaccinations within the first 10 weeks of initiating study treatment and from receiving adenoviral-based vaccines for the duration of study participation (including postintervention follow-up from week 9 through week 52). We excluded individuals with active infection, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) except those with documented laboratory evidence of cleared HBV or HCV infection, individuals with a history of organ allograft or other history of immunodeficiency or individuals with a intercurrent condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily of prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study treatment. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in the study protocol (Supplementary Information). The trial was a phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label, multicenter, prospective study originally designed with the coprimary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity following initial vaccination with Nous-209 monotherapy. To achieve a goal of at least 36 individuals evaluable for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, up to 45 participants were enrolled between November 2022 and November 2023 at four institutions (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), The University of Puerto Rico, Fox Chase Cancer Center and City of Hope) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) iCAN PREVENT clinical trial consortium. At baseline, all participants underwent standard-of-care screening lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy). Confirmed eligible participants received initial Nous-209 vaccination as a single 1-ml IM injection of GAd20-209-FSPs (nominal concentration of 2 × 1011 viral particles per ml) at week 0 (prime), followed by a single 1-ml IM injection of MVA-209-FSPs (nominal concentration of 2 × 108 infectious units per ml) at week 8 (boost). Following key preactivation amendments, protocol version 5 was approved for study initiation in August 2022. In October 2023, protocol version 5.3 was approved, allowing for the addition of a revaccination cohort (cohort 2) in which a subset of eligible participants who completed initial Nous-209 vaccination at week 0 and wk 8 (cohort 1) were then randomized to receive either an MVA-209-FSP IM injection at week 52 or a GAd20-209-FSP IM injection at week 52 followed by an MVA-209-FSP IM injection at week 60. Safety and immunogenicity outcomes related to cohort 2 will be reported in a future manuscript. Separate reporting of cohorts 1 and 2 was permitted by protocol. Our study was designed and developed by academic authors in collaboration with the Division of Cancer Prevention of the NCI and Nouscom. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The NCI Central Institutional Review Board and The University of Texas MDACC Institutional Review Board approved this study (protocol nos. The coprimary endpoints of the trial were safety (rate of grade 2 and 3 AEs) and immunogenicity following initial Nous-209 vaccination. Our primary safety and tolerability endpoint was assessed during the prime and boost vaccination phase (week 0 through week 9 + 7 days). AEs were monitored throughout the study (up to 52 weeks + 14 days following initial vaccination) in all participants who received at least the GAd-209-FSP vaccination at week 0 and were graded according to version 5.0 of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs. After each vaccine injection, participants were asked to record symptom reactivity events daily on a memory aid (vaccine report card) for up to 7 days (or up to 8 days after symptom resolution). Protocol-defined injection-site reactions included pain, tenderness, erythema or redness, induration or swelling, itching and bruising, while systemic reactogenicity symptoms included fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, myalgia or muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and arthralgia or joint pain. Our coprimary immunogenicity endpoint was assessed at week 9 and was defined as reactivity to at least one of the 16 FSP pools using an ELISpot assay. Notably, in the case of detection of reactivity pools at baseline, an increase of at least 80% in the preexisting reactivity (measured at baseline) was considered as a positive response to the vaccine. Per protocol, evaluable participants underwent screening lower endoscopy (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) at week 52 ± 14 days (cohort 1) or week 68 ± 14 days (cohort 2) for standard-of-care endoscopic assessment in accordance with local institutional practices for high-risk screening populations and for collection of research biopsies. For all participants, clinical endoscopic biopsies of abnormal mucosa and/or resected polyp specimens (if any) were submitted for routine clinical pathology assessment at each participating study site. As prespecified secondary endpoints, we recorded polyp burden (count, size, histology and presence or absence of high-grade dysplasia) and neoplasia incidence. Additional secondary endpoints are detailed in the study protocol (Supplementary Information). PBMCs from whole blood were isolated at different time points and cryopreserved at each of the clinical sites before shipment to the central laboratory for immunogenicity assessment at Nouscom. To maintain the functionality of PBMCs, isolation and freezing procedures were completed within a maximum of 8 h from blood collection. PBMCs were isolated using Leucosep Bio-One polypropylene tubes (prefilled; Greiner, Merck) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cryopreserved cells were thawed, washed, counted and rested overnight before use in immunological assays. A set of 976 recombinant, lyophilized peptides, with the majority of them being 15 aa in length, overlapping by 11 aa and spanning the entire sequence of Nous-209, were produced by JPT Peptide Technologies. Individual FSPs were covered by its specific pool of overlapping peptides and then arranged in 16 peptide pools for immunogenicity assessment, as described below. To prepare pools 1–16, the peptides were mixed to a final concentration of 0.4 mg ml−1 for each peptide. PBMCs were resuspended in R10 medium, stimulated with a set of peptides designed to cover the 209 FSPs encoded by the vaccine and arranged into 16 peptide pools (P1–P16) at a final concentration of 3 µg ml−1. Cells were plated in ELISpot plates (human IFNγ ELISpot PLUS kit, Mabtech) and incubated for 18–20 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Spontaneous cytokine production (background) was measured by incubating PBMCs with medium alone, supplemented with the peptide diluent DMSO (negative control, Sigma-Aldrich), whereas CEFX (JPT Peptide Technologies), a pool of known peptide epitopes for a range of HLA subtypes and different infectious agents, was used as positive control. Results are expressed as SFCs per 106 PBMCs in stimulated cultures after subtracting the DMSO background. A response was considered positive if (1) the number of SFCs per 106 PBMCs ≥ 50 and (2) it was at least twice the DMSO background value. A subject was classified as a responder if reactivity to at least one of the 16 FSP peptide pools is induced after vaccination. If a subject exhibited preexisting reactivity to a peptide pool at baseline, the vaccine was expected to enhance this response by at least 80% in at least one of the 16 FSP peptide pools; in this case, such participants were considered as responders. NeoAg vaccine peptide pools were deconvoluted to identify immunogenic peptides by IFNγ ELISpot assays ex vivo or after in vitro stimulation. ELISpot plates were analyzed on the CTL ImmunoSpot S6 universal analyzer. To characterize neoAg-induced CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell responses, CD8+ T cells were selectively depleted from the total using anti-CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, 130-045-201) following the manufacturer's instructions. The CD8− cell population was then stimulated with either individual peptides or peptide pools (final concentration 3 μg ml−1) and T cell responses against specific peptides were assessed using an IFNγ ELISpot assay. The depletion efficiency of CD8+ T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. T cell responses were classified as CD8⁺ mediated if a significant reduction in IFNγ spot count was observed following CD8⁺ T cell depletion. Conversely, responses were classified as CD4⁺ mediated if no substantial change in spot count was detected after depletion PBMCs were thawed and rested for 1 h at 37 °C in R10. The samples were then incubated with anti-human Fc block (Pharmingen BD) at a 1:50 dilution in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1× PBS and 0.5% FBS) for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing with FACS buffer, the samples were stained with HLA class I dextramer HLA-B*0801/IAKKRIKL 8-mer peptide (SPEF2 FSP) conjugated to PE at room temperature for 30 min, protected from light. The live/dead near-IR dead cell stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L10119) was added at 1:100 dilution and cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer until acquisition. For intracellular staining, PBMCs were stimulated with the vaccine single peptide (from SPEF2, 11-mer) (4 µg ml−1), DMSO (control) and PMA/ionomycin cell stimulation cocktail (positive control; Affymetrix) in the presence of anti-human CD107a (LAMP1; BioLegend, clone H4A3, 328618). Following 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with Fc block for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed and stained with live/dead dye in staining buffer for 15 minutes at room temperature. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed twice before fixation and permeabilization with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit) for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were washed twice and resuspended in 1× perm/wash buffer (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit) for intracellular staining with IFNγ (BioLegend, clone 4S.B3, 502532). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed and then resuspended in perm/wash buffer until acquisition. Data were acquired on a BD FACS Canto II and analyzed using FlowJo (version 10.1). The gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Fig. To investigate neoAg-specific immune responses, we genetically modified the MMRd HCT116 colon cancer cell line, which harbors an MLH1 mutation, to express multiple HLA alleles and neoAg minigenes (MGs) derived from the CDC7 gene mutation. These MGs encode neoAg peptides of varying amino acid lengths (specifically 50-mer, 15-mer and 9-mer) designed to be presented by both MHC class I and class II alleles, as informed by previous studies7. The codon-optimized CDC7 50-mer construct was cloned into a lentiviral backbone obtained from VectorBuilder (plasmid VB240607-1533chz). This configuration ensured efficient routing of the CDC7 construct through the secretory pathway and enhanced antigen processing and presentation for recognition by neoAg-specific T cells. The transfection process followed a two-step protocol. In the first step, HLA allele expression cassettes were cloned into PiggyBac transposon vectors under constitutive promoters and cotransfected with a transposase helper plasmid into HCT116 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescent reporters (red fluorescent protein, blue fluorescent protein and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)) were included to enable tracking of transgene expression and selection of stable clones by drug selection, followed by flow cytometry sorting to ensure the expression of all transgenes within single cells. Cells were plated 1 day before infection, exposed to viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene and spinoculated at 800g for 90 min at 32 °C to enhance transduction efficiency. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh complete DMEM and cells were expanded for 5–7 days. Puromycin selection was applied to enrich for stable integrants, which were further purified by FACS on the basis of EGFP expression. For the functional evaluation of neoAg-specific immune responses, the 15-mer peptide CDC7 (TSRILNLQVLKKILR), which is restricted to MHC I, was used for in vitro validation. The peptide was synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies and used to stimulate PBMCs derived from LS trial participant 12 collected at baseline and at week 8 after Nous-209. PBMCs were cultured in R10 medium (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine (Corning, 10040CV), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone, SH30070.03), 10 mM HEPES buffer (Corning, 25060-CI) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Corning, 30002CI)), supplemented with 330 U per ml recombinant human IL-7. Stimulation was carried out using 4 µg ml−1 CDC7 peptide per well, with concanavalin A and DMSO serving as positive and negative controls, respectively. On days 3, 7 and 10, the cells were replenished with R10 medium containing 10 U per ml interleukin 2 (IL-2). After 12 days of culture, the expanded T cells were divided into two populations; one half was used for microfluidic coculture assays to assess tumor cell-targeting potency, while the other half was subjected to IL-2 withdrawal for subsequent IFNγ ELISpot analysis. On day 13, the second population of stimulated PBMCs was seeded in triplicate (3 × 105 cells per well) into 96-well ELISpot plates precoated with human IFNγ capture antibodies. SFCs were quantified using the ImmunoSpot S6 UNIVERSAL analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited). To evaluate the tumor-targeting potency of neoAg-stimulated T cells, experiments were performed using the OrganoPlate three-lane 64 microfluidic system (MIMETAS). A collagen I extracellular matrix (ECM) gel was prepared by mixing collagen I (5 mg ml−1; AMSbio), 1 M HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and NaHCO3 (Sigma) in a 1:1:8 ratio on ice. Then, 2 μl of the gel mixture was loaded into each gel inlet and polymerized in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Genetically modified HCT116 cells expressing CDC7 MG derived from the CDC7 gene mutation, encoding peptides of varying amino acid lengths, were used in these experiments. Cells were labeled with the fluorescent dye CellTracker red CMTPX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded into the top perfusion inlets adjacent to the ECM gel channels at a density of 10,000 cells per µl (2 µl per chip). The plate was incubated on its side for 3–4 h to ensure cell attachment to the ECM gel. NeoAg-stimulated PBMCs were labeled with the fluorescent dye CellTracker green CMFDA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded into the bottom perfusion channels at a 5:1 E:T ratio. Following cell seeding, 50 µl of culture medium was added to all perfusion inlets and outlets to ensure complete filling of the channels without air bubbles. The coculture system was maintained on a rocker platform (14° inclination, 8-min intervals) for 48 h to enable continuous medium perfusion. After the 48-h incubation, genetically modified HCT116 cells and control cells were collected from the microfluidic chamber outlets. Migrated T cells were depleted from the collected samples using CD3 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and column-based magnetic separation according to the manufacturer's instructions. This process ensured the efficient removal of CD3+ T cells, leaving a purified tumor cell population for downstream analyses. Apoptotic cell death was quantified using a caspase 3/7 luminescence assay, performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols. For viability, equal volumes of reagent and culture medium were added to samples, inducing cell lysis and generating a stable luminescent signal proportional to intracellular adenosine triphosphate content. Luminescence was recorded using a plate luminometer, expressed as relative luminescence units, normalized to untreated control wells and reported as percentage viability relative to control. For apoptosis, equal volumes of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent and sample were combined, resulting in caspase-mediated cleavage of a luminogenic DEVD substrate and light emission proportional to caspase 3/7 activity. Luminescence was recorded on a plate luminometer, normalized to control wells and expressed as percentage apoptosis relative to baseline. First, we deparaffinized the tissue sections with xylene and 100% alcohol. Then, tissues were collected and incubated with lysis buffer in the presence of proteinase K using the Roche microRNA isolation kit. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm and cell pellets were used for extraction of genomic DNA using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA quality was assessed using TapeStation analyzer; then, Twist exome capture, library preparation and raw sequencing were performed by the Advanced Technology Genomics Core at The University of Texas MDACC using the Illumina NovaSeqX platform. Alignment of WES data was performed using BWA-mem (version 0.7.19) with default parameters to human genome reference hg38. Duplicate reads were marked with GATK (version 4.6.2.0). Base quality recalibration was performed with GATK Apply BQSR. Tumor exome data were processed starting from the raw data (FASTQ files), which were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information under BioProject PRJNA954699. A preliminary quality control of the raw sequence data was performed by filtering out reads of low quality with Trimmomatic (version 0.33)33. Multimapping reads were filtered out using SAMtools (version 1.9)35. DNA alignments were further optimized at regions around indels and base scores were recalibrated after the optimization step using GATK software (version 3.7)36. Frameshift mutations within the Nous-209 neoAgs were identified from aligned sequencing data (BAM files) using a lookup-based approach. A mutation was considered present if a minimum of three reads supported the variant and the variant allele frequency (VAF) exceeded 10%, consistent with previously established criteria.27 MSI status of previously published datasets7 and colorectal adenomas from on-study colonoscopies was determined using MSIsensor2 (version 0.1; https://github.com/niu-lab/msisensor2.git)37 in ‘tumor-only' mode. MHC class I binding affinity predictions were performed using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource MHC I prediction tool (https://www.iedb.org/). Peptide sequences of interest were analyzed for their potential to bind HLA class I molecules using the Consensus method (version 2.18) with peptide lengths of 8, 9 and 10 aa. Downstream immunogenicity analyses were performed, prioritizing peptides on the basis of the results of MHC class I binding affinity predictions. The trial was conducted using Simon's minimax two-stage design, wherein the immunogenicity response rate was defined by the number of evaluable participants with immunogenicity by ELISpot assay among all treated participants. On the basis of prior evidence38, our primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated with respect to a predefined target immunogenicity response rate of ≥75%; by contrast, we considered a immunogenicity response rate of ≤55% to be unacceptable. In the first stage, 24 participants were enrolled and accrual halted to fully evaluate immunogenicity at week 9; with 16 or more responses observed in the first stage, additional participants enrolled in the study to reach a total of 36 evaluable participants. Upon study completion, Nous-209 vaccination was considered effective if >24 participants demonstrated immunogenicity. Immunogenicity rates are reported with 95% exact confidence intervals evaluated using the Clopper–Pearson method. Our study applied a Bayesian toxicity monitoring plan in which treatment would be considered unsafe if the estimated rate of unacceptable toxicity (grade 3 of higher treatment-related AEs except for vaccine reactogenicity symptoms) was ≥30% with a probability of ≥70%. Assuming a β prior probability of toxicity with parameters (0.3, 0.7) and considering the Simon's two-stage design, the trial had a 99.6% chance of stopping early if the true toxicity rate was 50% when the true response rate was 55%. SAS 9.4 was used for exploratory statistical analyses of associations between clinical and demographic factors and immunogenicity. Frequencies and percentages are reported for categorical variables. Summary statistics such as number of nonmissing observations, mean, median, s.d., minimum and maximum are provided for continuous data. The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the association between categorical variables and vaccine responses. Wilcoxon's rank sum test or Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the distributions of continuous response variables (such as the number positive pools at specific time points), across different demographic or clinical groups. Statistical analyses for cell viability, apoptosis and cytokine secretion were conducted using Prism 10 (GraphPad Software). For cell viability and apoptosis assays, data were analyzed across the following groups: genetically modified HCT116 cells cocultured with CDC7-stimulated PBMCs (patient 12 at baseline and after Nous-209), nongenetically modified HCT116 cells cocultured with CDC7-stimulated patient 12 PBMCs at baseline and after Nous-209 (control group) and genetically modified HCT116 cells cultured alone (CDC7-HCT116 control). Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-sided unpaired t-test, with significance indicated in the figure (P values < 0.0001). For the CTL-related IFNγ ELISpot secretion assay, paired t-tests were used to compare PBMCs at baseline and after Nous-209, with comparisons to the negative control (DMSO) and results expressed as the mean ± s.d. Significant differences are annotated in the respective figures for clarity. All other ELISpot data were presented as the mean ± s.e.m., with significance tested using a two-tailed, Mann–Whitney statistical analysis.

Reactogenic AEs included fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, myalgia/muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and arthralgia/joint pain. a) Heat map of the most recurrent immunogenic individual FSP identified in ≥ 5 participants assessed. b) Deconvolution of Pool 3 immune response at the level of single FSP in Pt 18 to identify the immunogenic reactive SPEF2 FSP. c) Baseline versus post Nous-209 T cell immune response against SPEF2 FSP in multiple LS carriers, with 7 pts sharing the HLA-B:08:01; bars in b and c show mean SFC/106 PMBCs ± SEM, dots refer to 3 technical replicates. d) Neoantigen-specific T cell responses were tracked in the blood at baseline and post Nous-209 by dextramer staining to detect CD8+ T cell response recognizing the immunogenic SPEF2 FSP mapped in Pt 18. Pie charts shows frequencies of naive (CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (CM; CD45RA−CCR7+), effector memory (EM; CD45RA−CCR7−) and T effector memory RA+ (TEMRA; CD45RA+CCR7−) cells in total CD8+ population (left-most chart) and CD8+dextramer+ populations from corresponding dot plots. Bars represent pre-IVS and post-IVS ELISpot results, shown as mean SFC/10⁶ PBMCs ± SEM, dots represent the 3 biological replicates used to generate each mean. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test; ****P < 0.0001. a) Representative dot plot for participant 18 intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for CD8+ cells producing CD107α (left) and IFN-γ (right) in ex vivo culture with DMSO or SPEF2 CD8 peptide. b) Schematic representation of the microfluidic 3D co-culture system used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of Nous-209-induced T cells against CDC7-expressing HCT116 cells. Effector T cells were co-cultured with genetically modified HCT116 target cells within an extracellular matrix gel under gravity-driven flow at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 5:1.
