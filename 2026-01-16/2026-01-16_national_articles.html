Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss a potential government shutdown, the impact of protests on the midterm elections and the reaction to a former 'SNL' star's criticisms about Rep. Jasmine Crockett. Democrats in the House of Representatives are claiming a posthumous victory from their 43-day government shutdown in October that left them empty-handed. "I think it looked good at both points, but certainly after we passed the bill on the House floor," Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., said. Despite a disappointing conclusion to the shutdown itself, Democrats like Ivey believe they're winning a messaging war over demands for expanded federal assistance as Congress eyes healthcare legislation. "Mission accomplished," Ivey said of the effort. The country first plunged into a shutdown on Oct. 1 when Democrats refused to advance spending legislation unless Congress renewed expiring COVID-19-era Obamacare subsidies. However, after weeks of stalled talks, a handful of Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government without securing any extension to the enhanced assistance. The shutdown's end brought bitter frustration to members like Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — so much so that he joined several Democrats in calling for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to step aside, citing a failure of leadership. Two months later, his outlook on the shutdown has softened. In his view, Democrats successfully turned the country's gaze. "He's been one of the most effective leaders in Congress on this issue," Khanna added. "I believe Hakeem has shown extraordinary leadership in making healthcare the issue." House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., walks toward the House Chamber on Capitol Hill on Dec. 18, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Rep. John Olszewski, D-Md., said, "I think the fight was absolutely worth it. He added that the shutdown, in hindsight, has given him confidence Democrats have a winning hand going forward. "I think it was not an issue. It wasn't — until Democrats stood firm and said, ‘We have to address this healthcare crisis.' I think some sort of extension, even if it includes reasonable guardrails about limits on income or provisions to help prevent fraud — we can do those things," Olszewski said. The forward-looking component of the shutdown's value is especially important for Abdul El-Sayed, a candidate for Senate in Michigan who had vented frustration with congressional Democrats over the shutdown's result. El-Sayed has built his campaign on advocating for universal healthcare and an increased government role in social services. To him, there's still nothing gained from winning a messaging war unless Democrats capitalize on it. "I think Democrats did a good thing by fighting the fight. We just haven't won it yet," El-Sayed said. It's unclear what Senate Republicans are going to do in the end." Abdul El-Sayed, a Senate candidate from Michigan, said nothing will be gained from winning the messaging war unless Democrats capitalize on it.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's push for the GOP to win midterms or risk impeachment. FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Eric Swalwell's gubernatorial campaign recently received almost $10,000 from the California-based office of a top Beijing law firm that has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, a Fox News Digital investigation found. The law firm's website reveals that this office is their "Silicon Valley Office" and appears to only have one lawyer who works there. Keliang "Clay" Zhu, who donated $5,000 to Swalwell's gubernatorial campaign this past November and previously donated over $10,000 to his House campaigns, is a partner at the law firm and is the only name listed for the "Silicon Valley Office," according to their website. While the firm, which has over two dozen offices in China, portrays themselves as independent, the firm and its lawyers continue to have longstanding cooperation with the Chinese government's departments and major state-owned enterprises. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., speaks during congressional hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Zhu, who is originally from China, touts several examples of how he has helped Chinese state-owned enterprises and other Chinese companies get a foothold in the United States, according to his bio. For example, he touts representing an "investment fund of a major state-owned enterprise in acquiring majority shares in one data analytics software company in the Silicon Valley," which he valued at $100M. Another bio touts how he "has assisted Chinese companies and funds to complete more than $9 billion investments in the fields of chips, unmanned vehicles, new energy, artificial intelligence, industrial automation, and biopharmaceuticals in the United States." His bio also says he helped advise "a governmental investment fund from Shenzhen for its compliance with CFIUS regulations in the U.S." and represented "WeChat users in a historic lawsuit that sued President Trump and successfully stopped his WeChat ban in 2020." Similar efforts to restrict WeChat have occurred in countries like Australia and India, according to the White House. Zhu also has a history of fighting against state-level legislation aimed at preventing China's foreign land grab in the United States. After a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit intended to stop a Texas law banning Chinese nationals from owning or leasing land in the state, Zhu described the legislation as "unfair, unconstitutional and un-American," according to AsAmNews, a daily news site focused on Asian-American and Pacific-Islander communities. Zhu similarly expressed disfavor with a Florida law meant to prevent individuals from countries that are foreign adversaries to the United States, such as China, from buying up land. National security experts have sounded the alarm about China increasingly buying up farmland, property near military bases and other land near places of strategic value, which has been matched with state-level legislation in places like Texas, Florida, Arizona and more. Chinese land grabs in the United States have been an ongoing concern for lawmakers. Currently, Congress is considering multiple bills related to the matter, while almost two dozen states have already passed legislation to implement changes around foreign land purchases in their states. "All Asian Americans will feel the stigma and the chilling effect created by this Florida law, just like the discriminatory laws did to our ancestors more than a hundred years ago," Zhu said in 2023 about an anti-land grab bill, according to a press release from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Michael Lucci, a top China expert and the State Armor Action founder and CEO, sounded the alarm over the donations and called for Congress to reform the "campaign finance laws to define donations made on behalf of foreign adversaries to be bribes." "Congressman Swalwell must finally stop playing footsie with America's foremost adversary: Communist China. First was his fiery romance with Fang Fang, a CCP spy, and now he's caught taking campaign checks from Communist China's favorite big law firm," Lucci told Fox News Digital. "Congress must fix this problem by reforming campaign finance laws to define donations made on behalf of foreign adversaries to be bribes, and to impose criminal penalties upon those who make such donations. And Congress should go further by altogether prohibiting the acceptance of payment for any lobbying or other influence work on behalf of an American adversary, as the State of Texas did last year." Chinese President Xi Jinping discussing the country's economic and social development at a political gathering in Beijing, China. Li Wang, another top attorney and the chief global partner of the Beijing office, touts how she "has served as general legal counsel for scores of Ministries of the PRC, state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises and institutions." Her bio also says she is the "Commissary of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Beijing Committee" and the "Chairman of Belt & Road Service Connections." Representative Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., was mocked on X this week after posting a video of himself lifting weights while trashing Republicans. Swalwell has repeatedly claimed he cut off ties as soon as U.S. intelligence officials warned him of the threat and a congressional ethics investigation into the matter eventually found no wrongdoing on Swalwell's behalf. However, he was ultimately removed by Republicans from his post on the House Intelligence Committee, with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy citing Swalwell's past run-in with a suspected Chinese spy. Lucci told Fox News Digital that Swalwell should commit to halting any further dalliances with America's foreign adversaries, and re-donate the funds he received from DeHeng Law Offices and Zhu "to an organization that fights the evils of communism." Fox News Digital reached out to Swalwell and Zhu for comment on this story, but did not hear back by publication. Cameron Cawthorne is a politics editor for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Governor Wanda Vázquez speaks at a press conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 21, 2020. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to pardon former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez, a White House official said Friday. Her sentencing was set for later this month. Federal prosecutors had been seeking one year behind bars, something that Vázquez's attorneys opposed as they accused prosecutors of violating a guilty plea deal reached last year that saw previous charges including bribery and fraud dropped. They noted that Vázquez had agreed to plead guilty to accepting a promise of a campaign contribution that was never received. The official who confirmed the planned pardon indicated Trump saw the case as political prosecution and said the investigation into Vázquez, a Republican aligned with the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had begun 10 days after she endorsed Trump in 2020. Vázquez, an attorney, was the U.S. territory's first former governor to plead guilty to a crime, specifically accepting a donation from a foreigner for her 2020 political campaign. She was arrested in August 2022 and accused of engaging in a bribery scheme from December 2019 through June 2020 while governor. Authorities said that Puerto Rico's Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions was investigating an international bank owned by Venezuelan Julio Martín Herrera Velutini because of alleged suspicious transactions that had not been reported by the bank. Authorities said Herrera and Mark Rossini, a former FBI agent who provided consulting services to Herrera, allegedly promised to support Vázquez's campaign if she dismissed the commissioner and appointing a new one of Herrera's choosing. Authorities said Vázquez demanded the commissioner's resignation in February 2020 after allegedly accepting the bribery offer. She also was accused of appointing a new commissioner in May 2020: a former consultant for Herrera's bank. Vázquez was the second woman to serve as Puerto Rico's governor and the first former governor to face federal charges. Ricardo Rosselló resigned following massive protests. Vázquez served until 2021, after losing the primaries of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party to former Gov. Associated Press reporter Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico contributed.</p>

President Donald Trump will pardon former Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced and her co-defendants, Fox News has learned. "This entire case is an example of political prosecution. In August of 2022, Wanda Vazquez faced bribery charges related to the financing of her 2020 gubernatorial campaign. Ms. Vazquez' pardon materials state that there was never any element of a quid pro quo deal and that her prosecution was politically motivated. The investigation into Ms. Vazquez began 10 days after she endorsed President Trump in 2020," a White House official told Fox News. Then-Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced speaks during a press conference to announce strict new rules for all passengers flying into Puerto Rico to curb coronavirus cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on June 30, 2020. The White House official also told Fox News that Trump will pardon Vázquez's co-defendants, Julio Martin Herrera-Velutini and Mark Rossini, a former FBI agent. "The investigation, she contends, not only monitored her campaign, but also included a monitoring of the Trump campaign. Additionally, Ms. Vazquez believes that there was no bribery at all because the discussions with the banker concerned a matter of agreeing on policy with a potential donor, and not taking action in exchange for a material gain. This case bears similarities to that of Alexander Sittenfeld, who received a pardon in May of 2025," the official added. In 2022, Vázquez was arrested on bribery charges linked to her 2020 campaign. She was accused of engaging in a bribery scheme from December 2019 through June 2020, according to The Associated Press. Former Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez exits the court after her appearance in relation with federal bribery charges in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Aug.4, 2022. "I assure you that they have committed a great injustice against me." In 2019, Herrera's bank was under scrutiny by Puerto Rico's Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, which reportedly believed there were suspicious transactions not reported by the bank, according to the AP. Herrera and Rossini reportedly promised to support Vázquez's 2020 campaign in exchange for her dismissing the commissioner and appointing a new one, the AP reported at the time, citing unspecified authorities. The outlet said that officials claimed Herrera and Rossini paid more than $300,000 to political consultants to support Vázquez's campaign. President Donald Trump during a Mexican Border Defense medal presentation in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. In 2025, Trump issued a slew of controversial pardons, including Jan. 6 defendants, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, former Rep. George Santos, Tim Leiweke, former president of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez and reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Colin Cowherd discusses the news and asks if this was the right decision for both parties. Baltimore Ravens star edge rusher Kyle Van Noy wants to see the NFL make a change to the intentional grounding rule. "One thing the @NFL needs to change back is intentional grounding from a QB should be a sack again! You work so hard as a defender and a QB can just get to throw it away to avoid the sack, taking away money from a defender! Baltimore Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy (53) looks on during the first quarter against the Buffalo Bills in an AFC divisional round game at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, on Jan. 19, 2025. As currently written, intentional grounding is when a quarterback is under duress within the tackle box, facing an imminent loss of yardage, and throws a forward pass that is not in the direction and vicinity of an on originally eligible receiver. The penalty for intentional grounding is a loss of down and 10 yards from the previous spot. If intentional grounding occurs in the end zone, it is a safety. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) throws a pass against Baltimore Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy (53) during the second half at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, on Nov. 27, 2025. Van Noy wants the edge rushers to receive credit for a sack on an intentional grounding, as plenty of edge rushers in the NFL have incentive bonuses for sacks recorded, and they are the ones who cause the penalty. Six-time Pro Bowler Eric Weddle responded to Van Noy's post, agreeing with him. NFL fans can play FOX Super 6 and win cash prizes. 3 guys should be a team sack if it's hard to tell but most of the time you can establish half sacks and full sacks. If not … guys can turn the call in so they can take a deeper let look at it. If 2 guys are hitting him should get a half. I also think they take out half sacks and give full sacks for both but that's just me, that might be a little greedy," Van Noy posted on X. In 15 games, he had two sacks, 20 tackles and one interception. Last season, Van Noy recorded 12.5 sacks and made the Pro Bowl. He will be a free agent this offseason.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said today that the agency is “working” to equip immigration officers with body-worn cameras. Throughout President Donald Trump's monthslong surge of federal immigration officers, cell phone videos captured by civilians have shown officers using aggressive tactics to arrest immigrants and crack down on protesters. DHS has said these videos — including the ones showing an ICE officer fatally shooting Renee Good in Minneapolis — do not capture the moments leading up to what is recorded. The officer who shot Good used his cellphone to record their interaction. CNN previously reported that some, but not all, ICE field offices are given body-worn cameras. Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good, testified during a separate case in December that immigration agents in the Minneapolis area “cannot wear them.” When asked by CNN's Pamela Brown about ICE officers using cameras, McLaughlin said they are “of course” allowed to wear them. Asked whether all ICE officers will have body cameras, McLaughlin responded: “We are working on that with the One Big Beautiful Bill, actually.” The law signed by Trump last July gave DHS an unprecedented surge in funding to hire and equip more immigration officers. President Donald Trump forewarned leaders in Minnesota that he may intervene if protests continue amid immigration enforcement activities. “In Minnesota, the Troublemakers, Agitators, and Insurrectionists are, in many cases, highly paid professionals,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday. “The Governor and Mayor don't know what to do, they have totally lost control, and our currently being rendered, USELESS!” he went on. A day earlier, he said he would use the law if needed to “quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State.” President Donald Trump suggested he wants to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his current role rather than nominating him to become Federal Reserve chair. “Kevin has it so good … We don't want to lose him.” Hassett, a conservative economist who has advised Republicans throughout his career, has long been seen as the front-runner in Trump's deliberations for Fed chair, praised for his ability to articulate the president's sweeping policies. More context: In an interview with Fox Business earlier today, Hassett weighed in on the Justice Department's investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell over testimony he gave last year on the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation to its Washington, DC, headquarters — the same interview Trump said he watched. … (US Attorney) Jeanine Pirro said that she was asking questions all the way back a few months ago, and so they felt the necessity of doing it this way. “Jay's a good man, I expect that there's nothing to see here — that the cost overruns are related to things like asbestos, as he says — but I sure wish they had been more transparent,” he added. Last month, Trump hinted he may nominate Hassett to be Fed chair. President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering applying new tariffs on countries that opposite his ambition of annexing Greenland. So I may do that,” Trump said during an event focused on health care at the White House. Trump's push to control Greenland has prompted outrage among European nations, who fear the move could rupture longstanding transatlantic ties. Some have begun sending troops to the semiautonomous Arctic island that's currently a territory of Denmark. Representatives from Greenland and Denmark visited the White House this week for inconclusive meetings about Trump's plans. Tensions flared in Minneapolis again last night in the wake of a second shooting by a federal immigration officer in just one week, as President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act that would allow the deployment of US troops to Minnesota. CIA Director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas yesterday, according to a US official. “During the meeting in Caracas, Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers,” the official said. The meeting comes as President Donald Trump has asserted control over Venezuela, particularly its oil production, saying the US will effectively “run” the country following its capture of Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. Trump has shown support for Rodríguez, a longtime regime insider, over opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with the president yesterday. Troop activity in Greenland, with several European NATO countries deploying small numbers of military personnel there this week, has no bearing on President Donald Trump's push to acquire the Danish territory, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters yesterday. “I don't think troops in Europe impact the president's decision making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,” Leavitt said, underscoring the president's position. The comments come following Wednesday's meeting between Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The two delegations “agreed to really establish a working group of individuals who will continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland,” Leavitt said, adding that the talks would occur “every two to three weeks.” Meanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of US Senators, including Senators Chris Coons, Thom Tillis, Jeanne Shaheen and Dick Durbin, is expected to meet with Danish and Greenlandic government and business leaders in Copenhagen today. The group will hold a joint press conference around 9 a.m. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado told reporters yesterday, that she had “presented” US President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal as a gift during an “extraordinary” meeting at the White House. Trump has long coveted the prize, but the committee that awards it has been clear that it cannot be shared or transferred. However, Trump has previously indicated he does not think Machado has enough respect within Venezuela to govern – and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that he had not changed his view. Three-quarters of Americans say they oppose the United States attempting to take control of Greenland, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, indicating that President Donald Trump's push to expand America's territory faces stiff headwinds with the public. Even the president's partisans are about evenly divided, with 50% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying they support it and 50% opposed. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are deeply against the move, with 94% opposed overall, including 80% who say they strongly oppose it. About 8 in 10 independents who don't lean toward either party are also opposed. Trump said Wednesday on his social media website Truth Social that “anything less” than US control of Greenland is “unacceptable.” The message came ahead of a meeting at the White House between Danish officials, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that appeared to do little to bring the two sides any closer to an agreement.</p>

Renee Good's former father-in-law Tim Macklin Sr. joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her death, give an update on his grandson and react to the Minnesota protesters acting 'in her name.' Several Republican lawmakers are looking to talk President Donald Trump out of invoking the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis as the city sees demonstrations over the fatal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-involved shooting of Renee Nicole Good. If invoked, the Insurrection Act would allow Trump to deploy active-duty troops or federalized National Guard members to restore order.

(Alex Kormann/The Minnesota Star Tribune via Getty Images) Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., seemed to downplay Trump's threat, placing his hope in local law enforcement's ability to "settle things down." "Hopefully the local officials working with not only the federal law enforcement, ICE and other agencies, but also the local law enforcement officials will be able to settle things down," Thune told reporters. Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., cast doubt on whether it would be appropriate to invoke the act, according to The Hill. "I have felt that since the fatal shooting [of Good] a week or so ago that we needed to be very, very careful, very cautious in how we proceed, not only in Minnesota but in other areas, to keep the conflict, the potential for conflict as it relates to ICE enforcement dialed back," Murkowski said, according to The Hill. We don't need that," Murkowski added, according to The Hill. Demonstrators carry a banner during an "I Can't Breathe" Silent March For Justice in Minneapolis, Minn., on Sunday, March 7, 2021. "If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great state," Trump wrote on Truth Social. Tim Walz called for calm and issued an appeal to the people of his state. This is not who we are," the Democrat said. "And an appeal to Minnesotans: I know this is scary. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. A firework was set off near the scene of a shooting in Minneapolis on Jan. 14, 2026. In response to Walz, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, "Tim Walz, Jacob Frey, and Democrat leaders in Minnesota have done nothing but turn up the temperature, smear heroic ICE officers, and incite violence against them — all in defense of criminal illegal aliens." "In Minnesota, ICE has arrested rapists, drug traffickers, domestic abusers, and more, despite Democrat opposition. The only statement Tim Walz should be making is an apology. He has repeatedly compared ICE officers to Nazis and lied about their important work, including in his speech just last night," Jackson also said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Demonstrations over the country's ailing economy which began on December 28 soon morphed into a direct challenge to its ruling theocracy. A woman crosses an intersection in downtown Tehran, Iran, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. A street vendor adjusts clothes for sale in downtown Tehran, Iran, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. Iranian opposition leader Reza Pahlavi speaks during a news conference on Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, in Washington. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic. Harsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran's ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country's theocracy. There have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country. Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.” Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran. Khatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump's soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.” “They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. His fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Russia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria's former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year's U.S. and Israeli  attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had  raised concerns  with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region. Yet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance. “I believe the president is a man of his word,” Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that “regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“ Despite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government. Even as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic. At a border crossing in Turkey's eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout. “I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns. Mehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey. A representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran. The agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities.</p>

(AP Photo/Adam Gray) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Liberian man who has been shuttled in and out of custody since immigration agents in Minnesota broke down his door with a battering ram was released again Friday, hours after a routine check-in with authorities led to his second arrest. The dramatic initial arrest of Garrison Gibson last weekend was captured on video. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled the arrest unlawful Thursday and freed him, but Gibson was detained again Friday when he appeared at an immigration office. A few hours later, Gibson was free again, attorney Marc Prokosch said. “In the words of my client, he said that somebody at ICE said they bleeped up and so they re-released him this afternoon and so he's out of custody,” Prokosch said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Gibson's arrest is one of more than 2,500 made during a weekslong immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and St. Paul, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Gibson, 37, who fled the civil war in his West African home country as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what's known as an order of supervision, Prokosch said, and complied with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities. In his Thursday order, the judge agreed that officials violated regulations by not giving Gibson enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked. Prokosch said he was told by ICE that they are “now going through their proper channels” to revoke the order. Meanwhile, tribal leaders and Native American rights organizations are advising anyone with a tribal ID to carry it with them when out in public in case they are approached by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Native Americans across the U.S. have reported being stopped or detained by ICE, and tribal leaders are asking members to report these contacts. Democratic members of Congress held a local meeting Friday to hear from people who say they've had aggressive encounters with immigration agents. St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who is Hmong American, said people are walking around with their passports in case they are challenged, and she has received reports of ICE agents going from door to door “asking where the Asian people live.” Thousands of Hmong people, largely from the Southeast Asian nation of Laos, have settled in the United States since the 1970s. Minneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls, all related to the fatal shooting of Good. Another ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, pulled his gun and fired at close range, jumping back as the SUV moved past him. FBI Director Kash Patel said at least one person has been arrested for stealing property from an FBI vehicle in Minneapolis. The SUV was among government vehicles whose windows were broken Wednesday evening. Attorney General Pam Bondi said body armor and weapons were stolen. Minnesota's attorney general said he would sue if the president acts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum speaks at the National Palace in Mexico City, Nov. 7, 2025. MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing “compelling results” in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration. The comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened that U.S. forces “will now start hitting land” in Mexico targeting drug cartels, after the dramatic United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro. The early January raid in Venezuela set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico. On Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed “more must be done to confront shared threats.” Sheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S. She reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico. “The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,” she said. Sheinbaum said she again told Trump that U.S. intervention in Mexico was unnecessary.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is threatening to punish countries with tariffs if they don't back the U.S. controlling Greenland. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland,” the president said, without providing details. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska., arrives as members of the Danish Parliament and a Greenlandic committee meet with American Congress members at the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026.

Military vessel HDMS Ejnar Mikkelsen of the Royal Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don't back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital. Trump for months has insisted that the U.S. should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.” During an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals. “I may do that for Greenland too,” Trump said. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” he said. Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. That encounter didn't resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views. European leaders have insisted that is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies. In Copenhagen, a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives met Friday with Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers, and with leaders including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Delegation leader Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thanked the group's hosts for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said that “we had a strong and robust dialogue about how we extend that into the future.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said after meeting lawmakers that the visit reflected a strong relationship over decades and “it is one that we need to nurture.” She told reporters that “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset, and I think that's what you're hearing with this delegation.” Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. “We have heard so many lies, to be honest and so much exaggeration on the threats towards Greenland,” said Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic politician and member of the Danish parliament who took part in Friday's meetings. “I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, we do not think that that is a good idea,” she said. Along with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Murkowski has introduced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit the use of U.S. Defense or State department funds to annex or take control of Greenland or the sovereign territory of any NATO member state without that ally's consent or authorization from the North Atlantic Council. Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Tuesday that “if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. Indigenous Inuit in Greenland do not want to be colonized again, she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hard-right and populist leaders from across the globe have appeared in an online video endorsing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán ahead of an election that polls suggest could end his long premiership. The campaign video, published by Orbán this week, shows 11 national leaders and hard-right figureheads – including France's Marine Le Pen, Italy's Giorgia Meloni and Argentina's Javier Milei – endorsing the Hungarian leader's bid for a fifth consecutive term in office. The American actor Rob Schneider also lent his support. Orbán, who returned to power in 2010 and is Europe's longest-serving prime minister, has become a lodestar for European populists and the MAGA movement in the United States. Championing national sovereignty, traditional values and hard borders, Orbán has long railed against the European Union, without seeking to leave it. But while Orbán still commands affection abroad, he is facing a growing backlash at home. Over 16 years in office, his Fidesz party has been criticized for presiding over Hungary's democratic backsliding, economic stagnation and curbs on press freedom. Leading the charge against Orbán is Péter Magyar, a former Fidesz loyalist-turned-arch-rival. Magyar's Tisza party has led Fidesz in the polls for more than a year, campaigning mostly against what it says is government corruption, and promising to boost Hungary's economy. It must be won,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the campaign video. “I think Victor Orbán has all those qualities. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Orbán was responsible for “the camp of patriots, and defenders of nations and sovereign peoples,” for achieving “ever greater success in Europe.” Le Pen was convicted last year for embezzling EU funds and received a five-year ban on running for political office, which would disqualify her from the French presidential election next year. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she and Orbán are partners in a political project: “Together, we stand for a Europe that respects national sovereignty, (and) is proud of its cultural and religious roots.” Orbán's Central European allies – including Czech President Andrej Babiš and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki – also voiced their support. The video also included several references to Russia's war in Ukraine, with which Hungary shares a border. Orbán, who met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in November, has repeatedly obstructed EU efforts to fund Ukraine's defense. On Thursday, he said he would launch a “national petition” seeking backing for his policy of rejecting the EU's latest financial support package for Ukraine. Despite not featuring in the video, US President Donald Trump did write Orbán a letter in December wishing him “the best of luck” with his electoral campaign. Despite having more than three years to do so, Trump – who praised Orbán as a “great leader” of a “great country” – said it had been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked. The Czech Republic, another landlocked country, stopped buying Russian oil after the invasion of Ukraine, while Hungary chose to deepen its dependence on Russia. Last year, Russia accounted for more than 90% of Hungary's crude oil imports – up from 61% pre-invasion, according to a report from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minnesota's federal lawsuit against Trump administration officials primarily focuses on how the surge of federal immigration agents into Minneapolis and the fatal shooting of Renee Good have terrorized local residents. “Officers who joined the department after 2020 report similar emotional impacts, having experienced prior unrest as community members.” One police source referred to the current situation as a “mess.” “But becoming mediators between the federal government and activists is not what we signed up for.” “This isn't just any city; this is Minneapolis,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national police research and policy organization. “Minneapolis, going back to 2020, became ground zero in the whole policing discussion.” Whistles, then gunfire: How the deadly ICE shooting unfolded in Minneapolis In particular, the unrest nearly six years ago has had a few clear impacts: First, the police remain badly understaffed and are concerned about diverting limited resources to ICE-related issues. Second, police have focused more on de-escalation tactics, a sharp contrast from ICE. Together, these indicate that federal immigration agents are likely to face more significant and sustained pushback in Minneapolis than elsewhere. According to the state's lawsuit, filed on Monday, the federal actions have pushed a short-staffed police force into costly overtime, diverted police resources and caused mental stress for officers. A Department of Justice attorney did not explicitly contest the claims and was given a deadline of Monday to respond to the suit. While the local police do not enforce immigration law, they have often been called on to respond to issues created by the presence and actions of federal agents. Answering all those calls is a challenge for the understaffed department. Minneapolis police once boasted over 900 sworn officers, but in the years after George Floyd's murder, the tally fell to a low of 550 officers. With an aggressive recruitment strategy, the police force grew to 600 officers last year – still a small number compared to the city's population of about 400,000. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN last year the police department relied on an “exorbitant” amount of overtime hours to cover all its shifts. Scheduled days off were canceled and officers worked longer shifts to cover the shortage. “These changes have impacted officers' personal lives and leave them exhausted,” the lawsuit says. The source said he knows of several colleagues who are taking early retirement. “We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation,” O'Hara said last month, according to the Associated Press. “The expectation in Minneapolis is very different probably than any other city, and that's why the police chief of Minneapolis, Brian O'Hara, is probably so sensitive to how tactics are, how you identify yourself, and all of those issues,” Wexler said. “ICE and (Customs and Border Protection) are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.” Just on Tuesday, federal agents on the streets of Minneapolis covered their faces and conducted traffic stops amid crowds of demonstrators, CNN's Ryan Young witnessed. “This crowd is extremely angry and it feels like this thing is sort of sitting on a powder keg right now,” Young explained. Similarly, O'Hara said he was concerned that tensions could escalate to a dangerous level, like in 2020, when the city was overtaken by riots, looting and arson. “I'm concerned that the rhetoric keeps escalating, that the tensions keep rising, that we are headed towards yet another tragedy and a potential trigger to what happened here yet again in 2020,” he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday. On Wednesday night, law enforcement and demonstrators clashed near where a federal agent shot and injured a man after he allegedly assaulted the agent. O'Hara declared the stand-off an “unlawful assembly” and directed people to go home. Masked agents and public arrests: A closer look at ICE's increasingly aggressive tactics Minneapolis residents, though, have had a crash course since 2020 on proper police conduct, federal-local relations, consent decrees, “defund the police” and other law enforcement issues. “The people in Minneapolis have that education already,” Johnson said. They know the telltale signs of when something's not quite right.” Sam Clingan, a father of two young boys, told CNN at a memorial for Good in Minneapolis that he and his kids have spoken about these issues. “Unfortunately, this isn't a new practice for us, having tough conversations about things that have happened in our city,” he said. Lots of people who are very connected in the social justice community and who make sure they bring that perspective into their day-to-day lives and how they organize their community and step up for their community,” he said. “Every day, regular Minneapolis residents devote hours to documenting ICE conduct, warning our neighbors, bringing food and other goods to neighbors who are sheltering in place, and providing other support,” she said, according to CNN affiliate KARE. There are literally hundreds of people in the streets right now as we speak driving around checking ICE and their conduct.” They have abided by the Constitution, which is a massive juxtaposition against what we've seen from some of these ICE agents,” Frey said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Democrats believe they've uncovered a backdoor to limiting President Donald Trump's military operations abroad and conducting oversight despite limited minority power and few Republicans willing to buck the administration. Democrats are prepared to force a flurry of votes on war powers resolutions in the coming weeks and months after one on Venezuela — despite its failure — secured last-minute concessions from the White House. Democrats are eyeing six other countries where Trump has threatened, or has already taken, military action: Iran, Colombia, Cuba, Nigeria, Mexico, and Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. The plans come after Trump was forced to offer assurances this week to flip two Republicans crucial to avoiding another embarrassing setback by squashing a bipartisan resolution that would have curbed further military actions in Venezuela without Congress. Such measures require floor votes, against the wishes of Republican leaders, and only need a simple majority. “But we also feel like the prospect of these votes causes the administration to take some important steps that he otherwise wouldn't take.” Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Todd Young (R-IN), who days earlier voted with all Democrats and three other Republicans to advance the resolution that would have limited Trump's unilateral military capabilities following the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. Those promises included letters from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Young and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Risch (R-ID) confirming there were no U.S. armed forces currently in the South American country and that Trump would seek congressional authority or give written notification should the situation change. Hawley cited Rubio's assurances as satisfactory, and Young said he also secured public congressional testimony from Rubio that will occur after next week's Senate recess. It's merely an effort to kind of reset our work on war powers,” Young told the Washington Examiner. The Venezuela vote required Vice President JD Vance to cast his eighth tiebreaker. Unlike Venezuela, Trump has only expressed threats regarding Iran, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, and Greenland. Last month, Trump struck Islamic State group targets in Nigeria. “I'm not interested in helping [Democrats] with their politics,” Hawley told the Washington Examiner. Democrats are bullish that a vote on Greenland could prove even more difficult for Republicans than Venezuela, given Trump's escalating rhetoric in seizing the NATO ally by military force. Susan Collins (R-ME), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Democrats to limit Trump's authorities in Venezuela, was noncommittal on her position with a Greenland resolution but noted she's been “consistent” in recent months in her support for previous war powers resolutions on Venezuela. “I don't even like to think about a war powers resolution with Greenland in it,” Murkowski told the Washington Examiner. But others, such as Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), despite echoing the concerns of Collins and Murkowski about Trump's Greenland rhetoric, have downplayed the need to address it with what they characterize as unnecessary preemptive action by Congress. And another possible handicap to Democrats' success is their healthy dose of skepticism that the administration will keep the promises it has made to members of its own party. “We are wise to be wary about commitments by these guys,” Kaine said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protests erupted once again Thursday night in Minneapolis, fueled by outrage over federal agents' tactics in confronting Minnesotans – including US citizens. Twelve people were arrested in Minneapolis, according to the Department of Homeland Security. “Last night in Minneapolis 12 anti-ICE agitators were arrested for assaulting law enforcement,” DHS posted on X Friday morning. Federal officers in tactical gear deployed tear gas and percussion grenades to try to disperse crowds near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. State and local leaders have urged the community to remain calm amid unrest that escalated earlier this week after a federal agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan national who federal officials said began to resist arrest and “violently assault” one of its officers. But heated clashes could soon turn frigid as plunging temperatures and fierce winds of 30 to 40 mph blast through the Twin Cities. By Friday evening, the wind chill will plummet below zero degrees – and it's expected to stay that way until the middle of next week. From Saturday night into Sunday morning, the actual temperatures will drop below zero, with blustery winds ushering wind chills as low as -20 degrees. Minnesota and Illinois invoke the 10th Amendment in lawsuits to block federal agents in their cities. Trump using Insurrection Act in Minneapolis would be a huge risk – even by his standards CNN's Brandon Miller, Kelly McCleary, Danya Gainor, Samantha Waldenberg and Elise Hammond contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is exerting political pressure on Stars & Stripes, the independent military newspaper that informs US servicemembers worldwide. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell announced Thursday that the Department of Defense will “modernize” the outlet and “refocus its content away from woke distractions that syphon morale, and adapt it to serve a new generation of service members.” Parnell's statement came as a shock to staffers at Stars & Stripes, who haven't heard directly about any changes yet, and who now fear that the news outlet's independence and credibility is at risk. The statement also drew swift criticism from several Democratic lawmakers and First Amendment advocates. “The Pentagon is trying to turn this independent newsroom into a mouthpiece for the administration's political messaging,” said Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director for PEN America. Congress has repeatedly affirmed and sought to protect the newspaper's unique status. Stars & Stripes is a product of the US military and is partly funded by the Pentagon, but it models itself after commercial newspapers and covers the news freely, “without news management or censorship,” as Department of Defense policy states. “By keeping its audience informed, Stars and Stripes enhances military readiness and better enables U.S. military personnel and their families stationed overseas to exercise their responsibilities of citizenship,” the newspaper's website says. Like many papers, Stars & Stripes runs wire stories from The Associated Press and Reuters, but Pentagon officials told right-wing website The Daily Wire that “this will no longer be the case.” Parnell described Stars & Stripes as being “custom tailored to our warfighters” going forward, prompting some journalists to say that the paper already is. With no further details about what's next, “people are obviously concerned about what this means for our ability to produce journalism going forward,” a Stripes staffer told CNN on condition of anonymity. Richardson, of PEN America, urged Congress to “continue to protect Stars and Stripes' editorial independence and ensure the administration allows it to serve military members free from political influence.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal prosecutors charged 26 people in a massive college basketball point-shaving scheme Thursday, which involved numerous players and teams from NCAA Division I men's basketball. College basketball players were bribed to throw games and enrich sports gamblers during a recent period from September 2022 to February of last year. “It enveloped the world of college basketball,” he said at a news conference in Philadelphia. “For example, if a team was favored to lose by 4 points, the player would receive a bribe to underperform so that his team would lose by more than that,” Metcalf said. The betting scheme began with bets placed on Chinese Basketball Association games. Former Chicago Bulls player Antonio Blakeney allegedly colluded with Marvis Fairley and Shane Hennen to fix CBA games. Hennen, we allege, texted a confederate that the only things certain in life were ‘death, taxes, and Chinese basketball. The betting scheme was then moved to the United States, and conspirators began recruiting college basketball players to participate. “The pattern of college basketball game integrity conduct revealed by law enforcement today is not entirely new information to the NCAA,” Baker said in a statement. The college basketball betting scheme comes after the NCAA banned three prominent Division 1 basketball players for participating in “sports-betting related game manipulation.”</p>
