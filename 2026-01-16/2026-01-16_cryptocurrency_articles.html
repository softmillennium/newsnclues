                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto wants its way—even if it means near-term pain. Fresh disagreements over how crypto should be regulated have undercut early 2026 "we are so back" vibes. While there was a rally in market prices earlier this week, that more recently has stumbled as the Clarity Act, legislation that seeks to create a regulatory framework for the industry, stalled in Washington. That, however, was postponed after Coinbase (COIN) chief Brian Armstrong pulled his support, citing issues including language that would appear to put one of the company's products at risk. Lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating an ethics issue that would restrict senior government officials, including President Donald Trump, from profiting from crypto. Shares of crypto companies including Coinbase, Circle (CRCL), and Bullish (BLSH) took hits following the news, but appear to be recouping some ground Friday. Fresh disagreement over how crypto should be regulated has blunted the rally in bitcoin and other altcoins. That dynamic recalls how, last year, crypto prices stalled despite a number of regulatory wins—though prices were on the upswing to start 2026 before this latest round of uncertainty. He listed issues with the draft bill, including what he called a "defacto ban on tokenized equities," and "amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins." One of the bigger issues Armstrong outlined has to do with stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-specific law passed last year, prohibited issuers like Circle from offering yield to customers but left open a loophole that would allow companies like Coinbase to provide them. The draft restricted rewards that resemble savings accounts after banks pressed lawmakers to address the issue, arguing that it would sap deposits and hurt smaller lending firms. Arjun Sethi, co-chief of crypto exchange Kraken, disagreed with Armstrong that the Clarity Act "would be materially worse" than the current state of affairs. "Walking away would not preserve the status quo in practice," Sethi said on social media Wednesday evening, expressing support for the bill. Another point of contention: The bill would ban senior government officials from profiting on crypto ventures, which Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said was outside of his committee's jurisdiction in an interview with CoinDesk, owned by crypto exchange Bullish, and would have to be addressed "at a later date." Given the scope of some of conflict, some crypto entrepreneurs have expressed doubt that the bill will pass this year, especially with an election ahead that will likely divert attentions. "Senate Banking Chairman Scott; Trump-tied ethics clash doesn't belong in his crypto bill."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samson Mow, a vocal Bitcoin proponent and CEO of JAN3, who is focused on Bitcoin nation-state adoption, has once again drawn the community's attention to unique BTC features that make it the most decentralized digital currency on the market. Mow is known as one of the believers that BTC is definitely going to surge to $1 million in the near future. Today, he took to his X account to remind the audience about the thing that makes Bitcoin what it is and drives Wall Street to chase it — the programmed scarcity of this cryptocurrency. Samson Mow reminded the crypto community that there can only exist 21 million Bitcoin. It is worth noting that more than 19 million coins have already been mined. Besides, the Bitcoin mining mechanism includes so-called halvings, created to make BTC deflationary. Earlier this week, Samson Mow shared the time period when he expects Bitcoin to definitely skyrocket to $1 million, and perhaps even higher. He reckons that it will be possible since Bitcoin is likely to add roughly $150,000 to its price every year before then. During some of those years, he expects Bitcoin to print Omega candles, while in some years, Bitcoin may trade sideways, letting investors stock up on it. What's more, Mow believes that if either option hits strong enough, Bitcoin may reach $1 million sooner than 2031. Currently, Bitcoin is largely reacting to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and other countries, including trade tariffs imposed by the U.S. on them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investment bank Jefferies' longtime “Greed & Fear” strategist Christopher Wood has reportedly eliminated Bitcoin from his flagship model portfolio, citing mounting concerns that advances in quantum computing may undermine the cryptocurrency's long-term security. He argued that quantum breakthroughs would weaken Bitcoin's claim to be a dependable store of value for pension‑style investors. ​Wood added that concern over quantum risk is rising among long-term, institutional investors, warning that some capital allocators now question Bitcoin's store of value case if quantum timelines compress. He said he feared that “cryptographically relevant” machines arriving sooner than expected could let attackers derive private keys from exposed public keys, weakening the cryptography underpinning Bitcoin balances and mining rewards and, in the extreme, challenging its role as “digital gold” for pension‑style portfolios. The quantum issue has been discussed for years among developers and commentators, but Wood's move shows how it's now influencing mainstream asset allocation decisions at major brokerage and research houses. Castle Island Ventures partner and Bitcoin advocate Nic Carter has discussed the quantum issue at length, warning in December that “capital is concerned and looking for a solution” on quantum risk, even though many developers, including Blockstream CEO Adam Back, remain skeptical that it is a near‑term problem. Macro analyst Luke Gromen has also turned cautious on Bitcoin in recent months, citing macro and technological uncertainties, including quantum computing risk, as reasons to favor increasing gold exposure versus BTC on a multi‑cycle view. Bitcoin developers and core infrastructure builders push back on the idea that quantum progress is an immediate threat. Blockstream CEO Adam Back has repeatedly argued that breaking Bitcoin's current signature schemes is likely 20–40 years away and that the network would have ample time to migrate to post‑quantum signature algorithms and better key management practices well before any real‑world break becomes feasible. Other analysts, including an a16z researcher, similarly conclude that the probability of a “cryptographically relevant” quantum computer capable of breaking today's public key systems emerging this decade is low. They say that the bigger near‑term risks come from implementation bugs, governance, and “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks on encrypted data rather than immediate attacks on live blockchain signatures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mamadou Toure, founder of Ubuntu Tribe, explains how the system works to Lennox Yieke. Yet extractive economic models rooted in colonial-era practices continue to funnel this wealth to a narrow elite and foreign investors, leaving the vast majority of Africans excluded from the riches beneath their feet. Mamadou Toure, founder and chief executive of the Ubuntu Tribe company, is determined to fix this through blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We have issued what we call $GIFT, which stands for gold international fungible token and is equivalent to one milligram of gold,” he tells African Business. Toure explains that each $GIFT is backed one-to-one by physical gold. “You can still have the gold [in vaults] in Zurich, Stuttgart, Copenhagen or Dubai – like we do – but issue a digital certificate of ownership on blockchain so that people who are in Africa can own a piece of that gold,” he says. Ubuntu Tribe has partnered with local fintechs and mobile money operators to ensure that users of its wallet in Africa can move between local currencies, mobile money and crypto. He reports serving over 30,000 customers, with more than 10,000 downloads of its digital wallet to date. “We took two years to build a robust, globally competitive, compliant system,” he says, noting that the company is fully regulated in Europe and is in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Kenya and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Toure says: “in 2026 we are adding between $1bn and $1.2bn worth of gold into the system to match growing demand.” Much of this demand, he argues, stems from gold's ability to act as a hedge against inflation when many African currencies – including the Nigerian naira, Ghanaian cedi and Egyptian pound – have depreciated significantly. And “since 2000, gold has gained more than 1,300% against the dollar. Gold helps correct this unfairness – where you can work as hard as possible, but if you're in Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Douala or Johannesburg, the fruits of your labour vanish because the currency you saved in has significantly depreciated,” Toure says. Gold prices soared more than 70% in 2025, the metal's strongest annual performance since 1979. In late December it (briefly) traded above $4,500 an ounce – up from $2,685 at the close of 2024. Analysts remain broadly bullish on gold's outlook, with JP Morgan Global Research projecting prices around $5,400 an ounce by the end of 2027. Yet gold, like any asset, is bound by a fundamental rule of financial markets: past performance is not indicative of future results. There is no guarantee that gold prices will continue to rise. But do holders of $GIFT tokens really understand these risks – and, more importantly, do they have the skills to construct portfolios that can effectively weather inevitable market corrections? Toure says the company has embedded several tools into its wallet to help address this. The platform offers exposure to other digital assets, including Bitcoin and a range of cryptocurrencies, enabling users to diversify their holdings and reduce concentration risks. “We have put a strong emphasis on the Ubuntu Academy, which helps non-crypto natives and those without financial literacy to effectively onboard and grow,” Toure explains. He points to the company's investment in an AI-powered tool designed to provide bite-sized, conversational guidance on gold, savings, risk and tokenisation – delivered in plain language, tailored to the user's context and available around the clock. Toure is confident that $GIFT's adoption will extend beyond retail users to small businesses, corporates and institutions. Institutional investors, he says, “are very interested, especially because our gold is regulated, so they're not taking any regulatory risk by buying our token. The company in December announced a partnership with Global Settlement Network (GSN), a fintech firm developing blockchain infrastructure, to slash Africa–EU transfer times from weeks to seconds and bring more than $5bn worth of gold on-chain. Before becoming a full-time entrepreneur, Toure spent two decades in senior finance roles, including stints at KPMG, BNP Paribas Investment Banking and the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private lending arm. He later joined General Electric as managing director for investments and project finance in sub-Saharan Africa. “I believed the financial system had reached its limits and someone had to act if Africa was truly to be given a chance. What I saw in blockchain was the possibility of something different.” Toure believes that tokenising other natural resources could help Africa move beyond GDP as the central measure of economic might. He adds that GDP is also a flawed measure because it measures production in fiat currencies: “if the paper [fiat currency] that you have loses value against other papers, while you don't even control it, what does your GDP really mean?” He admits that trying to rewrite Africa's financial and economic rulebook has inevitably stirred silent resistance from those who benefit from the status quo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is growing market chatter around a strong altcoin season in Q1 2026, as the Russell 2000 index hits record highs this month in January. On-chain data suggests traders are increasingly willing to take on more risk while positioning for a potential altcoin recovery. On-chain indicators confirm strength in the altcoin space, with most assets showing a long-to-short ratio above 1. Privacy coins, led by Monero (XMR), have also been drawing increased attention recently. The chart below shows that higher-ranked altcoins, with smaller market capitalizations, are posting even stronger ratios. The trend points to increasing risk appetite among traders, signaling rising confidence in a broader altcoin recovery. From an investor psychology perspective, many altcoins have corrected by 80%-90%. As a result, investors who are already facing significant losses have little incentive to sell and are instead choosing to hold their positions. If the historical pattern repeats, Patel expects a move of 702% in 2026. The Russell 2000 index, reflecting small-cap stocks, is showing major strength after hitting a fresh all-time high in January. This highlights renewed strength in U.S. small-cap stocks, setting up a strong backdrop for risk assets. Veteran trader Peter Brandt noted that the index has broken out from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, prompting him to take a long position.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few things haunt crypto investors more than the "what if" of missed ICOs. Early buyers turned tiny investments into life-changing wealth as it became digital gold. Tron in 2017 rode the blockchain hype wave, delivering big returns to those who joined its ICO before it powered decentralized entertainment empires. These weren't obvious wins at the time; they started with quiet traction, strong narratives, and community momentum that exploded later, leaving most watching from the sidelines. Patterns repeat, and right now APEMARS ($APRZ) is teasing that same early-stage magic in a fun, meme-driven package, with emerging as the name among the best crypto projects. This story of Commander Ape's accidental Mars mission surviving 225 million km on bananas and grit has its presale live in Stage 3 (BANANA BOOST) at just $0.00002448 per token, with a planned listing at $0.0055. That creates a potential 22,367% ROI from current pricing (based on price math, not guaranteed). Buy in during presale, stake your tokens, and unlock 63% APY rewards two months after listing, turning your position into a yield machine while the story unfolds. Add referral bonuses (9.34% extra tokens per qualified invite over $22), and it's free crypto layered on top. With stages selling fast (earlier ones gone in hours/days, current momentum at 300+ holders and $75k+ raised), this feels like one of those rare redemption shots savvy investors chase. Bitcoin launched in 2009, not as a traditional ICO, but through a free distribution via mining and early giveaways often called the original "missed ICO" opportunity. Early adopters who grabbed BTC for pennies (or even nothing) saw astronomical returns as it evolved from a niche experiment into the king of crypto. A $100 investment back then would now be worth millions, with Bitcoin's market cap hitting around $1.93 trillion as of January 2025. The drama lies in how many dismissed it as worthless code, yet those who believed early turned tiny bets into life-changing wealth. It's a stark reminder: the best crypto projects often start quietly, build unstoppable momentum, and reward patient believers massively. Tron (TRX) raised about $70 million in its 2017 ICO, with tokens sold at around $0.0019 each, making it a classic "missed ICO" story for those who jumped in during the frenzy. Early investors who held through the ups and downs watched TRX climb dramatically, hitting an all-time high of $0.44 in late 2024. Tron's story shows how the best crypto projects can ride hype waves to real adoption, turning modest early entries into significant gains for those who didn't miss the boat. Projects that start small, build real community interest, and offer clear early advantages often turn into the ones people talk about years later. Bitcoin and Tron did exactly that for those who got in before the crowds arrived. As one of the best crypto projects gaining traction right now, it's drawing eyes from investors who learned from past misses and aren't keen on repeating them. The presale is active in Stage 3 right now, priced at $0.00002448 per token. With the planned listing at $0.0055, the price difference suggests a potential return of around 22,367% from this point (based on simple math, markets can change, of course). Recent numbers from the official site show $85,654 raised overall, Stage 3 already 87% sold, and a countdown sitting at about two days and a few hours left (or until the tokens run out). Over 380 people have joined in recent updates, and earlier stages moved even faster. This kind of speed tells me demand is building quickly, and waiting could mean paying more soon. Market trends tracked by the best crypto to buy now indicate growing demand for presale-driven projects. Usually a mix of an engaging idea, fair structure, and people jumping in because they see the value before everyone else does. APEMARS fits that pattern with its light-hearted tale of Commander Ape accidentally blasting off to Mars on sheer determination and bananas. Right now, Stage 3 is live, and at 87% sold with the timer ticking down, this feels like one of those moments where acting early could make a big difference later. Stage 3 is 87% sold with Rs 2 days left (or until tokens run out). The next stage means a higher price and fewer tokens per dollar. Getting started is easy, but with the stage nearing its end, timing matters. Tokens arrive in your wallet right away, with no complicated steps. Once you have them, set up staking through the project's tools to lock in that 63% APY (rewards begin two months post-listing for stability). Then grab your referral link from the dashboard, share it, and when friends join with $22 or more, you both earn 9.34% extra tokens. It's built to grow the community naturally while putting more in your pocket. The total supply is fixed at 70 billion tokens, with half going through this presale across 23 stages and burns planned at later checkpoints to reduce what's available over time. The contract is on Ethereum and has been checked for security. In January 2026, APEMARS ($APRZ) feels like one of those moments. It has a fun story about an ape reaching Mars, plus real features like 63% APY staking (starting two months after listing), referral bonuses for extra free tokens, and a presale that's moving fast. Stage 3 is at $0.00002448, already 87% sold, with just about two days left. The timer is ticking, and these windows don't stay open long. Investing early in Bitcoin, one of the best crypto projects, could have turned small amounts into millions. For example, $100 in 2009 might be worth over $100 million today due to its scarcity and adoption. Many regret missing it, but lessons highlight spotting innovative projects like APEMARS now to avoid future regrets. While early ICO buyers saw huge gains, current prices at $0.30 offer entry for long-term holders betting on growth in dApps and content. Many ICOs fail due to scams, poor planning, or market shifts, with studies showing over 90 percent not succeeding. Among the best crypto projects that thrive, success comes from strong teams and real utility. Failed ones often lack transparency or deliver on promises, leading investors to seek vetted presales like APEMARS. Look for strong narratives, audited tech, and community buzz in the best crypto projects. APEMARS is a meme coin inspired by an ape's Mars journey, positioning itself among the best crypto projects with deflationary burns and 63 percent APY staking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee's Bitmine and MrBeast collaboration has converged Ethereum with YouTube's biggest star — traders are divided on its impact. A $200 million investment by Tom Lee's Bitmine into YouTube star MrBeast's media company has sparked market speculation that Ethereum (ETH) could gain renewed momentum if the partnership helps draw younger audiences into crypto.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Bitmine said  on Thursday it would take a $200 million equity stake in Beast Industries, the entertainment and consumer-products company founded by YouTube star Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson. The investment marks one of Bitmine's largest non-core equity positions to date, as the firm continues to anchor its balance sheet around Ethereum. Lee described Donaldson as “the leading content creator of our generation,” adding that Beast Industries' reach across younger demographics made it a natural partner. Meanwhile, famed commentator Ted Pillows, questioned how much capital Lee and Bitmine has. “ETH treasury company Bitmine invests $200,000,000 in MrBeast's ‘Beast Industries,” he wrote on X. Lee told Ark Invest chief executive  Cathie Wood in November that Bitmine plans to launch a company-run Ethereum staking operation “very soon.” Addressing concerns about network concentration, Lee said ownership levels even approaching 10% would not undermine Ethereum's decentralization. Separately, Lee has repeatedly reiterated his bullish stance on Ethereum's price outlook. Lee recently told investors that while Ethereum could briefly dip toward $2,500, the upside remains substantial. “We think that ETH can be $7,000 to $9,000 by the end of January,” Lee said. In a recent note to shareholders, Lee said that if Bitcoin reaches $250,000, Ethereum could trade between $12,000 and $22,000 based on historical price ratios. Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, Olanrewaju said Ethereum is approaching resistance near $3,175. “If buyers push through, the next targets lie between $3,508 and $3,782,” he said. On the downside, a break below immediate support around $3,050 could see Ethereum test levels near $2,621. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows Bitmine continues to scale its Ethereum exposure, having staked an additional 154,208 ETH, worth about $479 million.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this market, charts move like heart monitors, and every Instagram guru seems to have the next 100x gem until its price goes down by next week. However, amidst this chaos, AI has emerged as a transformative force in the industry, reshaping how people approach crypto trading through automated strategies, predictive models, and enhanced risk management. It's essentially becoming the backbone of a more lucrative future for cryptocurrency traders and helping them make better decisions. For example, while making an ada price prediction is not an easy feat, machine learning models help traders receive predictive insights and act before major price movements occur, which is quite a big deal. In the very first years after cryptocurrency's inception, trading relied mainly on manual analysis, which was cumbersome. Human traders would spend hours glued to their computer screens, monitoring price charts, news cycles, and social media platforms to inform their decision-making. AI and ML models entered the scene as trailblazer solutions meant to change everything, as they can process vast amounts of data in real time. These state-of-the art technologies track price movements, macroeconomic indicators, and social sentiment, with the purpose of identifying trends and optimizing trading strategies. If you can forecast price changes, you have an edge, and this matters especially when navigating such a volatile market like crypto. A study evaluating AI-driven strategies for Bitcoin trading between 2018 and 2024 concluded that an AI-led model achieved an overall return of 1640%, an outperformance of traditional buy-and-hold approach that illustrates the predictive power of AI. But AI and ML are on a mission to change the world by delivering accurate predictions no matter how complex the datasets are. The crypto market runs all day long without any pause, but for human traders, it's impossible to work 24/7. AI-powered trading bots can execute trades round-the-clock without compromising efficiency at all, and capture opportunities which a human eye could easily miss. In 2024 alone, the market cap of AI crypto agents increased 29% to more than $31 billion in only a few weeks, which reflected quick adoption and investor confidence. What does this mean for you as a trader? Psychologically speaking, it's just hard to navigate the turbulent seas of crypto trading without emotions getting in the way of success. Whether it's the exhilaration of striking it rich or the distress of unexpected market downturns, emotions can sway decision-making processes very quickly. But AI is a compass guiding traders through this ocean of uncertainty. Lack of regulation, unexpected price drops, psychological pitfalls like panic selling and FOMO, can all turn crypto trading into an unnerving experience. But the integration of AI into trading is radically improving risk management techniques. With this technology, it becomes easy to analyze patterns from historical data and spot early signs of market instability. This means you can know if the market is about to drop or surge and adjust your positions in real time. AI also follows stringent risk management protocols, which means each trade will align with a predetermined risk profile, regardless of the emotional factors or the noise. The role of AI in crypto is only beginning. As it evolves, there's a strong likelihood to see it merging with fascinating technologies, like voice interfaces for more intuitive control, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and multi-modal tools which can pull insights from more than numbers and charts only. Bots will not simply follow scripts, but adapt on the fly, learn from new data, and possibly respond to humans in real-time. AI will also contribute to the growth of decentralized finance. As DeFi protocols expand, the technology can automate complex financial services and increase their accessibility for a global audience. There's no doubt that AI is already doing an excellent job in transforming crypto and will continue to do so. In reality, this mindset will only sabotage your trades, because the truth is that AI isn't meant to replace your trading strategy but to enhance it. The real power is in combining both human skills with algorithms, because while AI analyzes faster, humans interpret smarter, and bring experience and context to the game. The next generation of successful traders won't be those who trade the hardest, but who leverage AI to achieve a trading system that's balanced, efficient, and emotionally stable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko signed Decree No 19 on January 16, 2026, creating a regulatory framework for crypto banks in the country. The decree permits High-Tech Park residents to combine token-based services with traditional banking operations. This development positions Belarus among nations actively integrating digital assets into mainstream financial systems. This two-tier approval process ensures oversight from both technology sector authorities and traditional financial regulators. Additionally, these entities must adhere to decisions issued by the Hi-Tech Park Supervisory Board. According to BelTA, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree in January 2026 establishing a “crypto bank” framework, allowing eligible High-Tech Park firms to offer token services alongside traditional banking under dual supervision by park authorities and the… The combined oversight mechanism creates a supervisory framework that addresses both technological innovation and financial stability concerns. This structural requirement suggests authorities are prioritizing institutional participants over individual operators or smaller entities. The dual regulatory model enables crypto banks to develop financial products combining traditional banking benefits with digital token technology. Customers will access services that merge established banking security with the speed and efficiency of blockchain-based transactions. Crypto banks must maintain compliance with existing financial institution standards while implementing token-based solutions. The decree does not eliminate conventional banking regulations but rather extends them to cover digital asset operations. Financial institutions will navigate requirements from multiple supervisory bodies throughout their operations. The framework positions Belarus as a jurisdiction encouraging financial technology development within structured oversight. Unlike some jurisdictions that separate crypto activities from traditional banking, Belarus permits integration under specific conditions. This approach reflects growing international recognition that digital assets require specialized but connected regulatory treatment rather than complete isolation from established financial systems.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading real estate developer MegPrime Holding, LLC, said Thursday it will launch a “universal payments” cryptocurrency after receiving approval from the SEC. The token aims to convert routine spending into tangible value and “long-term financial progress.” Users making rent or mortgage payments through MP Token on the MegPrime app could reap up to 20% back in the same token, MegPrime said in a press release. Furthermore, renters who use MP Token for payments could be eligible to receive 100% of their previous year's rent, capped at $25,000, towards a future home purchase. Qualified users may also avail of mortgage rates up to 2.0% below the market rate. The token will be available for purchase during its upcoming Token Generation Event and subsequently on the MegPrime app. It is also anticipated to be listed on other third-party cryptocurrency exchanges. “The integration of blockchain technology into the residential homebuilding space is an economic leap forward and represents what we believe to be the single greatest use case for blockchain technology of our time,” said Aaron Ipour, co-founder of Megatel Homes and MegPrime. MegPrime described the token as a “utility-based digital currency,” rather than an investment or bank deposit. The 30-year fixed mortgage rates, which were near 2.65% in early 2021, spiked to the mid-6% region last year, impacting household affordability. The firm projected rents to rise between 2% and 3% nationwide in 2026.
