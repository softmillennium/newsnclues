                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's how a report on alien abductions in the United States begins: “Most alien abduction stories begin quietly — a strange light, a missing moment, something that feels off.” Sounds like something from the “Twilight Zone” or worse. It's the Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026 and it looks at where abductions are reported and shows the pattern. But the takeaway is simple: these reports don't appear everywhere — they appear somewhere,” the report says. As many know, South Carolina was the site of the UFO Welcome Center in Bowman for years, a saucer-shaped wooden structure built over a period of years by Jody Pendarvis. The ramshackle 48-foot-wide, 16-foot-tall structure was written up by any number of publications and heralded as a roadside attraction. It was never reported whether any UFOs actually checked it out over the decades it existed, but Pendarvis was quoted as saying “Maybe another UFO came by and set the fire” when the place burned down in 2024 after a 30-year run. The study said South Carolina has a 1.03% chance with odds of 1 in 97. “New Hampshire ranks #1 in the U.S. because people there report UFO sightings more often than anywhere else — about 24 sightings per 100,000 residents,” the report said. “In several top states, a large share of sightings involve close encounters. In Idaho, Vermont, Oregon, and Wyoming, roughly 1 in 5 reports includes claims like missing time or direct contact,” the report said. Wyoming residents are more often reported abduction-style experiences. They said instead it was a weather balloon, but the UFO rumor never died, prompting books, movies and TV shows. Maybe that's why the aliens never came back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For 15 seasons, Supernatural balanced dark fantasy, a Dom Toretto level of “family” quotes, and a surprising amount of humor. But at its core, the CW series was built on horror. While not every monster-of-the-week episode was focused on genuine terror, there are some installments that still haunt viewers long after the credits rolled. Even star Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) has admitted there's one episode that got under his skin more than the rest. So, with that in mind, here are the five episodes we think prove Supernatural could be just as scary as anything on late-night cable. I mean, if Dean Winchester can get spooked, what chance do we have? And considering clowns have long been a staple of the horror genre, it's unlikely many others like them, either. From the very real, very terrifying John Wayne Gacey to Stephen King's It, the sinister creep-factor of clowns makes this episode a given on this list. For many fans, this one hit close to home. Anyone who grew up uneasy around clowns found new reasons to keep their distance after watching. What makes it more interesting is that this episode came 9 years before the bizarre and very real nightmare-fuel phenomena of the 2016 clown sightings. From standing in the middle of abandoned roads, blocking rivers, to creeping up to people's ring doorbells and staring into the cameras. So, if anything, Supernatural was way ahead of the trend, and with hindsight, “Everybody Loves a Clown” certainly deserves to be on this list. Season 2's “No Exit” is a chilling reminder that some of the darkest monsters come from real history. His spirit captures and torments women living in an apartment building. So, Sam and Dean team up with Jo Harvelle (played by Alona Tal) to put an end to the hauntings. The true-crime angle adds an extra layer of dread. Holmes' crimes were very real, and extremely heinous. His “Murder Castle” which Sam briefly mentions in the episode, is disturbing not only because of what he did there, but also that a living, breathing human being had the capacity to think of it and act on those thoughts. Seeing his presence bleed into Supernatural's world gives the episode disturbing authenticity. But it's the fact that Sam and Dean can't actually kill Holmes' ghost. Sure, they manage to incapacitate him and pour a city-sized amount of concrete on top of him, but he's still there. And while Holmes was a spirit in Supernatural, he was no less horrific than his living, breathing version, showing that sometimes the scariest monsters are the human ones. In the episode, Sam is kidnapped by a backwoods family who hunt people for sport — literally nothing supernatural here! Ackles has explained in numerous interviews that what made this episode stand out was its realism. But, like “No Exit”, “The Benders” is based on very real people. In Kansas between 1871 and 1872, a family known as “The Bloody Benders” were accused of killing up to 20 travelers after letting them stay in their cabin. Even after facing down countless demons and angels across 15 seasons, Ackles still points to “The Benders” as the one that made him shiver. That endorsement alone makes it a must-watch for anyone curious about Supernatural's scarier side. The Winchester brothers investigate mysterious deaths tied to mirrors, leading to eerie sequences where Bloody Mary herself crawls out of reflective surfaces. Even today, fans point to this episode as the one that made them afraid to look in a mirror at night. It punishes those hiding guilty secrets, forcing characters — and by proxy, the viewer — to confront uncomfortable truths. Though not officially cited as the scariest episode for Jared Padalecki (aka Sam Winchester), this is one he has definitely acknowledged as causing the creeps.Children in horror often walk the line between innocent and sinister, and Supernatural takes full advantage of that uncanny energy in “The Kids Are Alright.” Dean reconnects with old flame, Lisa, only to discover that the children in her neighborhood are acting in an odd Invasion of the Body Snatchers kind of way. Eventually, he realizes the kids are most certainly not alright, and they've been replaced by changelings — creatures who feed on their human mothers while posing as their children. It's one of the show's creepiest creature designs, with changelings revealed as pale, leech-faced monsters when you see their reflections in mirrors. The juxtaposition of childhood innocence with suddenly aggressive neediness and predatory malice creates some of the series' most unsettling visuals. The episode hits hard because it takes something as familiar, comfortable, and wholesome as suburban family life, and corrupts it with horror. Which Supernatural episodes do you think are scariest?
