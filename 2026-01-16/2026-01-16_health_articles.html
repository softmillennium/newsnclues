                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study – selected as our Editors' Choice for January, 2026 – was led by first authors Eugenia Casella and Jana Depovere, with corresponding author Adelheid Soubry from the University of Leuven. The research shows that a man's age is linked to specific changes in sperm DNA that may influence early development in children. Autism spectrum disorder is a growing public health concern affecting millions of families worldwide. DNA methylation plays a key role during early development and can be sensitive to age-related biological changes. Researchers analyzed sperm samples from 63 healthy, non-smoking men between the ages of 18 and 35. The analysis identified more than 14,000 DNA sites where methylation levels changed with age, with most showing a gradual decrease as men got older. "To identify sperm-specific marks, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study in sperm from 63 men, using the Illumina 450K array." While individual changes were small, their location within the genome was important. Many age-related changes occurred near imprint control regions, which help ensure that certain genes are active only from one parent. Researchers found that several genes affected by age-related DNA changes have previously been linked to autism. These genes are involved in brain development, nerve communication, and early growth. Changes in their regulation may increase vulnerability to neurodevelopmental differences. Overall, the findings provide new biological insight into earlier evidence linking paternal age to child health. However, the authors note that autism is a complex condition shaped by many genetic and non-genetic factors, and no single cause has been identified. The study results suggest that age-related changes in sperm DNA may be one contributing factor. By clarifying how paternal age influences sperm biology, this research supports future studies in reproductive health as family planning increasingly shifts toward later parenthood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subtle abnormalities in kidney function – even within the range considered normal – may help identify people at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. The researchers have therefore developed a web-based tool that could aid in early detection and thus primary prevention. In the absence of effective screening programmes, patients are often diagnosed late, when more than half of their kidney function has already been lost. To address this gap, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have constructed population-based distributions for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) - the most widely used measure of kidney function. The aim is to help doctors identify people at risk, thus enabling early preventive action. We were inspired by the growth and weight charts used in paediatrics, which intuitively help clinicians identify children at risk of obesity or undergrowth." The researchers have made their eGFR distribution charts openly available to healthcare professionals and developed a web-based calculator, developed by PhD student Antoine Creon, that can help assess how a patient's eGFR compares with population norms for their age. The findings show that departures from the median eGFR for one's age and sex are associated with worse outcomes. Individuals with an eGFR below the 25th percentile had a markedly higher risk of developing kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. Mortality also displayed a U-shaped relationship; both low and high percentile extremes were linked to increased risk of death. Among those with a seemingly normal eGFR above 60 ml/min/1.73 m², but below the 25th percentile, only one fourth had received additional testing for urinary albumin, which is important for detecting early kidney damage. "For example, consider a 55-year-old woman with an eGFR of 80. Most clinicians would not react to such a seemingly normal value. This signals an opportunity to act earlier," says Juan Jesús Carrero, professor at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet. Yang, Y., et al.

"We identified women and people with high perceived loneliness as groups particularly vulnerable to anxiety, with a worsening of their psychic state as the crisis persisted," the authors wrote. "Our current findings suggest that certain groups may benefit now from targeted psychological support in primary care or in addiction centres. Implementing a simple non-intrusive question about perceived loneliness in clinical practice could help to screen those at the greatest risk for high anxiety," they added. It was published online on January 06, 2026, in BMJ Open. A high attrition rate was present, with only 39% of participants completing at least one follow-up questionnaire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Regulatory affairs have long been regarded as a necessary hurdle in drug development, with drug developers routinely required to ensure compliance by preparing dossiers and managing submissions via complicated national and international frameworks. That perception is outdated, however, as regulatory strategy now represents a source of competitive advantage rather than mere compliance. Regulatory expertise can de‑risk programs, accelerate timelines, and even improve a compound's commercial value when it is integrated into drug development planning at an early stage. Regulatory experts at hVIVO have seen this transformation firsthand, with their extensive experience across human challenge studies, early‑phase clinical trials, and complex therapeutic areas highlighting that regulatory affairs are no longer solely confined to the back room. Rather, regulatory affairs are key to influencing policy, shaping development pathways, and ensuring that innovative and vital treatments reach patients as quickly as possible. Compliance remains the foundation of any work related to regulatory affairs, because no program can progress without robust documentation, including CTAs, INDs, eCTDs, and GxP validation. Acceleration is assured by embedding a well‑designed regulatory strategy from the outset. For example, beginning with a Target Product Profile (TPP) and a specifically tailored regulatory roadmap allows sponsors to align on population, indication, and endpoints prior to committing any major resources. Rather, this strategy must be a living plan that is adaptable to both commercial realities and scientific progress. The early involvement of regulatory experts ensures that sponsors are clear on what is acceptable to regulatory agencies, what is realistically feasible, and how best to position their specific product for success. Regulatory designations such as EMA PRIME, FDA Fast Track, and orphan status are more than just badges of honor. The team of regulatory consultants at hVIVO has guided sponsors through these regulatory pathways, helping them secure designations that transform a program's trajectory. A universal flu vaccine application for the EMA PRIME scheme provides a useful example of how a combination of these expedited pathways and an appropriate regulatory strategy can directly impact both commercial outcomes and scientific progress. Regulatory success depends on more than just technical expertise, however. Relationships with sponsors, agencies, and policymakers are also key to a program's success, and hVIVO's experienced consultants have extensive experience preparing briefing packages, rehearsing meetings, and managing interactions with regulators to improve the likelihood of a positive outcome. Human challenge studies highlight the importance of this point because acceptance of these models varies, as they are not currently fully codified in regulatory guidance. hVIVO's teams have helped challenge models to become more widely accepted by directly engaging regulators, clearly explaining the science, and lobbying for greater and wider inclusion in guidance. This approach is a notable example of regulatory strategy in action: influencing policy and creating pathways for innovation that would otherwise be blocked by building trust and rapport with regulators. Challenge models may be considered less rigorous than field trials, but they offer vital proof‑of‑concept data that is key to de‑risking subsequent development and accelerating antiviral and vaccine programs. This will require a robust combination of scientific excellence and regulatory advocacy, but it remains a clear example of how strategy elevates compliance into competitive advantage. Its integrated approach is another of hVIVO's key strengths. The company's regulatory services operate seamlessly across non‑clinical, clinical, and CMC. Senior experts undertake the work, supported by a network of specialists across the group, ensuring delivery is never delegated to less experienced or junior team members. Sponsors benefit from end‑to‑end support thanks to this breadth and depth, ranging from marketing authorization dossiers to consultancy and operational support for IND‑enabling toxicology packages. Integration also ensures quality and consistency across the development lifecycle. This rare holistic approach affords sponsors a genuine competitive advantage. Regulatory strategy continues to evolve, with this evolving landscape being reshaped by early adaptive designs, real‑world evidence, and master protocols such as umbrella and platform protocols. Agencies are increasingly open to innovative approaches, but only when sponsors present them clearly and convincingly. The role of regulatory affairs has also evolved and is now as much about negotiation and communication as it is about comprehensive documentation. The right combination of technical expertise and relational skill is key to regulatory professionals' ability to shape policy, influence guidance, and accelerate innovation. Regulatory affairs are no longer the hurdle that they were historically considered to be; rather, they can become a lever for credibility, speed, and commercial success with the right strategy. Compliance is imperative, but competitive advantage stems from acceleration. Strong relationships, expedited pathways, and integrated expertise all help to ensure a regulatory strategy that drives innovation rather than simply satisfying requirements. hVIVO is a full-service early phase CRO offering end-to-end drug development services from preclinical consultancy through to Phase III clinical trials, including world-leading end-to-end human challenge trials services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A national panel of experts has issued the strongest call yet for the Department of Health and Social Care to overhaul how it approaches dementia prevention, pointing to vital evidence that dementia risk can be reduced and providing a framework for the development of new government policy that could improve brain health for millions. The Nottingham Consensus, published in Nature Reviews Neurology, was led by researchers at the NIHR Policy Research Unit in Dementia and Neurodegeneration at Queen Mary University of London (DeNPRU-QM). It sets out 56 recommendations aimed at turning decades of research into tangible policy. This means creating policies that account for how individual choices interact with social, economic and environmental conditions to influence brain health across a lifetime. We know dementia risk can be reduced, but the evidence has not yet been transformed into a coherent governmental strategy. People need clear, evidence-based guidance on protecting their brain health, but the information they receive can be confusing or make them feel blamed. What we need now is coordinated, structural action to develop dementia prevention policies that are equitable, realistic and grounded in the lives people actually lead." Dr. Harriet Demnitz-King, Lead Author, Postdoc Research Fellow, Queen Mary University of London Senior author Charles Marshall, Professor of Clinical Neurology at Queen Mary University of London, said: "Dementia is now the leading cause of death in the UK, so we desperately need a clear public health plan to improve this situation. We hope that this consensus will lead to better public messaging about dementia, improved recognition and management of other conditions that increase dementia risk, a strategy on structural approaches to improving brain health, and research that addresses gaps in our knowledge about how best to do all this. The panel, made up of a diverse group of 40 experts, identified three high-priority areas for individual action where evidence is particularly strong: hearing loss, social isolation and high blood pressure. But they also warned that without structural support – such as affordable hearing services, accessible social infrastructure and effective blood pressure management – these interventions will fail to reach the people who need them most. The Nottingham Consensus provides clear, actionable recommendations to support a policy shift towards dementia prevention in line with the 10 Year Health Plan for England. It calls for a joined-up approach that builds dementia prevention into wider government action on issues such as smoking, alcohol, pollution and social inequality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review reveals how complications after overseas cosmetic and weight-loss surgery are landing back in UK hospitals, exposing serious risks for patients and unresolved pressures for the NHS. Study: Complications and costs to the UK National Health Service due to outward medical tourism for elective surgery: a rapid review. In a recent study published in BMJ Open, researchers examined reported cases of complications linked to outward medical tourism from the UK, residents traveling abroad for elective surgery, and the implications for NHS care on patients' return. They found that outward medical tourism, mainly involving bariatric, metabolic, and cosmetic surgery, with only a small number of ophthalmic cases, can lead to serious postoperative complications requiring the use of NHS services. Outward medical tourism refers to people travelling abroad to obtain elective medical procedures that are not urgently required. This practice has grown steadily over recent decades, as suggested by earlier estimates and policy analyses. While such travel may benefit individual patients by reducing costs or shortening waiting times, it raises concerns for health systems in patients' home countries. For the UK NHS, outward medical tourism poses challenges because patients may return with complications requiring follow-up care, hospital admission, or further surgery. These complications can be difficult to manage when details of the original procedure are incomplete or unavailable. Although estimates suggest a large and growing number of UK residents seek medical care abroad, the scale, costs, and consequences for the NHS remain unclear. Earlier research highlighted variable motivations for travel, limited patient awareness of risks, and reliance on NHS services to manage complications. Researchers conducted a rapid review design to synthesize UK-based evidence on the costs, complications, and benefits of outward medical tourism undertaken for elective procedures, seeking to provide insights for policy and practice. They followed recognized guidance for such reviews, adhered to established reporting standards, and prospectively registered the study. Comprehensive searches were conducted across multiple medical and scientific databases, covering studies published during 2012, 24. Additionally, citation tracking and searches of grey literature were undertaken, with relevant earlier studies identified from a previous review. Eligible studies were quantitative or descriptive UK-based reports examining complications, costs, or benefits to the NHS resulting from elective surgery undertaken abroad. Emergency, cancer, fertility, dental, and transplant-related tourism were also excluded. Outcomes included types of surgery, complications, NHS resource use, and treatment costs. The study quality and overall certainty of evidence were evaluated using standardized tools. The search identified 38 reports describing 37 studies published between 2007 and 2025. These studies reported on 655 patients treated by the NHS for complications following elective surgery abroad. No studies reported benefits or savings to the NHS. Most patients were women, around 90 percent, with an average age of 38 years. The most common destination country was Turkey, accounting for over 60 percent of reported cases. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most frequent bariatric procedure, while abdominoplasty and breast surgery dominated cosmetic procedures. At least 53 percent of patients experienced severe complications, often requiring surgery, prolonged hospitalisation, or intensive treatment. Although no deaths were reported, hospital stays were substantial, averaging 17 days for bariatric surgery complications and 6 days for cosmetic surgery complications. Reported NHS costs ranged from £1,058 to £19,549 per patient at 2024 prices. Longer hospital stays and surgical interventions were the main drivers of cost. However, the evidence base was weak, and cost estimates were likely to be underreported due to missing or incomplete data. The rapid review shows that outbound medical tourism for elective surgery can result in serious complications that place considerable demands on NHS specialist hospital services, particularly in secondary and tertiary care, as reported. A major strength of the review is its comprehensive and systematic search, including grey literature, and its capture of data from over 650 patients. However, the evidence base is limited by retrospective case reports and small case series, high risk of bias, incomplete reporting, and poor generalisability. Many studies only included emergency presentations, likely underestimating the true burden. Overall, there is little certainty about the evidence on costs, and key gaps remain, particularly regarding primary care impacts, long-term outcomes, and population-level estimates. The findings highlight the need for clear NHS policy on postoperative responsibility, better public information about risks, and improved data collection to support informed decision-making and future health service planning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recreational physical activity may be associated with breast tissue composition and biomarkers of stress in adolescent girls, according to a new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC). The findings shed new light on how physical activity during adolescence-a critical period of breast development-may influence biological pathways related to future breast cancer risk. In adult women, higher levels of recreational physical activity (RPA) are consistently linked to a lower risk of breast cancer, with studies showing roughly a 20 percent reduction in risk among the most active women compared with the least active. Until now, however, the biological mechanisms underlying this association-particularly earlier in life-have remained poorly understood. The new study provides some of the first evidence linking RPA to breast tissue composition and stress-related biomarkers in adolescent girls. Our findings suggest that recreational physical activity is associated with breast tissue composition and stress biomarker changes in adolescent girls, independent of body fat, which could have important implications for breast cancer risk." Girls who reported engaging in at least two hours of recreational physical activity in the prior week, compared with none, had lower percent water content in breast tissue-an indicator of lower breast density- and lower concentrations of urinary biomarkers linked to stress. These findings align with previous research in adult women showing that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower mammographic breast density, a key predictor of breat cancer risk.The researchers analyzed data from the population-based Columbia Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program Study, which draws from the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) Mothers and Newborns birth cohort. Participants were originally recruited to the cohort between 1998 and 2006 from prenatal clinics at NewYork-Presbyterian and Harlem Hospital, as well as affiliated satellite clinics, serving urban neighborhoods including Washington Heights, Central Harlem, and the South Bronx. More than half (51 percent) reported no recreational physical activity in the past week. "Our research has several strengths, including the use of multiple biomarkers measured in urine, blood, and breast tissue," said Mary Beth Terry, PhD, Columbia Mailman School professor of Epidemiology, and senior author of the study. "We measured biomarkers of stress and chronic inflammation that are widely validated and commonly used in epidemiologic research, enhancing confidence in our findings. Importantly, this research was conducted in a population-based, urban cohort of Black/African American and Hispanic girls-groups that are historically underrepresented in research and face persistent disparities in both physical activity levels and breast cancer outcomes." "Our study population of urban Hispanic (Dominican) and non-Hispanic Black/African American adolescent girls is critical to include in breast cancer research," added Kehm, who is also affiliated with HICCC. "These groups not only have been historically underrepresented in studies but they face higher risks of developing breast cancer at younger ages and of experiencing more aggressive subtypes. At the same time, Black and Hispanic girls consistently report lower levels of recreational physical activity than their non-Hispanic White peers." The authors note that additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine how these adolescent biomarkers may translate into breast cancer risk later in life, and say the findings underscore the potential importance of promoting physical activity early in development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The settlement, announced Jan. 14, resolves whistleblower lawsuits that accused the giant health insurer of mounting a years-long scheme in which it overstated how sick patients were to illegally boost revenues. "Medicare Advantage is a vital program that must serve patients' needs, not corporate profits," said U.S. Attorney Craig Missakian for the Northern District of California, in announcing the settlement. "Fraud on Medicare costs the public billions annually, so when a health plan knowingly submits false information to obtain higher payments, everyone — from beneficiaries to taxpayers — loses," he said. The insurance plans have grown dramatically in recent years and now enroll about 34 million members, more than half of the people eligible for Medicare. About 2 million Medicare members are enrolled in KP plans. Attorney Max Voldman, who represents whistleblower James Taylor, said the case shows the need for a "continued effort to fight fraud in health care." Taylor, a longtime Kaiser Permanente physician, filed his suit against the company in October 2014. The Justice Department took over his case, bundled with others, in July 2021. From 2009 through 2018, KP added roughly half a million diagnoses that generated about $1 billion in improper payments to the health plan, according to the complaint. The government pays Medicare Advantage plans higher rates to cover sicker patients. But over the past decade, dozens of whistleblower lawsuits, government audits, and other investigations have alleged that health plans exaggerate how sick patients are to pocket payments they don't deserve, a tactic known in the industry as "upcoding." In settling the case, KP did not admit any wrongdoing. The company noted that other health plans had "faced similar government scrutiny" over Medicare Advantage billing practices. It said the whistleblower cases "involved a dispute about how to interpret" Medicare's billing requirements. In all, six whistleblowers filed cases against Kaiser Permanente. Osinek, who trained physicians on medical coding guidelines, filed her case in August 2013. In her suit, she alleged that Kaiser Permanente inflated claims submitted to Medicare by having doctors amend medical files, often months after a patient's visit, to slap on diagnoses that were not treated at the time or didn't exist. Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his findings were based on a review of more than 50,000 pages of internal company documents. UnitedHealth Group disputed the findings and has long denied that its coding practice triggers improper payments. The report cited several medical conditions that have repeatedly been linked to overbilling by Medicare Advantage plans, such as coding for opioid dependence disorder in patients who are taking their medications as directed for pain. The Senate report also alleged that Medicare Advantage plans have improperly diagnosed dementia. The report said that Medicare removed dementia from its list of codes in 2014 partly due to concerns over upcoding. "Medicare Advantage is an important option for America's seniors, but as the program adds more patients and spends billions in taxpayer dollars, Congress has a responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight," Grassley said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sickle cell anemia is the world's most common genetic disorder. It causes the red blood pigment hemoglobin to crystallize, which results in rigid, malformed red blood cells with a sickle shape. The disease, which is hereditary, can be treated with hydroxyurea. When taken regularly, this drug can improve quality of life; however, it is not well tolerated by all patients. A bone marrow transplant is another possibility, but there is a lack of suitable donors and other treatments, such as gene therapies or therapeutic antibodies, come with extremely high costs. Now, an international team led by Max Gassmann, professor emeritus of veterinary physiology at the University of Zurich, is pursuing an alternative and significantly more cost-effective approach. Memantine has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease for about 20 years, meaning it is no longer patentable. In previous preclinical studies, researchers demonstrated that memantine has a stabilizing effect on red blood cells. They then investigated the drug's safety and tolerability in a phase II study. "In the best case, memantine would be available for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, as a well-tolerated, easy-to-store, and very cost-effective drug that is no longer patent-protected," says Max Gassmann. This would be particularly significant for countries with a high disease burden and limited resources, for example Africa or certain places in India. All patients involved in the study continued their existing hydroxyurea therapy, as discontinuing it would have been unethical. "The observed effects should therefore be interpreted as complementary to hydroxyurea," Gassmann explains. The research team is now planning a follow-up study that will, for the first time, include patients who have not received hydroxyurea treatment, in order to allow a systematic analysis of combination therapies. This approach aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of memantine in a comprehensive and evidence-based way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new randomized controlled trial has found promising evidence that the smoking cessation medication varenicline (Chantix/Champix) can help people with cannabis use disorder (CUD) to reduce cannabis use. CUD is a rising problem globally, partly due to recent legalization in several countries and US states, and until now no medications have been found to treat it. CUD is characterized by continued use of cannabis despite 'clinically significant impairment' such as ignoring important social, occupational, or recreational activities and persistent use despite physical or psychological problems associated with cannabis. Varenicline is an effective medication for quitting tobacco. This trial, conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina and published in Addiction, tested whether varenicline could help with CUD. Results showed it helped men reduce cannabis use, but not women. (Varenicline works equally well for both sexes as a stop-smoking aid.) The trial included 174 participants with CUD who used cannabis at least three days per week. Participants were randomized to varenicline (working up to a dose of 1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants also received a weekly brief medical management session to encourage their adherence to both the medication and the treatment plan. The male varenicline group also used cannabis an average of 3.8 days per week, compared with 4.7 days per week for the male placebo group. The female varenicline group used cannabis an average of 4.9 days per week, compared with 3.6 days for the female placebo group. The female varenicline group showed higher withdrawal and craving scores and higher anxiety than any of the other groups. Cannabis use disorder is rising quickly in the United States. Current pharmacological treatment options are very limited, and so our ability to help people reduce their cannabis use is also limited. Our study found that varenicline, a drug that helps people to reduce or stop smoking, may be effective at reducing cannabis use as well, but only for men. Our next step is to further explore varenicline for cannabis use disorder, using a larger sample size of women, to better understand this sex difference in the treatment outcome.
