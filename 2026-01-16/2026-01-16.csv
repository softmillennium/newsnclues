            Images of plants painted on pottery made up to 8,000 years ago may be the earliest example of humans' mathematical thought, a study has found.
    


            Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem examined pottery produced by the Halafian people of northern Mesopotamia, who lived between 6200 BC and 5500 BC.
    


            Many bowls featured flowers that have been depicted with four, eight, 16, 32 or 64 petals. The use of these numbers forms a “geometric sequence” that implies a form of mathematical reasoning rooted in symmetry and repetition, the researchers said in the study published last month in the Journal of World Prehistory.
    


            Study authors Yosef Garfinkel, a professor in archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Sarah Krulwich, a research assistant and MA student at the university's archaeology department, examined pottery fragments from 29 Halafian sites, excavated over a 100-year period from 1899.
    


            They found that in nearly every one of the 375 fragments that depict flowers, the number of petals is determined by this doubling sequence, which divides a circle into symmetrical units.
    


            “The strict adherence to these numbers, which are repeated in examples from different sites over hundreds of kilometers, cannot be accidental, and indicates that it was done intentionally,” Garfinkel told CNN.
    


            The Halafians may have developed this form of mathematical reasoning — based on the progressive doubling of numbers — in response to managing village communities that had existed in the Near East for some 4,000 years and had become economically complex, the researchers said.
    


            “The ability to divide space evenly, reflected in these floral motifs, likely had practical roots in daily life, such as sharing harvests or allocating communal fields,” Garfinkel said in a press statement.
    


            In the study, the authors note that it wasn't until the third millennium BC that texts supply undisputed data on various mathematical systems. The Sumerians, in what is now Iraq, used a numerical system based on the number 60 — of the kind still used in timekeeping — and it has been suggested that a pre-Sumerian system existed, which used the number 10 as the base.
    


            But the researchers said the Halafian use of the numbers four, eight, 16 and 32 does not fit either of these systems and “may reflect an earlier and simpler level of mathematical thinking that was in use in the Near East in the 6th and 5th millennia BC.”
    


            “These patterns show that mathematical thinking began long before writing,” Krulwich said in the statement. “People visualized divisions, sequences, and balance through their art.”
    


            The study contributes to the academic field of ethnomathematics, which identifies mathematical knowledge embedded in cultural expression by prehistoric or non-literate communities.
    


World's oldest string of yarn shows Neanderthals were smarter than we thought



            This is not the first time it has been suggested that artifacts other than written documents may indicate early mathematical thinking.
    


Some experts believe that evidence of string-making by Neanderthals more than 40,000 years ago indicates that our Stone Age ancestors had an understanding of mathematical concepts like pairs and sets, as well as other basic numeracy skills.
    


            Garfinkel said his team's discovery constitutes a foundational step in the maturation of human thought, and that understanding how to do basic division would have been necessary for the later emergence of more complex mathematics.
    


            “Like everything in human development, aspects of mathematics also developed in an evolutionary way from the simple to the more complex,” he said.
    


            He and Krulwich also said in the statement that the Halafian pottery is unique in being an early instance of humans applying an understanding of symmetry to art. None of the images depicts edible crops, implying their purpose was aesthetic rather than agricultural or ritualistic.
    


Trees in art, as well as life, often follow simple mathematical rules, study finds



            “These vessels represent the first moment in history when people chose to portray the botanical world as a subject worthy of artistic expression,” they said. “It reflects a cognitive shift tied to village life and a growing awareness of symmetry and aesthetics.”
    


            However, Jens Høyrup, Senior Associate Professor Emeritus at Roskilde University, Denmark, who specializes in Mesopotamian mathematics and was not involved in the study, is less convinced by the archaeologists' argument.
    


            He described the symmetry of the Halafians' floral depictions as “an isolated incident of mathematical technique” rather than evidence of broader mathematical reasoning.
    


            “If you have to divide a circle nicely, at first you make a diameter — then it's two. Then you divide the other way, so you have four,” he told CNN. “It doesn't amount to any search for a geometric ascending sequence, it's simply halving.”
    


            “They have a sense of symmetry, that's clear. But we cannot decide from there that they had a mathematical system,” he adds. “There's no higher mathematics; it's just the simplest way to make divisions.”

            Worrying about money and food may age the heart even faster than traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease, according to a new study published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. 



            Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and the findings raise new questions about how financial stress fits into cardiovascular health and what people can do to protect their hearts.
    


Making these lifestyle changes reduces chronic disease, even if you have a genetic risk



            I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen to help explain how financial stress can affect the heart and what steps people can take to improve their heart health and protect against that stress. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore's health commissioner.
    


CNN: What did this study find?



Dr. Leana Wen: The researchers analyzed data from over 280,000 adults who had completed detailed surveys about the social and economic factors in their lives and underwent clinical evaluations of their cardiovascular health. Instead of just looking at whether people developed heart disease, the team focused on a concept called “cardiovascular age,” which reflects how old a person's heart and blood vessels look biologically compared with what one would expect for their actual age.
    


            They found that people who reported higher levels of financial stress and food insecurity tended to have evidence of more advanced cardiovascular aging, even after accounting for traditional medical risk factors.
    


            In other words, two people of the same chronological age and with the same clinical risk profiles could have hearts that “aged” at different rates, depending on how much financial strain they were under. While the study does not prove that financial stress directly causes accelerated heart aging, it strongly suggests that the economic strain can affect not only mental well-being but also cardiovascular health.
    


CNN: What does it mean to say that stress can “age” the heart?



Wen: When researchers measure heart aging, this refers to structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular system that increase the risk of heart disease. These include stiffening of blood vessels, changes in heart muscle function and impaired ability of the cardiovascular system to respond to exertion.
    


Chronic stress can accelerate these processes. Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline affect blood pressure, heart rate, inflammation and metabolism. When these systems are activated repeatedly over long periods, they can contribute to wear and tear on the heart and blood vessels. Over time, that cumulative effect may resemble what we see with aging or long-standing medical conditions.
    


More than 99% of heart disease cases have a risk factor you can address before you get sick, study shows



CNN: How is financial stress different from other types of stress?



Wen: Financial stress has some unique features that make it particularly potent. Unlike an acute stressor such as a short-term work deadline or a brief illness, financial strain is often chronic and ongoing. It can involve persistent worries about bills, housing stability, medical expenses, debt or support of family members.
    


            Because money affects so many aspects of daily life, financial stress can be difficult to escape. It may disrupt sleep, limit access to healthy food or medical care, and reduce opportunities for exercise or rest. All these factors compound one another and can amplify cardiovascular risk over time.
    


Worried about money? Experts share how to prepare for hard times



CNN: How does financial stress compare with traditional risk factors like high blood pressure or diabetes?



Wen: To me, what's most striking about this study is that the magnitude of the association between financial stress and heart aging was similar to or even exceeded that of many clinical risk factors. These traditional risk factors, like high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking, are well-recognized contributors to heart disease, and clinicians routinely screen for and treat them.
    


            This research suggests that social determinants of health, including financial stress and food insecurity, may belong in the same conversation. That does not mean financial stress replaces traditional risk factors, but rather that it adds to them. Someone with high blood pressure who is also under severe financial strain may face compounded risk.
    


Aiming for a healthier year? A doctor shares the 5 science-backed habits that matter most



CNN: Does this mean heart disease is inevitable for people under financial stress?



Wen: No, and that is an important point. Financial stress increases risk, but it does not mean that people experiencing it are doomed to poor heart health. Risk is influenced by many factors, and there are still meaningful actions individuals and clinicians can take to reduce harm.
    


CNN: How should clinicians think about financial stress when assessing heart health?



Wen: Clinicians should consider financial stress as part of a patient's overall risk profile, much like family history or lifestyle factors. Asking patients about stress, financial strain and access to resources can provide important context for medical decision-making.
    


            This does not mean clinicians need to solve financial problems, but they can help connect patients to resources, adjust treatment plans to reduce financial burden, and be mindful of how stress may affect adherence to medications or lifestyle recommendations. Also, simply acknowledging financial stress as real and relevant to health can improve trust and care.
    


Long walks linked to improved heart health and longevity



CNN: What are other steps people should take to protect heart health?



Wen: The fundamentals of heart health remain regular physical activity, a balanced and heart-healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar.
    


            Routine checkups matter because many cardiovascular risk factors develop silently. Treating hypertension or diabetes early dramatically lowers the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and heart failure. And because chronic stress affects heart health as well, techniques such as mindfulness practices, adequate sleep and social connection can help buffer stress responses and contribute to better heart health.
    


What women can do to reduce their risk from heart disease



CNN: What is the broader takeaway from this research?



Wen: This study reinforces that health is shaped not only by the health care that people receive but also the social and economic conditions in their lives. Recognizing financial stress and food instability as part of cardiovascular risk can allow for more compassionate and effective care.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","CIA director traveled to Venezuela to meet with country's acting president","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/16/politics/cia-director-venezuela-acting-president","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:28:08 GMT","


            CIA Director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's acting president Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas on Thursday, according to a US official.
    


            “During the meeting in Caracas, Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers,” the official said.
    


            The meeting, which was first reported by the New York Times, comes as Trump has asserted control over Venezuela, particularly its oil production, saying the US will effectively “run” the country following its capture of Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.
    


            Trump has shown support for Rodríguez, a longtime regime insider, over opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with the president on Thursday and even gifted him her Nobel Peace Prize medal.
    


            Trump administration officials insisted to lawmakers in a briefing after Maduro's capture that the move was not a regime change operation since the Venezuelan government remains largely intact and is now led by Rodríguez, who was Maduro's deputy, sources familiar with the briefing previously told CNN.
    


            The administration's policy decision to back Rodríguez over Machado was informed by a classified CIA analysis on the impact of Maduro no longer being president and near-term implications of his potential removal, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            The tightly held intelligence product was commissioned by senior policymakers, and the CIA was expected to continue providing similar recommendations on the leadership situation in Venezuela going forward, multiple sources previously told CNN.
    


            The CIA was also involved in the plan to capture Maduro. In August, the agency had covertly installed a small team inside Venezuela to track Maduro's patterns, locations and movements, which helped bolster the operation earlier this month, sources familiar with the plans told CNN.
    


            The assets included a CIA source operating within the Venezuelan government who assisted the United States with tracking Maduro's location and movements ahead of his capture, one source briefed on the operation told CNN.
    


            Ratcliffe's meeting with Rodríguez this week was meant to build trust, according to the US official, and reflects the CIA director's emphasis on human intelligence gathering and wanting the agency to be less risk averse.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Teenagers busted in Ukrainian-run sabotage plots across Russia","https://www.rt.com/russia/631033-fsb-teenagers-sabotage-plot/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:17:00 GMT","

Four teenagers have been detained by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) after they were allegedly recruited by Ukrainian intelligence to carry out arson attacks on police vehicles and a shopping mall.

The security service said on Friday it had “suppressed the activities” of the individuals, aged 15 to 17, in Moscow and the Chuvash Republic. The FSB stated the minors were contacted via social media and dating chats by agents posing as girls to obtain their geolocation data.

After the teenagers sent the data, they were contacted by Ukrainian agents posing as Russian law enforcement officers who informed them that the coordinates they provided had been used by Kiev's armed forces to plan drone strikes, the FSB said. 

The callers then blackmailed the teens, offering them the opportunity to avoid criminal liability if they committed crimes under the guise of an “anti-terrorism security check.” 

In video testimony released by the FSB, one teenager described being directed to buy gasoline. “I thought ‘why?' but agreed. Then they jammed the internet when I got there. And thank God,” he said. 

Another teen shared a threat he received from a masked man with a Ukrainian flag: “Thanks for the coordinates, bitch. You're in for a fun night tonight.”

The Investigative Committee stated a 15-year-old from Cheboksary has been charged with a terrorist act for making incendiary bottles and burning two police cars last summer. In Moscow, a 16-year-old is accused of attempted property damage for setting fire to a canister of gasoline in a mall cinema in November. The charges carry sentences of up to 25 years.

The FSB and Investigative Committee urged the public to be vigilant and not share personal data. The agency has repeatedly reported foiling Ukrainian plots, often citing similar recruitment methods targeting teenagers and vulnerable citizens since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022.

In the latest episode of ‘Sanchez Effect', we take a deep dive into the real story behind the protests sweeping Iran with a guest who joins us from Tehran. Professor Marandi reveals that Israel is practically waving its national flag, admitting it orchestrated these protests, while Western media outlets conveniently look the other way. Rick points out that even Mike Pompeo acknowledged that Mossad agents were alongside demonstrators in Tehran – a delightful setup for a color revolution! But they've had no luck so far. Professor Marandi says it's because when the violence escalated, the Iranian government shut down the internet immediately and protests fizzled out very quickly. That can only mean one thing – they were being coordinated from abroad. And without internet? Oops...didn't see that coming.

Rick can't help but wonder why Israel, usually tight-lipped about its operations, would admit to being involved in this one. Marandi argues that the language of politics is shifting – just look at Trump and his tactics with Venezuela and now Greenland. Speaking of which, the US president isn't backing down, which has caused Danish officials to panic. That's as Rutte continues his usual diatribe that China and Russia are responsible for all the world's woes. When Greenland looks to him for help, though, he can only offer a big “NO COMMENT.” But don't worry, unlike Daddy Trump's golden boy, we've got plenty of comments and insights lined up for you – right here on RT.

MOSCOW, January 16. /TASS/. Russia's foreign ministry strongly recommends Russian nationals refrain from trips to Moldova amid what it called numerous cases of discrimination against Russian citizens in that country.

""Moscow continues to record numerous episodes of discrimination, ungrounded harassment and undue treatment of Russian citizens in Moldova by the Moldovan authorities,"" the ministry said.

The ministry ""strongly recommend that Russian citizens take these risks into account and refrain from traveling to Moldova.""

According to the Russian foreign ministry, Moldova's authorities are hampering consular access to Russian nationals. ""Relevant requests from the Russian diplomatic mission are ignored. That means that offering consular services is practically impossible.""

The ministry warned that upon arrival in Chisinau's airport, holders of Russian passports ""are regularly subjected to humiliating searches and checks."" Moreover, they often have to spend hours in the transit zone, being deprived of basic services.

""In some cases, Russian citizens spent more than two days at the airport. Oftentimes they were subsequently banned from entering the country under invented pretexts.

MOSCOW, January 16. /TASS/. Russia has no claims regarding Greenland, Russian Ambassador to Denmark Vladimir Barbin told TASS in an interview, commenting on US President Donald Trump's remarks that if the United States fails take Greenland under control, Russia or China will.

""Russia has no aggressive plans with regard to its Arctic neighbors. It is not threatening them with military action, not blackmailing them, and is not preparing to lay a claim to their territory,"" the diplomat said.

The Russian ambassador recalled Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen's remarks during a conference in Washington on January 14, where he said that neither Russia nor China posed a threat to Greenland today.

""Nevertheless, NATO countries, including Denmark, are broadly using fantasies about a Russian or Chinese threat in order to militarize the Arctic Region,"" the ambassador added.

In his opinion, ""by dragging NATO into the Arctic, including to Greenland, Denmark has been promoting a confrontational approach, which always leads to degradation of security <…> and fuels military tensions in the region.""

On January 14, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, top Greenlandic diplomat Vivian Motzfeldt met with US Vice President JD Vance, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met in Washington. Rasmussen later said Denmark was unable to convince the United States to abandon its desire to annex Greenland during these consultations. At the meeting, the parties agreed to create a working group that will meet regularly to explore the possibility of reaching an understanding on the future of the island. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated the need for Greenland to join the United States. Even during his first term in office he offered to buy out the island, and in March 2025 he expressed confidence that it could be annexed. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had previously questioned Denmark's right to control Greenland and said it should become part of the United States.

Earlier this week, Trump said: ""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor.""

Greenland is part of Denmark as an autonomous territory. In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen, in addition to allied commitments to NATO, signed the Greenland Defense Treaty, under which the United States has committed itself to defending the island from possible aggression.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Any Lucía López Belloza was detained at Boston's airport in November and flown to Honduras two days later

The Trump administration apologized in court for a “mistake” in the deportation of a Massachusetts college student who was detained trying to fly home to surprise her family in Texas for Thanksgiving.

But the administration still argued that the federal government error should not affect her immigration case.

Any Lucía López Belloza, a 19-year-old freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, 15 miles west of Boston, was detained at the city's airport on 20 November and flown to Honduras two days later. Her sudden removal came despite an emergency court order on 21 November directing the government to keep her in Massachusetts or elsewhere in the United States for at least 72 hours for legal processes.

López Belloza, whose family emigrated from Honduras to the US in 2014 when she was seven, is currently staying with grandparents and studying remotely. She is not detained and was recently visiting an aunt in El Salvador. In early December, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers reportedly turned up at her parents' home in Austin, Texas, and behaved aggressively towards the family but left without taking further action.

At a federal court hearing on Tuesday of this week in Boston, the government argued the court lacks jurisdiction in the case because lawyers for López Belloza filed their action several hours after she was taken to Texas on the way out of the US in November. But the government also acknowledged it violated the judge's order.

In court filings and in open court, government lawyers said an ICE deportation officer mistakenly believed the order no longer applied and he failed to activate a system that alerts other ICE officers that a case is subject to judicial review and that removal should be halted.

“On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize,” said Mark Sauter, assistant US attorney, to the judge, saying the employee understood “he made a mistake”. The violation, Sauter added, was “an inadvertent mistake by one individual, not a willful act of violating a court order”.

In a declaration filed with the court on 2 January, the ICE officer also admitted he did not notify ICE's enforcement office in Port Isabel, Texas, that the removal mission needed to be canceled. He said he believed the judge's order did not apply once López Belloza was no longer in the state.

The government maintains, however, that her deportation was lawful because an immigration judge ordered the removal of López Belloza and her mother in 2016, and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed their appeal in 2017. Prosecutors said she could have pursued additional appeals or sought a stay of removal.

Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, countered that she was deported in clear violation of the 21 November order and said the government's actions deprived her of due process. “I was hoping the government would show some leniency and bring her back,” he said. “They violated a court order.”

Federal Judge Richard Stearns said he appreciated the government acknowledging the error, calling it a “tragic” bureaucratic mistake. But he appeared to rule out holding the government in contempt, noting the violation did not appear intentional. He also questioned whether he had jurisdiction over the case.

“It might not be anybody's fault, but she was the victim of it,” Stearns said, adding at one point that López Belloza could explore applying for a student visa.

Pomerleau said one resolution would be allowing López Belloza to return to finish her studies while he works to reopen the underlying removal order.

Washington Post says local medical examiner found ‘asphyxia' to be cause of Geraldo Lunas Campos's death. Plus, how Trump's dismantling of federal agencies has impacted children with cancer

Good morning.

The death of a man who was being held at a federal detention camp in Texas in early January may be investigated as a homicide after the local medical examiner reportedly found the preliminary cause was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”.

Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old from Cuba who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in July last year, was pronounced dead on January 3. He had been in ICE custody at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.

The Department of Homeland Security had previously highlighted Lunas Campos as one of the “worst of the worst”, a category used by DHS to trumpet what they claim as victories in Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. Lunas Campos had convictions for child sexual abuse, possession of a firearm and aggravated assault.

What did ICE say about his death? In a press release, the agency claimed he died after “experiencing medical distress” and said his cause of death was under investigation.

The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has presented her gold Nobel peace prize medal to Donald Trump after meeting him in the White House, nearly a fortnight after he ordered the abduction of Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro.

Machado, who received the award last year for her struggle against Maduro's “brutal, authoritarian state”, told reporters on Thursday she had made the gesture in recognition of the US president's “unique commitment [to] our freedom”.

Several hours later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Machado “presented me with her Nobel peace prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect”.

What have the peace prize organizers said? Earlier in the day, they posted on X: “A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel peace prize laureate cannot.”

The regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, will not be able to maintain control over Iranian society after the violent suppression of the latest wave of protests, one of the country's leading film-makers has predicted.

“It is impossible for this government to sustain itself in this situation,” the director Jafar Panahi told the Guardian. “They know it too. They know that it will be impossible to rule over people.

Todolí foundation produces varieties from Buddha's hands to sudachi and hopes to help citrus survive climate change

It was on a trip with a friend to the east coast of Spain that the chef Matthew Slotover came across the “Garden of Eden”, an organic farm growing citrus varieties he had never heard of. The Todolí Citrus Foundation is a nonprofit venture and the largest private collection of citrus in the world with more than 500 varieties, and its owners think the rare fruit could hold the genetic secrets to growing citrus groves that can deal with climate change.

The farm yields far more interesting fruit than oranges and lemons for Slotover's menu, including kumquat, finger lime, sudachi and bergamot.

They grow everything completely naturally, and the groves have become a haven for frogs, goldfinches and bees.

Slotover is the founder of Toklas in London, one of Nigella Lawson's favourite restuarants. She recently raved about a dinner there that included langoustine and scallops with Rangpur lime and Spanish sweet limetta, and a “heavenly” guava roll with Shikuwasa mandarin.

When Slotover visited the Todolí farm, he was awestruck. “It was like the Garden of Eden”, he said. “I just cannot tell you what the experience was like … I knew about oranges and lemons and limes and grapefruit. I didn't know about tangelos and finger limes and citrons and pomelo.”

He tries to source most of the food on his European-inspired menu from the UK. “But citrus is too good to miss,” he said, during a visit to the Oxford Real Farming conference earlier this month. He teamed up with other chefs to bring over some rare varieties from the farm, and they became so popular he passed distribution over to the organic food supplier Shrub, which sells them to chefs across London.

Finger limes, also known as caviar limes, frequently feature on Slotover's menu. They contain zesty pearls that burst in the mouth and have a fragrant sweet-and-sour flavour.

The citrus collection had no commercial purpose before the chefs discovered it. “When we first approached the owner Vincente [Todolí, the former Tate Modern director], he said: ‘We don't really sell it. We give it to friends, we have an Italian guy who makes ice-cream with it.' And what we've been doing with it since has been really helpful to the farm,” Slotover said.

The foundation's technical director, Óscar Olivares-Fuster, said it operated differently to the commercial farms nearby.

“Spain is the world's largest exporter of fresh citrus,” he said. “We at Todolí do organic, we don't use pesticides, we work with nature. Our climate, the cold nights, warm days and sea breeze help us with all our varieties, more or less.”

Rather than using artificial irrigation, which is water-intensive, they have learned from the ancient Arab practices and use irrigation ditches and ponds, which are not only attractive to look at but store water very well.

They have also created a haven for songbirds previously linked to Valencia's citrus groves but which have been wiped out by herbicides and insecticides.

“We have a bank of genes here, with hundreds of varieties of citrus. This is something unique to study,” Olivares-Fuster said. “Investigating these will be key for citrus to survive all the challenges that are coming, including climate change. Eventually, citrus will be grown north of the Pyrenees and we might struggle in the south.”

One of his favourite varieties to grow is the trifoliate orange. It is a small, very sharp fruit used mostly in jams and marmalades or as a substitute for lemon zest in recipes.

He said it was interesting because unlike other citrus varieties “it will shed its leaves in winter. This means it can be very resistant to cold”. Perhaps scientists could use this genetic trait to help other citrus varieties survive in colder climates, he suggested.

The farm grows 40 Japanese citrus varieties, including the Kiyomi tangor, but also the Valentine pomelo, a sweet fruit often grown in California. Chefs are keen on calamansi, a small, sour fruit originally from the Philippines, and the fragrant Borneo lumia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Chinese Embassy in Manila yesterday said it has filed a diplomatic protest against a Philippine Coast Guard spokesman over a social media post that included cartoonish images of Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平).

Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tarriela and an embassy official had been trading barbs since last week over issues concerning the disputed South China Sea.

The crucial waterway, which Beijing claims historic rights to despite an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis, has been the site of repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels.

Tarriela's Facebook post on Wednesday included a photo of him giving a speech, with a background featuring a compilation of comical images of Xi under the banner “Why China remains to be bully?” 

The embassy slammed the post for “attacking and smearing Chinese leaders” in a statement it released.

The move “constitutes a serious violation of China's political dignity,” the embassy said, adding that it is a “blatant political provocation, which has crossed the red line.”

The embassy expressed strong indignation to the Philippines' presidential palace, foreign affairs department and coast guard demanding an explanation for Tarriela's “malicious provocations.”

Tarriela said the protest was “an attempt to deflect from the core issue: China's repeated aggressive and illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea,” using the Filipino term for the waters immediately west of the country.

“If the Chinese Embassy objects to images or expressions that highlight these violations — often through legitimate public discourse or even satire — it only underscores discomfort with the truth being exposed,” Tarriela said, calling the response an “effort to intimidate.”

Faced with new global challenges, the leaders of China and Canada yesterday pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) told visiting Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October last year on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,” Xi said.

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, said better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

He called for a new relationship “adapted to new global realities” and cooperation in agriculture, energy and finance.

Those new realities reflect the so-called “America first” approach of US President Donald Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both economies. 

Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that the Canadian government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the US at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

No announcement was made on tariffs between China and Canada, which is a sticking point in the relationship.

Canada followed the US in putting tariffs of 100 percent on electric vehicles from China, and 25 percent on steel and aluminum under former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.

China responded by imposing duties of 100 percent on Canadian canola oil and meal, and 25 percent on pork and seafood. It also added a 75.8 percent tariff on canola seeds. 

Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.

China is hoping Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada would drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the US. Trump has suggested Canada could become the US' 51st state.

16:49 JST, January 16, 2026

Another 11 players have been selected to defend Japan's title in the upcoming World Baseball Classic in March.

NPB Enterprise Inc. and other organizers announced the additions to Samurai Japan on Friday.

Tomoyuki Sugano, who pitched for Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles last season, returns to the national squad for the first time in two tournaments. In his debut year since departing from the Yomiuri Giants, where he was the ace pitcher, he delivered a solid performance, recording 10 wins.

From the domestic leagues, Hanshin Tigers infielder Teruaki Sato earned his first selection to the national team. Sato was a driving force behind his team's Central League championship last season, clinching two league batting titles with 40 home runs and 102 RBIs.

Also joining the roster are pitcher Yuki Matsumoto of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, catchers Seishiro Sakamoto of the Hanshin Tigers and Kenya Wakatsuki of the Orix Buffaloes, and outfielder Shota Morishita of the Hanshin Tigers.

From the previous championship-winning squad, infielder Shugo Maki of the Yokohama DeNA BayStars was selected, along with infielder Sosuke Genda of the Saitama Seibu Lions, and the trio of infielder Taisei Makihara, outfielder Kensuke Kondoh, and outfielder Ukyo Shuto from the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.

Eight players, including the Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani, were announced in December. Once the remaining 11 members have been selected, the roster for Japan's 30-man team will be complete.

Editor's note: This is a developing story.

An unidentified drone crashed into a residential high-rise in the Russian city of Ryazan overnight on Jan. 16, as Russia reported a wave of drone attacks across multiple regions.

Russian officials said there were no casualties, while residents reported hearing explosions during the night. A local oil refinery is believed to be the intended target of the strikes.

According to the Russian opposition news channel Astra, the drone hit around the 18th floor of a building in the Otkrytie residential complex, though local authorities have not commented and the extent of the damage remains unclear.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed air defenses intercepted 22 drones over Ryazan Oblast, with additional drones downed over the Rostov, Voronezh, Kursk, Tula, and Volgograd regions, as well as Crimea, Oryol, and Lipetsk.

The ministry also said another 44 drones were intercepted over Belgorod Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials.

The Ryazan Oil Refinery, which produces upwards of 17.1 million tons of oil per year, has been a regular target of attack given its role in fueling Russia's war in Ukraine.

Ryazan, the region's capital, is located 180 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Moscow and about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia along Sumy Oblast.

Ukraine hopes to gain more clarity on ""documents that we have actually drafted with the American side, and regarding Russia's response to all this diplomatic work,"" Zelensky said.

A major air defense aid package has arrived in Ukraine to help defend its stricken energy infrastructure as the country-wide winter energy crisis deepens, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 16.

The arrival of the package, further details about which were not disclosed, came at a point when several of the surface-to-air missile systems in Ukraine were left ""without missiles,"" the Ukrainian president said.

Each successive delivery of extra air defense support from Ukraine's partners is being begged and fought for, said Zelensky, who noted that Ukraine's needs extended far beyond the well-known U.S.-built Patriot system.

Ukraine is loosening curfew restrictions to allow citizens to reach humanitarian aid centers even at nighttime amid an ongoing energy crisis caused by Russian attacks, Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Jan. 16.

""This is necessary so that everyone who currently has no electricity, water, or heat receives the necessary assistance,"" Shmyhal explained during a meeting in the parliament, noting that similar rules are already in effect during air raid alerts.

A curfew was introduced in Ukraine alongside martial law at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, largely prohibiting citizens from being outside during specific hours.

The curfew length varies across regions. In Kyiv and most other regions away from the front line, it lasts from midnight until 5 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelensky signaled upcoming changes in the rules earlier this week.

The news follows days of sustained Russian drone and missile attacks against the energy grid in Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine, leaving citizens without heat and electricity for an extended period amid freezing temperatures.

The unprecedented energy crisis continues to afflict the most of the nation's population centers, especially the capital, where even maximum temperatures currently fail to climb higher than -10 degrees Celsius.

The resulting hardships and dangers have affected millions of Ukrainians, with heating cut to a minimum and indoor temperatures plummet, while regular non-scheduled power outages greatly limit alternative options for staying warm.

""I've recently come back to Kyiv after three years abroad, and this winter feels like the worst I have ever seen while I was visiting,"" said Lisa Sokolova, a 24-year-old communications manager based in the capital to the Kyiv Independent.

""Life has become critically unpredictable, it is impossible to plan even an evening or the next day. You never know if there will be heat, water, light, and the ability to work or cook.""

Ukrainian authorities have declared a state of emergency to tackle the consequences and alleviate humanitarian challenges facing the population.

In Kyiv, city authorities announced on Jan. 10 a significant dialling down in outdoor light output, with most streets lights reduced to 20% power and any decorative lighting switched off entirely.

Shmyhal also instructed state companies, namely Ukrainian Railways and the energy company Naftogaz, to ensure electricity supply from abroad for the current winter in the amount of no less than 50% of total consumption.

Backup energy equipment is being distributed across regions to address the critical needs of essential infrastructure, the minister noted.

In addition to air defense support Ukraine's partners continue to supply Kyiv with emergency aid directed both at repairing energy infrastructure and mitigating the humanitarian effects of the crisis.

The U.K. allocated 20 million pounds ($26.8 million) of accelerated funding for ""energy infrastructure support"" on Jan. 16 while Italy has begun the delivery of industrial boilers with 1.85 million euros ($2.15 million) for the worst-affected areas, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said that since October 2025, Russian forces have targeted 11 hydroelectric power plants, 45 major combined heat and power plants, 49 thermal power plants, and 151 electrical substations across the country.

The heaviest strikes were recorded in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast, as well as the Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Chernihiv oblasts.

The intensified attacks also come at a time when Kyiv remains under significant pressure to accept capitulatory concessions as a basis for a potential peace deal with Moscow.

""I think this is a strategy of exhaustion and demoralization, it's really exhausting but despite everything, I want to stay in Kyiv and maybe to take a ""break"" in safer cities in Ukraine,"" said Sokolova. 

""At the same time, I understand that capitulation will make things worse — we will lose the opportunity for justice without guarantees of safety.""

Yuliia Taradiuk contributed to reporting.

Putin said Russia is ready to serve as a mediator in the Middle East, an offer that follows signals that the U.S. might launch strikes against Iran amid a deadly crackdown on protests.

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

For a mid-sized, trade-dependent economy like Canada's, life is tough now. The United States, the world's biggest economy and the country's largest trading partner, is turning its back on free trade; the world's largest trading bloc, Europe, while open to deepening ties, promises limited upside growth; and China, the other behemoth, exports far more than it imports.

Prime Minister Mark Carney's trip to Beijing this week to find new markets for Canadian businesses seemed a tall order from the start. So, the accord on Friday to lower tariffs on both sides is good news indeed. The deal that will increase canola exports from Canada while allowing Chinese electric-vehicles into the Canadian market is quite an achievement – not only for the gains secured, but for the door it opens.

At first glance, the opportunities in China look scant, since the country's export-led growth model limits the growth of the country's domestic market. Nevertheless, China has for years been talking of raising the consumption share of the economy and some China-watchers expect 2026 will be the year this rebalancing starts in earnest, potentially expanding its domestic market considerably. Canada should therefore take this agreement further, since some of the immediate opportunities Canada faces in China may be time-limited, with implications for two of Canada's biggest industries – oil and cars.

Tony Keller: Why is Mark Carney in Beijing? Blame the weather in Washington

China's shift to renewable energy has been driven primarily by a strategic imperative, namely the desire to reduce dependence on critical imports. Having just lost access to the oil it imported from Venezuela, and with its Iranian supplies threatened by the instability there, China will no doubt welcome Canadian substitutes. But it won't want to depend on them. The volatility of global energy markets in the last few weeks will only intensify Beijing's drive to further reduce its oil and gas imports.

Thus, Canada ought to couple oil and gas sales with the acceleration of its own energy transition. Meanwhile, trying to protect the Canadian auto industry in its current form is probably now a doomed cause, because it's not just China switching to new technology. Global sales of gas-powered cars peaked in 2016 and have since fallen precipitously as the world transitions toward electrical vehicles. China has become the world leader in the EV market not, as is often said, due simply to cheap labour and government subsidies, but because Chinese carmakers have become so efficient – for instance, automation of Chinese factories has advanced further than in western countries (even with the high tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese EVs, Chinese producers are still entering the U.S. market).

So, Canada would do better to regard China's renewable-energy sector, and especially its automobile sector, not as a threat but as an opportunity, forging partnerships that will enable Canadian firms in this sector to grow and find new markets for new products elsewhere. In that regard, the agreement to foster greater gas and oil exports to China while simultaneously encouraging co-operation in the shift to renewable energy is a further step forward.

Furthermore, there's reason for cautious optimism that deepening ties in this sector won't just leave Canada swamped with inexpensive Chinese imports. The European Union and China this week agreed to a minimum pricing scheme to replace tariffs on Chinese EVs, and China also plans to end rebates on the exports of solar panels and batteries. In short, while the U.S. is hardening its trade stance, China appears to be easing its own. Mr. Carney has seized his chance at an opportune time.

Were Canada to now advance its technology collaboration with China, it could potentially learn a lot in areas where China excels. For instance, in high-speed rail, China has not simply shortened travel times between cities but integrated it with local transit to create larger labour markets, thereby facilitating the knowledge-exchange behind the country's rapid pace of technological progress. Of note, therefore, is Chinese President Xi Jinping's commitment to provide visa-free travel to Canadians, which widens the door to cross-border knowledge-exchange.

In sum, Canada stands to gain a lot from partnering with China to build an economy for the future, not preserve the present one. As Arthur Lam wrote in these pages this week, Canada needs to develop its industrial economy if it's to secure growing exports, not just fall back on the resource-oriented export model that served the country so well in the last century, but which is quickly approaching its expiration date.

The two countries still have fundamental differences. Nonetheless Canada can reduce its vulnerability by developing products, services and systems that become so useful to the Chinese, and to other countries, and so difficult to substitute elsewhere, that more nations see the virtue of co-operating with us.

Friday's agreement was therefore a good start in renewing ties. Canada now has an opportunity to develop this relationship to help build a new and more resilient economy.

Prime Minister Mark Carney reached a deal with China to allow nearly 50,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into Canada at a low tariff rate in return for big reductions in Beijing's levies on canola seed and a promised elimination of its tariffs on a host of other products.

The announcement on Friday marks a break with the United States in how it treats Chinese electric vehicles by removing a tariff both countries enacted in 2024.

This brings about a truce in a painful trade war between Ottawa and Beijing as the Prime Minister seeks bigger overseas export markets and new foreign investment to offset the economic damage caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist tariffs.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a trade deal that would allow up to 49,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into the Canadian market, with Beijing reducing levies on canola seed and other products.

At the same time, the deal raises the prospect that Canada may be putting itself offside of Mr. Trump's tough-on-China agenda, which the President expects allies to follow.

U.S. Trade Representative ‍Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government's decision to allow Chinese electric vehicles at a low tariff ‍rate ​is “problematic” and that Canada may come to regret the decision.

“I think in ‍the long run, they're not going to like ‍having made that deal,” Mr. Greer told CNBC on Friday.

Canada's trade deal with the United States and Mexico is up for review this year. 

Mr. Carney announced the deal with Beijing after several hours of meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his first trip to China as Prime Minister.

China's Ministry of Commerce later posted statements online that are consistent with Mr. Carney's description of the deal. The statement said the two countries have agreed to work together in a wide range of areas, such as electric vehicles, energy and agriculture, with economic and trade co-operation expected to enter a fast-track of development. 

Ottawa imposed 100-per-cent tariffs on Chinese-made EVs in 2024, and Beijing later responded with retaliatory levies on seafood and agricultural products. 

The Prime Minister said this is the first fruit of a new “strategic partnership” Canada is forging with China, which follows from his decision to “strategically, pragmatically and decisively” change relations with Beijing.

Andrew Coyne: In seeking to deepen trade with China, Canada is hedging its bets

Mr. Carney, speaking to reporters in Beijing, said relations with China have recently been more predictable than those with the U.S. and the “results coming from that” are visible.

The Prime Minister made several references during his visit to the upset in global trading rules - a disruption that has increased under Mr. Trump. “The world has changed much since that last visit. I believe the progress that we have made in the partnership sets us up well for the new world order,” Mr. Carney said Thursday during earlier meetings with Premier Li Qiang. 

There are caveats to Canada's tariff concession, which lowers levies on Chinese EVs from 100 per cent to 6.1 per cent starting March 1: It applies to the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. Mr. Carney later told reporters he expects the quota will rise about six per cent annually – reaching 70,000 in half a decade.

In return, China, by March 1, will cut tariffs on canola seed to approximately 15 per cent from current combined tariff levels of 84 per cent, the Prime Minister said.

And, according to Mr. Carney, Beijing has also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas by that date “until at least the end of this year.” He did not elaborate on this or whether this tariff relief would be extended beyond 2026.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister said, Mr. Xi has committed to removing visa requirements for Canadians travelling to China.

Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand says Prime Minister Mark Carney's trip to Beijing is about boosting trade and refreshing Canada's relationship with China.

The Canadian Press

Canada imposed the tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in tandem with the U.S. in 2024 under the Biden administration. 

The rationale for Canada's levies on these imports was that China is subsidizing and overproducing EVs, swamping global markets and undermining other countries' ability to compete. 

Mr. Carney did not address those concerns Friday.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has previously described Chinese EVs as “roving surveillance systems” that should not be allowed on Canadian streets, issued a statement criticizing the deal.

“Prime Minister Carney must explain how he has gone from saying China was Canada's ‘biggest security threat' before the election to announcing a ‘strategic partnership' with Beijing after the election,” he said.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford also criticized the EV tariff cut Friday, warning this could hurt Canada's auto sector, which is largely concentrated in his province. “Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers.”

Asked how he will explain to the United States why Canada is giving China freer access to our automobile market, Mr. Carney played down the amount of low-tariff access granted.

He said the quota for Chinese EVs reflects imports from the last full year before the tariff was applied and it is “less than 3 per cent of the size of the Canadian auto market.” Canadians buy about 1.8 million vehicles each year, Mr. Carney said.

He also defended allowing in more foreign vehicles at a time when the Canadian auto assembly industry is under pressure, saying the Chinese supply will offer lower-priced EVs for Canadian consumers. 

“China's strengths in the electric vehicle sector are undeniable. They produce some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world,” the Prime Minister said.

Canada says it's open to Chinese investment in energy sector

Opinion: Quite the achievement for Mr. Carney in Beijing. Now what?

Part of the Chinese EV quota will be reserved for cars with an import price of $35,000 or less, Mr. Carney said. The proportion of the quota dedicated to this category will rise 50 per cent by 2030, he said, “kickstarting the availability of more affordable electric vehicles in Canada. 

Mr. Carney said he expects this EV deal will spur Chinese auto industry investment in Canada. He offered no details on what would drive China's EV makers to relocate production to Canada.

He said the Canadian government has set a goal of increasing exports to China by 50 per cent by 2030.

The Prime Minister defended his engagement with China despite Western criticism of its human-rights record. 

“We take the world as it is – not as we wish it to be,” Mr. Carney said. 

The Prime Minister said Canada and China “respect the differences in each other's systems,” which means co-operation will be more “focused and limited” than with more like-minded countries. He suggested he doesn't plan to criticize China publicly. “We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.”

Carney says he and Xi talked about Greenland's sovereignty and the U.S. president's threats to the territory during their meeting in Beijing.

The Canadian Press

Mr. Carney, asked about U.S. threats to take Greenland by force, said he backs the sovereignty of Denmark. He added that he and Mr. Xi “found much alignment of views” when the issue came up during their meeting. 

Mr. Carney's four-day ​official visit to China, which began on Wednesday, is the first by a Canadian prime minister since 2017. Relations between Western countries and China deteriorated as countries, including Canada, blocked Chinese companies from investing in an increasing array of sectors from telecommunications to critical minerals to security-related industries.

Canada's food-safety agency signs agreement with China

On Thursday, the Prime Minister met with Premier Li and Zhao Leji, China's top legislator. The two sides signed five non-binding memorandums of understanding, including one on strengthening energy co-operation, at a time of rising petroleum exports to China from Canada. The energy MOU also promotes Canadian uranium sales to China, saying the two countries aim to “strengthen co-operation in natural uranium trade.”

The two countries also issued a joint economic and trade co-operation “road map” that said Canada would welcome Chinese investments in areas including energy, agriculture and consumer products as part of a growing relationship.

The Carney government has stressed the need to shift trade away from the United States, which has grown more protectionist under Mr. Trump. Mr. Carney has set a 10-year goal for Canada to double non-U.S. trade, which would generate $300-billion more in annual exports.

US President Donald Trump says Iran has halted killings and executions, citing assurances he received. Tehran denies plans for hangings as tensions remain high and airspace closures disrupt flights. Follow DW for more.

US President Donald Trump says he is told Iran has stopped killing protesters and will not carry out executions

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says there are no plans to execute protesters, while repeating claims that foreign elements are behind the unrest

Tensions remain high after Iran briefly closes its airspace, forcing international flights to divert before traffic begins to resume

Here are the latest headlines, analyses and background on the Iran protests Thursday January 15, 2025:

The United Nations has called on Iran to stop any planned executions of protesters and to investigate all deaths independently and transparently.

""We call on Iran to halt any executions linked to protest-related cases,"" Martha Pobee, UN assistant secretary general at the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said during a UN Security Council meeting. ""All deaths should be promptly, independently, and transparently investigated. Those responsible for any violations must be held to account in line with international norms and standards.""

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on all parties to exercise the utmost restraint, Pobee added.

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) held an emergency meeting on Thursday to address protests in Iran and a crackdown that has resulted in thousands of deaths, according to the group Iran Human Rights.

At the meeting, Iran's Deputy UN Ambassador Gholam Hossein Darzi accused the US of ""direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.""

He claimed Washington, with its actions, was ""laying the groundwork for political destabilization and military intervention"" in the Middle Eastern nation.

The diplomat stressed that Tehran does not seek escalation or confrontation, but would deliver a ""decisive, proportionate and lawful response"" should there be ""any act of aggression — direct or indirect.""

Meanwhile, US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz told the UNSC meeting that Washington stands by the ""brave people of Iran.""

He also reiterated President Donald Trump's stance that ""all options are on the table.""

""President Trump is a man of ‌action, not endless talk like we see at the United Nations. He has made it ‌clear all options are ⁠on the table to stop the slaughter,"" Waltz said.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in recent days in a deadly clampdown on the anti-regime protests.

But on Thursday, the US leader adopted a wait-and-see posture, saying he had been told ⁠that Iran would stop killing protesters and not carry out executions.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters President Donald Trump was informed that 800 executions of Iranian protesters that had been supposed to take place yesterday ""were halted.""

Iran's Justice Ministry early on Wednesday had said that trials and executions of protesters would be expedited, only to walk back the statement later in the day.

Trump said Wednesday he had been assured from ""very important sources on the other side"" that executions would not go ahead, and appeared, for now, to step back from threats of military action against the Iranian regime. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing US officials, that Trump had been advised a military strike against Iran would likely not lead to regime collapse, and would risk sparking a ""wider conflict."" 

Press Secretary Leavitt said Thursday that the US was continuing to monitor the situation in Iran, with the latest reports indicating the protests have begun to slow down.

""The president and his team have communicated to the Iranian regime that if the killing continues, there will be grave consequences,"" she said. 

The Oslo-based NGO Iran Human Rights estimates more than 3,400 protesters have been killed, making the crackdown on protesters by far the deadliest in the history of the Islamic Republic.

While ordinary Iranians are still cut off from the world by the longest internet blackout in Iran's history, the regime itself is working hard to spread its narrative of the protests that have gripped the country.

Switzerland has signalled its willingness to mediate in the tensions between the US and Iran.

The Swiss foreign affairs department said a top official spoke with the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and offered a venue ""to help de-escalate the current situation.""

Switzerland represents the interests of the US in Iran because Washington has not had diplomatic representation there since the US embassy in Tehran was stormed in 1979 during the first days of the Islamic revolution.

Among other things, Switzerland maintains a ""Foreign Interests Section"" in Tehran, which provides consular protection to US citizens. 

A nationwide internet shutdown in Iran hit the one week mark on Thursday, Internet monitor Netblocks posted on social media.

""Exactly one week ago... Iran fell into digital darkness as authorities imposed a national internet blackout,"" Netblocks said.

Human rights activists outside of Iran fear the communications blackout is aimed at masking the true scale of a deadly crackdown on protests.

The Oslo-based NGO Iran Human Rights says more than 3,400 demonstrators have been killed, adding that the actual figure is likely much higher as the communication blackout makes it more difficult to access information from inside Iran.

Iranian state media have reported authorities are looking for Starlink satellite dishes, which provide remote internet access and offer the only way for videos and images from inside Iran to reach the outside world.

The United Nations Security Council has called an emergency meeting Thursday to address Iran's deadly protests, following a request from the United States.

President Donald Trump said he's been told that killings in Iran's crackdown on protests are easing. He added there's no current plan for mass executions, signaling a wait-and-see approach after earlier threats of intervention.

Iran's foreign minister said Tehran has ""no plan"" to hang protesters. State media reported Thursday that a 26-year-old man arrested in the central city of Karaj will not face the death penalty.

Rights group Hengaw had warned Erfan Soltani could be executed this week, but his family says the order was postponed.

Trump reacted on social media, calling the news ""good"" and hoping it continues.

The United States imposed sanctions on Iranian security officials for allegedly orchestrating a violent crackdown on peaceful protests.

The Treasury Department sanctioned the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security, accused of being among the first to call for violence against protesters, as well as commanders from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and law enforcement forces.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US ""stands firmly behind the Iranian people in their call for freedom and justice"" and that Treasury ""will use every tool to target those behind the regime's tyrannical oppression of human rights.""

The US also sanctioned 18 individuals and entities involved in a shadow banking network linked to Iranian financial institutions.

""US Treasury knows that, like rats on a sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you,"" Bessent warned.

The sanctions block access to US assets and businesses, but they are largely symbolic because many of those affected hold no US assets.

A Canadian citizen has died in Iran at the hands ⁠of ‍the Iranian authorities, Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand ⁠wrote on X, though she did not provide details on how or when it happened.

""Peaceful protests by the Iranian people — asking that their voices be heard in the face of the Iranian regime's repression and ongoing human rights violations — has led the regime to flagrantly disregard human life,"" she said.

She added that Canada condemns the Iranian regime's violence and calls for it to end immediately.

The northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein has suspended deportations to Iran, according to an order issued by the state's Social Affairs Minister, Aminata Toure.

The decision cites recent unrest in Iran and the government's crackdown on its population.

""The human rights situation in Iran is catastrophic. Every day, Iranian security forces crack down on demonstrators with extreme harshness,"" said Toure. Her ministry stated that the deportation ban will initially apply for three months.

The move follows a similar decision on Wednesday by Rhineland-Palatinate, which ordered an immediate halt to deportations of Iranian nationals.

Meanwhile, Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is rejecting a nationwide halt to deportations to Iran, despite the brutal crackdown by Iranian security forces on protesters.

One Red Crescent staff member died, and five other colleagues were hurt while working last week in northwestern Iran, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a statement.

The aid group's parent organization, however, did not say how the staff member died.

""The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is deeply saddened by the killing of Amir Ali Latifi, an Iranian Red Crescent Society staff member, and the wounding of five other IRCS colleagues, who were all in the line of duty in Gilan province, on January 10,"" the IFRC said.

The IFRC expressed its sincere condolences to his family, loved ones, and all IRCS colleagues. 

It also said it was ""deeply concerned about the consequences of the ongoing unrest on the people of Iran,"" and stressed the ""safety and protection of humanitarian personnel,"" were essential to ensure the, ""delivery of impartial, life-saving assistance to people in need.""

Turkey opposes military intervention against neighboring Iran and believes that Tehran must resolve its internal problems independently, according to Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

""We are against military intervention in Iran. Iran needs to resolve its own internal, authentic problems itself,"" Fidan told reporters.

At a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said Turkey would continue its diplomatic initiatives to help solve the issue. He added that Ankara hopes Iran and the United States can find a solution to the conflict.

In recent days, Fidan held two calls with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, to stress the need for talks to resolve regional tensions.  

China's foreign minister told his Iranian counterpart that Beijing opposes ""the use or threat of force in international relations,"" as tensions rise over protests in Iran.

The remarks came during a phone call between Wang Yi and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to China's foreign ministry.

The call followed comments by US President Donald Trump considering military intervention against Iran as human rights groups estimate more than 3,400 protesters have been killed over two weeks of anti-government protests.

""The use or threat of force in international relations is opposed, as is imposing one country's will on another,"" Wang said during the call, according to the ministry.

He added that China was ""willing to play a constructive role"" in helping find a way forward.

Foreign ministers from the G7 group of major industrialized democracies and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas have voiced alarm over developments in Iran and rejected what they called a deepening, brutal repression of the population.

In a joint statement, they said Iranians have been courageously expressing legitimate demands for a better life, dignity, and freedom since late December.

The eight officials, including German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, said they were concerned by the high number of reported deaths and injuries.

They urged Iranian authorities to show restraint, refrain from violence, and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, and access to information.

""We condemn the deliberate use of violence and the killing of demonstrators, arbitrary arrests and intimidation tactics by security forces against protesters,"" the statement said.

The officials said they were ""deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries"" and condemned ""the deliberate use of violence"" by Iranian security forces against protesters.

The G7 members ""remain prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues to crack down on protests and dissent in violation of international human rights obligations,"" the statement said.

The G7 and the EU said they were prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues its crackdown. The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The UN Security Council is set to meet Thursday afternoon for ""a briefing on the situation in Iran,"" according to a spokesperson for the council's Somali presidency.

The scheduling note said the briefing was requested by the United States.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","'Charlie Hebdo' cartoon on Swiss fire tragedy sparks outrage","https://www.dw.com/en/charlie-hebdo-cartoon-on-swiss-fire-tragedy-sparks-outrage/a-75513790","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:02:24 GMT","

A cartoon by the French satirical weekly portraying the deadly fire in Crans-Montana as the ""comedy of the year"" provokes disgust.

On average, the cartoons published on the Instagram account of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo get a few hundred reactions, but a recent drawing by cartoonist Eric Salch has prompted more than 15,000 social media users to express their dismay.

It was published as Switzerland observed a national day of mourning to commemorate the victims of the deadly fire in a bar in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, which killed 40 people, most of them teenagers. More than 110 others suffered injuries, some severe.

The cartoon referring to the tragedy shows two apparently charred skiers, wrapped in bandages, skiing downhill in Crans-Montana. 

The caption reads: ""Les brûlés font du ski — La comédie de l'année"" (""The burned go skiing — The comedy of the year""). The text is a play on the title of the French film comedy, ""Les Bronzés font du ski"" (1979; released in English as ""French Fried Vacation 2"").

The cartoon was swiftly met with fierce debate.

Lawmaker Benjamin Roduit of Switzerland's The Center party called for a ban on sales of Charlie Hebdo in the country. He told news site nau.ch: ""At a time when young victims are fighting for their lives, this is vile and unacceptable. It violates human dignity. The words fail me to describe that image.""

Swiss author Beatrice Riand and her husband Stephane, a lawyer, filed a criminal complaint. They argue that Salch and Charlie Hebdo were in violation of Article 135 of the Swiss Criminal Code, which penalizes the production and distribution of violent depictions that grievously violate human dignity.

Riand told Swiss broadcaster RTS, ""I find this deeply abhorrent. Freedom of expression has limits. They're mocking the victims. The question is: Does human dignity take precedence over freedom of expression, or not?""

An attorney for the victims, Jean-Luc Addor, described the image to nau.ch as ""deeply shocking and in unimaginably poor taste,"" though he doubted a complaint would succeed. ""The readers of the magazine should be imposing the sanction,"" he said.

Thousands of commenters also voiced their outrage online. One Instagram comment read, ""Freedom of expression justifies nothing. Shame on you for what you've done; you're pathetic."" Another comment said, ""When you buried your dead, people cried with you… and when others mourn their children, you turn it into a joke. It's disgraceful! Where's your humanity?""

The latter comment is a reference to the 2015 terrorist attack on the French satirical weekly. Islamist terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo newsroom and killed 12 people, including five well-known cartoonists and the magazine's editors. The attackers targeted the magazine for reprinting cartoons from a Danish newspaper that depicted the Prophet Muhammad. Europe showed broad solidarity with Charlie Hebdo in reaction to the attacks.

The magazine has now once again succeeded in drawing attention with provocation. Editor-in-chief Gerard Biard defended the cartoon on RTS's ""Forum"" program: ""Of course it can be shocking, but satire is meant to shock."" He said the magazine was not mocking the victims, but highlighting the absurdity of the tragedy.

Biard acknowledged that the artist had ""gone pretty far,"" but added, ""dark humor does not have to be pleasant.""

The debate centers on a core question: Is there anything that shouldn't be a target for satire? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines satire as ""wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly (as of a person, government, or society),"" and more broadly, as ""humor that criticizes weakness or wrongdoing.""

For many, the cartoon about the fire crosses a line — and that reaction is what was intended. Supporters of an uncompromising approach to satire often point to Charlie Hebdo's long tradition of provocative, often taboo-breaking images, albeit grounded in legal protections for freedom of the press and free expression.

French cartoonist Patrick Lamassoure, president of the international press cartoonists' network Cartooning for Peace, told DW last year on the 10th anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attack: ""Anything I say or do can upset someone — anything. The only thing that can set a limit is the law, since we've all agreed to it.""

Three days after the initial drawing, Charlie Hebdo published another Salch cartoon on Instagram, mocking Switzerland's outrage.

The headline asks: ""Is it permissible to insult the Swiss?"" followed by, ""The editorial staff wiped out by crossbow."" It shows two enraged crossbowmen — the crossbow being a symbol for Switzerland — killing members of the satirical weekly's editorial staff, evoking memories of the 2015 attacks.

""Spoke with @ZelenskyyUa about the energy situation ‍in Ukraine, with Russia's ​attacks ​causing terrible human suffering, as well as on the ongoing efforts to bring an end to ‍the war,"" Rutte wrote on social media.

""We're ​committed to ensuring that Ukraine continues to ⁠get the ​crucial support needed to defend ‌today ‌and ultimately secure a lasting peace."" 

Russia has intensified a campaign on Ukraine's energy infrastructure amid freezing temperatures, having leftKyiv in the midst of its worst electricity outage of the war.

The deployment of Western forces to Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal is an ""unacceptable"" proposition for Russia, and foreign troops deployed to Ukraine would be legitimate targets for the Russian military, Russia's foreign ministry said.

""Well aware of the unacceptability of such a ‍scenario for Russia, the British are using it as another tool ​to undermine the peace process,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.

""Any foreign troops in ⁠Ukraine ​will be considered as legitimate targets for the ‌Russian ‌armed forces. The British component will be no exception,"" she said.

TheUK and France have agreed to deploy troops to Ukraine if it strikes a peace deal with Russia.

France says it now provides most of Ukraine's battlefield intelligence, largely replacing the United States.

""Where Ukraine was extremely dependent on American intelligence capacity, huge majority (of it) a year ago, in (the
space of) a year, two-thirds is today provided by France,"" President Emmanuel Macron said.

 

Washington suspended intelligence sharing in March 2025 to pressure Ukraine into peace talks with Russia.

Since then, a coalition of 35 nations has taken over weapons and financial support after the US stopped direct funding.

Kyiv's former spy chief warned last month that US data, including satellite imagery and missile alerts, remains critical.

Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency declined to comment.

 

Kharkiv's Mayor Ihor Terekhov said that a Russian attack had destroyed a large energy infrastructure object, without specifying what or where. 

""The enemy has destroyed a large object of critical energy infrastructure,"" Terekhov said. ""The headquarters for overcoming the consequences of emergencies is working 24/7, emergency services and specialized specialists are on site."" 

The border city of Kharkiv in the northeast had come in for explicit praise earlier from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an example of a city that had taken effective preparations to mitigate the effects of power outages and the cold weather. That was before Terekhov's comments on Thursday, however. 

A Russian ballistic missile struck port infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian city of Chornomorsk, Deputy Prime Minister for Reconstruction Oleksiy Kuleba said on Thursday. 

Kuleba said on Telegram that one person had been wounded in the strike on a pier, ""where a civilian vessel under the flag of Malta was located."" 

The injured person was a crew member who was receiving medical attention, he said. 

Kuleba said that the ship was preparing to transport container cargo. He said the strike had damaged three containers and caused an oil leak. 

""Russia is deliberately attacking facilities that ensure export, logistics and food security,"" he alleged, calling the attack ""another act of Russian terror."" 

Russia on Thursday expelled a British diplomat, saying the individual was an undeclared spy, while London dubbed the allegation ""malicious and baseless."" 

Russia's FSB security service said the diplomat was working undercover for British intelligence, and that he had been given two two weeks to leave Russia. The diplomat's name was published and Russian media carried pictures of him. 

The Foreign Ministry in Moscow summoned Britain's charge d'affaires, Danae Dholakia, to issue a formal protest. 

""A warning was also issued that if London escalates the situation, the Russian side will give a 'mirror' response,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 

The UK's Foreign Office said such ""malicious and baseless accusations"" against its staff were nothing new. 

""Their targeting of British diplomats comes out of desperation and actioons like this undermine the basic conditions required for diplomatic missions to operate,"" it said. ""We are carefully considering our options in response."" 

During the war in Ukraine, Russia and the West have repeatedly accused each other of ramping up espionage activity to levels not seen since the Cold War, sending various embassy and consulate staff home. 

Amid less frosty ties to the US since Donald Trump's return to the White House, Britain has increasingly inherited the unofficial status as Russia's main international antagonist in domestic propaganda.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva visited Kyiv on Thursday, holding talks with the head of the National Bank of Ukraine and visiting landmarks like the Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen photo memorial in the capital. 

Central bank chief Andriy Pyshnyy greeted Georgieva in front of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in the city center, where burnt-out Russian tanks were ⁠displayed.

Georgieva said online that she had an ""excellent discussion"" with Pyshnyy ""on the IMF's support for Ukraine, and on how monetary policy is helping preserve macroeconomic stability during these challenging times."" 

IMF officials said that Georgieva would also meet with President Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and other officials and business leaders during the one-day visit, her first since 2023. 

Georgieva, who has close family ties to Ukraine, said she was in the capital ""to witness firsthand the resilience of a people who have endured four years of an unjust war,"" adding that their ""courage inspires the world.""

The war, soon to enter a fifth year, has hit the Ukrainian economy hard, further impacting a country that had already required multiple emergency loans from the IMF in the years prior to Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. The country is slated to spend the bulk of state revenues — 2.8 trillion hryvnias or around 27.2% of GDP — to fund defense efforts in 2026.

Ukraine and the IMF reached a preliminary agreement on an $8.2 ‍billion, four-year lending program in November, contingent on passage of a budget for 2026 and shoring up donor financing assurances, among other factors. ​It is expected to come up for consideration in the coming weeks, after Georgieva's visit.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his video address that there was an emergency in the country's energy sector ""caused by the Russian airstrikes and the harsh winter weather,"" and that he had spent Wednesday discussing the means to tackle it with newly-appointed Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal. 

Ukraine has been setting up emergency tent shelters with heating, hot beverages and power points to charge devices like mobile phones. 

Zelenskyy said the situation was ""especially difficult"" in several cities — including Kyiv, Odesa and Dnipro — while others like Kharkiv had taken more timely measures to mitigate the fallout. 

He said that declaring a state of emergency would make greater flexibility and reduced bureaucracy possible legally. Regional leaders had been instructed to redouble efforts to connect backup energy sources to the grid and to import power from abroad, he said.

Incoming Energy Minister Shymhal has been a key ally to Zelenskyy throughout his presidency, previously serving for around five years as prime minister before moving to the Defense Ministry, and now the Energy Ministry. 

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that he agreed with President Trump's comments when asked by reporters on Thursday. 

""I agree, that is indeed the case,"" he said. ""President Putin and the Russian side remain open [to talks]. The Russian position is well known. It is well known to the American negotiators, to President Trump, and to the leadership of the Kyiv regime."" 

Peskov said that the situation was ""deteriorating day by day for the Kyiv regime,"" and that Ukraine's ""corridor for decision-making"" in the negotiating process was ""narrowing."" 

Russia has been pushing not just to keep the territory its military currently occupies, around 20% of Ukraine's internationally recognized land mass, but also for Ukraine to withdraw its troops from some contested regions which it still controls. Ukraine has suggested it might accept halting the fighting along the current front lines, in exchange for Western security guarantees guarding against any potential future Russian incursions. 

US President Donald Trump told the Reuters agency that it was his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, not Russia's Vladimir Putin, who was holding up a potential peace deal. 

""I think he's ready to make a deal,"" Trump said of the Russian president. ""I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.""

Asked why US-led negotiations were yet to resolve a conflict that the property mogul used to boast he would halt within ""a day,"" Trump responded: ""Zelenskyy."" 

These claims stand in contrast to the position of European allies, who have consistently questioned Putin's willingness to engage in serious negoatiations about a just peace. 

Zelenskyy has publicly ruled out territorial concessions to Russia on multiple occasions during the conflict, with Russian forces currently occupying large parts of the east of the country, as well as the Crimean Peninsula that it annexed in 2014.

Hello and welcome to our updates on news from or connected to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on January 15, 2026.

Freezing temperatures persist in much of the country after the wave of cold weather that swept east across Europe. 

At lunch time on Thursday in the capital Kyiv, temperatures in the shade were -12 degrees Celsius (10.4 Fahrenheit). Russia's longstanding tactic of targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure with its aerial attacks becomes doubly effective when the winter weather's most inclement.

Newly appointed Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal, a longstanding prime minister and then defense minister prior to this during Zelenskyy's tenure as president, took over the key portfolio on Wednesday. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW.com'}","world"

Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader, gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump on Thursday as she attempted to woo the US president.

Mr Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded the honour, which has been bestowed on several former presidents including Barack Obama.

Ms Machado, whose liberal Vente Venezuela party is widely believed to have won the 2024 election, was given the award for “promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela”.

It follows claims Mr Trump did not back installing Ms Machado as the country's leader following Nicholas Maduro's capture because she was given the honour.

Asked whether she had given Mr Trump her award during their meeting on Thursday, Ms Machado said: “I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize.”

She said she had done so “in recognition [of] his unique commitment [to] our freedom”.

A White House official confirmed that Mr Trump intends to keep the medal.

In a Truth Social post on Thursday evening, Mr Trump wrote: “Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Maria!”

Days earlier the Nobel Institute had ruled against Ms Machado's previous suggestion of transferring last year's peace prize to Mr Trump.

Earlier in the day, the Nobel organisers posted on X: “A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.”

Last week, Mr Trump said he could not think of “anybody in history that should get the Nobel Peace Prize more than me”.

The Venezuelan politician's effort to win over the US president comes after he said he did not believe she had enough respect within Venezuela to govern the country.

He instead has shown support for acting president Delcy Rodríguez, Mr Maduro's former vice-president, who was sworn in on Jan 5.

Critics argue that Ms Rodriguez is a continuation of Mr Maduro's repressive regime. Shortly after his capture, the government directed police to search out and seize people who supported the US intervention.

But Mr Trump appears to be pleased with the current arrangement, having praised Ms Rodriguez as a “terrific” person following a call earlier this week.

On Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the Venezuelan leaders had been “extremely cooperative” and the US president “likes what he's seeing”.

Ms Leavitt said Ms Rodriguez had been in “constant communication” with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and other officials.

The US president's opinion of Ms Machado's ability to lead the country had “not changed”, Ms Leavitt added, saying his assessment “was based on realities on the ground”.

She said Mr Trump was “committed to hopefully seeing elections in Venezuela one day” but did not give an indication of a timeframe.

Ms Rodriguez must tread carefully. She will need to appease Mr Trump and US demands while also retaining the support of the hardline anti-imperialist factions in the Venezuelan government.

On Thursday, US forces seized a sixth oil tanker in a pre-dawn raid, according to the US Southern Command.

Marines and sailors launched from the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier in the Caribbean and apprehended the vessel called Veronica.

“The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,” US Southern Command said in a post on social media.

The move could raise tensions with Russia, which has been moving to protect dark-fleet tankers in recent weeks.

President Donald Trump started his second term with his sights set on Greenland.

When Trump first proposed buying the Arctic nation during his first administration, it was treated like a joke. But in a subsequent phone call with Denmark's prime minister, who controls the autonomous territory's foreign policy, the president doubled down on his efforts to seize power. In the “aggressive and confrontational” conversation, Trump threatened tariffs if he didn't get his way. In a news conference earlier that month, he also refused to rule out the use of military force. Denmark is taking him seriously: The country announced a $2 billion military expansion in the Arctic.

Though the island is not for sale, the president emphasized Greenland's importance to U.S. national security. Left unspoken: A U.S. takeover could weaken the country's mining laws and ban on private property, aiding Trump donors' plans to profit from the island's mineral deposits and build a libertarian techno-city.

Trump, who has summarized his own natural resources policy as “drill, baby, drill,” would likely approach the island's natural resources quite differently from Greenland's current government, which has opposed large extractive projects. 

In 2019, Trump's ambassador to Denmark and Greenland visited a major rare-earth mining project on the island shortly before Trump's first calls to buy the country. Opposition to the mine ushered liberal political party Inuit Ataqatigiit into power two years later, which halted the mine and banned all future oil development. 

The president's renewed intention to take over Greenland has reignited debates over its sovereignty, as the country grapples with the trade-offs between economic opportunity and independence from Denmark. As the country's glaciers recede, it's also facing sweeping climate-driven transformations, threatening traditional industries like fishing and hunting and exposing valuable mineral resources.

These shifts have prompted interest from powerful players associated with Trump. Tech moguls in the front row of his inauguration, like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, are also investors in a startup aiming to mine western Greenland for materials crucial to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. 

That company, KoBold Metals, uses artificial intelligence to locate and extract rare earth minerals. Their proprietary algorithm parses government-funded geological surveys and other data to locate significant deposits. The program pinpointed southwest Greenland's rugged coastline, where the company now has a 51 percent stake in the Disko-Nuussuaq project, searching for minerals like copper.

Just two weeks before some of its investors were glad-handing at the Capitol celebrations, KoBold Metals raised $537 million in its latest funding round, bringing its valuation to almost $3 billion. Among the contributors was a leading venture capital firm founded by Marc Andreessen, an early Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has helped shape the administration's technology policies, including consulting with Trump's Department of Government Efficiency as a self-proclaimed “unpaid intern.”

“We believe in adventure,” Andreessen wrote in a lengthy 2023 manifesto that outlined his criticisms of centralized government, advocating for technologists to take control, “rebelling against the status quo, mapping uncharted territory, conquering dragons, and bringing home the spoils for our community.” Connie Chan, a general partner at his venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is listed as a KoBold director in their 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

In addition to KoBold, Andreessen has also backed other ventures eyeing the Arctic nation: He is a significant investor in Praxis Nation, a project aiming to use Greenland to establish a “crypto state,” a self-governing, experimental community built around libertarian ideals, and technology like cryptocurrency. 

The venture is also funded in part by Pronomos Capital, a venture capital group founded by the grandson of economist Milton Friedman and bankrolled by libertarian figures such as Peter Thiel, whose own family reportedly managed a uranium mine in Namibia. Pronomos aims to create private, business-friendly charter cities like Praxis, often in developing countries where investors could write their own laws and regulations. 

These “broligarchs” now have the ear of the president. Peter Thiel has been a significant supporter of Trump, throwing millions of dollars behind him throughout his political career and introducing him to current Vice President JD Vance. 

Most notably, in December, Trump announced Peter Thiel's partner Ken Howery as his Danish ambassador, making his intentions explicitly clear: “The United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on TruthSocial, his social media platform. 

Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede flatly rejected the idea, responding on Facebook, “Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom.” 

For centuries, the fight to control Greenland has revolved around its natural resources. The ice-gripped country has been part of Denmark since 1721 when a merchant-backed missionary expedition sought to spread Christianity to its Inuit population — and expand whaling and trade routes.

Greenland gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979, though the Danes continued to control its foreign relations and defense, allowing the U.S. to build and operate military bases there. In a 2008 referendum, Greenlanders voted for greater independence, allowing them to take control of their natural resources along with other state functions. 

That same year, the U.S. Geological Survey found the country had one of the world's largest potential oil and gas reserves. More recent estimates suggest that the Arctic could hold 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas. The report drew the attention of major oil companies like ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and BP, which began acquiring exploration licenses and conducting surveys around Greenland and its offshore areas.

But producing oil in such harsh conditions is difficult and expensive due to high transportation costs and infrastructure limitations. ExxonMobil, for example, withdrew its application in 2013, as a downward trend in oil prices made further development economically unfeasible. 

When Siumut, a pro-independence political party, came into power earlier that year, leader Aleqa Hammond declared the country would instead transition to mineral extraction, saying, “If we want greater autonomy from Denmark, we have to finance it ourselves. This means finding new sources of income.” In 2014, the government announced a four-year national plan to create “new income and employment opportunities in the area of mineral resources activities.” 

Because Greenland's vast mineral deposits often contain uranium, however, the burgeoning mining industry quickly came into conflict with Denmark's strict policy against extracting radioactive materials. Denmark chose not to develop nuclear energy in the 1980s, and has comparatively strict regulations around radiation protections. 

One of the measures the Siumut-led government took in 2014 was proposing a bill that would have limited public access to environmental information and decision-making processes around mineral extraction. It also lowered environmental standards for uranium mining. 

The bill failed to pass, but with Siumut's support, an international project hoping to extract uranium and rare-earth metals gained preliminary approval. The Australian-based company Greenland Minerals (now called Energy Transition Minerals) found backing from Chinese Shenghe Resources Holdings, and brought Trump's Greenland Ambassador Carla Sands to the site for a visit in July 2019. The following month, Trump announced he wanted to buy the island, comparing it to “a large real estate deal.” 

Sands, a former chiropractor and soap opera actress, now works for the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank concerned with strengthening the U.S. mineral supply chains, among other nationalist issues. 

Energy Transition Minerals' proposed mine triggered massive controversy: Concerns over the potential impact on critical fishing industries and food supplies ushered the Siumut party out of decades of power in 2021. “There is an ongoing, generational dialectic,” says Barry Zellen, a senior fellow of Arctic Security at the Institute of the North, between pro-development and pro-subsistence movements “that tends to swing pendularly.” 

As the more left-leaning Inuit Ataqatigiit party took over, they quickly passed a law reinstating limits around uranium that revoked Energy Transition Minerals' permits and banned all future oil and gas exploration. 

“The price of oil extraction is too high,” the party wrote in a statement at the time. “This is based upon economic calculations, but considerations of the impact on climate and the environment also play a central role in the decision.”

These kinds of environmental protections are exactly what Trump aims to remove from American mining. On his own first day in office, one of Trump's many executive orders directed government officials to remove “undue burdens” on the industry, so that the U.S. could become “the leading producer and processor of nonfuel minerals, including rare earth minerals.”

The push for control of the Arctic country comes as deep-pocketed investors like Andreessen have been drawn to startups hoping to build experimental enclaves, sold by the promise of freedom from the constraints of government. 

Proposals for these cryptostates have sprung up in Honduras, Nigeria, the Marshall Islands, and Panama, the latter of which Trump has also recently proposed taking over by military force. While each concept looks a little different, often the sales pitch includes replacing taxes and regulations with cryptocurrency and blockchain. 

For Praxis, these utopian dreams have led to Greenland, which is often incorrectly imagined as an unpopulated frontier. “I went to Greenland to try to buy it,” Praxis founder Dryden Brown posted on X in November, noting he first became interested in the island “when Trump offered to buy it in 2019.” Once in Nuuk, he learned that the country has long sought independence from Denmark and that many Greenlanders support sovereignty, though the country remains reliant on Denmark for financial support. It currently receives $500 million a year in Danish subsidies that account for 20 percent of the economy. 

“They do not want to be ‘bought,'” Brown belatedly discovered, concluding, “There is an obvious opportunity here.” He proposed taxes from an independently-run city like Praxis could help replace Danish subsidies. 

Greenland, however, does not allow private property, an arrangement that historically has given communities a stronger voice in determining how or if its natural resources are developed — and could prove a problem for Brown's planned utopia. But perhaps that could change under a new government.

On Monday, in response to a post referencing “Trump's projects related to Greenland,” Praxis official X account —whose bio reads “We're meant for more” below a version of the endeavor's hallucinogenic flag — boasted about “A new post-state in the far North.” 

The startup “nation” has raised $525 million, though Brown, who dropped out of New York University and was fired from his last hedge fund job, hasn't shared many specifics on Praxis' website about his proposal for Greenland. (His previous efforts to build a city somewhere in the Mediterranean have also so far remained vague, beyond a branding guide that focused on “traditional, European/Western beauty standards” and recruiting tech employees with “hot girls.”) 

But other tech tycoons' plans for the island are more concrete. 

Greenland is warming at a much faster rate than the rest of the planet, causing its glaciers to precipitously retreat. As the ice recedes, these valuable deposits are becoming more accessible. A 2023 European Commission survey revealed that Greenland has 25 out of 34 minerals classified as critical raw materials, or resources that are essential to the green energy transition but have a high risk of disrupted supply chains. The country boasts some of the world's largest deposits of nickel and cobalt, and collectively, its mineral reserves almost equal those of the U.S.

This wealth of resources has drawn the attention of companies like KoBold Metals, whose Silicon Valley backers have a vested interest in supplying materials for the tech industry.

KoBold has positioned itself as providing critical solutions for climate change, facilitating a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by supplying the materials needed for batteries and other renewable technologies. The company hailed President Biden's use of the Defense Production Act to encourage mining in 2022, along with the Inflation Reduction Act's measures to subsidize international mining for rare earth minerals. 

In Greenland, KoBold Metals' exploration licenses focus on searching for nickel, copper, cobalt, and platinum-group minerals — materials important for green energy, but also for data centers' rapid growth. 

KoBold's primary development so far has been developing a copper mine in Zambia, the largest such find in a century. Copper is used as a key material in the construction of data centers, and is crucial for artificial intelligence's infrastructure. The AI boom is expected to nearly double the demand for copper by 2050. “We invested in KoBold,” OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said, to “find new deposits.”

Their Zambia venture, too, has been part of a global power struggle, as the Biden administration backed the development of a railway to transport metals from the region to a port in Angola. The initiative was part of a broader U.S. effort to counter China's growing presence in Africa, offering investments as an alternative to its Belt and Road Initiative, a trade and infrastructure package. 

KoBold's top executive, however, likes to focus on lithium. The growth [of lithium demand] is sort of staggering,” KoBold CEO Kurt House said in a 2023 presentation at Stanford. “It's like a 30x increase in global production that you need.” One of the places the U.S. might turn to for this critical mineral is Greenland, where promising deposits were recently discovered. 

“Everyone wants to have lithium” for its role in creating batteries, says Majken D. Poulsen, a geologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. She explains the first exploration for lithium in Greenland was just conducted last summer in collaboration with the U.S. State Department. Under Biden, the agency also helped the country draft a mining investment law, aimed at encouraging investment in Greenland.

Though quite different in tone, Trump's Greenland bluster shares similar goals. Charlie Byrd, an investment manager at global assets management firm Cordiant Capital, is one of many investors now hoping the president's gambit will result in policy changes that are more favorable to foreign investment. “There is no doubt that that would lead to bigger institutional involvement and more strategic investment,” he told trade publication Institutional Investor this week.

Much of this interest is driven by tensions with China, which currently accounts for around 70 percent of global rare earth mining and 90 percent of its processing. This gives the Asian powerhouse enormous leverage over global tech supply chains. 

Control over the minerals that power technology has become a major form of soft power, pulling invisible strings in global markets and shaping alliances. That makes mining regulations in Greenland a geopolitical chess move. 

Today, “regulations from the government of Greenland are quite high,” the Geological Survey's Poulsen explains. “They have really strict regulations,” she says, including both environmental and social considerations, like “local benefits such as taxes, local workforce, local companies, [and] education.” 

Michael Waltz, Trump's incoming national security adviser, appeared to confirm that gaining access to the country's minerals was driving Trump's interest. “This is about critical minerals, this is about natural resources,” he told Fox News.

Glaciers loomed through Trump Force One's cockpit window as Greenland's coast unspooled behind a bobblehead of the 47th president, his plastic bouffant bobbing in the turbulence. Dropping through the sharp, thin air, the plane delivered Donald Trump Jr. to the island's capital of Nuuk in early January with his father's message: We intend to take over.

The tour de force — which included bribing people to participate in photo shoots — failed to win over many Greenlanders, says Inuuteq Kriegel, a Nuuk resident. “We don't want to be Americans. We don't want to be Danish. We're Greenlanders,” he said.

A week after Trump Jr.'s trip, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) introduced the Make Greenland Great Again Act, instructing Congress to support Trump's negotiations with Denmark to acquire Greenland immediately. (Ogles is currently the subject of an FBI probe around his campaign finance filings and last week announced an amendment that would allow Trump to run for a third term.) 

“It might sound crazy, and one might ask, ‘Why would you want Greenland?'” Ogles said in a recent video. He was speaking with Kuno Fencker, a member of Greenland's parliament representing the Siumut party, who had traveled to Washington, D.C. “Your security interest is our security interest,” Ogles told Fencker. “Our ability to make best use of your minerals, your resources, and your riches — to benefit your people and ours — is in our best interest.”

Fencker, who says taxes and royalties from the island's minerals and fossil fuels could pave the way for the island's independence, responded, “We have other vast resources, like oil and gas, but that has been stopped by the current government. But my personal view is that we have to utilize those resources.” 

Fencker's U.S. trip ignited local controversy. Typically, Greenland's international negotiations require coordination and approval from Denmark; imagine someone like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) single-handedly deciding to negotiate with the European Union without Congressional approval. Fencker's party said he was not authorized to discuss Greenland's foreign affairs, while Fencker defended his travel as a private mission at his own expense.

The rogue nature of recent developments has been reinforced by bombastic press coverage. In Greenland, Kriegel says foreign reporters “often talk to the loud people — and often the same people — and they can generalize a whole population by speaking to only a few.” His own social networks are deeply uncomfortable with Trump's attempts to purchase the country. 

Trump and his tech donors' eagerness to seize Greenland, existing culture and laws be damned, are “representative of a particular colonial and extractive worldview,” wrote Anne Merrild Hansen, professor of social science and arctic oil and gas studies at the University of Greenland. The approach treats land and resources as commodities to be claimed, regardless of the rights or interests of the people who live there. 

All the unwelcome commotion, however, has succeeded in delivering one change: Kriegel says the country is now unified in wanting to find a path to independence from Denmark, even if there's not yet agreement on how to do so. 

“You can't put a name on land,” he says. “Land belongs to the people. It's a part of us, and we're part of it.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

American Historical Association members are undaunted by the veto: “We educate. We organize. We have to keep fighting.”

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

When members of the American Historical Association (AHA) gathered in Chicago for their annual conference from January 8-11, 2026, many hoped the professional society would condemn the undermining of education and historical research in the United States and abroad. While the majority of members who attended the conference's business meeting on January 10 voted in favor of two resolutions denouncing the destruction of education infrastructure in Gaza and attacks on core principles of education in the United States, respectively, the wins were short-lived. On January 11, the association's leadership announced that it had voted not to approve the two resolutions.

“This is a really egregious violation of both the AHA's principles and mission, but also the democratic vote,” AHA member Mezna Qato, a historian of Palestine at the University of Cambridge and a member of the Palestinian Historians Group (PHG), told Truthout. The success of the two resolutions at the January meeting was the result of months of organizing spearheaded by groups within the larger association, including PHG, Historians for Peace and Democracy (HPAD), and Historians for Palestine.

Qato told Truthout that a growing number of academics have been spurred to action as they witness escalating attacks against their profession and on-campus Palestine solidarity movements. “Part of it is about bringing your historical profession in alignment with your moral and civic and political values and doing so in a way that supports and advances other struggles within the AHA, including a defense of academic freedom, freedom of speech, [and] the profession itself against the vagaries of this rising authoritarian turn in the U.S.,” she told Truthout.

“This is a really egregious violation of both the AHA's principles and mission, but also the democratic vote.”

Members who put forward the resolutions see the AHA as a powerful space within which to organize. Chartered by congress in 1889, it is the oldest professional association of historians in the United States. It is also the largest such association in the world, with over 10,000 members who research various regions and eras at institutions worldwide.

This year's conference in Chicago featured panels on academic freedom, immigration, and teaching Palestine and the Middle East, which drew connections to contemporary threats to the field and attacks on vulnerable communities. The meeting followed weeks of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the host city, which disrupted learning for hundreds of students. (Now, the attacks have mostly moved on to Minneapolis, where many schools have begun offering online learning in an effort to protect students and families from harassment or abduction.)

Members who voted on the “Resolution Opposing Attacks on Core Principles of Education” at January's AHA meeting said doing so felt particularly urgent in the face of those attacks. “The Trump administration has been so brutal, so unscrupulous, and so quick in mounting an attack on education and its core principles of fairness, transparency, truth,” AHA member Ellen Schrecker, a professor emerita of American history at Yeshiva University and HPAD member, told Truthout. “The whole sector, from Harvard's president down to daycare providers, are under assault.”

Guiding principles call for the association to take a public stance “when public or private authorities, in the United States or elsewhere, threaten the preservation of or free access to historical sources.”

The resolution calls on the association to condemn “ongoing attacks on academic freedom, free speech, faculty governance, and equity from government officials, including the president of the United States, [which] are irreparably damaging education.” It also calls on the AHA to condemn justifications for attacks on education rooted in “weaponize[d] allegations of antisemitism and racism.” That phrasing points to the way that lawmakers and special interest groups have seized on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, as well as expressions of solidarity with Palestine, to target, investigate, and attack institutions, educators, and students.

The second resolution heard at this year's meeting was a “Resolution in Solidarity with Gaza.” It recognized scholasticide in the enclave and called for “support[ing] efforts to ensure the current survival, and future rebuilding, of Palestinian higher education.” AHA member Stacy Fahrenthold, a historian of the modern Middle East at the University of California, Davis, told Truthout that supporting the future of Palestinian educational institutions is not only a moral issue but also a matter of professional importance to her field.

“If professors aren't free to do research in Palestinian history, if the archives are burned, the colleges razed to the ground, the schools destroyed, and the professoriate targeted, assassinated, and killed, the AHA's own slogan about being an advocate for the promotion of historical studies becomes an empty phrase unless we can do the most basic speech act of standing up and speaking out about these atrocities,” Fahrenthold told Truthout.

Votes on the two resolutions came after leadership vetoed a similar “Resolution to Oppose Scholasticide in Gaza” last year, even though members had voted to pass it at the annual meeting. Initially, the AHA Council also refused to add this year's resolutions to the meeting agenda. The resolutions were eventually voted on and passed during the January 10 meeting — but only after more than two-thirds of the members in attendance voted to suspend the meeting rules to allow for their introduction.

The January 11 statement announcing the AHA Council's decision not to approve the resolutions claimed both fell “outside the scope of [its] chartered mission” and that approving them “would present institutional risk.” Barbara Weinstein, a professor of history at New York University who served as AHA president in 2007 and on the council from 2006 to 2008, told Truthout that when the AHA leadership references risk, she suspects it is chiefly concerned about “blowback from the Trump administration.”

The decision tracks with a wider trend among professional societies and unions of educators of suppressing members who speak out against genocide in Gaza, as well as their efforts to distance their associations from that violence through divestment or other actions. Many have been accused of complying in advance with an increasingly authoritarian Trump administration.

“The people in the executive council are going along defending the status quo when it is indefensible. So, what do we do? We educate. We organize. We demonstrate, we demonstrate some more. We have to keep fighting.”

Under previous administrations, AHA has passed resolutions or issued statements condemning conflicts that were led or backed by the U.S., and the destruction of educational infrastructure. In 2007, it passed a resolution urging its members to oppose the war on Iraq. It also issued a statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The statements seem to align with guiding principles that AHA published in 2017, which call for the association to take a public stance “when public or private authorities, in the United States or elsewhere, threaten the preservation of or free access to historical sources.”

A January 15 statement from PHG also rejects the council's reasoning for blocking the resolutions and suggests that the decision undermines the association's mission. “These vetoes are an abandonment of the AHA's democratic principles and a dereliction of the AHA's duty to defend academic freedom. With these vetoes, the AHA Council has silenced Palestinian scholars and colleagues, placed historians of Palestine at greater professional and personal risk, and fed rising authoritarianism at home and abroad,” the statement reads.

Despite setbacks, Qato told Truthout she believes many members remain committed to mobilizing within the confines of the professional association, whether through future resolutions or other interventions. “The incredible work that's been done that's crystallized a broad-based opposition to Israeli and U.S. genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, that work needs to move forward,” Qato told Truthout. “The space at AHA, and the extraordinary capacity building that it has allowed for, and the conversations that have brought so many of us together — we're not going to rescind that space.”

Schrecker, who at 87 years old has been engaged in the anti-war struggle and the fight for academic freedom longer than most, told Truthout she is confident that the movement will gain ground as she and her colleagues continue their organizing work.

“The people in the executive council are going along defending the status quo when it is indefensible,” she said. “So, what do we do? We educate. We organize. We demonstrate, we demonstrate some more. We have to keep fighting.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

I'm in good company. Millions of people wake up with stiffness—you don't even have to be old to experience stiff joints and muscles in the morning. Add in medical considerations such as arthritis, and morning stiffness can be profound.

Stiffness doesn't always get all the credit it deserves for being a troublemaker, but it is unfortunately excellent at limiting our safety and independence in functional tasks and self-care activities, and can also put us at risk of muscular sprains and strains or outright falls that can cause severe injuries.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 The Massive Costs of Gutting USAID

 Alice Hill and Lindsey Doyle

Climate change is an expensive problem. According to the insurance and risk management firm Aon, economic losses from natural disasters worldwide amounted to $313 billion in 2022 and $380 billion in 2023. The World Bank reported in 2019 that in low-income and middle-income countries, weather-related service disruptions and poor maintenance of infrastructure cost households and businesses between $390 billion and $647 billion a year. As global average temperatures continue to rise, the financial services company S&P Global estimates that annual losses from physical climate risks, including extreme weather and sea-level rise, could reach 3.2 to 5.1 percent of world GDP by 2050.

Investment in early warning systems, infrastructure improvements, alternative water storage, and drought-tolerant crops can lessen the pain. The Global Commission on Adaptation, an initiative started by two international policy organizations, has found that every dollar invested in such climate-resilience measures yields between $2 and $10 in avoided losses and economic gains. The World Resources Institute, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, puts the median yield even higher: a 2025 study of climate-resilience projects in 12 countries around the world found over $10 in benefits for every dollar invested over a ten-year period.

And when the United States invests in climate resilience abroad, it generates benefits at home. For years, Washington has funded such programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, making modest investments to mitigate the effects of overseas disasters. This aid has helped keep important supply chains intact and valuable markets open, reduce migration pressures, and prevent China from gaining more ground in developing countries, effectively serving as an inexpensive insurance policy for American prosperity, security, and influence.

The Trump administration has slashed these foreign assistance programs in the name of reducing costs. It cut over 80 percent of USAID's 6,200-plus grants and contracts, including almost 100 percent of those that have something to do with climate. But Washington's retreat from international climate-resilience efforts is a false economy. Any initial savings could quickly be erased as disasters worsened by climate change drive price increases, displace people who may show up at U.S. borders, create conditions that criminal and extremist groups exploit, and enable China to expand its footprint—turning a supposed budget cut into a costly mistake.

For decades, American leaders have recognized that investments in international development pay for themselves. In 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for a dramatic increase in spending for foreign assistance to help address local problems before they become crises that would demand U.S. military action. In 2013, Jim Mattis, at the time the general in charge of U.S. Central Command, made the case for international engagement in blunter terms, opining that if the State Department were not funded fully, the U.S. Defense Department would ultimately “need to buy more ammunition.” The 2021 National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change further underscored the point that climate change creates problems for Washington in the form of geopolitical tensions and instability abroad.

Modest outlays for climate-resilience projects are all the more important as continued greenhouse gas emissions make weather increasingly erratic. According to the Global Commission on Adaptation, just 24 hours of advance warning of a hazardous event can reduce damages by almost 30 percent. An investment of $800 million in early warning systems would avoid $3 billion to $16 billion in losses every year, a double-digit return, in addition to the lives saved. And according to the International Federation of the Red Cross, climate-resilient development could reduce the number of people needing humanitarian assistance because of weather disasters from 100 million in 2019 to 68 million by 2030 and just ten million by 2050.

Under prior administrations, U.S. agencies invested in climate risk reduction programs. In Malawi, for instance, USAID and NASA worked with the central government, as well as regional and local institutions, between 2019 and 2021 to strengthen an early warning system for floods. The U.S. agencies helped integrate satellite data into an existing UN-supported system that used sensors to monitor river levels upstream of flood-prone areas. After the updates, what had once provided only a few hours' notice of a flood gave up to two weeks' advance warning. When Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe struck in 2022, local authorities were able to send text-message alerts to vulnerable communities three to four days in advance. According to the Malawian government, the early preparations enabled by those warnings prevented $40 million in losses. The American taxpayer supplied less than $100,000 for the technology transfer to set up this system and less than $1 million a year to operate a regional hub staffed by local hydrometeorologists.



A similar effort in Central America also yielded large payoffs. After Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 storm, killed 10,000 people in 1998 in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, USAID, NASA, and other government agencies helped create a regional flood monitoring network. NASA provided real-time monitoring of floods and forecasting of floodwater movement within 24 hours of rainfall. Hydroelectric dam operators in Honduras used this information to manage the release of dammed water to prevent flooding downstream. When Hurricanes Eta and Iota—both Category 4 storms—hit in 2020, the system was credited with a dramatic reduction in loss of life. The Red Cross was also able to use the flood information to inform rescue efforts in places where the organization had no previous experience, and fatalities across Central America totaled fewer than 250.

Early warning systems are particularly vital in places where disasters have become routine. In Bangladesh, where much of the land sits barely above sea level and is covered with a lattice of rivers, climate change has made flooding more frequent and intense. The U.S. government invested in early warning systems designed to help local authorities incorporate satellite data into their forecasting systems, and in 2022, USAID and NASA provided timely and location-specific weather advisories to 250,000 farmers across the country. Those advisories can determine whether a family harvests a crop before disaster strikes or loses it to rising waters. A 2023 USAID study estimated that the agency's climate information saved these Bangladeshi farmers an average of $467 each, a significant amount in a country where the average annual income is below $3,000.

International climate assistance delivers the most immediate benefit in lives saved and economic losses avoided in the countries where disasters occur, but the United States saves money, too. For one, investments in climate resilience reduce demand for humanitarian aid. In President Donald Trump's second term, the United States has continued to pledge disaster aid, albeit at a much lower level than before. After the Category 5 storm Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba, and Haiti, for example, Washington announced millions in direct aid to the countries affected. In December 2025, the administration also announced a $2 billion pledge for delivery of humanitarian assistance through the UN. If the United States were to resume its investments in disaster risk reduction, it could keep future such bills as low as possible.

International climate-resilience efforts offer secondary savings for the United States, too. These programs help keep farmers who lose their harvest because of climate change from switching to illicit crops such as coca, which can end up in drugs destined for the U.S. market. They also help people preserve their livelihoods, making it less likely they will have to leave home after a disaster and try to migrate to other countries, including the United States.

In Central America, droughts, storms, and extreme heat—all exacerbated by climate change—have eroded rural livelihoods and pushed families to leave the region. A 2023 study in Scientific Reports found that droughts during the growing seasons in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras between 2012 and 2018 coincided with a 71 percent rise in emigration to the United States. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, extreme heat was a particularly strong predictor of migration for Salvadoran farm families, and households lacking access to credit were three times more likely to migrate under these drought and heat conditions.

Investment in climate-resilient agriculture reduces these pressures. Through Feed the Future, a bipartisan initiative to fight global hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that operated from 2010 to 2025 across 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, USAID supported the adoption of drought- and disease-tolerant crops, efficient irrigation, and animal and plant disease prevention. In Honduras, USAID worked to address coffee rust—a plant disease exacerbated by warmer, wetter weather that can cause crop loss, which in turn can motivate a farmer to migrate—and helped 16,000 farm families and agribusinesses adopt technologies to increase harvests in 2021. That same year, in Guatemala, USAID created 30,000 jobs across the food value chain, generated $76 million in agricultural sales, and drove an additional $10 million in public and private financing into its projects. Across all its programs, Feed the Future helped 34 million people in 2024 alone improve agricultural practices, access financing, and reduce their farms' climate risk, giving them less reason to leave home in search of better conditions.



Other Feed the Future projects benefited the United States in various ways. In 2021, for instance, USAID worked with the Department of Agriculture to stop the transmission of African swine fever, a highly contagious disease whose geographic spread is increasing with rising temperatures, among pigs in Hispaniola. Those efforts were pivotal in preventing transmission to pigs in the United States, where the outbreak threatened the multibillion-dollar domestic pork industry. Working with American companies, USAID also helped ensure that, even as climate change affects their crops, farmers abroad can continue to supply Americans with foods that cannot be grown in the United States, such as coffee, avocados, certain spices, cocoa, vanilla, and tropical fruits.

Many sub-Saharan countries are suffering major agricultural losses caused by climate change, making international trade in staples such as maize, wheat, and rice more volatile. In 2023, USAID and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation worked with more than 80 African seed companies to distribute drought-resistant seeds to seven million farming families cultivating 20 million acres. The seeds boosted crop yields by an average 25 percent, cut food costs for about 44 million people, and added around $1.5 billion to the African continent's GDP in one year. Farmers who also adopted climate-resilient techniques such as precision irrigation and cover crops saw their incomes rise by more than 20 percent. This kind of protection for agricultural markets can reduce food price shocks, which can lead to political unrest, food insecurity, and ultimately migration.

Foreign assistance in climate resilience also helps reduce opportunities for terrorist organizations and other criminal elements to recruit. Armed insurgents find it easier to enlist new members when harvests fail and livelihoods vanish. In the Sahel, al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State (or ISIS) militants prey on communities that lose their farms to drought. Reducing the damage of extreme weather can stem extremist recruitment and criminal activities such as human trafficking. In 2021 and 2022, USAID worked with the World Food Program and ARC Replica, an insurance initiative launched by the African Union agency African Risk Capacity, to help the governments of Mali and Burkina Faso purchase drought insurance policies. When devastating droughts happened in 2022 and 2023, those policies triggered payouts of $15 million to affected farmers in Mali and $7 million in Burkina Faso, supporting more than 434,000 people. For less than $1 million out of USAID's budget each year, the program likely helped protect people in the region from criminal groups that feed on hunger and despair.

Similar preventive investments have paid dividends in the Middle East. In Basra, the economic hub of southern Iraq, years of rising temperatures and declining water quality fueled public anger and sparked violent protests, including riots in 2018 that shut down much of the city. USAID stepped in to equip the Basra Water Management Committee with data systems and training to track salinity, manage resources, and improve water distribution. The result was better access to clean water, greater agricultural productivity, and fewer local conflicts—all for less than $1 million. Resilience efforts such as this can bolster fragile states and reduce the need for humanitarian intervention. A few million dollars spent early can help the United States avoid spending hundreds of millions later when state failure may require emergency relief, a counterterrorism response, and refugee assistance.

Just because the United States has cut its climate programs does not mean all international adaptation efforts have ceased. In many cases, China has stepped in, spending the past few months positioning itself as the provider of choice for early warning systems and climate information. Across Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, Beijing is promoting solar farms, dams, and other projects under the banner of “South-South cooperation.” Such efforts are sorely needed, but when they are driven by China, they come with costs. Many of these projects include predatory lending conditions, contributing to soaring sovereign debt in developing countries and hampering long-term economic growth. With more debt to service, these countries have less money to spend on education, food subsidies, and fresh water supplies—all of which help prevent conflict.

And while Beijing's offers of climate assistance make China an indispensable partner, Washington's withdrawal makes it appear apathetic and unreliable. USAID spent more than $2 million on climate resilience in Mongolia in 2022; in March 2025, after Trump shuttered USAID, China launched a climate-resilience project in the country in cooperation with the International Federation of the Red Cross. The result is that in Mongolia, whose large copper deposits give it outsize geopolitical and economic heft, China has gained clout and the United States has lost it. Influence follows investment, and soft power tends to accrue to those offering solutions.

Slashing the United States' international climate-resilience funding and decimating the institutions that deliver it is not fiscal prudence or putting Americans first. The small savings it produces are only temporary. The costs of these cuts will resurface both at home and abroad, be they in supply chain disruptions, migratory pressures, heightened security threats, higher disaster-response bills, or reduced diplomatic options as China binds other countries more tightly into its sphere of influence. The smarter course is to invest now—in the early warning systems that save lives, the seeds that secure harvests, the insurance that cushions shocks, and the diplomatic partnerships that keep countries stable and open to U.S. global leadership.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

MEGHAN L. O'SULLIVAN is Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Jeane Kirkpatrick Professor of the Practice of International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School. Between 2005 and 2007, she served as Deputy National Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan.

 Washington Is Repeating Mistakes It Made in Iraq

 Meghan L. O'Sullivan

Venezuela is not Iraq. But much as the legacy of U.S. President George W. Bush became tied to Iraq's fate, President Donald Trump's legacy now depends in some measure on how events unfold in Venezuela. There are, of course, key differences between Washington's 2003 invasion of Iraq and the operation against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro: most obviously, Bush pursued the ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with an invading force of more than 150,000 American troops. He acted after the UN passed 16 resolutions condemning Saddam's activities, Washington assembled a coalition of 49 supporting countries, and Congress authorized the use of force. By contrast, Trump's “Operation Absolute Resolve” to extract Maduro was a surprise to everyone, including Congress, and involved some 200 Americans over the course of two and a half hours.

But the United States' painful experience in Iraq has more lessons for Venezuela than observers might think. I spent a total of nearly two years on the ground in Iraq, arriving days after Saddam fled Baghdad and staying throughout the entire occupation, and aspects of Venezuela's current situation seem familiar. Then, as now, citizens and a substantial diaspora initially appeared elated that the United States had removed a repressive dictator. Then, as now, the United States presumed that after a tyrant's removal, other elements of the state bureaucracy—including security forces necessary to maintain order—would continue to function. And then, as now, Washington believed that a lightning-quick, successful military operation would impress its allies and intimidate its adversaries, helping deliver the cooperation of regional powers without much more effort.

In the case of Iraq, these assumptions—and others—turned out to be dangerously wrong. The United States' experience there serves as a warning about how the lack of adequate preparation for the “day after” the toppling of a dictator can communicate American weakness to the world, even after a highly successful military operation. Indeed, Washington's rivals for influence in the region initially quivered in the face of overwhelming U.S. military power: Iran's Islamic regime paused its development of nuclear weapons, Libya's Muammar al-Qaddafi gave up his nuclear program, and Syria eventually ended its nearly 30-year occupation of Lebanon. Yet subsequent—and in many cases, avoidable—missteps in Iraq eventually created an overwhelming narrative of failure, complicating U.S. actions and relationships worldwide and emboldening rivals.

Considering five hard-earned lessons from Iraq could help the Trump administration deliver a better outcome in Venezuela, both for its citizens and for Americans. First, Washington must not presume that a regime will survive after its top leader is removed; it therefore must have a plan to provide law and order in case they break down. Second, it should prepare for the inevitable toxicity of the narrative that the United States is after oil alone and how that narrative can disrupt U.S. aims. Third, it must appreciate that the promotion of democracy might be needed—not out of a sense of altruism but to deliver stability. Fourth, it must be prepared to allocate resources to secure a better outcome, even if a country's resources promise great future wealth. And finally, the United States cannot assume that its power will ensure positive results without the help and support of regional actors.

Many Venezuelans are understandably thrilled that the United States removed Maduro. Many Iraqis, too, were pleased by Saddam's ouster. When I arrived in Baghdad days after he fled the city in April 2003, Iraqis evinced a cautious optimism; many were simultaneously exuberant and uncertain about what would come next. But any pro-American sentiment soured quickly in the face of the disorder and violence that followed the U.S. military operation.

Perhaps the most damaging of all the assumptions U.S. officials made was that Iraqi government ministries, including some security forces, would continue to effectively operate. Even weeks into the invasion, code-named Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Bush administration had no intention of occupying the country. The United States' experience in Afghanistan, just a year and a half earlier, had created expectations for a swift and limited involvement: after the United States entered that country to topple the Taliban regime, a domestic and regional consensus quickly formed that Hamid Karzai would be the country's most appropriate first post-Taliban leader. Karzai was sworn in as chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority 40 days after Kabul fell to the U.S. military.

Iraq once had a well-developed civil service, and U.S. leaders presumed the country would require little day-to-day governance by the United States after a suitable new leader had been identified. As the invasion got underway, there were debates in Kuwait, the operation's staging ground, about what the initial American message to the Iraqi people should be. U.S. leaders decided to emphasize that Iraqis could return to work as normal and that the American involvement would be brief and focused on securing the continuity of Iraqi institutions. When I volunteered to leave a role at the State Department to join a civilian team accompanying the military into Iraq, retired General Jay Garner, who was in charge of civilian operations, encouraged me to commit to three months on the ground, predicting that after that “we can all go home together.”

But those three months stretched to six, then nine, then 12, then 15, as Iraq's institutions collapsed after Saddam's removal and a quick handover became impossible. Decades of poverty, sanctions, and political repression had left the Iraqi population deeply traumatized. And when people sensed that no one was in charge, they took to the streets—both to take revenge on hated institutions and to secure whatever advantage they could in the face of uncertainty and lawlessness. The looting of government buildings and weapons depots as well as sabotage of critical oil and communications infrastructure dramatically set back the United States' plans. Some of this violence had been set up in advance: Saddam's regime had made extensive preparations for an insurgency to oppose any U.S. incursion, and after he lost power, those resistance networks were activated, forming the nucleus of an armed resistance that would plague the American military for years. Either out of a lack of ability or will, the United States initially let the chaos unfold; on April 11, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said at the Pentagon: “Stuff happens. And it's untidy. And freedom's untidy. And free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.”



The United States' Iraq experience suggests that the United States should be prepared for the possibility that the Bolivarian regime will not survive the loss of Maduro. This outcome will be likelier if the Trump administration truly moves to stop drug trafficking, oil smuggling, and illicit mining. Venezuela's armed forces are particularly reliant on the flow of money from drug trafficking and oil smuggling to ensure loyalty and to finance the lifestyles of army generals and local paramilitary groups alike. In a recent interview with the Miami-based radio station Actualidad, an opposition-affiliated retired lieutenant colonel warned that if regime officials “don't have income from narcotrafficking, black oil, or contraband, they cannot sustain an army.” The Venezuelan military is also historically anti-American and may become dissatisfied with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former deputy, if she continues cooperating with Washington as the new interim president. The current regime, in other words, might prove either unable or unwilling to sustain governance and keep the peace.

It is also far too early to be complacent about the possibility of violence and looting. Venezuela's institutions have been hollowed out after more than a quarter century of Bolivarian rule. Factor in 20 years of U.S. sanctions, chronic hyperinflation, and an estimated poverty rate of 80 percent, and it's easy to see how the removal of a leader could stoke unrest.

Given the enormous difficulty Washington faced in occupying and governing Iraq, it is understandable that the Trump administration has chosen to keep the Venezuelan regime in place. In fact, senior Trump officials have already cited the poignant lesson Iraq offers about not dismantling an authoritarian regime's institutions. Although the lesson about maintaining institutions is not wrong, implementing it is harder than it sounds. The U.S. policy of “de-Baathification” in Iraq excluded people from governance on the basis of their seniority in Saddam's Baath Party because it was difficult or impossible to determine their individual complicity in abuses. This policy should not be repeated. In practice, however, once a regime collapses, institutions are no longer robust. And they cannot be maintained or rebuilt without contending with the reality that millions who suffered under that apparatus will desire revenge, or at least accountability. I worked with one Iraqi leader whose nine brothers had been brutally killed by the Baath Party. Asking him to accept that members of the party should maintain privileged positions in society was a nonstarter; this sentiment was shared by many other Iraqis. The challenge is not deciding whether to dismantle institutions; it is figuring out how to save the parts of the regime that remain functional and necessary while responding to—and trying to defuse—a fierce drive for retribution.

The U.S. failure to address a breakdown of order in Iraq was the first crack in the perception of American invincibility. Before I left the country in June 2004, I asked dozens of Iraqis what the United States had done well and what it had done wrong. Almost all of them told me that looting and lawlessness had set the tone for a transitional period in which no entity was deemed authoritative. A few weeks after Saddam's removal, I clutched my seat while riding with an Iraqi colleague who sped over a highway divide and through an intersection, oblivious to a dangling traffic light. “When did Iraqis stop obeying traffic lights?” I asked. “The day Saddam fled,” he replied, matter-of-factly. Iraqis had followed laws out of sheer fear for so long that once Saddam was gone, all of them seemed breakable.

As Iraq became more chaotic and the United States found itself governing a country of more than 25 million people with little preparation, my Iraqi colleagues continuously lamented how terrible a supposed superpower was at providing basics such as security and electricity. Increasingly, they wondered what the Americans were doing in Iraq—why had we come? As efforts to rebuild faltered, the narrative that Washington only wanted Iraq's oil took hold, fueling a nascent insurgency and disillusioning a large majority of citizens.

This narrative proved potent despite the fact that the United States had repeatedly refrained from taking physical possession of the country's oil fields. In 1991, the United States relinquished the oil fields it had taken control of during its offensive to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi forces. In 2003, the U.S.-led occupying authorities declined to grant new contracts to foreign companies, opting to delay that process until a legitimately elected Iraqi government could make the decisions. (As a result, the first contracts to foreign companies were not awarded until 2009.) Consistent with the approach it had taken since World War II, the United States was more focused on ensuring its ability to access oil on global markets at affordable prices than on physically controlling oil.

The Trump administration's bald focus on controlling Venezuela's oil may appeal to a certain American constituency. But it will wear on the Venezuelans celebrating Maduro's ouster. As in Iraq, a sense is already emerging that the United States lacks an interest in aiding ordinary people and that its ambitions are limited to seizing Venezuela's resources. Future communications by the White House—both at home and abroad—should instead focus on the United States' desire for better governance, an objective that Venezuelans and their neighbors share. Many senior Trump administration officials, most notably Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have already emphasized this angle.

This shift must be not only rhetorical but also reflected in the administration's actions. It will discover that even if its interests are limited to oil, it will need to help Venezuelans establish a different sort of government if the sector is to flourish. It is inconceivable that Venezuela will be able to attract large-scale capital and U.S. oil companies' extended investments in the absence of more legitimate, transparent, and rule-bound governance. Similarly, even if Venezuela pursues an oil renaissance by reforming its national oil company, it will need a new regime in place to attract oil experts who fled the country after Hugo Chávez took power in 1999.

Few appreciate another reality about the United States' approach to Iraq: its persistent efforts to midwife a representative government were ultimately motivated not simply by ideology—a fixation on promoting democracy—but also by pragmatism. In early 2003, some advocates for war believed that a democratic Iraq would change the whole Middle East. But those of us on the ground became further convinced that democracy was needed for other reasons. To stabilize a fractious state with enormous oil resources, the country needed to transition to a broad-based political system. Iraq's sectarian and ideological divisions meant that no one leader or group could be entrusted to deliver prosperity to all communities; only a representative constitutional government—constructed with checks and balances and opportunities for electoral transfers of power—could convince key constituencies that they would receive their share of the country's potential wealth.

This theory, however, was easier to articulate than to operationalize. Because the United States' initial proposal for a transitional political process did not involve holding elections early enough, it was rejected by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, whom Iraqi Shiites, the country's majority sect, considered their most revered and credible leader. Later, U.S. leaders and their Iraqi partners failed to convince Iraqi's Sunni minority, Saddam's former base, to join transitional governance bodies. An insufficiently inclusive political transition provided more fodder for the insurgency.

Encouraging a more legitimate government in Venezuela does not require a U.S. occupation. In pursuing a political transition after removing a dictator, Trump's team has one huge advantage over the Bush administration: Venezuela has opposition leaders who have already mustered clear domestic and international support. In Iraq, the Bush administration had to orchestrate a costly and difficult multiyear effort to find and empower alternative Iraqi leaders. In a 2024 presidential election, by contrast, Venezuelans overwhelmingly voted for Edmundo González Urrutia, the proxy for the opposition leader María Corina Machado, whom Maduro's government had barred from running. Washington must involve one or both of these figures in an inclusive transition. That transition would ideally also include noncriminal “Chavistas”: lower-ranking military officers, intellectuals who supported the country's 1999 Bolivarian revolution, and ex-technocrats who served in government at earlier points. These people still represent the sentiments of a substantial portion of Venezuelans, especially those living in poor and rural areas.



The Trump administration seems to assume that because Venezuela is estimated to hold the largest oil reserves in the world, it will quickly generate sufficient funds to cover a political transition and infrastructural reconstruction. Trump stated this unequivocally in the press conference he held the morning after Maduro's extraction. This presumption echoes a catastrophic mistake the United States made in Iraq: U.S. leaders persistently underestimated the quantity of resources and diplomatic attention it would take to craft and support a successful political transition, not to mention jump-starting the oil industry and rebuilding infrastructure.

“We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told U.S. lawmakers at a hearing in March 2003, days after the invasion of Iraq began. He projected that the Iraqi oil industry would generate $50 billion to $100 billion in revenue over the next two to three years. The Bush administration lost credibility with both the Iraqis and the U.S. Congress when those assumptions proved patently false. Poor infrastructure, antiquated equipment, and attacks on pipelines caused Iraqi production to fall far short of what the Bush administration had anticipated. Ten months after Wolfowitz's testimony, the Congressional Budget Office noted that Iraqi oil revenue was insufficient to cover anything beyond government salaries. Three years after Saddam's ouster, Iraq's oil output was still 27 percent below prewar levels.

A peaceful political transition leading to more stability and less corruption will make U.S. companies more eager to make long-term investments in Venezuela. But no matter what, efforts to repair long-neglected oil fields and infrastructure will take time. Industry experts are in broad agreement that even presuming a smooth transfer of power, the lifting of international sanctions, and the entrenchment of a pro-investment government, boosting oil production dramatically could take a decade. The United States will need to devote resources to stabilizing Venezuela, managing its political transition, and rebuilding its oil industry, efforts that will likely require congressional appropriations. The Trump administration should therefore work more actively to invest legislators in Venezuela's success.

The Trump administration appears to believe that American power is at an apex. But more than 20 years ago, when the United States was indisputably the world's only superpower, the Bush administration overestimated its own power and erred badly by neglecting to bring other countries into decisions about Iraq's fate. It believed its power was so supreme that when its efforts to gain regional support for its invasion failed, it assumed it could deliver a positive outcome without it. Instead, Iraq's neighbors, particularly Iran and Syria, saw incentives for undermining the U.S.-led transition. And far-flung powers including China and Russia took advantage of the United States' quagmire in Iraq to advance their own interests, profiting from diminished scrutiny from Washington.

If the Trump administration does not want to find itself in the same position, it should intensify its regional and global consultations on Venezuela. Although the impulse to handle the situation unilaterally is strong, actors in the region and beyond have huge stakes in Venezuela's future. Bringing them in now will yield large payoffs later on.

In an April 2016 interview, President Barack Obama said his “worst mistake” as president was “probably failing to plan for the day after” the removal of Qaddafi in Libya. Every U.S. president should not have to grasp the same lessons anew. It is not too late for Trump to learn from Iraq so that he does not need to answer a question about Venezuela the same way at the end of his presidency.

 Or Risk Losing a Global Swing State

 Richard Fontaine and Lisa Curtis

When Donald Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, U.S.-Indian relations were stronger than almost anyone in the twentieth century could have predicted. In the first 50 years after India gained independence in 1947, New Delhi was deeply suspicious of Washington, which it saw as an imperial power not unlike those in Europe. It repeatedly criticized the United States' behavior and adopted a policy of nonalignment during the Cold War. But after the Soviet Union collapsed and the millennium turned, U.S. leaders realized that India could be an important partner in countering a rising China and a valuable market for American companies, and they worked assiduously to win over Indian officials. The courtship wasn't easy: it required repeated visits and commitments to deepening defense and technology cooperation from Democratic and Republican administrations alike, spread out over the course of 25 years, alongside outreach from increasingly like-minded Indian governments. Slowly but surely, however, India and the United States forged a tight bond, undergirded by formal military agreements and increased economic ties.

But now, all this progress is at great risk. The problems began with a fit of presidential pride and pique, when Trump craved and claimed credit for ending the brief May conflict between India and Pakistan. Islamabad leaped to support Trump's account, praising the president's “decisive diplomatic intervention” and nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize. But New Delhi—which does not accept foreign mediation in its conflict with Pakistan as a matter of principle—denied that Washington had played such a role. Trump then angered India further by hosting Pakistan's military chief, General Syed Asim Munir, in the Oval Office less than two months after Pakistani terrorists killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir and triggered the May conflict. Trump also declined to sign a trade deal with India and imposed draconian tariffs on its United States–bound exports, and in August, he called the country a “dead economy.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in turn, traveled to China—his first visit there in seven years—and appeared clasping hands with China's and Russia's leaders. This prompted Trump to conclude that the United States had “lost India.”

The relationship between India and the United States is not quite lost. Even as their leaders feud, the two governments have continued to cooperate in the background. But it is teetering badly, and if U.S. officials want to fix it, they will need to move quickly. The Trump administration will have to lower tariffs on Indian goods. It will need to back away from claims that the United States negotiated peace between India and Pakistan and stop offering to mediate their eight-decade conflict over Kashmir. These may be tough asks of Trump, who is fixated on cutting the U.S. trade deficit and becoming a Nobel laureate. But repairing the U.S.-Indian relationship is of paramount importance. India is a global swing state, one whose outlook and actions will disproportionately influence the international order. It shares U.S. concerns about Chinese power, and it wants to ensure that the Indo-Pacific democracies are strong and work together. New Delhi, in other words, remains an essential American partner. Washington will miss it if it's gone.

Indian policymakers were initially excited about Trump's second term in office. The president prioritized building relations with the world's most populous democracy during his first four years, and he seemed to appreciate India's rise. His administration elevated defense ties and stressed the positive role India could play in his Indo-Pacific strategy. Trump treated Modi to a White House dinner in 2017 at which the two spoke of their countries' deepening friendship. The leaders even forged a personal bond, appearing before 50,000 spectators at the 2019 “Howdy Modi” rally in Texas and over 100,000 spectators at the “Namaste Trump” rally in Gujarat the following year. New Delhi expected more of the same when Trump returned to the White House.

The early days of Trump's second term were indeed promising. During his first 24 hours in office, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio convened the foreign ministers of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (better known as the Quad)—which consists of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—in Washington, where they jointly committed to defending the rule of law, democratic values, and sovereignty and strengthening maritime, economic, and technology security in the Indo-Pacific. In February, Trump again hosted Modi at the White House. There, the two announced a raft of defense, technology, and trade initiatives and reaffirmed their strategic partnership—one that was, according to a joint statement, “anchored in mutual trust, shared interests, [and] goodwill.”

But within months, the bonhomie was on ice. After India and Pakistan began fighting in May, the United States worked behind the scenes to help the two states reach a cease-fire, much as it has in the past. Yet unlike earlier leaders, Trump loudly boasted about Washington's role, highlighting details of his efforts to end the fighting—including using trade threats to coerce the two sides—and pledging to work with the countries to solve their long-running territorial dispute over Kashmir. Indian leaders denied Trump's version of events, as well as a State Department declaration issued on May 10 that said India had agreed to direct talks with Pakistan on a broad array of issues. Trump, however, added the incident to the ever-lengthening list of global conflicts he asserts that he has resolved and made it the centerpiece of his campaign for the Nobel Peace Prize. He has refused to stop discussing it; The Times of India reported on November 22 that Trump had publicly mentioned his role in securing a cease-fire over 60 times, and he has brought it up multiple times since.



The Trump administration's current decisions differ substantially from how the United States has dealt with past crises involving India and Pakistan. Consider, for example, the two countries' February 2019 military standoff. In the aftermath, the first Trump administration focused on pressing the United Nations to punish the Pakistani-based terrorist group responsible for attacking India and precipitating the conflict, an effort that was greatly appreciated in India. This time around, Trump played into Pakistan's strategy of seeking third-party mediation in order to upset the status quo in Kashmir.

Trump's grandstanding is, naturally, fine by Pakistan, which won his immediate gratification by nominating him for the Nobel and thanking him for his “leadership and proactive role for peace in the region.” But it is deeply upsetting to India. Since the two countries signed the Simla Accords in 1972, after the 1971 Indian-Pakistani war, New Delhi has consistently maintained that disputes between the two countries must be handled on an exclusively bilateral basis. If Modi were to effusively praise Trump for ending the conflict, he would risk backlash not only from the political opposition but also from his own supporters. In fact, Modi does not want Trump to claim any credit for stopping the fighting.

New Delhi thus vehemently denied Trump's assertion. “The talks regarding cessation of military action were held directly between India and Pakistan under the existing channels established between both militaries,” India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said in June. “India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never.” It was a statement that seemed to sit poorly with the White House. In August, Trump rejected a proposed trade deal between the two countries and slapped 50 percent tariffs on Indian products. He and his team began loudly criticizing New Delhi's trade practices, in particular its purchases of Russian oil. New Delhi was set to host this year's Quad summit in November. But after it became clear that Trump would not attend, India postponed the gathering.

The current impasse is hardly the first crisis in U.S.-Indian relations. In 1998, Washington imposed short-lived sanctions on New Delhi after it tested nuclear weapons. In 2013, federal agents arrested the Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade on charges of visa fraud and exploitation of a domestic worker, creating huge tensions. During his first term, Trump claimed that Modi had requested U.S. mediation on Kashmir (he had not), and U.S. lawmakers threatened to sanction India for its 2018 purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems. During the Biden administration, relations were strained when the United States uncovered an Indian plot to assassinate an American Sikh activist in the streets of New York City. But it will be harder to recover from this crisis than from those incidents. Modi has taken a major domestic political hit from the current deterioration of ties, and Indian public opinion has turned against the United States. Indian social media commentary, once effusive about the Trump administration, has turned acerbic. Posts repeatedly mock and condemn the United States.

Nevertheless, there are signs of a modest thawing. New Delhi recently signed a one-year agreement to increase imports of liquefied petroleum gas from the United States. The two governments have completed a deal for India to purchase $93 million worth of Javelin antitank missile systems and precision-guided artillery and signed a nearly $1 billion contract for the maintenance of the Indian Navy's U.S.-made MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters. The annual Malabar naval exercise involving Australia, India, Japan, and the United States took place off the coast of Guam in mid-November.

But these are small steps. If Washington wants to really repair the relationship, it will have to go big. It can begin by finally concluding a trade deal that lowers the massive U.S. tariffs, even if it means accepting some protectionism in India's agriculture sector, which still employs almost 50 percent of the country's population. Fortunately, Trump has been softening his stance on tariffs as a result of increasing concerns about rising prices in the United States. The Trump administration, for example, recently cut levies on imports of 200 food items, some of which are imported from India.

The White House also needs to more clearly understand the roles that New Delhi and Islamabad play in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the context of strategic competition with Beijing. An India that is more capable of defending its border with China and is more active in the surrounding ocean can stretch Chinese resources and complicate Beijing's planning. U.S.-Indian technology cooperation can assist the United States in outcompeting China, particularly in artificial intelligence as American tech giants are pouring billions into the Indian market. And the United States and India can strengthen their diplomatic positions by taking them together, particularly within the Quad framework.



Islamabad, by contrast, has a strong and growing military and an economic relationship with Beijing that it will not sacrifice to help Washington counter Chinese power and influence. Moreover, the Pakistani economy is stagnant and lacks opportunity for United States investment and trade. (Pakistan's GDP growth rates and social indicators lag behind those of Bangladesh.) Warming U.S. relations with Islamabad could even draw New Delhi's attention away from Beijing by emboldening Pakistan to take a more aggressive stance toward India, building up its military forces along their shared border and encouraging more terrorist attacks on Indian soil. The United States can seek better counterterrorism cooperation with Islamabad against mutual threats such as the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, and the Islamic State (or ISIS-K). It can forge some new investment ties, especially in information technology to counter Beijing's growing hold on this sector. But stronger relations with Pakistan should not come at the expense of Washington's relationship with New Delhi, as they increasingly seem to be doing today.

The Trump administration should thus make clear that it does not seek to rehyphenate India and Pakistan (in other words, to put the two countries on equal footing) and that it does not seek to mediate their dispute over Kashmir. The United States can continue to play a role behind the scenes in trying to keep tensions between the two neighbors in check. But preventing another round of hostilities requires a sober approach that prioritizes quiet diplomacy aimed at reducing tensions and encouraging bilateral dialogue, not bold offers of mediation or resolution. Officials should certainly not repeat what Trump attempted in June, when the president suddenly invited Modi to visit the White House while Munir was in Washington, perhaps in hopes of staging a dramatic in-person meeting.

The Trump administration also should not conclude that just because Washington and New Delhi share concerns about China's rise, taking a tough line on India will have no consequences. New Delhi will always see China as a strategic adversary, and it will not join an axis with Beijing and Moscow. But India has handled relations with China over the last 65 years on its own. It would rather have U.S. support in matters related to Beijing, but if it views the United States as an unreliable partner, it will accommodate China on border disputes and on trade and investment. It would, in other words, shift from being a competitor to Beijing in the Indo-Pacific to being a more agreeable neighbor. Chinese officials would then toast their good luck.

Washington isn't solely to blame for its deteriorating relations with India. Some of the United States' grievances, such as New Delhi's close ties to Moscow, are legitimate. India has started reducing its imports of Russian oil, which peaked in 2025 at around two million barrels per day, but it can and should speed up the process. It can find other suppliers: before the invasion of Ukraine, after all, Russian oil amounted to less than one percent of Indian imports. Now that Trump has endorsed bipartisan legislation that would increase tariffs on India and other countries that import Russian oil, the pressure is building on New Delhi to finally halt all energy imports from Russia. Indian officials will also need to internalize the reality that the United States is a democracy and that its policies on Russian oil, tariffs, Iran, and many other issues will change between, and sometimes during, administrations.

Yet Washington cannot afford to be belligerent. And after over eight months of recriminations, it will have to be patient in regaining New Delhi's trust. Even if the two sides move quickly to patch things up, the current dustup will have lingering effects. Indian policymakers still remind their American counterparts about the dispatch of a U.S. naval detachment to the Bay of Bengal during the 1971 war. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose, especially between two countries that spent the entirety of the Cold War essentially estranged. It will likely take years to repair the damage that has already been inflicted.

But that is all the more reason to act now. The longer the current crisis lasts, the harder it will be to restore the relationship and the more likely it is that the two countries will lose an entire generation of progress. It is therefore time to right the ship.

Live Updates


            • Tensions over Greenland: A US delegation is in Copenhagen today to discuss cooperation with Denmark and Greenland. Earlier this week, leaders from Denmark and Greenland said a “fundamental disagreement” persists with the Trump administration over the future of the territory.
    


            • Venezuelan opposition leader in US: María Corina Machado will speak at the at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, today. Yesterday, she met with President Donald Trump, who is keeping Machado's Nobel Peace Prize after she presented it to him.
    


            • Meanwhile, in Minneapolis: Trump warned he might invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy US troops to Minnesota, where anti-ICE protests have grown increasingly heated.
    


            Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said today that the agency is “working” to equip immigration officers with body-worn cameras.
    


            Her comments on CNN's “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown” came in response to a video showing a federal officer asking a US citizen for her ID. McLaughlin accused the media of showing short snippets of video devoid of any context.
    


            Throughout President Donald Trump's monthslong surge of federal immigration officers, cell phone videos captured by civilians have shown officers using aggressive tactics to arrest immigrants and crack down on protesters. DHS has said these videos — including the ones showing an ICE officer fatally shooting Renee Good in Minneapolis — do not capture the moments leading up to what is recorded.
    


            The officer who shot Good used his cellphone to record their interaction. CNN previously reported that some, but not all, ICE field offices are given body-worn cameras. Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good, testified during a separate case in December that immigration agents in the Minneapolis area “cannot wear them.”
    


            When asked by CNN's Pamela Brown about ICE officers using cameras, McLaughlin said they are “of course” allowed to wear them.
    


            Asked whether all ICE officers will have body cameras, McLaughlin responded: “We are working on that with the One Big Beautiful Bill, actually.” The law signed by Trump last July gave DHS an unprecedented surge in funding to hire and equip more immigration officers.
    


            President Donald Trump forewarned leaders in Minnesota that he may intervene if protests continue amid immigration enforcement activities.
    


            “In Minnesota, the Troublemakers, Agitators, and Insurrectionists are, in many cases, highly paid professionals,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.
    


            “The Governor and Mayor don't know what to do, they have totally lost control, and our currently being rendered, USELESS!” he went on. “If, and when, I am forced to act, it will be solved, QUICKLY and EFFECTIVELY!”
    


            Trump stopped short of saying he would use the Insurrection Act to send the military into Minnesota. A day earlier, he said he would use the law if needed to “quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State.”
    


            President Donald Trump suggested he wants to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his current role rather than nominating him to become Federal Reserve chair.
    


                    “I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today. I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said today at a White House event. “Kevin has it so good … We don't want to lose him.”
                





            Hassett, a conservative economist who has advised Republicans throughout his career, has long been seen as the front-runner in Trump's deliberations for Fed chair, praised for his ability to articulate the president's sweeping policies.
    


More context: In an interview with Fox Business earlier today, Hassett weighed in on the Justice Department's investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell over testimony he gave last year on the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation to its Washington, DC, headquarters — the same interview Trump said he watched.
    


            “We at the White House, we respect the independence of the Fed. … (US Attorney) Jeanine Pirro said that she was asking questions all the way back a few months ago, and so they felt the necessity of doing it this way. I find that regrettable,” Hassett said.
    


            “Jay's a good man, I expect that there's nothing to see here — that the cost overruns are related to things like asbestos, as he says — but I sure wish they had been more transparent,” he added.
    


            It's unclear whether Hassett was referring to the federal probe itself as “regrettable,” or how the Fed handled the Justice Department's questions about the renovation.
    


            Last month, Trump hinted he may nominate Hassett to be Fed chair.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering applying new tariffs on countries that opposite his ambition of annexing Greenland.
    


            “I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” Trump said during an event focused on health care at the White House.
    


            The president made the remark as he recounted using tariffs to force other nations to cooperate on a plan to lower drug prices in the United States.
    


            Trump's push to control Greenland has prompted outrage among European nations, who fear the move could rupture longstanding transatlantic ties. Some have begun sending troops to the semiautonomous Arctic island that's currently a territory of Denmark.
    


            Representatives from Greenland and Denmark visited the White House this week for inconclusive meetings about Trump's plans.
    


            Tensions flared in Minneapolis again last night in the wake of a second shooting by a federal immigration officer in just one week, as President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act that would allow the deployment of US troops to Minnesota.

            US Sen. Chris Coons is set to lead a delegation to Copenhagen today “to highlight more than 200 years of friendship between the United States and the Kingdom of Denmark,” according to a statement from the Delaware lawmaker's office.
    


            “The trip will highlight bipartisan support for our allies in the Kingdom of Denmark and discuss how to deepen this partnership in line with our shared principles of sovereignty and self-determination, and in the face of growing challenges around the world, especially bolstering Arctic security and promoting stronger trade relations between the two countries,” the statement read.
    


            Sens. Thom Tillis and Jeanne Shaheen as well as Reps. Sarah McBride, Gregory Meeks, Madeleine Dean and Sara Jacobs are expected to be among the delegation held in Copenhagen today and tomorrow.
    


            They are scheduled to meet with “Danish and Greenlandic government and business leaders,” Coons' office said.
    


            The delegation comes as President Donald Trump has made clear his desire for the US to take over the arctic territory. The push has been criticized by lawmakers across the aisle, and 75% of Americans say they oppose the idea, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.
    


            CIA Director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas yesterday, according to a US official.
    


                    “During the meeting in Caracas, Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers,” the official said.
                





            The meeting was meant to build trust, according to the official, and reflects Ratcliffe wanting the CIA to be less risk averse.
    


            The meeting comes as President Donald Trump has asserted control over Venezuela, particularly its oil production, saying the US will effectively “run” the country following its capture of Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.
    


            Trump has shown support for Rodríguez, a longtime regime insider, over opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with the president yesterday.



Troop activity in Greenland, with several European NATO countries deploying small numbers of military personnel there this week, has no bearing on President Donald Trump's push to acquire the Danish territory, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters yesterday.
    


            “I don't think troops in Europe impact the president's decision making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,” Leavitt said, underscoring the president's position.
    


            The comments come following Wednesday's meeting between Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Leavitt described that meeting as “productive.”
    


            The two delegations “agreed to really establish a working group of individuals who will continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland,” Leavitt said, adding that the talks would occur “every two to three weeks.”
    


            The White House also made clear that the president views acquiring Greenland as a priority for national security.
    


            Meanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of US Senators, including Senators Chris Coons, Thom Tillis, Jeanne Shaheen and Dick Durbin, is expected to meet with Danish and Greenlandic government and business leaders in Copenhagen today. The group will hold a joint press conference around 9 a.m. ET.
    


            Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado told reporters yesterday, that she had “presented” US President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal as a gift during an “extraordinary” meeting at the White House.
    


            Trump has long coveted the prize, but the committee that awards it has been clear that it cannot be shared or transferred. “A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot,” it said in a post on X. The medal is currently in the president's possession, and a White House official said Trump is keeping the medal.
    


            After her meeting with Trump, Machado told US lawmakers that the meeting with the president was “historic, not only for the future of Venezuela, but for the future of freedom in the world.”
    


            However, Trump has previously indicated he does not think Machado has enough respect within Venezuela to govern – and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that he had not changed his view.
    


            Three-quarters of Americans say they oppose the United States attempting to take control of Greenland, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, indicating that President Donald Trump's push to expand America's territory faces stiff headwinds with the public.
    


            The survey finds just 25% of Americans favor the US attempting to take control of the Danish territory. Even the president's partisans are about evenly divided, with 50% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying they support it and 50% opposed. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are deeply against the move, with 94% opposed overall, including 80% who say they strongly oppose it. About 8 in 10 independents who don't lean toward either party are also opposed.
    


            Trump said Wednesday on his social media website Truth Social that “anything less” than US control of Greenland is “unacceptable.” The message came ahead of a meeting at the White House between Danish officials, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that appeared to do little to bring the two sides any closer to an agreement.

            Minnesota's federal lawsuit against Trump administration officials primarily focuses on how the surge of federal immigration agents into Minneapolis and the fatal shooting of Renee Good have terrorized local residents.
    


            Among those affected: Members of the Minneapolis Police Department, still scarred from the summer of 2020.
    


            “For officers present during the 2020 unrest, the incident has triggered traumatic memories as the officers resume operational duties amid concerns of potential instability,” the lawsuit states. “Officers who joined the department after 2020 report similar emotional impacts, having experienced prior unrest as community members.”
    


            One police source referred to the current situation as a “mess.”
    


            “We all signed up for police work and law enforcement – going out there and helping victims and putting bad people behind bars,” the source told CNN. “But becoming mediators between the federal government and activists is not what we signed up for.”
    


            The comments reveal one aspect of how the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd more than five years ago continues to cast a long shadow over the Twin Cities and has colored the response to last week's killing of Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.
    


            Floyd's death in May 2020 set off protests and rioting in Minneapolis, shattered the public's trust in law enforcement and sparked an exodus of police officers and a sharp rise in crime.
    


            Minneapolis police staffing has recovered somewhat in recent years, and violent crimes have declined since peaking in 2021-22. But ICE's aggressive tactics under the Trump administration, including the fatal shooting of Good last week, threaten to upend that progress and pick at a particularly sensitive scab in the city.
    


            “This isn't just any city; this is Minneapolis,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national police research and policy organization. “Minneapolis, going back to 2020, became ground zero in the whole policing discussion.”
    


Whistles, then gunfire: How the deadly ICE shooting unfolded in Minneapolis



            CNN spoke to Minneapolis residents, policing experts and local officials and reviewed the state's lawsuit to better understand how the city's response has been affected by the events of 2020.
    


            In particular, the unrest nearly six years ago has had a few clear impacts: First, the police remain badly understaffed and are concerned about diverting limited resources to ICE-related issues. Second, police have focused more on de-escalation tactics, a sharp contrast from ICE. And third, activists and the public know these issues well and are better organized than elsewhere.
    


            Together, these indicate that federal immigration agents are likely to face more significant and sustained pushback in Minneapolis than elsewhere.
    


            “The city had an education in the good, the bad and the ugly of policing and was able to be a laboratory of sorts to see what's going on and how you can make reform,” said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank. “The residents themselves are probably a bit more prepared than residents in other cities for these types of events.”
    


            The federal government launched “Operation Metro Surge,” featuring about 2,000 federal agents, in the Twin Cities last month to target Somali immigrants in response to accusations of fraud by members of the community.
    


            According to the state's lawsuit, filed on Monday, the federal actions have pushed a short-staffed police force into costly overtime, diverted police resources and caused mental stress for officers.
    


            In a hearing on the lawsuit Wednesday, a judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order as Minnesota had requested. A Department of Justice attorney did not explicitly contest the claims and was given a deadline of Monday to respond to the suit.
    


            While the local police do not enforce immigration law, they have often been called on to respond to issues created by the presence and actions of federal agents.
    


            Answering all those calls is a challenge for the understaffed department. Minneapolis police once boasted over 900 sworn officers, but in the years after George Floyd's murder, the tally fell to a low of 550 officers.
    


            With an aggressive recruitment strategy, the police force grew to 600 officers last year – still a small number compared to the city's population of about 400,000. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN last year the police department relied on an “exorbitant” amount of overtime hours to cover all its shifts.
    


            Responding to these immigration-related incidents has required thousands of hours of overtime and millions in extra costs, the lawsuit states. Scheduled days off were canceled and officers worked longer shifts to cover the shortage.
    


            “These changes have impacted officers' personal lives and leave them exhausted,” the lawsuit says.
    


            The federal surge and shooting of Good has “taken a toll on the mental health” of police officers, the lawsuit states. There is “legitimate concern that the cumulative psychological impact” could lead to further attrition of staff, the suit states.
    


            Officers are feeling tapped out and believe the federal surge has negatively impacted their efforts to regain the public's trust, according to the police source. The source said he knows of several colleagues who are taking early retirement.
    


            Since the police killing of Floyd, O'Hara and Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey have tried to focus police training on de-escalation tactics and transparency – a stark contrast to federal agents' use of masks and aggressive actions.
    


            “We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation,” O'Hara said last month, according to the Associated Press. “But unfortunately that is not, that is often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city.”
    


            The criticism underscores the differences between how Minneapolis police are trained and how ICE is trained, policing experts said.
    


            “The expectation in Minneapolis is very different probably than any other city, and that's why the police chief of Minneapolis, Brian O'Hara, is probably so sensitive to how tactics are, how you identify yourself, and all of those issues,” Wexler said.
    


            Federal officials have defended the actions of federal agents as appropriate.
    


            “ICE and (Customs and Border Protection) are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”
    


            Just on Tuesday, federal agents on the streets of Minneapolis covered their faces and conducted traffic stops amid crowds of demonstrators, CNN's Ryan Young witnessed.
    


            People confronted the agents and chanted, “ICE out now! ICE out now!” Agents fired pepper balls, flash bangs and tear gas to try to disperse the crowd.
    


            “This crowd is extremely angry and it feels like this thing is sort of sitting on a powder keg right now,” Young explained.
    


            Similarly, O'Hara said he was concerned that tensions could escalate to a dangerous level, like in 2020, when the city was overtaken by riots, looting and arson.
    


            “I'm concerned that the rhetoric keeps escalating, that the tensions keep rising, that we are headed towards yet another tragedy and a potential trigger to what happened here yet again in 2020,” he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday.
    


            On Wednesday night, law enforcement and demonstrators clashed near where a federal agent shot and injured a man after he allegedly assaulted the agent. O'Hara declared the stand-off an “unlawful assembly” and directed people to go home.
    


            According to the Minnesota lawsuit, the aggressive actions of federal agents have damaged the public's trust in all law enforcement because people “confuse” ICE agents with local police.
    


            “People only see the badge,” Johnson said, meaning most people don't know the difference between local police and ICE.
    


Masked agents and public arrests: A closer look at ICE's increasingly aggressive tactics



            Minneapolis residents, though, have had a crash course since 2020 on proper police conduct, federal-local relations, consent decrees, “defund the police” and other law enforcement issues.
    


            “The people in Minneapolis have that education already,” Johnson said. “They know the telltale signs of excessive force. They know the telltale signs of when something's not quite right.”
    


            Sam Clingan, a father of two young boys, told CNN at a memorial for Good in Minneapolis that he and his kids have spoken about these issues.
    


            “Unfortunately, this isn't a new practice for us, having tough conversations about things that have happened in our city,” he said.
    


            “We have a great community here in Minneapolis and the Twin Cities in general. Lots of people who are very connected in the social justice community and who make sure they bring that perspective into their day-to-day lives and how they organize their community and step up for their community,” he said.
    


            Michelle Gross, the president of the activist group Communities United Against Police Brutality, said last week the community has stepped up to protect their neighbors.
    


            “Every day, regular Minneapolis residents devote hours to documenting ICE conduct, warning our neighbors, bringing food and other goods to neighbors who are sheltering in place, and providing other support,” she said, according to CNN affiliate KARE.
    


            “Even after this horrific violence by ICE, the community continues to go out and do what we need to do to keep our neighbors safe. There are literally hundreds of people in the streets right now as we speak driving around checking ICE and their conduct.”
    


            In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, the mayor sought to contrast the chaos created by ICE agents with the hard work of Minneapolis police.
    


            “(Local police) have kept people safe. They have done right. They have abided by the Constitution, which is a massive juxtaposition against what we've seen from some of these ICE agents,” Frey said. “They have my support.”

            Hard-right and populist leaders from across the globe have appeared in an online video endorsing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán ahead of an election that polls suggest could end his long premiership.
    


            The campaign video, published by Orbán this week, shows 11 national leaders and hard-right figureheads – including France's Marine Le Pen, Italy's Giorgia Meloni and Argentina's Javier Milei – endorsing the Hungarian leader's bid for a fifth consecutive term in office. The American actor Rob Schneider also lent his support.
    


            Orbán, who returned to power in 2010 and is Europe's longest-serving prime minister, has become a lodestar for European populists and the MAGA movement in the United States. Championing national sovereignty, traditional values and hard borders, Orbán has long railed against the European Union, without seeking to leave it.
    


            But while Orbán still commands affection abroad, he is facing a growing backlash at home. Over 16 years in office, his Fidesz party has been criticized for presiding over Hungary's democratic backsliding, economic stagnation and curbs on press freedom.
    


            Leading the charge against Orbán is Péter Magyar, a former Fidesz loyalist-turned-arch-rival. Magyar's Tisza party has led Fidesz in the polls for more than a year, campaigning mostly against what it says is government corruption, and promising to boost Hungary's economy.
    


            Facing his first credible challenger in years, Orbán has tried to paint Magyar as a political novice and seems to have called on his ideological allies to rally to his defense ahead of parliamentary elections on April 12.
    


            “Security cannot be taken for granted. It must be won,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the campaign video. “I think Victor Orbán has all those qualities. He has the tenacity, the courage, the wisdom to protect his country.”
    


            French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Orbán was responsible for “the camp of patriots, and defenders of nations and sovereign peoples,” for achieving “ever greater success in Europe.” Le Pen was convicted last year for embezzling EU funds and received a five-year ban on running for political office, which would disqualify her from the French presidential election next year. She is appealing the decision.
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she and Orbán are partners in a political project: “Together, we stand for a Europe that respects national sovereignty, (and) is proud of its cultural and religious roots.” Orbán's Central European allies – including Czech President Andrej Babiš and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki – also voiced their support.
    


            The video also included several references to Russia's war in Ukraine, with which Hungary shares a border. Orbán, who met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in November, has repeatedly obstructed EU efforts to fund Ukraine's defense. On Thursday, he said he would launch a “national petition” seeking backing for his policy of rejecting the EU's latest financial support package for Ukraine.
    


            “He is fighting for peace in Ukraine, and for peace in Europe,” Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, said in the video. “Europe needs Viktor Orbán.”
    


            No US officials featured in the video, although Schneider, the actor, said he wanted to “encourage all Hungarians to continue to move forward to protect your great culture and your amazing country” by voting for Orbán. Despite not featuring in the video, US President Donald Trump did write Orbán a letter in December wishing him “the best of luck” with his electoral campaign.
    


            During a visit to Washington in November, Orbán secured a one-year exemption from US sanctions on Russian oil. Despite having more than three years to do so, Trump – who praised Orbán as a “great leader” of a “great country” – said it had been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked.
    


            Analysts told CNN this explanation was facile. The Czech Republic, another landlocked country, stopped buying Russian oil after the invasion of Ukraine, while Hungary chose to deepen its dependence on Russia. Last year, Russia accounted for more than 90% of Hungary's crude oil imports – up from 61% pre-invasion, according to a report from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

            Protests erupted once again Thursday night in Minneapolis, fueled by outrage over federal agents' tactics in confronting Minnesotans – including US citizens. But this time, the demonstrations came under the threat of President Donald Trump invoking the Insurrection Act.
    


            Twelve people were arrested in Minneapolis, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            “Last night in Minneapolis 12 anti-ICE agitators were arrested for assaulting law enforcement,” DHS posted on X Friday morning. “Reminder: it is a federal crime and a FELONY if you lay a finger on law enforcement or destroy federal property.”
    


            Federal officers in tactical gear deployed tear gas and percussion grenades to try to disperse crowds near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building.
    


            State and local leaders have urged the community to remain calm amid unrest that escalated earlier this week after a federal agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan national who federal officials said began to resist arrest and “violently assault” one of its officers.
    


            But heated clashes could soon turn frigid as plunging temperatures and fierce winds of 30 to 40 mph blast through the Twin Cities. By Friday evening, the wind chill will plummet below zero degrees – and it's expected to stay that way until the middle of next week.
    


            From Saturday night into Sunday morning, the actual temperatures will drop below zero, with blustery winds ushering wind chills as low as -20 degrees.
    


Minnesota and Illinois invoke the 10th Amendment in lawsuits to block federal agents in their cities. Here's why that matters

            The Trump administration is exerting political pressure on Stars & Stripes, the independent military newspaper that informs US servicemembers worldwide.
    


            Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell announced Thursday that the Department of Defense will “modernize” the outlet and “refocus its content away from woke distractions that syphon morale, and adapt it to serve a new generation of service members.”
    


            Parnell's statement came as a shock to staffers at Stars & Stripes, who haven't heard directly about any changes yet, and who now fear that the news outlet's independence and credibility is at risk.
    


            The statement also drew swift criticism from several Democratic lawmakers and First Amendment advocates.
    


            “The Pentagon is trying to turn this independent newsroom into a mouthpiece for the administration's political messaging,” said Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director for PEN America. “This action tramples both the First Amendment and the congressional mandate that the publication remain editorially independent.”
    


            Congress has repeatedly affirmed and sought to protect the newspaper's unique status.
    


            Stars & Stripes is a product of the US military and is partly funded by the Pentagon, but it models itself after commercial newspapers and covers the news freely, “without news management or censorship,” as Department of Defense policy states.
    


            “By keeping its audience informed, Stars and Stripes enhances military readiness and better enables U.S. military personnel and their families stationed overseas to exercise their responsibilities of citizenship,” the newspaper's website says.
    


            Parnell, a close ally of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, described a few specific adjustments. “No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints,” he wrote.
    


            Like many papers, Stars & Stripes runs wire stories from The Associated Press and Reuters, but Pentagon officials told right-wing website The Daily Wire that “this will no longer be the case.”
    


            The Daily Wire also reported that all of the paper's content “will be written by active-duty service members,” which alarmed the civilian staff who currently write stories.
    


            Parnell described Stars & Stripes as being “custom tailored to our warfighters” going forward, prompting some journalists to say that the paper already is.
    


            With no further details about what's next, “people are obviously concerned about what this means for our ability to produce journalism going forward,” a Stripes staffer told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            Richardson, of PEN America, urged Congress to “continue to protect Stars and Stripes' editorial independence and ensure the administration allows it to serve military members free from political influence.”

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing “compelling results” in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.

The comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened that U.S. forces “will now start hitting land” in Mexico targeting drug cartels, after the dramatic United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro.

Sheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a “cool head,” has sought to placate Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. The early January raid in Venezuela set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.

On Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed “more must be done to confront shared threats.”

Sheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.

“There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,” she said.




She reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.

“The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,” she said.

Sheinbaum and Trump also spoke by phone Monday. Sheinbaum said she again told Trump that U.S. intervention in Mexico was unnecessary.

It was at a relatively minor event in upstate New York in September 2022 that Ilia Malinin, the self-anointed “Quad God” who was fast becoming the biggest name in figure skating, finally landed the jump that so many people had thought impossible.

Others had tried quad axels in competition over the years. All of them had fallen. That extra 180 degrees of rotation — necessary for the only jump in skating that starts with a forward-facing entry — proved to be a half-revolution too much.

So when Malinin landed it inside the arena made famous by the U.S. hockey team's upset of the Soviets at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, it not only sent shockwaves through the tight-knit skating community but made headlines around the world.

“My mind was just blown,” said two-time Olympic skater Jason Brown.

Yet by conquering the gravity-defying jump, Malinin also raised an important question: What comes next?

The six main jumps in figure skating have been standard since the early 1900s. The only difference between then and now is the number of revolutions. Dick Button landed the first double axel in 1948, and the first triple jump four years later. Kurt Browning landed the first quad, a toe loop, in 1988, and it was 10 years before Timothy Goebel landed the first quad salchow.

By landing the quad axel, Malinin may have maxed out the boundaries of human performance. Most sports scientists agree that the speed and amplitude necessary for five-revolution jumps truly is impossible, leaving figure skating at a crossroads, where a dearth of innovation threatens to take the shine off a sport already fighting to maintain popularity.

“I think it's kind of natural that we were going to get to this point,” said Malinin, the overwhelming favorite to win gold for the U.S. at the Milan Cortina Olympics. “But I haven't reached my top, whether it's in the technical and how much I can jump and spin, but also in the creativity.”

Malinin, 20, points to his signature “raspberry twist,” a somersaulting spin unlike anything that anybody else does. He created it himself, and it tends to bring down the house whenever he throws it down near the end of his programs.

Yet the flashy maneuver also underscores one of the inherent problems with trying to be creative: It doesn't get rewarded.

The International Skating Union has rigid requirements for both short programs and free skates, and it rarely pays off to deviate too far from the script. Malinin might not get a lot of extra points for landing his raspberry twist, for example, since it is not one of the six standard figure skating jumps, but a failure to land it could cost him dearly.

“Absolutely, there are a lot of things I've wanted to try,” Malinin told The Associated Press, “because I think it would be really cool and appealing. But it's a bigger risk for the program itself, and the system and scoring means it doesn't make sense.”

In other words, what's the point in trying to innovate?

“There are so many rules in your programs that you don't have too much wiggle room,” said Alysa Liu, the reigning world champion. “A lot of these rules really restrict us. Like, all of our spins look the same now, but they could look so different.”

“One of my training mates, Sonja Himler, does these incredible programs,” added Amber Glenn, a three-time U.S. champion, and along with Liu one of the favorites to win Olympic gold for the American team in February.

“Like, she spins the other way, jumps the other way — really cool things that, you know, someone who's watched a little bit of skating will be like, ‘Oh, I've never seen that before,'” Glenn said. “Whereas if I go and do, you know, the norm, and do it well, versus what she does, my scores will be better, even though what she does is way more impressive, in my opinion.”

Justin Dillon, the manager of high performance at U.S. Figure Skating, acknowledged having had hard conversations with some skaters about their programs. They may have planned something unique or interesting, but the risk wouldn't be worth the reward.

“I encourage individuality, and bringing it to the ice,” Dillon said, “but if they do something so avant-garde that it doesn't check those boxes, then it really doesn't serve them. It doesn't always mean throw it out, but what can we do to make it a home run?”

To its credit, figure skating's governing body has loosened some restrictions in recent years. The backflip, which was long banned in competition because of its inherent danger, is allowed now, though it also doesn't carry a whole lot of scoring weight.

Is that hold-your-breath element of risk and uncertainty the next big step in skating?

“I mean, you're cringing. It legit scares me,” Glenn said of the backflip. “If you can do it, great. I think it's so fun. I want to learn it once I'm done competing. But the thought of practicing it in like, a warmup or in training, it just scares me.”

Brown has never been able to consistently land quad jumps in competition. Instead, he relies on near-perfect execution of triple jumps, along with arguably the best artistry in figure skating, to consistently challenge for podium placements in major competitions.

Maybe, Brown mused, the next innovation in figure skating has nothing to do with extreme feats of athletic ability.

“I have so much respect for the ways in which people are pushing the sport technically,” he said, “but I think the more that people fixate on executing an element, the less risk people take artistically, because they're already taking these risks technically. And it is very hard to do both. So maybe the next step for figure skating is to reward the story we're trying to tell.”

Demonstrations over the country's ailing economy which began on December 28 soon morphed into a direct challenge to its ruling theocracy.

Iran's Permanent Representative to the UN accused the U.S. and Israel of instilling “political destabilization, internal unrest and chaos” in the nation following the recent deadly protests.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.

Harsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran's ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country's theocracy.

There have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.

Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”

Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.

Khatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump's soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”




“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”

His fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

Peskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”

Russia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria's former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year's U.S. and Israeli  attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.

Days after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had  raised concerns  with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region. 

Yet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.

“I believe the president is a man of his word,” Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that “regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“

Despite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.

Iran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”

Gholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”

Khatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government. 

He said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.

Even as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.

Amid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey's eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.

“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.

Also crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.

Mehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey. 

Although he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.

“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”

In a sign of the conflict's potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran's crackdown on protests.

A representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.

The death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.

The agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Most American presidents aspire to the kind of greatness that prompts future generations to name important things in their honor.

Donald Trump isn't leaving it to future generations. 

As the first year of his second term wraps up, his Republican administration and allies have put his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Kennedy Center performing arts venue and a new class of battleships that's yet to be built. 

That's on top of the “Trump Accounts” for tax-deferred investments, the TrumpRx government website soon to offer direct sales of prescription drugs, the “Trump Gold Card” visa that costs at least $1 million and the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a transit corridor included in a deal his administration brokered between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

On Friday, he plans to attend a ceremony in Florida where local officials will dedicate a 4-mile (6-kilometer) stretch of road from the airport to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.

It's unprecedented for a sitting president to embrace tributes of that number and scale, especially those proffered by members of his administration. And while past sitting presidents have typically been honored by local officials naming schools and roads after them, it's exceedingly rare for airports, federal buildings, warships or other government assets to be named for someone still in power.

“At no previous time in history have we consistently named things after a president who was still in office,” said Jeffrey Engel, the David Gergen Director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “One might even extend that to say a president who is still alive. Those kind of memorializations are supposed to be just that — memorials to the passing hero.”




White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said the TrumpRx website linked to the president's deals to lower the price of some prescription drugs, along with “overdue upgrades of national landmarks, lasting peace deals, and wealth-creation accounts for children are historic initiatives that would not have been possible without President Trump's bold leadership.”

“The Administration's focus isn't on smart branding, but delivering on President Trump's goal of Making America Great Again,” Huston said. 

The White House pointed out that the nation's capital was named after President George Washington and the Hoover Dam was named after President Herbert Hoover while each was serving as president. 

For Trump, it's a continuation of the way he first etched his place onto the American consciousness, becoming famous as a real estate developer who affixed his name in big gold letters on luxury buildings and hotels, a casino and assorted products like neckties, wine and steaks.

As he ran for president in 2024, the candidate rolled out Trump-branded business ventures for watches, fragrances, Bibles and sneakers — including golden high tops priced at $799. After taking office again last year, Trump's businesses launched a Trump Mobile phone company, with plans to unveil a gold-colored smartphone and a cryptocurrency memecoin named $TRUMP.

That's not to be confused with plans for a physical, government-issued Trump coin that U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach said the U.S. Mint is planning.

Trump has also reportedly told the owners of Washington's NFL team that he would like his name on the Commanders' new stadium. The team's ownership group, which has the naming rights, has not commented on the idea. But a White House spokeswoman in November called the proposed name “beautiful” and said Trump made the rebuilding of the stadium possible.

The addition of Trump's name to the Kennedy Center in December so outraged independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that he introduced legislation this week to ban the naming or renaming of any federal building or land after a sitting president — a ban that would retroactively apply to the Kennedy Center and Institute of Peace.

“I think he is a narcissist who likes to see his name up there. If he owns a hotel, that's his business,” Sanders said in an interview. “But he doesn't own federal buildings.”

Sanders likened Trump's penchant for putting his name on government buildings and more to the actions of authoritarian leaders throughout history.

“If the American people want to name buildings after a president who is deceased, that's fine. That's what we do,” Sanders said. “But to use federal buildings to enhance your own position very much sounds like the ‘Great Leader' mentality of North Korea, and that is not something that I think the American people want.”

Although some of the naming has been suggested by others, the president has made clear he's pleased with the tributes.

Three months after the announcement of the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a name the White House says was proposed by Armenian officials, the president gushed about it at a White House dinner. 

“It's such a beautiful thing, they named it after me. I really appreciate it. It's actually a big deal,” he told a group of Central Asian leaders. 

Engel, the presidential historian, said the practice can send a signal to people “that the easiest way to get access and favor from the president is to play to his ego and give him something or name something after him.”

Some of the proposals for honoring Trump include legislation in Congress from New York Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney that would designate June 14 as “Trump's Birthday and Flag Day,” placing the president with the likes of Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington and Jesus Christ, whose birthdays are recognized as national holidays.

Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube has introduced legislation that calls for the Washington-area rapid transit system, known as the Metro, to be renamed the “Trump Train.” North Carolina Republican Rep. Addison McDowell has introduced legislation to rename Washington Dulles International Airport as Donald J. Trump International Airport.

McDowell said it makes sense to give Dulles a new name since Trump has already announced plans to revamp the airport, which currently is a tribute to former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles.

The congressman said he wanted to honor Trump because he feels the president has been a champion for combating the scourge of fentanyl, a personal issue for McDowell after his brother's overdose death. But he also cited Trump's efforts to strike peace deals all over the world and called him “one of the most consequential presidents ever.” 

“I think that's somebody that deserves to be honored, whether they're still the president or whether they're not,” he said. 

More efforts are underway in Florida, Trump's adopted home.

Republican state lawmaker Meg Weinberger said she is working on an effort to rename Palm Beach International Airport as Donald J. Trump International Airport, a potential point of confusion with the Dulles effort.

The road that the president will see christened Friday is not the first Florida asphalt to herald Trump upon his return to the White House. 

In the south Florida city of Hialeah, officials in December 2024 renamed a street there as President Donald J. Trump Avenue.

Trump, speaking at a Miami business conference the next month, called it a “great honor” and said he loved the mayor for it.

“Anybody that names a boulevard after me, I like,” he said.

He added a few moments later: “A lot of people come back from Hialeah, they say, ‘They just named a road after you.' I say, ‘That's OK.' It's a beginning, right? It's a start.”

ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump would not be the first president to invoke the Insurrection Act, as he has threatened, so that he can send U.S. military forces to Minnesota. 

But he'd be the only commander in chief to use the 19th-century law to send troops to quell protests that started because of federal officers the president already has sent to the area — one of whom shot and killed a U.S. citizen. 

The law, which allows presidents to use the military domestically, has been invoked on more than two dozen occasions — but rarely since the 20th Century's Civil Rights Movement. 

Federal forces typically are called to quell widespread violence that has broken out on the local level — before Washington's involvement and when local authorities ask for help. When presidents acted without local requests, it was usually to enforce the rights of individuals who were being threatened or not protected by state and local governments. A third scenario is an outright insurrection — like the Confederacy during the Civil War. 

Experts in constitutional and military law say none of that clearly applies in Minneapolis. 

“This would be a flagrant abuse of the Insurrection Act in a way that we've never seen,” said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program. “None of the criteria have been met.”

William Banks, a Syracuse University professor emeritus who has written extensively on the domestic use of the military, said the situation is “a historical outlier” because the violence Trump wants to end “is being created by the federal civilian officers” he sent there.




But he also cautioned Minnesota officials would have “a tough argument to win” in court, because the judiciary is hesitant to challenge “because the courts are typically going to defer to the president” on his military decisions. 

Here is a look at the law, how it's been used and comparisons to Minneapolis.

George Washington signed the first version in 1792, authorizing him to mobilize state militias — National Guard forerunners — when “laws of the United States shall be opposed, or the execution thereof obstructed.” 

He and John Adams used it to quash citizen uprisings against taxes, including liquor levies and property taxes that were deemed essential to the young republic's survival.

Congress expanded the law in 1807, restating presidential authority to counter “insurrection or obstruction” of laws. Nunn said the early statutes recognized a fundamental “Anglo-American tradition against military intervention in civilian affairs” except “as a tool of last resort.”

The president argues Minnesota officials and citizens are impeding U.S. law by protesting his agenda and the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Customs and Border Protection officers. Yet early statutes also defined circumstances for the law as unrest “too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course” of law enforcement. 

There are between 2,000 and 3,000 federal authorities in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, compared to Minneapolis, which has fewer than 600 police officers. Protesters' and bystanders' video, meanwhile, has shown violence initiated by federal officers, with the interactions growing more frequent since Renee Good was shot three times and killed. 

“ICE has the legal authority to enforce federal immigration laws,” Nunn said. “But what they're doing is a sort of lawless, violent behavior” that goes beyond their legal function and “foments the situation” Trump wants to suppress. 

“They can't intentionally create a crisis, then turn around to do a crackdown,” he said, adding that the Constitutional requirement for a president to “faithfully execute the laws” means Trump must wield his power, on immigration and the Insurrection Act, “in good faith.” 

Courts have blocked some of Trump's efforts to deploy the National Guard, but he'd argue with the Insurrection Act that he does not need a state's permission to send troops. 

That traces to President Abraham Lincoln, who held in 1861 that Southern states could not legitimately secede. So, he convinced Congress to give him express power to deploy U.S. troops, without asking, into Confederate states he contended were still in the Union. Quite literally, Lincoln used the act as a legal basis to fight the Civil War. 

Nunn said situations beyond such a clear insurrection as the Confederacy still require a local request or another trigger that Congress added after the Civil War: protecting individual rights. Ulysses S. Grant used that provision to send troops to counter the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacists who ignored the 14th and 15th amendments and civil rights statutes. 

During post-war industrialization, violence erupted around strikes and expanding immigration — and governors sought help.

President Rutherford B. Hayes granted state requests during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 after striking workers, state forces and local police clashed, leading to dozens of deaths. Grover Cleveland granted a Washington state governor's request — at that time it was a U.S. territory — to help protect Chinese citizens who were being attacked by white rioters. President Woodrow Wilson sent troops to Colorado in 1914 amid a coal strike after workers were killed. 

Federal troops helped diffuse each situation. 

Banks stressed that the law then and now presumes that federal resources are needed only when state and local authorities are overwhelmed — and Minnesota leaders say their cities would be stable and safe if Trump's feds left. 

As Grant had done, mid-20th century presidents used the act to counter white supremacists. 

Franklin Roosevelt dispatched 6,000 troops to Detroit — more than double the U.S. forces in Minneapolis — after race riots that started with whites attacking Black residents. State officials asked for FDR's aid after riots escalated, in part, Nunn said, because white local law enforcement joined in violence against Black residents. Federal troops calmed the city after dozens of deaths, including 17 Black residents killed by local police. 

Once the Civil Rights Movement began, presidents sent authorities to Southern states without requests or permission, because local authorities defied U.S. civil rights law and fomented violence themselves. 

Dwight Eisenhower enforced integration at Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas; John F. Kennedy sent troops to the University of Mississippi after riots over James Meredith's admission and then pre-emptively to ensure no violence upon George Wallace's “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door” to protest the University of Alabama's integration.

 “There could have been significant loss of life from the rioters” in Mississippi, Nunn said.

Lyndon Johnson protected the 1965 Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery after Wallace's troopers attacked marchers' on their first peaceful attempt. 

Johnson also sent troops to multiple U.S. cities in 1967 and 1968 after clashes between residents and police escalated. The same thing happened in Los Angeles in 1992, the last time the Insurrection Act was invoked. 

Riots erupted after a jury failed to convict four white police officers of excessive use of force despite video showing them beating a Rodney King, a Black man. California Gov. Pete Wilson asked President George H.W. Bush for support. 

Bush authorized about 4,000 troops — but after he had publicly expressed displeasure over the trial verdict. He promised to “restore order” yet directed the Justice Department to open a civil rights investigation, and two of the L.A. officers were later convicted in federal court.

Jennifer Cruz is seen allegedly resisting arrest in Florida. She was detained after allegedly punching a trooper in the face during an immigration enforcement operation, according to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.

An anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agitator in Florida was arrested after allegedly punching a trooper in the face during an immigration enforcement operation. 

""This is Jennifer Cruz of Jacksonville,"" Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier wrote in an X post, sharing an image of the woman, who appeared to smile as law enforcement restrained her. 

Moments before she cracked a grin, video shows Cruz kicking toward a female officer while other law enforcement members had already placed her hands behind her back.

""Jennifer disagrees with immigration enforcement and decided to commit a few felonies by getting out of her car and punching a Trooper in the face. But unlike Minnesota, we don't put up with this nonsense. Not today, Jennifer,"" Uthmeier wrote.

Footage shows a chaotic scene as authorities attempted to detain Cruz.

A News4JAX reporter spoke to Juan Alvarez, the owner of the Mi Pueblo grocery store which was near where the incident occurred. He said he witnessed a traffic stop involving a state trooper. 

""ICE agents showed up with the state trooper. They detained the driver,"" he said. 

""And so yeah, they had an operation going on. And after that, they had detained another person. But it seems they got into an altercation with that person. It turned violent,"" he said, noting that more law enforcement showed up.

Renee Good's former father-in-law Tim Macklin Sr. joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her death, give an update on his grandson and react to the Minnesota protesters acting 'in her name.' 

Several Republican lawmakers are looking to talk President Donald Trump out of invoking the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis as the city sees demonstrations over the fatal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-involved shooting of Renee Nicole Good.

The Insurrection Act, which was passed in 1807, was last invoked in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots over the acquittal of LAPD officers involved in the beating of Rodney King.

If invoked, the Insurrection Act would allow Trump to deploy active-duty troops or federalized National Guard members to restore order. It would temporarily override the Posse Comitatus Act, which normally restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

There are some Republican lawmakers who are resistant to the idea of the president invoking the centuries-old law in the wake of the fatal shooting of Good. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., seemed to downplay Trump's threat, placing his hope in local law enforcement's ability to ""settle things down.""

""Hopefully the local officials working with not only the federal law enforcement, ICE and other agencies, but also the local law enforcement officials will be able to settle things down,"" Thune told reporters.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., cast doubt on whether it would be appropriate to invoke the act, according to The Hill.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala., also expressed her concerns about the move, saying that the administration needs to be ""very careful,"" The Hill reported.

DHS ARRESTS ARMED MAN WITH EXTRA AMMUNITION FOR ASSAULTING FEDERAL OFFICER AT LATE-NIGHT MINNEAPOLIS RIOT

""I have felt that since the fatal shooting [of Good] a week or so ago that we needed to be very, very careful, very cautious in how we proceed, not only in Minnesota but in other areas, to keep the conflict, the potential for conflict as it relates to ICE enforcement dialed back,"" Murkowski said, according to The Hill.

The senator from Alaska said the situation in Minneapolis was reminiscent of what happened ""during the time of George Floyd,"" referencing the wave of protests and rioting that followed Floyd's 2020 death in the same city. The protests over Floyd's death erupted in the final year of Trump's first term during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Black Lives Matter and anti-police crowds filled the streets of cities across the U.S. 

""Everything was just so tenuous and so volatile. We don't need that,"" Murkowski added, according to The Hill.

TOP HOUSE GOP LEADER DEMANDS TIM WALZ RESIGN AS MINNEAPOLIS ERUPTS OVER ICE SHOOTING

Trump issued the threat on Thursday, saying that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if the people of Minnesota continued to defy the law and attack federal agents.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great state,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Following Trump's post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called for calm and issued an appeal to the people of his state.

""Let's turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,"" the Democrat said. ""And an appeal to Minnesotans: I know this is scary. We can — we must — speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.""

In response to Walz, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, ""Tim Walz, Jacob Frey, and Democrat leaders in Minnesota have done nothing but turn up the temperature, smear heroic ICE officers, and incite violence against them — all in defense of criminal illegal aliens.""

""In Minnesota, ICE has arrested rapists, drug traffickers, domestic abusers, and more, despite Democrat opposition. The Trump Administration will protect the American people and enforce the law without apology. The only statement Tim Walz should be making is an apology. He has repeatedly compared ICE officers to Nazis and lied about their important work, including in his speech just last night,"" Jackson also said.

Fox News Digital spoke to Lake about the steps her streamlined agency took to broadcast pro-America coverage as chaos erupted in both Venezuela and Iran.

Despite President Donald Trump's past efforts to shut it down, Republicans passed a spending package that includes $643 million for the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), choosing legislative unity over a fight that could have derailed the must-pass spending bill. 

The move underscored the GOP's ongoing struggle to pursue party objectives while also crafting legislation that can unite Republicans amid razor-thin margins in the House of Representatives.

The funding goes toward radio, internet, television and broadcasting grants in the Middle East. The item passed both chambers of Congress this week as part of this year's National Security, Department of State and Related Programs Act (NSRP).

Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., one of the legislators who worked on the NSRP, said the final number came about from talks with Kari Lake, a senior advisor for the agency with close ties to the president.

""She seemed to me like we're on the same team on this,"" Alford said when asked about those conversations. ""I continue to communicate with her often and look forward to working with her as she tries to right this program and get it back to its original intent."" 

At the outset of his second term, Trump issued an executive order shuttering the USAGM, the parent organization of Voice of America, claiming that the organization had a clear bent against Republican principles and didn't serve the country's domestic interests. However, when courts ruled that the administration lacked the power needed to remove its congressionally approved funding, the agency remained in place.

Despite the continuation of its funding, Alford believes Republicans took a step toward the president's wishes, noting that the NSRP bill trims the agency's budget.

""I think the cuts that we're making, which is a 25% reduction, is a significant step forward to meeting what Kari Lake wants as well. I'm hoping that we can do even more in the 2027 appropriations bill,"" Alford said.

Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., who voted to advance the NSRP funding bill and its provision on USAGM, said he personally wants to see the funding eliminated.

""I would prefer that the federal government funds zero,"" Higgins said moments before Wednesday's vote. ""We support the president's executive actions and his executive orders, and we endeavor to codify them. We just don't have extra money to spend on things."" 

""But I'm not going to let something like that stop me from supporting the larger measure,"" he added. 

Higgins, a member of the fiscally conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Republicans must pick their battles carefully amid a razor-thin, two-seat majority in the House, following the retirement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and the sudden death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., earlier this month.

Republicans will continue to face questions about how to pursue party priorities in the coming weeks as they work through the year's remaining spending legislation. 

""We don't have the luxury of just casually opposing our own bills. It's just so tight, man. So, our goal is to pass our legislation — especially when you're faced with the alternative of a government shutdown,"" Higgins said, noting the consequences that would follow if Congress were to fail to pass spending legislation.

Currently, Republicans hold just a two-seat majority in the chamber.

When asked whether Democrats had pressed to include the USAGM funding in the NSRP package, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., did not describe the conversations but noted the package had resulted from bipartisan negotiations.

""How things get into these appropriations bills in this climate — all we do is advocate and leverage whatever we have. Some days you're the bug, some days you're the windshield,"" Quigley said.

The NSRP, having cleared both chambers of Congress, now heads to Trump's desk for his signature.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz says Iran's Islamic regime is responsible for the deaths of ‘countless' Americans and it is on an ‘illegal march' toward a nuclear weapon in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. 

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz warned Iran during an emergency meeting of the Security Council that President Donald Trump ""is a man of action"" who has ""made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter."" 

Waltz said Thursday that, ""We all have a responsibility to support the Iranian people and to put an end to the regime's neglect and oppression of the Iranian nation."" 

Iran has been plunged into turmoil amid recent anti-government protests, with the death toll from those being at least 2,677, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency told The Associated Press. 

""Colleagues, let me be clear. President Trump is a man of action, not endless talk like we see at the United Nations. He has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter. And no one should know that better than the leadership of the Iranian regime,"" Waltz added. 

Waltz's remarks came as Gholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., accused the U.S. of trying to destabilize the Islamic Republic.

""Under the hollow pretext of concern for the Iranian people and claims of support for human rights, the United States regime is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilization and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,"" Darzi said. 

Waltz dismissed the claim, telling diplomats at U.N. headquarters on Thursday that Iran's leaders are ""afraid of their own people."" 

""I would like to address the allegation put forward by the regime that these inspired protests are somehow a foreign plot to give a precursor to military action. Everyone in the world needs to know that the regime is weaker than ever before, and therefore is putting forward this lie because of the power of the Iranian people in the streets,"" Waltz said.

""They are afraid. They're afraid of their own people. Iran says it's ready for dialogue, but its actions say otherwise. This is a regime that rules through oppression, through violence, and through intimidation, and has destabilized the Middle East for decades. Well, enough is enough,"" he added. 

""The regime's dereliction of duty to its own citizens is what has put the ayatollahs in the positions they are in today with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, protesting in the streets after decades of neglect and abuse. So everyone should ask themselves, everyone sitting here today, how many people are dead?"" Waltz also said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump and his team ""have communicated to the Iranian regime that if the killing continues, there will be grave consequences.""

""And the president received a message as he revealed to all of you and the whole world yesterday, that the killing and the executions will stop. And the president understands today that 800 executions that were scheduled and supposed to take place yesterday were halted. And so the president and his team are closely monitoring this situation, and all options remain on the table for the president,"" she added.

Hawaii's Kilauea volcano sent lava up to 1,400 feet in the air Tuesday, marking its 39th eruption of the year.

Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted again this week — drawing renewed attention to Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park and fresh safety warnings. 

The Jan. 12th event marks the volcano's 40th eruptive episode since 2024, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

In a Facebook post announcing the eruption, park officials cautioned that increased interest in the activity could lead to heavy traffic and busy conditions near the park.

Officials urged visitors to plan ahead, slow down, follow posted signs — and park only in designated areas.

The current eruption inside the Halemaʻumaʻu crater can be viewed from several overlooks along Crater Rim Drive, though visibility can change quickly and weather such as fog or rain may obscure the lava, the park's website noted.

""Consider factors such as viewing experience, long waits and crowds, hiking ability and available time when selecting where to view the eruption,"" the park said.

Beyond traffic and viewing conditions, officials are also monitoring environmental impacts from the eruption.

The eruption is producing significant volcanic gas emissions, Fox Weather reported.

""Volcanic gas, which is made up of water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, can be released during eruptions and can be hazardous to areas immediately downwind of the eruption,"" Fox Weather said.

Officials advised visitors to monitor air quality conditions, as volcanic gases can be especially hazardous for children and people with respiratory conditions.

Kīlauea has been erupting episodically since late December, the USGS said.

The most eruptive episodes have lasted less than 12 hours — and they're separated by pauses that can last days or weeks.

The USGS also reported a small swarm of low-magnitude earthquakes beneath the Halemaʻumaʻu crater on Wednesday, noting that activity remains confined within the Kīlauea caldera.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Over two dozen charged in ‘massive scheme' to rig college basketball games","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/4421090/over-two-dozen-charged-scheme-rig-college-basketball-games/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:30:50 GMT","

Federal prosecutors charged 26 people in a massive college basketball point-shaving scheme Thursday, which involved numerous players and teams from NCAA Division I men's basketball.

College basketball players were bribed to throw games and enrich sports gamblers during a recent period from September 2022 to February of last year.

U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, David Metcalf, described the scheme as “massive” and an “international criminal conspiracy.”

“It enveloped the world of college basketball,” he said at a news conference in Philadelphia.

The gamblers often placed bets and then recruited players with the promise of sums in the tens of thousands if they could purposely underperform in their games. If the players properly underperformed, the gamblers would win their bets, often against the teams of the bribed players.

“For example, if a team was favored to lose by 4 points, the player would receive a bribe to underperform so that his team would lose by more than that,” Metcalf said.

Several prominent schools' teams games were involved in the scheme: Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Butler, DePaul, Duquesne, East Carolina, Florida Atlantic, Fordham, Georgetown, Kennesaw State, Kent State, La Salle, McNeese State, Nicholls State, Ohio University, St. Louis University, St. John's, SUNY Buffalo, Tulane, and Western Michigan University.

The betting scheme began with bets placed on Chinese Basketball Association games. Former Chicago Bulls player Antonio Blakeney allegedly colluded with Marvis Fairley and Shane Hennen to fix CBA games.

“The scheme proved lucrative,” Metcalf said. “Mr. Hennen, we allege, texted a confederate that the only things certain in life were ‘death, taxes, and Chinese basketball.'”

The betting scheme was then moved to the United States, and conspirators began recruiting college basketball players to participate.

“They picked these men because they were well connected in the world of college basketball,” Metcalf said. “They knew the players, many of them were players themselves, they were alumni, they were trainers, they were recruiters, they were networkers, they were people of influence, and because of that influence, they added gravitas and legitimacy to the scheme.”

NCAA President Charlie Baker was aware of the charges, and the organization had already investigated, or was investigating, almost all the teams named.

Senate Democrats believe they've uncovered a backdoor to limiting President Donald Trump's military operations abroad and conducting oversight despite limited minority power and few Republicans willing to buck the administration.

Democrats are prepared to force a flurry of votes on war powers resolutions in the coming weeks and months after one on Venezuela — despite its failure — secured last-minute concessions from the White House. Democrats are eyeing six other countries where Trump has threatened, or has already taken, military action: Iran, Colombia, Cuba, Nigeria, Mexico, and Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

“We have discovered a sensitivity and a vulnerability by using this method, and we're going to do it a whole lot more,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), an author of the Venezuela resolution.

The plans come after Trump was forced to offer assurances this week to flip two Republicans crucial to avoiding another embarrassing setback by squashing a bipartisan resolution that would have curbed further military actions in Venezuela without Congress. Such measures require floor votes, against the wishes of Republican leaders, and only need a simple majority.

“They do put some pressure on Republicans,” Kaine went on to say to the Washington Examiner. “But we also feel like the prospect of these votes causes the administration to take some important steps that he otherwise wouldn't take.”

The White House made personal commitments to sway the minds of Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Todd Young (R-IN), who days earlier voted with all Democrats and three other Republicans to advance the resolution that would have limited Trump's unilateral military capabilities following the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.

Those promises included letters from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Young and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Risch (R-ID) confirming there were no U.S. armed forces currently in the South American country and that Trump would seek congressional authority or give written notification should the situation change. Hawley cited Rubio's assurances as satisfactory, and Young said he also secured public congressional testimony from Rubio that will occur after next week's Senate recess.

“This is not a mandate on the president. It's merely an effort to kind of reset our work on war powers,” Young told the Washington Examiner. “I feel like the message was received, which is what I wanted to happen. I felt like I got some concrete and important deliverables out of it.”

But aside from Greenland, there is likely to be even less GOP appetite to buck Trump on other countries, yielding less leverage for Democrats to score measured wins through their Republican colleagues. The Venezuela vote required Vice President JD Vance to cast his eighth tiebreaker. Unlike Venezuela, Trump has only expressed threats regarding Iran, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, and Greenland. Last month, Trump struck Islamic State group targets in Nigeria.

Hawley and Young were noncommittal on forthcoming war powers measures and said they would evaluate each country on a case-by-case basis.

“I'm not interested in helping [Democrats] with their politics,” Hawley told the Washington Examiner. “I'm interested in making sure that No. 1: we protect the country. No. 2: the Constitution's followed. And listen, I support the president, and he and his team were great to work with on this.”

Democrats are bullish that a vote on Greenland could prove even more difficult for Republicans than Venezuela, given Trump's escalating rhetoric in seizing the NATO ally by military force. Officials from Greenland and Denmark met with high-level administration officials and lawmakers in Washington in recent days, including Vance and Rubio.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who voted with Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Democrats to limit Trump's authorities in Venezuela, was noncommittal on her position with a Greenland resolution but noted she's been “consistent” in recent months in her support for previous war powers resolutions on Venezuela.

“I don't even like to think about a war powers resolution with Greenland in it,” Murkowski told the Washington Examiner.

VANCE HELPS SQUASH VENEZUELA WAR POWERS PUSH IN SENATE, STAVING OFF SECOND TRUMP REBUKE

But others, such as Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), despite echoing the concerns of Collins and Murkowski about Trump's Greenland rhetoric, have downplayed the need to address it with what they characterize as unnecessary preemptive action by Congress. And another possible handicap to Democrats' success is their healthy dose of skepticism that the administration will keep the promises it has made to members of its own party.

“We are wise to be wary about commitments by these guys,” Kaine said. “But when they've made them — and they've made them publicly — all senators can monitor to see whether they actually live up to them.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

﻿It's a weird time to talk about contraceptive. Here's what the debate is missing.

Birth control in the US right now is full of contradictions.

Access to contraceptives has never been easier. Many states have passed legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe and dispense hormonal contraceptives directly to individuals, instead of requiring a doctor's prescription first. Telehealth services have helped make it easier to find different contraceptive methods in more rural parts of the country. The first over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, hit pharmacy shelves in early 2024.

Yet birth control is also facing cultural backlash. Social media platforms are awash with testimonials from people tossing aside their contraceptives in fear and sometimes anger, saying hormones are affecting their bodies or changing their personalities. Meanwhile, influencers are spreading misinformation about hormonal birth control, like that birth control causes long-term hormone disruption or causes cancer.

It's a weird time to talk about birth control. But understanding the current cultural moment requires more than just agreeing that birth control is good and that those who decry it are wrong.

Rather, it's worth interrogating where people's dissatisfactions come from, and tracing how legitimate experiences with and worries about hormonal contraceptives can lead people toward alternate (and often scientifically dubious) sources of education about their bodies.

This backlash against birth control is partially related to growing conversations around neglected issues in women's health. In the past 10 years, for example, doctors have finally started to take IUD insertion pain seriously. There's now wider recognition of how distressing symptoms of perimenopause and menopause can be, and conditions like endometriosis are finally getting the research it deserves.

Historically, “women and gender minorities are a medically underserved and medically mistreated population,” says Kate Clancy, a human reproductive ecologist and anthropologist at the University of Illinois, and the author of Period: The Real Story of Menstruation.

Many people with uteruses either have had or know someone who has had horrible experiences with health care that has diminished their trust in medicine, she says — so it makes sense that when people consider hormonal contraception and the possibility of side effects they start to question, “Is this really good for me?”

Racist and classist prejudices also shaped how doctors counseled people on birth control methods over the past 20 years. In the late 2000s, after the first hormonal IUD, Mirena, and the first hormonal implant, Implanon (which later became Nexplanon) were approved for use in the US. At that time, “the family planning community became very enamored with the high levels of effectiveness of those methods,” says Christine Dehlendorf, director of the Person-Centered Reproductive Health Program at the University of California San Francisco.

Doctors began, sometimes inappropriately, pushing these long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods on patients, or strongly objecting when people wanted to quit these methods, without listening to or trying to understand their reasoning. There was a sense that this “LARC first” strategy could protect people — especially low-income communities and communities of color — from their own undesired fertility, Dehlendorf says.

It was a demonstration of how, in the medical community, “we haven't always prioritized reproductive autonomy in the way that we should,” Dehlendorf says. And when people sense their medical providers are acting paternalistically and not prioritizing their own wants and needs, they start to distrust the medical system and begin looking elsewhere for health information. “That then leads somebody to be susceptible and vulnerable to mis- and disinformation.”

And misinformation is in no short supply. There's a swell of mostly right-leaning influencers now who have gained followings by demonizing hormonal contraceptives and promoting “natural birth control” methods like counting the days since your last period, tracking internal bodily temperature, and assessing the quality of vaginal discharge to gauge when you may or may not be fertile.

Some, like conservative podcast host Alex Clark, spread further fear and mistrust of hormonal birth control by claiming that it hurts women's fertility and turns some women bisexual, neither of which are supported by data. These attitudes are rife throughout the Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) movement — Surgeon General nominee Casey Means has called birth control pills a “disrespect of life.”

Part of why learning about natural birth control methods is so attractive is because it promises more intimate knowledge of the body that eliminates the need for “unnatural” interventions like hormonal contraception. And while people, no matter their political leanings, want to understand their bodies and how to gauge their own health, the desire to rely only on “natural” interventions for health is a huge feature of MAHA rhetoric.

For those who have tried hormonal birth control but felt blindsided by side effects that weren't adequately explained by their doctors, natural birth control might feel like a simpler path forward.

The plain truth is that many people on hormonal birth control will experience side effects. And data show that the majority of people who choose to go off the pill or take out their IUDs (not counting those who do so to get pregnant) make that choice because of those unwanted side effects. Some side effects, like mood changes, can go away by themselves over time or disappear when you change the kind of birth control you take. But for others, like changes in your bleeding or vaginal discharge, all that doctors can offer is reassurance that what you're experiencing is normal.

Hormonal contraceptives are a remarkable, life-changing tool — that often come with trade-offs that others find unacceptable.

Despite the robust body of data and evidence showing that hormonal contraceptives are safe and effective, doctors have no way of predicting whether any one person will experience any number of side effects, says Dehlendorf — a reality that exists in all of medicine and that makes the conversation around birth control and side effects tricky. Moreover, people can have very different experiences on the same hormonal birth control with different dosing, and experiences with one method can differ in different life stages, like before or after a pregnancy.

On top of all that, people's wants and needs are unique — not every person views every side effect as equally tolerable or intolerable. What one person might find to be a minor and livable side effect, another person might find a deal-breaker. Some patients come into the clinic wanting their birth control to halt their periods (having no period while on birth control is safe and not bad for you), says Bianca Allison, a teen-focused primary care pediatrician in North Carolina and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. Others really want to make sure they keep having regular periods, as reassurance that they're not pregnant.

Regardless of where your bar is, experiencing an unpleasant side effect you weren't expecting can be shocking. When Clancy started on a hormonal IUD in her 40s, which she needed as an offset for the estradiol patch she began taking for perimenopause, she spotted. In fact, “for seven months straight, I bled every single day” she says. That's not uncommon, and Clancy was lucky to have a doctor who had warned her. But a lot of people are completely taken aback by their side effects and dismissed when they express fear or concerns about these side effects, she says.

There are people who will argue to this day that you shouldn't share the potential negative risks of medication because then patients won't take it, Clancy says. “My research and the research of others indicate the absolute opposite — when you inform people, and they feel like they can actually trust you, they're actually much more likely to listen to your recommendations,” Clancy says.

Every person interviewed for this piece brought this up as a key area where doctors and other medical professionals can do a better job supporting patients, emphasizing that people want their doctors to proactively explain possible side effects, and what strategies are available to alleviate them.

When the first birth control pill was in development in the 1950s, women clamored to their doctors wanting to know how to get their hands on it. Early feminists like Margaret Sanger and Katharine McCormick argued that having control of one's fertility was a necessary component of the emancipation of women. And research suggests that's true. Access to reliable birth control has been shown to increase women's earnings, allow them greater educational attainment, and decrease their risk of falling into poverty.

And there's really no contraceptive more reliable than hormonal options. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that birth control pills are about 93 percent effective with typical use. IUDs and contraceptive implants are the most reliable reversible contraceptives with 99 percent effectiveness, while condoms and fertility awareness methods (like counting the days since your last period or measuring body temperature to approximate when you might be fertile) are just about 87 and 77 percent effective, respectively.

That said, the pitfalls of the “LARC first” approach teach us that the ultimate goal of birth control should not be only to prevent pregnancy, but to help people live the sexual and reproductive lives they want to lead, says Allison.

Just because one birth control method has lower effectiveness doesn't mean it is an inferior choice for all people. If a person really doesn't want to be on hormones because of past experiences, and feels ambivalent about the risks of pregnancy, then fertility awareness methods alone might be okay for them, she says. But if they're choosing to not be on hormones because of misinformation about long-term health effects, or if they think it'll be as effective and easy as the pill at preventing pregnancy, then that's something to talk about and maybe correct.

Some worry that politicized attitudes toward birth control will flatten people's understanding of contraceptives, and create a divide where people who trust and use hormonal contraceptives are “good” and those who don't are “bad” or vice versa, says Clancy. But the desire to learn about how different contraceptives affect the body — and to critically assess whether they're right for you — should not be partisan. And no one method to control fertility should be demonized or given absolute primacy.

Hormonal contraceptives are a remarkable, life-changing tool — that often come with trade-offs that others find unacceptable. Being clear-eyed about birth control requires us to understand that the way people assess these tradeoffs and make their decisions can be layered and individual.

If we had a society with easily available contraception, easily available education for all the pros and cons for all the different methods, and easily available abortion, we'd still have a diverse array of people picking all the different options, says Clancy. There are nuances and valid critiques to each of them, “but I 100 percent think that we should have complete unfettered access to them if we need them.”

The Insurrection Act, explained.

This story appeared in Today, Explained, a daily newsletter that helps you understand the most compelling news and stories of the day. Subscribe here.

When I hear the word “insurrection,” I still think about January 6. It's a strange twist of history — and also, probably, etymology — that this particular term is now finding new purchase in Minneapolis.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a seldom-used law some legal scholars have dubbed the country's “most dangerous,” to crack down on protesters in the city. Those protesters have blocked traffic and hounded federal agents since an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer killed Renee Good last week.

Trump has made similar threats in the past, and it's anyone's guess if he'll follow through. But even the suggestion of active-duty troops on the ground in a major US city is scary enough to justify a close look at the issue.

In today's edition, we answer the question: What is the Insurrection Act, exactly, and what will happen in Minneapolis if Trump invokes it? Plus: the MAGA media machine and microplastics.

The Insurrection Act is a centuries-old federal law that gives the president authority to deploy US troops inside the United States and use military force against Americans. Under normal circumstances, presidents can deploy troops almost anywhere they see fit, but those soldiers can't perform civilian law-enforcement tasks, like making arrests or conducting searches, inside the US. The Insurrection Act creates a temporary exception.

The act allows the president to deploy troops in four situations: when a state government requests federal help, when a federal law or court order can't be enforced through other means, and when violence deprives people of their constitutional rights or interferes with federal authority. That sounds pretty wide-ranging, and it is, but there are important limitations.

Under the act, presidents can only deploy troops to protect federal property or enforce federal law, Lindsay Cohn, a US military expert at the Naval War College, told Vox in a 2020 interview. The federal government has also historically held that the Insurrection Act can only be used when “those engaging in violence are either acting with the approval of state authorities or have, like the Klan in the 1870s, taken over effective control of the area involved,” as the Justice Department put it in a key 1964 memo.

But the law never actually defines “insurrection,” and legal scholars and organizations say that's made it ripe for abuse. In 2022, one legal expert warned Congress that the Insurrection Act gives presidents “sole discretion, in most instances” to determine when and how it's used.

In an appearance on 60 Minutes last November, Trump claimed that the Insurrection Act allowed him to send the Army or Marines into US cities without judicial oversight or review. “Do you know that I could use that immediately, and no judge can even challenge you on that?” he asked. “But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it.”

In a Thursday post on Truth Social, Trump argued that “many presidents” have invoked the Insurrection Act before. This is true; the act and related precursors have been invoked 30 times, mostly in the 1800s and early 1900s. George Washington used a precursor to the act to quash a (literal) rebellion over liquor taxes in 1794. Later presidents deployed troops to quell riots, crush frontier skirmishes, and force striking employees back to work.

In the past century, presidents have used the Insurrection Act in only two situations: to defend the civil rights of Black Americans in states that actively opposed desegregation and to respond to requests for aid from state governments. The last time it was invoked was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots that followed the acquittal of four police officers charged with beating Rodney King. The violent unrest killed 63 people, and California's governor requested federal assistance.

Trump, by contrast, has threatened to use soldiers to squash protests even over governors' objections. And last year, he used a different federal law to deploy state National Guard troops to Portland, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

The Insurrection Act lets Trump call up active-duty soldiers, not just National Guard members. And courts reviewing any deployments under the Insurrection Act would likely grant the president more latitude than they might otherwise, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

The Supreme Court ruled in December that it was illegal for Trump to use the National Guard to quash a small anti-ICE protest outside Chicago. In his opinion explaining the decision, however, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that Trump could still use the Insurrection Act to deploy regular troops. “One apparent ramification of the Court's opinion is that it could cause the President to use the U. S. military more than the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property in the United States,” he wrote.

In theory, yes. Invoking the Insurrection Act allows soldiers to function like civilian law enforcement. But the Act doesn't override the Constitution or other federal statutes governing military use of force. Soldiers called up under the Insurrection Act still can't search you without a warrant or your consent, for instance. And they're required to use force as a last resort after all other methods have failed.

It's maybe worth noting that, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, there are already more federal agents in the Twin Cities region than there are local police officers.

The Insurrection Act has never been used in immigration enforcement, and legal observers say that using the statute to deploy troops in that way would require a pretty willful misreading of the law. But Trump has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act not only to quell protests like those in Minneapolis but to secure “full operational control” of the US-Mexico border and carry out mass deportations.

Whatever Trump's ultimate goals, any invocation of the Insurrection Act would likely trigger a slew of lawsuits. Minnesota is already suing the federal government to end a surge of ICE agents in the state, arguing that it constitutes “a federal invasion” that has made Minnesota “less safe.”

Gen Z's hottest club might just be the multiplex.

It takes a lot to get people to movie theaters these days — and it might get even harder to catch blockbusters on the big screen in the near future.

Or at least that's what streaming giants like Netflix, which controversially acquired Warner Bros. Discovery in December, want you to think. The staggering $83 billion deal, which is still pending regulatory approval, all but confirmed the hastening demise of multiplexes. In discussing the merger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that, while his company plans on releasing Warner Bros. projects in theaters, he doesn't think long, exclusive theatrical runs for movies “are that consumer-friendly.”

The tech executive may have a point. While CGI-laden blockbusters like the latest Avatar sequel can still bring in more than$1 billion at the box office, going to the movies isn't what it used to be. Ticket sales have been on the decline for the past decade, and they still haven't completely recovered after falling off a cliff during the Covid-19 pandemic. (The 2023 Hollywood strikes didn't help.) With the dominance of streaming services, it seems reasonable to assume that consumers simply prefer to watch feature films from their couches, where they can look at TikTok or YouTube at the same time.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

But some recent research suggests that not everyone is avoiding the brick-and-mortar theater. Young people apparently can't get enough of this century-old pastime.

Last year, there was a 25 percent increase in theater attendance for members of Gen Z, according to the annual Strength of Theatrical Exhibition report from Cinema United, the world's largest exhibition trade association. Likewise, the number of Gen Z moviegoers who visit theaters at least six times a year rose from 31 percent in 2024 to 41 percent last year. Our youngest cohort, Gen Alpha, is even reporting higher levels of interest in going to the multiplex, according to a 2025 survey by the National Research Group. While 45 percent of millennials and 48 percent of Zoomers said they enjoy watching films on the big screen versus at home, a solid majority of Gen Alpha — 59 percent — said they favor the theatrical experience.

Amid the bleak reality of steamers swallowing up distributors, the once casual experience of moviegoing seems to have taken on some cultural gravity for young people. It's become a joke — but an apt observation — that AMC Stubs A-List program, the top-tier subscription that allows members to see up to four movies a week, has become its own cult on social media. Nicole Kidman's now-famous on-screen introduction at AMC Theatres still garners salutes and applause. Most visibly, the popular film-logging platform Letterboxd and #FilmTok, the corner of TikTok where users discuss the buzziest movies, have elevated a formerly mundane activity to a productive and even intellectual hobby. These online spaces have not only encouraged everyone to go out and see new movies but also pushed them to put on their critics hats while doing so.

“Young people like going to the movies. As we're subjected to more streaming slop, people realize that, ‘Oh, it's actually nice to go out and be part of the world.'” 

This sort of enthusiastic engagement is complicating streamer-driven narratives that at-home movie experiences are all consumers want. In our social media-dominated, AI-addled times, theaters don't just offer a refreshing dose of reality and connection but a way of combatting digital brain rot.

Alex DelVeecchio, general manager at Rutgers Cinemas on Rutgers University's campus, says young people ultimately “don't like to stay at home that much.” For an age bracket that grew up online, streaming isn't necessarily the novel or groundbreaking technology that it was when introduced to older generations.

“This really the first generation that's always had a smartphone,” DelVecchio says. “So these things that are big conveniences for us or things that we like to do — they've had it forever, so it's not really all that special to be able to stream everything at home.”

Despite suggestions from some media executives that the convenience of streaming beats going to theaters, young people have a different way of thinking about in-person experiences, especially since they came of age during pandemic lockdowns. In recent years, Gen Z has shown their willingness to splurge on live events, like concerts and sports, partially for a fear of missing out. And as theaters try to be more creative to sell tickets by offering everything from cocktails to dinner service, moviegoing has become its own sort of unique outing that consumers want to be a part of.

“They've tried to make the multiplex experience more of a luxury,” says film writer Will Tavlin, citing AMC and Regal's moves to install plush, reclining seats. “They're jacking up the prices of tickets to make it more of a special experience.”

This new, theater experience tends to include, in Talvin's words, “gimmicks,” like special-edition merchandise designed to go viral, such as the infamous Dune popcorn bucket. The ability to order food and drinks from your seat at certain theaters accounts for 38 percent of what's driving Gen Z to the movies, according to the National Research Group's 2025 Future of Film study. Couch-like seating (33 percent) is another notable draw.

The idea that once-affordable theaters now sell a premium product is controversial to some, although these increased prices track with inflation. Still, what might seem like unnecessary incentives to some movie lovers appear to be working on young people and even encouraging them to sign up for more cost-friendly loyalty programs.

There's also the fact that young people today spend six hours a day, on average, looking at their handheld screens, as more activities take place on social media. Going to a movie theater doesn't just give young people the opportunity to leave their bedrooms. It's a chance to watch something that's more engaging or more intellectually demanding than an endless TikTok stream, especially as these feeds become filled with AI simulations and brain rot content.

Of course, theater attendance for young people still includes a social media component, whether it's taking pictures of the screen or even recording full scenes to share online. Moviegoers post reviews on #FilmTok and Letterboxd as soon as they leave their screenings. In general, the sort of online fan culture that follows specific movie franchises is creeping more and more into the act of moviegoing itself. It helps that arthouse distributors, like Neon, A24, and Mubi, are finding increasing success with general audiences, courting Gen Z with Instagrammable merchandise and a savvy social-media presence. All in all, the social side of moviegoing seems to be persuading more people to become cinephiles.

In a world where streaming platforms own the most iconic movie studios — Netflix is acquiring Warner Bros., Amazon owns MGM, Disney owns 20th Century Studios — it's worth wondering what kinds of theater experiences will even be available in the future. They might be better than ever. Tavlin, for one, believes that “good movies ultimately get people back to the theater” and that young people are becoming more cognizant when they're being sold less-than-high-quality, assembly-line products from streamers.

“Young people like going to the movies,” Tavlin says. “As we're subjected to more streaming slop, people realize that, ‘Oh, it's actually nice to go out and be part of the world.'”

This year alone, Ryan Coogler's vampire flick Sinners became the highest-grossing original film in 15 years, while Japanese anime film Demon Slayer became the high-grossing international film in the United States. The horror film Weapons was a box-office hit, while the ping-pong movie Marty Supreme earned A24 its highest per-theater average (the film's box-office gross divided the numbers of theaters it plays in) when it was released over Christmas.

The Netflix-Warner Bros. deal is expected to close this summer, and it will represent a major coup for the streaming industry. As a group of concerned filmmakers wrote to Congress in a letter, the deal would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace,” shrinking the theatrical window for movies for as little as two weeks or eliminating it completely for certain projects. Still, the noticeable fervor around moviegoing signals a future that might not be so bleak.

Can young people do for movie theaters what they did for vinyl after records were pronounced dead, sparking a cultural resurgence and record-high sales? They're clearly excited to sit in a dark room, listen to a Nicole Kidman monologue, and enjoy compelling stories with a group of strangers. Maybe the film industry will have no choice but to pay attention.

The AI coworker is making tech people lose their minds. Here's what it actually is.

If it feels like the tech people in your life and on your timeline have collectively lost their minds — but, like, more than usual — that's just the Claude Code experience at work.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Now if you know what I'm talking about, you're either vibe coding so hard you're about to dissolve into a digital rapture or you're in a cold sweat and drafting your “I, for one, welcome our AI overlords” email.

But if you think Claude Code sounds like a New York Times word game you haven't gotten around to trying out, this FAQ is for you.

Okay, so, what is it?Right, you know how chatbots…chat? As in, write to you, talk to you, compose your college papers? Claude Code, which comes from the AI company Anthropic, is an AI tool that can actually do things with your computer. Actually, many of the things you can do with your computer. (Well, not you, if you're the target audience for this FAQ, but someone who is an expert programmer who never sleeps, never says no, and works at an impressive speed.)

Do…like what things?Honestly, it'd be easier to list the things it can't do with a computer. But an incomplete rundown of what users have accomplished with Claude Code would include: a Spotify Wrapped program but for text messages; personalized daily briefs that pull in emails, newsletters, and more; a Pokémon card management system; a personal DNA analyzer; and a “cyberpunk” Tetris game. You will need at least a $20 a month Claude Pro account — no freebies for you.

…Cool? But it has “code” in the name — do I have to know something about programming?

No worries! Yes, Claude Code is designed to work in what's known as a “command-line interface,” or the part of your computer where instead of clicking on icons or writing normal sentences, you type commands with a programming language into a terminal, aka the black screen where nerds are entering their code.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Do I look like 1995 Angelina Jolie in the movie Hackers? I don't know what any of that means. 

It's okay — neither do I!

It's true that experienced programmers can get the most out of Claude Code (though they're also the ones that are undergoing the deepest existential crises). But the learning curve for using Claude Code is descending faster than a Six Flags roller coaster, and you can increasingly interact with Claude Code more or less as you would with a chatbot if you want — with plain English and relatively few commands. Be warned that it's clunkier than using it in the terminal, but honestly I wouldn't trust either of us with that.

Bottom line, the process works like this:

In the best-case scenario, it closes the loop, mostly on its own: plan → change → check → fix. That's why people who build software for a living are acting like they've been freed from a thousand tiny paper cuts.

In the worst case, it can, uh, delete your files, leak your secrets, or burn through your rate limits. Which would be bad.

But I would like to keep my files. Ideally all of them. In their current state of existence.

Smart person. Claude Code is agentic-ish, meaning it can carry out tasks with little to no supervision, and as any manager knows, the benefits of an agent (“it can act autonomously!”) are also the drawbacks of an agent (“oh no, it just acted autonomously!”).

So if you start messing around with it, be sure to be very, very explicit in your directions — like, “do not delete anything. I really mean this.” (Fortunately, by default Claude Code still taps you on the shoulder before anything irreversible.) It's sort of like parenting a 5-year-old with superpowers.

Also, keep backups of anything important. But obviously you already do that.

Uh, sure…moving on, I understand why this is such a big deal for programmers. But does it really matter for the rest of us?

Sure does! As Future Perfect contributing editor Dylan Matthews wrote last year — borrowing a phrase from AI writer/investor Leopold Aschenbrenner — the scary endgame is “drop-in remote workers.”

Put simply, if you are a remote worker, it likely means you execute most of your tasks on a computer. Like I'm doing right now. And while I may not think of myself as manipulating computer code in my work, under the hood, that's exactly what's happening with every letter I press in this document.

Large language models — especially complex reasoning ones like Claude's Opus 4.5, the preferred model for super-charged Claude Code work — are already very good at thinking, analyzing and writing, and they're only likely to improve.

Claude Code is what happens when you take a language model and give it tool access — file editing, searching, running commands — inside your codebase, with guardrails you can loosen (or, regrettably, remove). In other words, if you're a remote worker, Claude Code could conceivably “drop in” and do some, most, or maybe all of that work. If chatbots could really just advise, models like Claude Code can actually do.

And Anthropic is already trying to port that same “Claude with hands” feeling out of the programmer cave and into the rest of your digital life. That's the idea behind the just-released Claude Cowork: Instead of pointing Claude at a codebase, you point it at a normal-person folder — your notes, docs, spreadsheets, PDFs, screenshots, the junk drawer of modern work — and it can read, organize, extract, and draft inside that space to produce real deliverables, not just suggestions.

If Claude Code is a drop-in remote worker for software teams, Cowork is the version that can drop into the work most remote workers actually do: turning messy inputs into usable outputs, faster than you can say “sorry, circling back.”

Uh oh.

Yes, now perhaps you understand why Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that we could be “sleepwalking into a white-collar bloodbath,” with AI wiping out huge numbers of entry-level jobs fast.

Have you tried Claude Cowork?

Nope — Cowork currently requires at least a $100 a month Max account, and obviously I have to save up for the post-work apocalypse.

Wait, aren't you supposed to be the Good News guy?

Indeed I am! (Sign up for the newsletter here.) And if you squint, you can argue that what we're likely to see is less replacing human jobs than rearranging them, turning workers into managers of teams of future AI agents, responsible for setting goals, checking outputs, and making judgement calls. So I guess in this more optimistic future, we'll all be Office Space's Bill Lumbergh, directing our army of AI agents to fill out infinite TPS reports.

O brave new world, that has such agents in it!

Yeah, I think the one thing we can count on is that it's going to get weird. I mean, weirder.

But in the meantime, unless you're planning on going around sabotaging data centers — please don't — you really can meaningfully improve your work and even your life if you begin to play around with these tools. The first time you actually create something that works is a pretty powerful feeling. Like I imagine how Mickey felt halfway through The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

Do…you know how that ended?And they all lived happily ever after.

Silver has outshone gold in the blistering precious-metals rally, but the surge may be running into a real-world constraint: The industries that actually use the white metal may be starting to pull back.

""At some price level, fabricators and end users simply cannot absorb higher costs,"" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Wednesday.

Industrial applications for silver include solar panels, electronics, and chips crucial to the AI buildout.

""They either try to pass them on and fail, cut back on purchases, or look for substitutes,"" Hansen added.

The spot silver price hit a fresh record high above $93 per troy ounce this week and is already up nearly 26% in 2026. The precious metal surged about 170% in 2025, far outpacing the 73% gain in gold prices over the same period.

Silver occupies a more complicated position than gold because it is both a precious metal and a core industrial input. This means it benefits from the same fear-driven demand that lifts gold, while also being tied to long-term themes such as electrification, solar energy, and electronics.

That mix made silver especially vulnerable to supply shocks. A physical short squeeze in London last year amplified the surge after inventories were left unusually thin by large flows of metal into US vaults amid tariff concerns.

Chinese production overcapacity and intense competition in recent years have driven up demand for the precious metal and other inputs. 

With silver now trading around $91 an ounce, some industrial consumers are beginning to respond by cutting usage or turning to substitutes.

Recently, major Chinese solar manufacturers Longi Green Energy Technology and Jinko Solar said they would begin substituting some silver with cheaper base metals. Even so, it may take time before slower buying and the use of existing stockpiles become visible enough to change the broader narrative around silver's boom, Hansen wrote.

""Every rally eventually meets its limit, and for silver, the most likely brake is industrial demand destruction,"" wrote Hansen.

Elon Musk called for the firing of the billionaire CEO of Europe's biggest airline as they traded insults in an escalating war of words over Starlink.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary isn't convinced by Starlink, Musk's satellite internet provider, which is becoming more popular among airlines.

For example, Lufthansa — the German flag carrier which runs the continent's second-largest airline group — announced on Tuesday that it would introduce the service. The following day, Scandinavian Airlines operated its first flight with Starlink.

However, as a budget airline, Ryanair is known for its no-frills offering.

""We don't think ‍our ⁠passengers are willing to pay for WiFi for an average ⁠one-hour flight,"" O'Leary told Reuters on Wednesday.

His comments sparked a debate on X. Musk said in a post: ""They [Ryanair] will lose customers to airlines that do have internet.""

In a subsequent interview on Irish radio on Thursday, the outspoken Ryanair boss said adding Starlink would cost the airline between $200 million and $250 million a year.

""In other words, about an extra dollar for every passenger we fly, and the reality for us is we can't afford those costs,"" he told Newstalk.

""Passengers won't pay for internet usage; if it's free, they'll use it — but they won't pay one euro each to use the internet.""

He then hit back at Musk, saying people should ""pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk.""

""He's an idiot. Very wealthy, but he's still an idiot,"" O'Leary added.

Musk then threw another shot on Friday morning, calling O'Leary an ""utter idiot.""

""Fire him,"" he added.

O'Leary has been the Ryanair CEO since 1994. Last month, he told the Financial Times that he plans to retire in five to 10 years. ""I don't want to hang around till 96 like Buffett,"" he said. 

He owns around 4% of the airline, making him a billionaire and one of the richest people in Ireland.

Ryanair and its subsidiaries operate a fleet of 643 airplanes, which handled 206 million passengers last year. 2024's statistics showed that it was the world's third-largest airline group, behind American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

The Irish airline's low-cost business model allows it to offer tickets as low as 15 euros, or about $17.40. It focuses on quick turnarounds between flights, charging for add-ons like sitting next to your friends, and on-board sales, including scratchcards and duty-free cigarettes.

Every airline that's announced Starlink deals so far has included free in-flight internet for everyone on board. So, even if O'Leary changed his mind, it seems unlikely that Musk's company would let him charge Ryanair passengers to use Starlink.

SpaceX executives also took umbrage at what they said was incorrect information about the fuel costs incurred by installing Starlink.

""You need to put [an] antenna on [the] fuselage — it comes with a 2% fuel ⁠penalty because of ​the weight and ​drag,"" O'Leary told Reuters.

Michael Nicolls, the VP of Starlink engineering, said in a Wednesday X post that Starlink terminals have a more fuel-efficient profile than other airplane internet providers. He added that SpaceX's analysis showed a Starlink terminal instead increased fuel costs by 0.3% on a Boeing 737-800, the model that makes up the bulk of Ryanair's fleet.

""Hmm, must be a way to get that down under 0.1%,"" Musk replied to him.

Ryanair declined to comment on Musk's and Nicolls' remarks when contacted by Business Insider. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While US budget airlines have recently pivoted to offer more premium options under intense financial pressures, Ryanair has little reason to do so. Adding an amenity like Starlink would be at odds with its business model, especially if it were free for passengers.

Post-pandemic, more American travellers have been paying extra for more luxurious flights. Budget airlines have also struggled to compete on price with legacy carriers.

But on the other side of the Atlantic, Ryanair has managed to balance a spartan approach with financial success.

In its latest quarterly earnings, Ryanair posted after-tax profits of 1.72 billion euros, about $2 billion — a 20% increase from a year earlier. Southwest Airlines' latest quarterly earnings were down nearly 20% year-over-year to $54 million.

Of all the robotaxis I've tried, Amazon's Zoox feels different.

Zoox — founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon four years later — is a robotaxi company that has limited operations in Las Vegas and San Francisco with about 50 vehicles between the two major cities. The company has said Austin and Miami are next on the map.

The service is considerably smaller than its competitor, Waymo, and that limitation was acutely felt in my experience hailing a Zoox on a Thursday night in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.

However, the rider experience itself felt more akin to an amusement-park-ride-slash-party-bus than an average ride-hail service in an everyday car, which makes Zoox a true differentiator against the emerging players in the robotaxi race.

Let me explain.

Zoox is not your average car.

The company doesn't bulk order vehicles from automakers to retrofit them with sensors the same way Waymo or Uber does. Instead, Zoox designed a vehicle solely for robotaxi operations and builds the cars out of a factory in Hayward, California.

The robotaxi doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedal — only seats inside the vehicle. The car is also bi-directional, meaning the Zoox's ""front"" goes both ways.

This helps the vehicle navigate tight spaces and avoid the need to execute U-turns or three-point turns.

However, riders will mainly feel the difference once they step inside the Zoox.

A chime plays as the robotaxi's doors slide open — almost like a grand entrance to the Zoox experience.

The interior reminded me of one of those immersive Disneyland rides or even a party-themed Gondola lift.

Inside, there are four seats — two on each side of the car, facing each other. I found that it encourages a social experience if you're bringing along multiple riders.

The headliner — or the roof — of the robotaxi has starlights which reminded me of the inside a Rolls-Royce or limousine. That touch felt especially appropriate for the Vegas scene, but it also seemed to add to the overall social experience Zoox is going for. It feels like a party inside the car.

Surprisingly, the seats were comfortable. The photos and videos I've seen of the Zoox made me think the seats would feel like a bus or subway seat, but they have a plush touch to them.

I don't see myself falling asleep inside the vehicle, simply because you're forced to sit upright and can't lie back in the seats, but they're comfortable enough for a 30- to 45-minute ride.

Another surprise: There's plenty of leg room that provides enough space between you and another rider in front of you. I went on a Zoox ride with a company spokesperson facing me, and space was not an issue.

I tried a Zoox facing forward and backward inside the car.

There have been some reports of riders feeling nauseous when they face backward. I didn't experience that, but that could just be unique to me.

The Zoox app tells riders which way to face if they are prone to motion sickness.

Outside the flashy headliner, there's little else inside the car. There are four wireless phone chargers, two small armrests, and four touchscreens by each of the seats, which allow riders to control the cabin temperature, change the music, and call for rider support.

Zoox is in a pilot stage of its operation in Las Vegas, working with fewer than 50 robotaxis inside the city. The service is free for now and limited to a handful of preset destinations.

I hailed a Zoox from one of the stops, the Luxor Hotel, and was given a 25-minute wait time. The real wait-time was 37 minutes.

Those two factors alone — limited destinations and long wait times — make Zoox less of a serious choice for day-to-day travel and more like a novelty experience to try once.

The rider experience also has room for improvement.

For all the effort Zoox put into creating a social in-car experience, the company has yet to provide riders with the option to connect to their Spotify or Apple Music. For now, passengers hear a curated music service from Stingray Music — similar to an iHeartRadio program.

The ride itself was mostly smooth. There was one moment that stuck out while the Zoox was going down the Strip.

Traffic was heavy at night, and the Zoox attempted to make a lane change while it was stopped behind a line of cars waiting at a red light.

The robotaxi began to move into the right lane, possibly to navigate around the traffic and transition to a less-congested lane. As it began to enter the right lane, with the body of the car now at a diagonal, the Zoox suddenly stopped. The car hesitated, lurched a little bit forward, and paused again. About 10 seconds later, the car straightened out and remained in the current lane.

Zoox did not respond to a request for comment.

After a nearly 35-minute ride, I was dropped off at AREA15, a Vegas entertainment hub that was one of the closest stops to my hotel.

A couple who had just taken a ride before me was trying to hail another Zoox to get back to their hotel at Excalibur.

The outside temperature was around 40 degrees.

We both resorted to calling an Uber.

Why has the market fallen out of love with Disney?

Bob Iger is nearing the end of a multi-year comeback run as CEO and has overseen several key improvements to Disney's business. Streaming has stopped bleeding cash. The company has mapped out a major expansion pipeline for parks and experiences. ESPN is bolstering its streaming strategy as the pay-TV bundle continues to shrink.

Despite this, the stock is sitting about 43% below its 2021 peak — and it could leave a dent in Iger's legacy.

During Iger's 15-year first run as CEO, which ended in 2020, Disney's stock surged as he transformed the company through acquisitions — Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm — that powered its movies, TV shows, consumer products, and parks. The introduction of the streaming service Disney+ in 2019 set off a growth narrative that saw the stock reach its all-time high of $198.60 in March 2021.

Since then, Disney has fallen well behind the S&P 500. Disney is trading around $114 — up about 24% from the start of Iger's second term as CEO. By comparison, the S&P has gained around 75%.

""Disney was the one stock in media that you could compare to everyone else,"" longtime Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said, referring to the broader market. ""This is the lowest relative valuation it's had in more than 40 years.""

Disney is operating within a complicated environment for media giants during Iger's second run, which is reflected in the varied stock performance of its competitors. Disney has no exact peer, but shares of its biggest rival, the pure-play streamer Netflix, have gained nearly 206% since November 2022, when Iger returned to Disney. Warner Bros. Discovery — which includes a storied Hollywood studio and HBO — was lagging until takeover interest fueled a stock run. Its shares are up 165% in that time period. Shares of NBCUniversal owner Comcast, which is dealing with both a troubled cable business and a sub-scale streamer, have declined about 12%.

Disney employees and everyday investors who spoke with Business Insider said they were frustrated by the stock's performance, but most believed it would eventually rebound.

""The fundamentals are there, and while the stock has lagged, it's part of a diversified portfolio, so I can afford to wait it out,"" said Dia Adams, a Disney fan and travel agent.

So, what's holding back the stock?

Wall Street analysts — most of whom, including Bank of America, recommend the stock — describe Disney as comprising three separate but interconnected businesses, each with its own distinct risk profile. At any given time, one of them looks shaky enough to hamper Disney's overall growth story.

Disney's Entertainment division, which spans linear TV networks, streaming services, and studios, is the most complex piece. Revenue from Disney's traditional TV business continues to decline as viewers shift away from the medium. That was on full display in Disney's fiscal fourth quarter ending September 27, with linear operating income falling 21% year over year.

The streaming business has been a bright spot, with operating income up 39% year over year in the fourth quarter. However, skeptics are concerned about streaming's ability to replace linear TV's decline and point out that growth is increasingly coming from outside the US, where people are often more price-sensitive.

The streaming wars could also get tougher for Disney moving forward. Netflix and Paramount Skydance are in a bidding war over Warner Bros. Discovery, and whichever combination emerges will create a larger rival that could put pressure on Disney.

Then there's Disney's studio business: hit-driven and expensive.

Wall Street was looking for Iger to work his magic on the movie business, and the films were ""horrific"" in Disney's 2025 fiscal year, Ehrlich said. The company blamed a decline in studio revenue on comparisons to the prior year's ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" and ""Inside Out 2."" Things have been looking up, though, with the blockbuster performance of ""Zootopia 2"" at the box office.

The Experiences division encompasses theme parks and cruise ships, and has become a top driver of profit for Disney. The division's recent strength has relied heavily on price increases rather than a bump in attendance.

That raises a key question: How much pricing power does Disney have left?

In 2025, domestic park attendance decreased 1%, according to Disney's annual report. Disney has also faced concerns about competition in Florida from Comcast's recently opened Epic Universe, and about the delayed debut of Disney Adventure in Singapore, now scheduled for March.

Sports is the smallest segment of Disney's business by revenue, but it has a clear growth story.

ESPN is modernizing for streaming with a newly enhanced app and big direct-to-consumer ambitions. That said, the cost of sports rights is increasing, and competition is intensifying — not only from traditional rivals like Fox, but also from deep-pocketed tech companies such as YouTube and Amazon.

Disney's sports spending was a topic on its latest earnings call after it paid more than a 73% increase for NBA rights in its latest deal, which kicked off with the 2025-2026 season. The company said the value to audiences and advertisers was big, even if the cost creates some ""bumpiness"" in financial results.

Wall Street sees no quick fix for Disney's stock. Analysts want proof of steady, repeatable earnings growth, whether from a stronger film slate, improved streaming profitability, or an expected lift from the cruise business in late 2026.

The stock price matters in ways that affect Disney operationally. Equity is critical to retaining top executives, and stagnant shares can dull the appeal of stock-based pay. This could complicate the job of Disney's next CEO.

Disney's CEO succession has become a favorite parlor game, with chatter centering on Experiences chief Josh D'Amaro and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden.

Regardless of who is chosen, investors are hoping for steady leadership over reinvention. The desire for continuity limits Iger's ability to make sweeping changes in his final months.

""Typically, CEOs will try very hard to exit on a high note,"" said Laurent Yoon, US media and telecom analyst at Bernstein. ""For Iger, it's certainly not good. It's going to be difficult to get stock in a good direction, at least near term.""

As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market. 

Arthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models.

Instead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers. 

""European governments are coming to us because they want to build the technology and they want to serve their citizens,"" Mensch said on the ""Big Technology Podcast"" on Wednesday.

Mistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems.

But Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available.

As a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe.

Mensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access.

The approach has already paid off. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure.

Mensch pushed back on the idea that the company benefits merely from EU regulation or protectionism.

Instead, he framed the demand as geopolitical and operational.

European governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms.

The same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security.

Mistral's embrace of open-source models is central to that strategy.

Open source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms.

The appeal isn't limited to Europe. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations.

That approach is already extending beyond the West. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy.

Long term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities.

In that future, he suggested, Mistral's biggest advantage may not be the models it builds — but where, and how, it builds them.

When Motolani Adedipe moved from Oklahoma to Seoul, South Korea, in August, she didn't just pack her suitcase — she brought along her 6-year-old daughter, newborn baby, and mom.

Adedipe, who is from Nigeria and moved to the US to attend grad school in Texas, first grew curious about South Korea while interning at a biotech firm in Boston, where she shared an apartment with a Korean roommate.

""For that summer, I ate a lot of Korean food. She put me on K-dramas,"" Adedipe, now 39, told Business Insider. That early curiosity soon grew into an interest in Korea's history, economy, and language.

Adedipe began learning Korean nine years ago online and continued after she moved to Oklahoma for work, where she became an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.

In September 2024, Adedipe applied for a Fulbright scholarship to extend her research in prostate cancer survivorship. She already knew she wanted to go to South Korea — even as she prepared to give birth to her second child that November.

She made it through the first review in December, but when months passed with no update, she figured she hadn't made it. So when the acceptance came through in April, the moment felt surreal.

""It was like the best news and almost the worst news at the same time. Best because finally I get to do this. But of course, the anxiety, how do we start planning now?"" Adedipe said.

Thankfully, her family was supportive, especially her husband.

""It required faith, sacrifice, structure, and for both of us to really imagine a life that looked very different from what we had planned,"" she said.

Her physician husband couldn't accompany her to South Korea, but they agreed that she would bring both daughters along.

""How many of her peers would ever say, 'Oh, I took a gap year in Korea'?"" she said, referring to their 6-year-old.

Knowing the scholarship would last just one year made the decision easier. Her husband has visited them in South Korea several times and plans to make more trips over the coming months.

""I saw it as an opportunity for my children to experience another culture, language, and way of life, while still having a clear sense of return,"" Adedipe said.

Now, she homeschools her daughter in the morning before sending her to a ""hagwon,"" a type of private academy that many Korean students attend after school.

""Not all of her friends speak English, so they kind of communicate through play,"" she said.

Adedipe's mom, who had traveled to Oklahoma to help out with the kids, joined them in Seoul.

As she searched for housing, Adedipe had a long checklist: enough space for her family, easy access to the subway, flat streets her mother, in her early 60s, could navigate, and a neighborhood that felt safe for kids.

She found a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in Mapo-gu, a district in western Seoul home to several universities.

Although the apartment was smaller than she initially hoped for, it turned out to be a great fit: It's surrounded by greenery and about a 30-minute commute to her workplace.

Her scholarship includes a housing stipend that covers her rent, which she declined to share.

Per the latest December data from the Korea Real Estate Board, the median monthly rent for an apartment in Mapo-gu is 1.39 million Korean won, or about $940.

Adedipe says her schedule varies from week to week, but her work typically starts in the afternoons. She goes into her office at Seoul National University Hospital several times a week, while continuing to supervise her lab in Oklahoma remotely at night.

Data from the Ministry of Justice showed that the number of foreigners living in South Korea at the end of 2024 stood at 2.65 million, a 5.7% increase from the previous year.

A US veteran who had retired in South Korea previously told Business Insider that he appreciated the country's safety and culture of respect. Meanwhile, a millennial who moved from Switzerland to Seoul said she valued the convenience of city life, including how most stores stay open late.

One of the biggest adjustments, Adedipe said, has been the extent to which technology is deeply woven into daily life in Seoul. Nearly everything is tied to having a registered phone number.

""Once I got my card and I got a bank account and I got a phone number that was registered, life became easy,"" she said.

Even though the city is known for its fast-paced lifestyle, Adedipe says she's been surprised by its human side.

""I lost my stylus in the bus, and I was able to get it back. It was tagged, and they verified they found it. That could never happen in the US,"" she said.

Watching her daughter flourish and adapt to their life in Seoul has been especially meaningful.

""Now that I'm seeing where she's shining. My goal is to keep encouraging her to find her passion in life and do that,"" she said.

In addition to learning Korean, her daughter takes part in extracurricular activities, such as piano, inline skating, and Taekwondo.

""She's doing everything that I never could have been able to give her because in Oklahoma, if you're doing all those classes, you have to drive your kids to all those classes,"" she said. ""But here in Korea, because of how the education is structured, she does all of that in a school, and she loves it.""

Living abroad with her mother has brought them closer. After leaving Nigeria for the US in her 20s, Adedipe went nearly eight years without seeing her mom because of visa issues.

""And now that I get to live with her again, it's like a dream come true,"" she said.

Looking back on her own experience, Adedipe says living and working in South Korea has felt like a ""full circle moment,"" after years of interest in the country.

""It felt like all the pieces of my life — research, storytelling, culture, and well-being — were suddenly being invited into the same room,"" she said.

How confident are you in AI? Enough to bet your retirement on it?

That's become a debate thanks to a bold proclamation by Elon Musk: Saving for retirement in 10 or 20 years ""won't matter.""

Musk's confidence comes from the work he's doing in artificial intelligence. The technological advancements will create an ""abundance"" of resources, granting everyone a ""universal high income,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said.

That's easy to say when you have checks notes and almost passes out nearly $700 billion in the bank. What about people whose net worths have a lot fewer zeros?

A group of BI reporters reached out to seven personal finance and AI gurus to get their take. They all agreed you shouldn't stop those direct deposits into your 401(K).

Even if AI increases productivity and reduces costs over time, it's not clear whether the benefits will be distributed evenly across the population.

Meanwhile, Americans are already in a precarious position regarding their retirement. Last year, BI's Noah Sheidlower spoke to nearly 200 Americans who continue to work past the age of 80 as part of our ""80 over 80"" series.

While some like the fact that they can still work, others don't have a choice. And that's with the benefit of Social Security, a safety net that might not exist in the future.

What do you think?

You can't completely discredit Musk's take, though.

Yes, forgoing retirement on the belief that AI and tech will just figure it out in a few decades is a massive gamble. But the past few years have reminded us that tech can quickly flip the script on conventional wisdom.

Five years ago, a career as a computer programmer felt secure. Now … not so much.

It's not a new phenomenon. My colleague Alistair Barr recently wrote in his Tech Memo newsletter (subscribe here!) that the US quickly went from having 25 million horses to fewer than two million thanks to the arrival of the steam engine.

Even if Musk is right, you'll probably still want some extra pocket change. Money isn't just about being able to buy things. It's also about access and exclusivity, and it's not clear how that might work in this new utopia.

It's not just going to Disney World; it's being able to cut the lines. It's not just getting tickets to the game; it's sitting courtside.

But if everyone's got ""universal high income,"" how will those perks work? Will all of us be equal? Or maybe some of us will be more equal than others?

President Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries ""if they don't go along with Greenland."" 

""We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,"" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.

The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.

The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. 

Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.

The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.

Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.

Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.

At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a ""most favored nations"" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.

""I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,"" Trump said.

A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a ""fundamental disagreement"" with Trump.

Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.

Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. 

The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. 

Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.

""I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,"" he said Friday.

In this article

Shares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 5% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity.

In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a ""solid start"" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said ""one data point does not make a trend."" They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess what early demand is like for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched on Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. 

Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more market share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug space. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity.

In a Friday note, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the Wegovy pill had around 3,100 prescriptions filled in the first week of the launch, citing IQVIA data for the week ending Jan. 9. Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, had around 1,300 prescriptions filled in the first week of its commercial launch, and roughly 8,000 in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. 

The TD Cowen analysts cited slightly different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. 

The analysts said around 4,290 prescriptions were filled for Novo Nordisk's pill during its first full week of launch, with the majority being for the starting dose of the drug. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. 

The analysts said that compares to the roughly 1,900 prescriptions filled for Zepbound during its first full week on the market. 

Assuming the Symphony data is accurate, the pill ""it is already outstripping its injectable counterparts at the same stage of their launch,"" TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych wrote in the note. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. 

Nedelcovych said he wants to see the full picture on the direct-to-consumer channel, which holds ""significant promise"" for the pill's launch. 

Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. 

While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements – no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water – that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions.

The Trump administration on Friday will push the largest electricity grid in the U.S. to make the big technology companies pay for new power plants. 

Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in large part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. 

The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. 

President Donald Trump wants PJM to hold an emergency auction in which the tech companies would bid on contracts for new electricity generation, a White House official told CNBC. 

Trump wants PJM to build $15 billion of new baseload power generation, the official said. He also wants PJM to cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, the official said. 

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and governors from the mid-Atlantic region will announce an agreement Friday morning urging PJM to take these actions, the official said. 

""Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading a unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.  

Bloomberg first reported the news. 

Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. 

The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a ""massive wealth transfer,"" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.

PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. Six gigawatts is equivalent to six large nuclear plants. 

The power shortage makes blackouts more likely, said Abe Silverman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 to 2023 under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

""Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,"" Silverman said.

Norwegian lawmakers reacted with shock and dismay over Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado's decision to present U.S. President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal.

""It's completely unheard of,"" Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international politics at the University of Oslo and former state secretary in the foreign affairs ministry, told public broadcaster NRK on Friday.

She called Machado's gesture ""disrespectful"" and ""pathetic,"" saying it undermined the value of the prize, which the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards annually. 

Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was ""incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,"" according to a Google translation.

Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a ""profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people."" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.

The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a ""wonderful gesture of mutual respect."" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.

The Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: ""A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.""

The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: ""The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.""

""Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,"" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. ""The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,"" he added. 

The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.

Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had ""proved they place politics over peace.""

Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is ""no doubt"" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.

Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.

""Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,"" Søreide said.

The growth of China's biotechnology sector has been staggering. Beijing is pumping money into the industry, backing research efforts and helping launch a new wave of labs and incubators in the country. That's a problem for the U.S. biotech industry and also affects rare disease patients who are waiting for a cure.

Among the experts speaking out against China's growing influence in the biotech sector is John Crowley, CEO of the lobbying group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, or BIO.

Crowley is something of a rock star in the rare disease community. His story is as incredible as it is inspiring. 

When Crowley and his wife were told his two young children had Pompe disease, a fatal genetic disorder, Crowley left his job in marketing to try to find a cure. He partnered with a researcher who was working on Pompe, and started a company that eventually developed a treatment to save the lives of his children and thousands of others.

If it sounds like the plot of a movie, it is. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Geeta Anand wrote a book about Crowley's story, which later became the Hollywood film ""Extraordinary Measures,"" starring Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser. 

Crowley has certainly made his mark in the biotech space. He helped build two biotech companies focused on rare diseases that were later acquired by larger pharmaceuticals. Most recently, in December, BioMarin paid nearly $5 billion for Amicus Therapeutics, a company Crowley helped grow from a five-person startup in 2005 to a multibillion-dollar company when he left in 2024. Crowley left Amicus to become the CEO of BIO. 

Since stepping into that post, he has become increasingly outspoken about China's biotech sector, advocating for the U.S. to become more competitive.

""We need to reduce the reliance on Chinese biotechs,"" Crowley said. ""Once they are the dominant player, then they will decide who gets what medicines and technologies.""

Crowley has seen the growth of China's biotech firsthand. ""I go back to even just 10 years ago, maybe, working in China. There were maybe a couple hundred true R&D biotech companies in China. By our count, there's over 4,000 today,"" he said.

At the same time, Beijing is reducing the regulatory hurdles for drugmakers doing research in China, meaning the treatments they're working on can get into clinical trials more quickly. That's attractive to both major drug manufacturers and smaller researchers from around the world, who see developing drugs in China as a faster and cheaper option than in the United States. A recent article in STAT profiled the rise of one Chinese incubator, ATLATL, highlighting how it's been able to develop relationships with clients spanning the entire drug development pipeline. 

To Crowley, who is a former naval intelligence officer, China's rise in biotech is a threat not just to the industry he represents, but to the millions of patients who rely upon the rare disease research that comes out of American universities.

""Our research grounded in our great academic institutions [is] a remarkable strategic advantage for the United States,"" Crowley said. ""It's threatened today."" 

""The greatest threat comes from China and the rise of Chinese biotechnology,"" Crowley said.

""We can't let China win in biotech,"" he said.

Crowley is not alone in his concerns. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a member of the CNBC Cures Advisory Board, devotes a chapter in his forthcoming book, ""The Miracle Century,"" to China's rise in biotech. In the book, Gottlieb lays out the case that as Beijing has simplified the regulatory approval process so breakthrough medical treatments get to market sooner, investment in those technologies has flowed from the U.S. to China. He wrote:

""If this drift continues and more drug discovery migrates from the U.S. to China, we could see our capacity for innovation begin to erode. As capital flows toward Chinese firms, U.S. biotechnology hubs like Boston and San Francisco, long the seedbeds of breakthrough science, may shrink. Restoring that American ecosystem would be anything but easy.""

The shift in capital is not theoretical. It's happening. 

A September article published in Nature found that from 2020-2025, 11 of the largest pharma players committed more than $150 billion in deals for access to assets developed in Asia, primarily in China. 

And data gathered for another forthcoming book, ""Innovation is the Best Medicine,"" by Dr. Roderick Wong, a physician and the founder and managing partner of life sciences investment firm RTW Investments, shows that from 2013-2025, China tripled its share of global clinical trial initiations. 

Political think tanks and lawmakers in the U.S. have taken notice. 

In November, the nonpartisan Atlantic Council published an analysis that identified pharmaceuticals as China's next trade weapon, likening the shift in biotech innovation to China to the offshoring of semiconductor chip manufacturing. 

Spurred on by concerns about corporate espionage, access to sensitive genetic data, and memories of the supply chain bottlenecks the global medical supply industry faced after the Covid pandemic, Congress in late 2025 passed the Biosecure Act, which President Donald Trump later signed into law as part of the massive $901 billion defense spending bill.

The Biosecure Act prohibits biotech companies that receive federal funds from doing business with companies that the U.S. designates as ""biotech companies of concern."" While it won't prohibit all business U.S. biotech companies do with China, and language in the law was softened from an earlier version of the bill, the law is forcing some firms based in the U.S. to reexamine their ties to China.

But for people living with a rare disease, the issue isn't so clear-cut. Rare diseases don't respect borders. And parents looking for a lifesaving treatment for their child don't care if it comes from the U.S. or China. Innovation in the rare disease space is a good thing. And in a field where there might be only two or three experts in the world on any given disease, that innovation is often the result of international collaboration. More and more frequently that innovation is coming from China.

It's a conundrum that isn't lost on Gottlieb, who acknowledged the innovation from Beijing is good for rare disease patients. At least in the short term. ""If the end result, though, is that the fragile U.S. innovation sector gets hollowed out and we lose our own engine of innovation, that's bad,"" Gottlieb said in a text. ""The priority targets of Chinese drug makers may not reflect our priority targets."" 

""As China erodes other parts of our ecosystem, it could hollow out everything,"" he added.

Both Gottlieb and Crowley said the real key to maintaining U.S. leadership in biotech is getting regulators to treat rare diseases, which might affect only a few hundred people, differently from those with larger patient populations. Rare disease researchers agree, arguing that a more streamlined approval process for rare disease treatments from the FDA would dramatically bring down the cost of bringing a new treatment to market in the U.S.

David Liu, a pioneer in gene editing whose lab at Harvard University and the Broad Institute is at the cutting edge of genetic research, said he's asked the FDA to take a more lenient stance when evaluating new treatments for rare diseases. One example Liu pointed to: current guidelines for cell and gene therapies that require a company demonstrates three full-scale manufacturing runs before a treatment can get final approval. 

""One full-scale manufacturing run typically costs $7 million for rare genetic disease gene editing treatments,"" Liu said. ""One production run can typically already treat more patients than exist in the whole world. So you're just asking companies to throw away an extra $14 million.""

Critics of current FDA policies argue that using a different set of standards for rare disease treatments would bring down development costs and help the drugs get to the people who need them more quickly, and that it could spur a new wave of investment in the space. 

""Let's think creatively,"" Crowley said. ""Don't apply the same standards for a rare disease with 100 kids to a treatment designed for a disease with millions of people.""

""We need a system that works better,"" he said.

Russia called the Trump administration's threats to take over Greenland ""extraordinary"" on Friday, adding it would continue monitoring the situation.

""The situation is unusual, I would even say extraordinary from the standpoint of international law,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to comments reported by Russian state news outlet Ria Novosti.

U.S. President Donald Trump has talked up acquiring Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, since a daring military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. He said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and that only Washington can counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island.

Peskov added that Trump ""has said that international law is not a priority for him. The situation is developing along a different trajectory, and we, along with the rest of the world, will be watching to see which one.""

A spokesperson for the Kremlin was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.

Peskov's comments come shortly after the U.S., Denmark and Greenland held crunch talks over the future of the Arctic island. 

The White House meeting, which was described as ""frank but constructive"" by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, ended on Wednesday without a diplomatic breakthrough, although they agreed to keep talking via a high-level working group. 

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he doesn't ""need international law"" and that only his ""own morality"" and mind can stop him. 

Several NATO members have deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a joint military exercise, meanwhile, seeking to beef up the military presence in and around the sparsely populated island.

Denmark, which is responsible for Greenland's defense, Germany, France, Sweden and Norway have all confirmed plans to take part in the joint exercises, known as ""Operation Arctic Endurance.""

Earlier in the week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that it was unacceptable to say that Beijing and Moscow were a threat to Greenland, accusing the West of double standards.

Happy Friday. This week isn't even over yet, but I'm already gearing up for next week's big events: the World Economic Forum in Davos, a major Supreme Court case and Netflix earnings.

S&P 500 futures are higher this morning after yesterday's winning session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Chip stocks led the market higher yesterday after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company released better-than-expected results, including a 35% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter profit. 

Here's what to know:

If you're disappointed to hear that Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman's parent company filed for bankruptcy, you're not alone. Amazon would also like to have a word with Saks Global.

The e-commerce site asked a federal judge yesterday to block Saks' bankruptcy financing plan, accusing the retailer of failing to hold up its agreement. Amazon invested $475 million into Saks' 2024 acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but ""that equity investment is now presumptively worthless,"" Amazon lawyers wrote in the filing.

The company told the judge that it and other creditors would be hurt by Saks' bankruptcy financing plan because it would have the department store operator take on more debt. As CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Annie Palmer report, Amazon threatened to ""seek more drastic remedies"" if Saks doesn't resolve its concerns.

President Donald Trump yesterday unveiled an outline of his health-care plan, which his administration said would reduce drug prices and insurance premiums.

The plan — dubbed the ""The Great Healthcare Plan"" by the White House — would codify Trump's ""most-favored-nation"" policy, which ties the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. to lower prices abroad. A fact sheet said the plan would also send money for health insurance ""directly"" to Americans, though some health policy experts say that's a bad idea.

The announcement came as senators struggled to reach an agreement on the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The new plan does not include extending the Obamacare tax credits, which Democrats demand be part of a health-care deal.

Prediction markets could be getting a big bank backer.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said yesterday that the bank is exploring opportunities in the growing corner of finance, telling investors on the company's earnings call that he ""personally met with the two big prediction companies and their leadership in the last two weeks.""

While Solomon pumped the brakes on the idea that Wall Street would rapidly embrace prediction markets, he noted that trading platforms regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ""look like derivative contract activities.""

""So I can certainly see opportunities where these cross into our business,"" he said.

From the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, to the Super Bowl, to the NBA All-Star game, sports fans have a lot to look forward to next month. 

And so does NBCUniversal, which will air all three events on NBC and its streaming service Peacock. NBC Chief Marketing Officer Jenny Storms is calling it ""Legendary February,"" and it's set to be a big test for the broadcaster, which spent billions of dollars on live sports rights.

As CNBC's Alex Sherman reports, next month is simply a reflection of what's become NBC's strategy, which — despite what co-CEO of parent company Comcast Mike Cavanagh says — is sports-first.

Here are a few stories worth reading over the long weekend.

CNBC's Dylan Butts, Pia Singh, Ari Levy, Kif Leswing, Emily Tan, Sarah Min, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Annie Palmer, Kevin Breuninger, Garrett Downs, Annika Kim Constantino, Greg Iacurci, Yun Li and Alex Sherman contributed to this report. Melodie Warner edited this edition.

A survey released Friday by corporate insurer Axis Capital shows there's a growing divide across the C-suite on how executives view the risks, rewards and impact of cutting-edge AI technology.  

On one hand, artificial intelligence is rapidly improving cybersecurity defense technologies, but AI is also equipping cybercriminals with sophisticated tools and creating new risks. 

""When you think about AI, it is not merely a cyber challenge. This technology presents unique burdens, liabilities, challenges and opportunities to CEOs and boards alike,"" Axis CEO Vincent Tizzio told CNBC in an exclusive interview. 

Axis surveyed 250 CEOs and chief information security officers across the U.S. and U.K. on how AI is reshaping the cyber risk landscape. The survey found that while CEOs tend to view AI as a driver of productivity and competitive advantage, CISOs tend to see the technology as a source of increased exposure to risks like data leaks. 

Asked how confident they were that AI would strengthen their companies' cybersecurity, 19.5% of CEOs said they weren't confident compared to 30% of CISOs saying they lacked that confidence.

""The rapidity of change that's going on in AI renders reconsideration of the purchases that they're making and taking around the tools that they're bringing to the company,"" Tizzio said.

The study also found that AI is generally viewed positively among both U.S. and U.K. executives, although U.K. respondents expressed more caution than those in the U.S. 

While 85% of U.S. leaders said they felt prepared for AI threats, only 44% in the U.K. said they felt prepared. 

Cybersecurity is a major investment priority for executives as ransomware attacks have nearly doubled over the past two years, with 82% of respondents saying they plan to increase their cybersecurity budgets over the next 12 months.  

""I haven't met a fellow CEO or board member that doesn't talk about the critical importance of discussing cyber as an exposure to the company's well-being,"" Tizzio said.

In this article

A U.S. move to seize Greenland could damage trade ties with the European Union, France's finance minister has warned, as one analyst told CNBC that tariffs or economic sanctions could lead to a ""trade war.""

U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up talk of annexing Greenland this month — and has not ruled out taking it by force. Talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday over the future of the world's largest island ended without a diplomatic breakthrough.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure told the Financial Times on Friday that economic ties between the U.S. and Europe could be damaged if Trump were to move to take the self-governing Danish territory. 

""Greenland is a sovereign part of a sovereign country that is part of the EU. That shouldn't be messed around [with],"" he said.

When asked whether the EU would hit the U.S. with economic sanctions if it invaded Greenland, Lescure told FT: ""I'm not going there. I mean, obviously, if that happened, we would be in a totally new world for sure, and we would have to adapt accordingly.""

His comments come as a Democratic-led U.S. delegation is expected to visit Copenhagen for talks with Danish MPs on Friday.

Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. Analysts told CNBC that he wants to keep rivals out of emerging trade routes and, potentially, mining of minerals that are critical in industries like defense. 

""Significant"" economic pressure in the form of tariffs or sanctions on Denmark by the U.S. ""could likely mean a significant E.U. pushback, where the E.U. could respond in kind, leading to a sort of trade war with the U.S. as well as constant headline risks,"" Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at Alpine Macro, told CNBC over email.

""This would rattle markets,"" he said. ""It would also call into question NATO, though we don't predict this happening, or NATO breaking apart. Domestic political and markets pushback would likely moderate any such pushes by the Trump administration.""

Meanwhile, European troops arrived in Greenland late Thursday for a collaborative military exercise. 

This shows the U.S. that ""this is primarily an allied effort,"" Maria Martisiute, policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday. ""If we want to reinforce veterans and defense in Greenland or the wider Arctic, it's not up to the U.S. It can be done via allied efforts.""

The exercise, combined with European leaders outlining their non-negotiable red lines, can ""send a powerful message,"" she said, adding: ""It remains to be seen how the U.S. will proceed in that regard.""

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed to double its spending on Greenland in its latest draft budget.

""What is clear is that Greenland can count on us — politically, economically, and financially and when it comes to its security,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.

U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday as investors monitored the economic outlook and geopolitical concerns.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield gained more than 3 basis points to 4.197%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury advanced more than 2 basis points to 3.588%. The 30-year Treasury yield was also more than 2 basis points higher at 4.808%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors have been concerned about geopolitical uncertainty through the week, with President Donald Trump insistent on taking ownership of Greenland — a self-governing Danish territory — saying it's critical to U.S. national security. On Friday, the president floated imposing tariffs on countries ""if they don't go along with Greenland.""

A high-stakes meeting on Wednesday between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland over the Arctic island's future ended without a diplomatic solution, but talks are expected to continue. 

Meanwhile, U.S.-Iran tensions have eased after Trump signaled he was holding off on military strikes, citing reports that Iran had reduced its violent crackdown on protesters. 

Also this week, a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has created worries about the Fed's independence, and whether it might be politically influenced. Trump said Friday that he'd like to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his position, a statement that boosted prediction market bets of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh becoming the next Fed chair.

It's quiet on the economic data front, but investors are looking to the week ahead when the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will be released and offer fresh insights on the economy. 

The bond market will be closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day.

Thursday offered markets a rare respite from nonstop geopolitical upheaval. Yet the week's headlines still reflected larger global dynamics.

Case in point: Taiwan's $250 billion investment in chip production in the U.S., which is as much a strategic move as a commercial one. The agreement will see the U.S. lower tariffs on Taiwanese imports to 15% from 20% and remove them altogether on other products, such as generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft components. 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has already purchased land and could expand in Arizona as part of this deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan in an interview Thursday. The firm is also considering additional investments in the U.S. beyond current plans,  TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told CNBC's Emily Tan on Thursday.

The world's leading contract chipmaker also announced blowout earnings on Thursday. TSMC also said it's raising its expected capital expenditure for 2026, indicating that demand for artificial intelligence remains high this year.

This wave of optimism helped power stock markets higher. Semiconductor and AI-related stocks such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Applied Materials advanced in the U.S., while European producers of chip-making equipment, such as ASML and ASM International, also climbed.  

In Europe, stocks are poised to end the week on a record high. A rally in technology shares has lifted the sector to levels not seen since 2000, while fresh data showing Germany's economy expanding in 2025 for the first time in two years also boosted sentiment.

Oil prices, meanwhile, slid after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could hold off on attacking Iran, easing a major source of near-term risk.

But tensions remain elsewhere. Several NATO nations announced they've deployed troops to Greenland as part of a joint exercise to bolster Arctic security. These movements follow strained transatlantic discussions over U.S. proposals to acquire the semi-autonomous Danish territory — a suggestion that has unsettled European partners and raised fundamental questions about the alliance.

U.S. is getting 30% higher prices for Venezuelan oil. Washington completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil valued at about $500 million, which is ""about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than [Venezuela] sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday.

India's exports to China soared in December. Shipments rose 67% year on year to $2 billion. By contrast, exports to the U.S. fell 1.8% to $6.8 billion amid 50% tariffs on New Delhi — but the U.S. remains India's largest export market.

Mitsubishi Corporation said on Friday that it will acquire shale gas assets in the U.S. in a $7.53 billion deal, including debt, as the Japanese trading house looks to build on its presence in the country's energy market.

Mitsubishi is looking to capitalize on rising power needs from data centers, manufacturing, as well as LNG exports, by expanding in the the world's largest gas market, citing domestic consumption, production, exports, and further demand growth.

It will acquire the assets from Aethon Energy Management in Texas and Louisiana in a transaction that includes $5.2 billion in equity purchases and $2.33 billion in Aethon's debt. 

Mitsubishi's deal comes after Japan's largest power generation company, JERA, announced a $1.5 billion investment in October in the Haynesville Shale basin on the Louisiana-Texas border, as part of Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge to the U.S.

Last month, Japanese media outlet Nikkei reported that projects in the energy sector were likely candidates for Japan's investment pledge, although it was not immediately clear if Mitsubishi's deal counts toward the proposed investment.

In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mitsubishi said that the investment will strengthen the earnings base of the company's natural gas and LNG businesses. 

It will also accelerate efforts to build an integrated value chain in the United States, ""from upstream gas development to power generation, data center development, chemicals production, and related businesses,"" the company said. 

Shares of Mitsubishi fell 2% after the transaction was announced.

The company has multiple investments in natural gas, with projects in Alaska, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia, among others. 

Mitsubishi has a total LNG production capacity across projects of about 15 million metric tons per year currently, and Atheon assets are estimated to add a similar capacity, doubling overall output. 

The company said it also plans to expand in the U.S. by engaging in power generation and manufacturing businesses that capitalize on competitive upstream gas projects.

Mitsubishi currently has partnerships in upstream shale gas development with U.S. energy company Ovintiv in British Columbia, Canada, midstream marketing and logistics through subsidiary CIMA Energy in Houston, and LNG exports via LNG Canada and Cameron LNG.

In this article

Buoyed by yet another blockbuster earnings report and a new U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is poised to accelerate its multibillion-dollar expansion in Arizona. 

The world's largest contract chipmaker has already committed $165 billion in the U.S., aligning with Washington's push to rebuild its domestic chip manufacturing. But TSMC executives have signaled that spending will rise even further as the company expands capacity to meet demand for artificial intelligence chips.

Speaking Thursday with CNBC's Emily Tan, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said the firm would continue to ramp up its investments in Arizona.

""We have strong conviction on the AI mega trend, and that is the reason we are stepping up the capital expenditures to expand in Taiwan and in the U.S.,"" Huang said. ""Not just to expand, but also try to accelerate where it is possible to satisfy or narrow the gap.""

The comments came just hours after Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said on the company's quarterly earnings call that TSMC had recently purchased additional land in Arizona and planned to build a ""gigafab cluster"" in the state. 

While the company did not disclose the dollar value of its planned expansions in the U.S., it forecast capital expenditure in the new year to increase over 30% at the midpoint compared with 2025. 

The Arizona expansion coincides with a U.S.-Taiwan trade deal signed Thursday that caps U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese goods at 15%, down from 20%, without stacking on existing rates. 

Under the agreement, Taiwanese firms commit $250 billion in direct U.S. investments across semiconductors, AI and related sectors, along with $250 billion in credit guarantees to strengthen supply chains. The deal also grants favorable treatment for chips, supporting efforts to reshore manufacturing to the U.S.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan that the goal of the trade deal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S.

Ahead of TSMC's earnings release and the trade deal, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Taiwanese chip giant had been planning a significant expansion in Arizona as part of trade negotiations between the U.S. and Taiwan, citing confidential sources. 

However, on Thursday, Huang denied that its U.S. investment plans were directly tied to those trade talks.

""The [U.S.-Taiwan] trade deal is between two governments, and we are not part of the discussions,"" he said. 

""But what I will say is we are continuing to invest and accelerate our investment in Arizona because of customers' demand, and we actually are making very good progress with our [first fab] in Arizona being up and running. 

The push to expand follows progress at its current U.S. facility following years of delays and concerns.

According to executives, TSMC's first fabrication plant, which has already begun mass production, is now producing chips with yields and technology levels comparable to those of the company's leading facilities in Taiwan. 

""It demonstrates that our manufacturing excellence can be repeated in the U.S. It's very meaningful for ourselves, and it's also very meaningful for our customers,"" Huang said.

However, he noted that the company's most advanced technologies would continue to be developed and scaled up in Taiwan, where TSMC benefits from the necessary collaboration between its research teams and manufacturing operations.

Profit margins in Taiwan also remain higher than in the U.S., partly due to lower labor costs.

Still, the company's outlook in the U.S. has improved. TSMC has moved up the production timeline for its second Arizona plant to the second half of 2027, with construction on a third facility accelerating this year. It has also begun applying for permits for a fourth plant, the company said at its recent earnings call.

According to Huang, TSMC's original plan for its first 1,100 acres in Arizona included six wafer fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a research and development center. 

However, that land proved to be insufficient for the expansion plans, prompting the purchase of an additional 900-acre lot. Some facilities that were part of the original plan will now be built on this second piece of land instead, with the remainder ""used for future flexibilities,"" Huang said. 

TSMC shares were trading up more than 3% in Taipei on Friday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Jefferies' ‘Greed & Fear' strategist cuts Bitcoin allocation to zero on quantum risk","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:48c840d10094b:0-jefferies-greed-fear-strategist-cuts-bitcoin-allocation-to-zero-on-quantum-risk/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:35:03 GMT","

Investment bank Jefferies' longtime “Greed & Fear” strategist Christopher Wood has reportedly eliminated Bitcoin from his flagship model portfolio, citing mounting concerns that advances in quantum computing may undermine the cryptocurrency's long-term security.

According to a report by Bloomberg, Wood said in the latest edition of his Greed & Fear newsletter, that the 10% Bitcoin (BTC) allocation he first added in late 2020 has been replaced by a split position in physical gold and gold mining stocks.

He argued that quantum breakthroughs would weaken Bitcoin's claim to be a dependable store of value for pension‑style investors.

​Wood added that concern over quantum risk is rising among long-term, institutional investors, warning that some capital allocators now question Bitcoin's store of value case if quantum timelines compress. 

He said he feared that “cryptographically relevant” machines arriving sooner than expected could let attackers derive private keys from exposed public keys, weakening the cryptography underpinning Bitcoin balances and mining rewards and, in the extreme, challenging its role as “digital gold” for pension‑style portfolios.

​Quantum risk enters mainstream portfolios

The quantum issue has been discussed for years among developers and commentators, but Wood's move shows how it's now influencing mainstream asset allocation decisions at major brokerage and research houses. 

Castle Island Ventures partner and Bitcoin advocate Nic Carter has discussed the quantum issue at length, warning in December that “capital is concerned and looking for a solution” on quantum risk, even though many developers, including Blockstream CEO Adam Back, remain skeptical that it is a near‑term problem. 

Macro analyst Luke Gromen has also turned cautious on Bitcoin in recent months, citing macro and technological uncertainties, including quantum computing risk, as reasons to favor increasing gold exposure versus BTC on a multi‑cycle view. 

Studies from firms such as EY and PwC similarly flag quantum computing as a significant emerging threat to traditional public key cryptography, warning that financial systems, including those supporting digital assets, need to prepare migration paths to quantum-resistant alternatives.

Developers say Bitcoin has time to adapt

Bitcoin developers and core infrastructure builders push back on the idea that quantum progress is an immediate threat. 

Blockstream CEO Adam Back has repeatedly argued that breaking Bitcoin's current signature schemes is likely 20–40 years away and that the network would have ample time to migrate to post‑quantum signature algorithms and better key management practices well before any real‑world break becomes feasible. 

Other analysts, including an a16z researcher, similarly conclude that the probability of a “cryptographically relevant” quantum computer capable of breaking today's public key systems emerging this decade is low.

They say that the bigger near‑term risks come from implementation bugs, governance, and “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks on encrypted data rather than immediate attacks on live blockchain signatures.

The cryptocurrency market wavered Friday as trading volumes cooled, with Bitcoin and Ethereum drifting downward despite positive momentum earlier this week.

Following Bitcoin's jump to $94,600 on Wednesday, the leading digital asset by market capitalization changed hands around $95,300, a 4.6% increase over the past seven days, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Ethereum has risen 5.9% to $3,250 over the same period of time.

Trading volumes for Bitcoin and Ethereum had meanwhile fallen 27% and 32% each to $65 billion and $54 billion, respectively, according to CoinGlass. The trend extended to various actions, including Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin.

The drop follows Coinbase's withdrawal of support for a crypto market structure bill, following weeks of lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill, and tensions boiling to the surface over the Securities and Exchange Commission's treatment of crypto firms among Democratic lawmakers.

""I'm still quite optimistic that this bill is going to get done in a very bipartisan and strong way,"" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during a Friday appearance on Fox Business. "" I did come out and say that I thought there were those issues, while deferring to the Senate on the exact procedure going forward from here."" 

On Thursday, several commentators skewered the SEC in a letter addressed to Chair Paul Atkins.

“There was a lot of optimism that we would see that passed this year,” Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at crypto trading firm GSR, told Decrypt, referring to the CLARITY Act. “The rally seemed to coincide with [a new version of the bill] getting released.”

Although efforts to mark up the bill were delayed by the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, Guzman pointed to the potential impact of other factors, including geopolitical tension in the Middle East sparked by protests in Iran and developments in President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell issued a warning that the White House was trying to undermine the central bank's independence, after news broke of Justice Department subpoenas centered on testimony he gave regarding a multi-billion dollar renovation of the Fed's headquarters. Guzman said it was notable that stocks fell, while crypto and precious metals advanced.

Since Monday, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have generated consistent inflows, pulling in $1.8 billion over the course of a four-day stretch, according to CoinGlass.

Jasper De Maere, a desk strategist at crypto market maker Wintermute wrote in a note on Thursday that the dynamic suggests “participation remains narrow,” with the bulk of the heavy lifting being done on Wall Street recently.

“Retail has been largely absent, with activity staying subdued even as prices climb,” he wrote. That might be shifting now as Bitcoin grabs headlines again, but this rally has been primarily an institutional and ETF story.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Is Solana's Pain a Game Changer for Ethereum?","https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/16/is-solanas-pain-a-game-changer-for-ethereum/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:00 GMT","

The smaller chain could lose ground in an important arena during a critical period.

Solana (SOL 0.64%) built its brand as a blockchain on its best attributes, which is to say its speed and low costs. Those traits make it among the most seamless places to run many kinds of crypto projects -- including sketchy schemes -- and one ongoing class action lawsuit against a few of the most important organizations related to the chain could be showcasing that pain point, thereby deterring a critical group of investors with a lot of capital on hand.

Ethereum (ETH 0.54%), on the other hand, has its own messes, but right now it could benefit substantially from the lawsuit against Solana. Here's what's going on and why it has a good shot at shifting the competitive landscape in crypto as it pertains to these two coins.

Image source: Getty Images.

A class action lawsuit is a legal process where plaintiffs try to represent a larger group of similarly affected people, and bringing such a lawsuit often pressures the defendants to take a specific action long before any judge rules on the facts. In the Solana case, plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Pump.fun meme coin launch platform as well as entities tied to Solana, including both the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs, as well as others.

In case it wasn't obvious, those entities are critical in supporting the Solana decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem and advancing the chain's platform technology, though they aren't necessarily the only groups pursuing those objectives. The plaintiffs are alleging that individuals in those organizations collaborated with the individuals operating Pump.fun in a way that financially disadvantaged the investors participating in meme coin launches.

The outcome of the lawsuit is not something that's knowable in advance, and jumping to conclusions is inadvisable. One defendant connected to the Solana ecosystem recently won a dismissal in the same broader dispute. Furthermore, the legal process is likely to take a long time regardless of what the outcome is.

Nonetheless, at the same time, astute investors will immediately realize that key organizations being pulled into allegations about potentially defrauding investors is not a good look for Solana. What's more, at this point in time, when the chain is angling to become a hub for tokenized real-world asset (RWA) management, specifically tokenized stocks, the mere existence of a serious class action suit could discourage financial institutions and other asset managers from considering the chain for their use cases.

And therein lies the opportunity for Ethereum to look squeaky clean and pick up the capital that's wary of Solana's chain.

Ethereum, like Solana, is positioning itself to be the ultimate destination for managing tokenized assets.

It currently has more than $12 billion in tokenized RWAs on its chain, making it a more popular destination in comparison to Solana's $940 million in tokenized assets. But an important difference is that despite its market cap being about four times larger than Solana's, in terms of tokenized equities, Ethereum only has $368 million in on its chain whereas Solana has $199 million.

Therefore Solana is proportionally a more appealing place to manage a subset of tokenized assets, which makes sense because it prioritizes features you would usually want for handling stocks as an institutional investor, like fast and cheap transactions, both of which are (again, in comparison) lacking with Ethereum. And it's that proportional advantage in attracting capital inflows that is now in jeopardy.

So, is the lawsuit actually a game changer for Ethereum's investment thesis, at least the portion of it that pertains to it being an emerging hub for managing tokenized real-world assets like stocks? In the near term, the answer to that question is probably yes, because it weakens the previously strong argument that Solana would easily outcompete Ethereum as the default platform for tokenized equity capital.

In the long run, Solana can likely absorb the reputational hit it just took without lasting ecosystem damage, and it can still win meaningful market share in the tokenized asset management segment. But the bar for its success just got a bit higher, and even if that isn't a permanent state of affairs, it will take some time to change and investors might not get the returns they want in the meantime.

The flip side, of course, is that Ethereum looks more appealing now, and if it can capitalize on this moment, it might be able to actually lead in an important area where pretty much everyone thought it would be a laggard over the long term.

Bitmine said  on Thursday it would take a $200 million equity stake in Beast Industries, the entertainment and consumer-products company founded by YouTube star Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson.

The announcement triggered after-hours  gains and then drops in Bitmine's shares amid renewed bullish discussion around Ethereum, which sits at the center of the company's core strategy.

The investment marks one of Bitmine's largest non-core equity positions to date, as the firm continues to anchor its balance sheet around Ethereum.

Lee described Donaldson as “the leading content creator of our generation,” adding that Beast Industries' reach across younger demographics made it a natural partner.

“Beast Industries' scale and cultural relevance align with our long-term vision and values,” Lee said in a statement.

Jeff Housenbold, chief executive of Beast Industries, called the funding “a strong validation of our vision, strategy and growth trajectory.”

He said that the capital would help the company pursue its goal of becoming “the most impactful entertainment brand in the world.”

The deal has fueled discussion on social media, with some traders speculating on how the partnership could influence Ethereum's long-term adoption.

One user on X  wrote that Lee has often described Ethereum as “the future of finance,” adding that “the generations that consume MrBeast content will inherit that future.”

The user also noted that “70% of MrBeast viewers are non-English speakers,” arguing that his global reach could expand awareness of crypto internationally.

Another user described the partnership as a “great onboarding opportunity for the younger generation.”

$ETH  treasury company Bitmine invests $200,000,000 in MrBeast's 'Beast Industries.

How much money do you have @fundstrat ? 🤣

— Ted (@TedPillows) January 15, 2026 



Meanwhile, famed commentator Ted Pillows, questioned how much capital Lee and Bitmine has.

“ETH treasury company Bitmine invests $200,000,000 in MrBeast's ‘Beast Industries,” he wrote on X. How much money do you have Fundstrat?”

Lee has said Bitmine is targeting ownership of 5% of ETH's total supply, a strategy he has dubbed the “Alchemy of 5%.”

He argues that reaching that level would significantly expand staking revenue and deepen the firm's role in institutional crypto infrastructure.

Lee told Ark Invest chief executive  Cathie Wood in November that Bitmine plans to launch a company-run Ethereum staking operation “very soon.”

Once operational, he said, the firm could earn a pre-tax yield of about 2.79% on its Ethereum holdings, potentially converting a large portion of its reserves into a recurring revenue stream.

Addressing concerns about network concentration, Lee said ownership levels even approaching 10% would not undermine Ethereum's decentralization.



“If someone has 10% of a system, they aren't in control of it,” Lee said.

Separately, Lee has repeatedly reiterated his bullish stance on Ethereum's price outlook.

Lee recently told investors that while Ethereum could briefly dip toward $2,500, the upside remains substantial.

“We think that ETH can be $7,000 to $9,000 by the end of January,” Lee said.

In a recent note to shareholders, Lee said that if Bitcoin reaches $250,000, Ethereum could trade between $12,000 and $22,000 based on historical price ratios.

In more aggressive scenarios, he said ETH could climb as high as $250,000 if Bitcoin were to reach $1 million.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum has begun to show renewed bullish momentum, according to Victor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN.

Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, Olanrewaju said Ethereum is approaching resistance near $3,175.

“If buyers push through, the next targets lie between $3,508 and $3,782,” he said.

On the downside, a break below immediate support around $3,050 could see Ethereum test levels near $2,621.

Meanwhile, on-chain data shows Bitmine continues to scale its Ethereum exposure, having staked an additional 154,208 ETH, worth about $479 million.

As of Tuesday, the firm's total Ethereum holdings stood at roughly 1.34 million ETH, valued at around $4.17 billion.

Oops, something went wrong

The broader crypto market is showing renewed strength, with the Bitcoin price surging past $97,000 earlier this week.

There is growing market chatter around a strong altcoin season in Q1 2026, as the Russell 2000 index hits record highs this month in January.

On-chain data suggests traders are increasingly willing to take on more risk while positioning for a potential altcoin recovery.

Altcoins have been showing strength recently, with top assets like Ethereum , BNB , Solana , showing strong gains on the weekly chart.

On-chain indicators confirm strength in the altcoin space, with most assets showing a long-to-short ratio above 1. Privacy coins, led by Monero (XMR), have also been drawing increased attention recently.

Crypto analytics platform Alphractel noted that the long positions are currently dominating over the short positions.

The chart below shows that higher-ranked altcoins, with smaller market capitalizations, are posting even stronger ratios.

The trend points to increasing risk appetite among traders, signaling rising confidence in a broader altcoin recovery.

From an investor psychology perspective, many altcoins have corrected by 80%-90%.

As a result, investors who are already facing significant losses have little incentive to sell and are instead choosing to hold their positions.

Another popular crypto market analyst, Crypto Patel, noted that the altcoins vs Bitcoin chart is showing signs of a bottom formation.

He expects the next “altseason” in 2026 to be larger than the 2017 and 2021 cycles combined, citing a key technical setup in the OTHERS/BTC chart.

According to Patel, OTHERS/BTC has returned to a major support level that previously occurred before every major altcoin cycle.

He highlighted that similar conditions led to rallies of roughly 423% in 2017 and 503% in 2021.

If the historical pattern repeats, Patel expects a move of 702% in 2026.

The Russell 2000 index, reflecting small-cap stocks, is showing major strength after hitting a fresh all-time high in January. This highlights renewed strength in U.S. small-cap stocks, setting up a strong backdrop for risk assets.

In just the first 15 days of 2026, the index has risen 7%, adding $220 billion to its market cap.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt noted that the index has broken out from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, prompting him to take a long position.

With the market seemingly shifting its stance from bullish to bearish, the question of whether altcoins' recent rallies will survive or not is arising. While some altcoins might depend on external developments, others are still following BTC's cues.

Thus, BeInCrypto has analysed three such altcoins that could surprise investors over the weekend.

Chiliz appears set for a potentially bullish weekend after unveiling its Chiliz 2030 vision. The long-term roadmap focuses on scaling the sports blockchain and expanding real-world adoption. This strategic update has improved sentiment around CHZ, positioning the altcoin favorably as investors assess future network growth prospects.

While the announcement alone may not spark a full recovery, it could sustain interest following CHZ's 30% weekly rally. Trading at $0.057, CHZ may consolidate near current levels. Holding above $0.053 would indicate stability, suggesting buyers remain engaged through the weekend despite limited immediate catalysts.

Downside risks persist as momentum indicators flash caution. The Money Flow Index signals overbought conditions, implying buying pressure may be saturated. If profit-taking emerges, CHZ could slip below $0.053. A deeper pullback toward $0.050 would invalidate the neutral outlook and confirm short-term bearish pressure.

DASH has emerged as one of the week's top performers, surging 114% in just seven days. The altcoin now trades near $80, fueled by aggressive buying momentum. Despite the strong rally, DASH remains 24.8% below the $100 milestone, keeping traders focused on whether upside strength can persist.

The recent DASH price surge followed increased merchant adoption, highlighted by Alchemy Pay onboarding the network. However, momentum indicators raise caution. The Chaikin Money Flow shows a bearish divergence, with price printing higher highs while CMF weakens. This suggests capital outflows are rising beneath the rally, increasing downside risk.

If selling pressure accelerates, DASH could lose the $74 support and slide toward $63 in the short term. Such a move would confirm a corrective phase. Conversely, renewed inflows could stabilize price action. Sustained demand would allow DASH to extend gains and challenge the $100 level next week.

Another one of the altcoins to watch this weekend is POL, which delivered a volatile January performance, rallying 46% last week as bullish sentiment dominated early trading. That momentum faded quickly. Heightened market uncertainty triggered sharp swings, pushing POL down 15.6% this week. 

The abrupt reversal highlights fragile confidence and highlights how quickly speculative demand can unwind.

Capital flows have weakened materially over recent sessions, making POL one of the first altcoins to lose investor support. The Chaikin Money Flow shows inflows drying up entirely. If outflows take control, downside pressure could intensify. Under such conditions, POL price risks sliding toward the $0.138 support zone.

A bullish reversal remains possible if sentiment improves across the broader market. Renewed accumulation could allow POL to reclaim $0.155 as support. Holding that level would restore short-term confidence. With sustained buying, POL could extend a recovery move toward $0.183, negating the current bearish outlook.

A strategic shift has led to multibillion-dollar contracts for Cipher Mining.

Once purely a Bitcoin mining company, Cipher Mining (CIFR +10.39%) announced a pivot to high-performance computing (HPC) in late 2024. It's still reliant on mining operations for now. Over the first three quarters of 2025, it earned $164.2 million, all from Bitcoin mining.

Even though the HPC infrastructure initiative isn't reflected in Cipher's financials yet, early indications suggest that it could unlock significant new revenue streams.

Image source: Getty Images.

Many mining companies have shifted their operations toward artificial intelligence (AI) and HPC data centers in recent years. What sets Cipher apart is that it has quickly landed massive deals with major tech companies.

In September 2025, Cipher announced an HPC colocation agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud platform. The initial 10-year term is worth approximately $3 billion, and the deal includes two five-year extension options that would bring the total value to approximately $7 billion. In November, Cipher and Fluidstack signed an additional AI hosting agreement worth approximately $830 million, or approximately $2 billion if both extensions are exercised.

Also in November, Cipher announced a 15-year lease agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide turnkey space and power for AI workloads. The deal is worth approximately $5.5 billion.

Cipher stock is up 255% over the last year, and it's now trading at 32 times trailing sales as of Jan. 12. It's expensive by that metric, but sales could ramp up quickly in 2026. Lease payments are expected to start in August for the AWS deal, and in October for the Fluidstack deal.

Each agreement could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue for Cipher. With that in mind, and given the rising demand for AI infrastructure, this blockchain stock could have massive growth potential.

Fri 16th January 2026

Blockchain technology allows tradable tokens for physical gold. Mamadou Toure, founder of Ubuntu Tribe, explains how the system works to Lennox Yieke.

Africa holds about 30% of global mineral reserves and nearly 40% of the world's gold. Yet extractive economic models rooted in colonial-era practices continue to funnel this wealth to a narrow elite and foreign investors, leaving the vast majority of Africans excluded from the riches beneath their feet. 

Mamadou Toure, founder and chief executive of the Ubuntu Tribe company, is determined to fix this through blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. His company sets out to offer a new way to access fractional shares of gold through tradeable digital tokens. 

“Today with blockchain you can tokenise an asset, meaning issue a certificate of ownership of this asset. We have issued what we call $GIFT, which stands for gold international fungible token and is equivalent to one milligram of gold,” he tells African Business.

Toure explains that each $GIFT is backed one-to-one by physical gold. What changes hands is the digital certificate of ownership, transferred at prevailing market prices on the blockchain. “You can still have the gold [in vaults] in Zurich, Stuttgart, Copenhagen or Dubai – like we do – but issue a digital certificate of ownership on blockchain so that people who are in Africa can own a piece of that gold,” he says. Each token represents just one milligramme of gold, so savers can gain exposure for as little as 10 US cents. 

Ubuntu Tribe has partnered with local fintechs and mobile money operators to ensure that users of its wallet in Africa can move between local currencies, mobile money and crypto. 

$GIFT has recorded more than $100m in trading volume across exchanges since its launch in late 2023, Toure says. He reports serving over 30,000 customers, with more than 10,000 downloads of its digital wallet to date. 

“We took two years to build a robust, globally competitive, compliant system,” he says, noting that the company is fully regulated in Europe and is in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Kenya and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). 

Toure says: “in 2026 we are adding between $1bn and $1.2bn worth of gold into the system to match growing demand.” Much of this demand, he argues, stems from gold's ability to act as a hedge against inflation when many African currencies – including the Nigerian naira, Ghanaian cedi and Egyptian pound – have depreciated significantly. And “since 2000, gold has gained more than 1,300% against the dollar. In just the past five years, it has surged nearly 800% against the naira, eroding purchasing power of savers. Gold helps correct this unfairness – where you can work as hard as possible, but if you're in Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Douala or Johannesburg, the fruits of your labour vanish because the currency you saved in has significantly depreciated,” Toure says. 

Gold prices soared more than 70% in 2025, the metal's strongest annual performance since 1979. In late December it (briefly) traded above $4,500 an ounce – up from $2,685 at the close of 2024. This rally has been driven by factors ranging from central banks' purchases to investor flight to safe-haven assets. 

Analysts remain broadly bullish on gold's outlook, with JP Morgan Global Research projecting prices around $5,400 an ounce by the end of 2027. Yet gold, like any asset, is bound by a fundamental rule of financial markets: past performance is not indicative of future results. There is no guarantee that gold prices will continue to rise. 

But do holders of $GIFT tokens really understand these risks – and, more importantly, do they have the skills to construct portfolios that can effectively weather inevitable market corrections?

Toure says the company has embedded several tools into its wallet to help address this. The platform offers exposure to other digital assets, including Bitcoin and a range of cryptocurrencies, enabling users to diversify their holdings and reduce concentration risks.

The company also provides users with educational resources. “We have put a strong emphasis on the Ubuntu Academy, which helps non-crypto natives and those without financial literacy to effectively onboard and grow,” Toure explains. He points to the company's investment in an AI-powered tool designed to provide bite-sized, conversational guidance on gold, savings, risk and tokenisation – delivered in plain language, tailored to the user's context and available around the clock.

“Our game is not just to make people rich for the sake of being rich. It is to create a generation of well-informed and well-prepared citizens who can navigate the risks and opportunities of investment,” Toure says. 

Toure is confident that $GIFT's adoption will extend beyond retail users to small businesses, corporates and institutions. He argues that more companies are looking to deploy tokenised gold to hedge against currency depreciation, strengthen purchasing power and enhance financial performance through exposure to diverse asset classes. 

Institutional investors, he says, “are very interested, especially because our gold is regulated, so they're not taking any regulatory risk by buying our token. And it's audited, which gives them comfort that there is real gold backing it,” Toure says.

The company in December announced a partnership with Global Settlement Network (GSN), a fintech firm developing blockchain infrastructure, to slash Africa–EU transfer times from weeks to seconds and bring more than $5bn worth of gold on-chain. The initiative aims to use tokenised gold as the settlement asset, sidestepping the costly reliance on dollar-based correspondent banking. According to the two companies, the roadmap begins with a 12‑month pilot focused on gold traceability and a cross-border foreign exchange (FX) corridor. This will be followed by programmable gold tokens, stablecoin FX pools and, he says, integrations with government and central bank systems by 2028.

Before becoming a full-time entrepreneur, Toure spent two decades in senior finance roles, including stints at KPMG, BNP Paribas Investment Banking and the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private lending arm. He later joined General Electric as managing director for investments and project finance in sub-Saharan Africa. Asked why he traded a stable career for the uncertainties of entrepreneurship, the Cameroonian is candid: “Outside your comfort zone is where the magic happens.

“I believed the financial system had reached its limits and someone had to act if Africa was truly to be given a chance. I've always had this thing where, when I see something that isn't working, I feel compelled to fix it,” he says. “The way the financial system is structured today, I can't really say it works to the advantage of the continent. What I saw in blockchain was the possibility of something different.”

Toure believes that tokenising other natural resources could help Africa move beyond GDP as the central measure of economic might. “There is a contrast between GDP, which is cash value, and wealth, which is asset value. Africa is not poor, just illiquid.”

He adds that GDP is also a flawed measure because it measures production in fiat currencies: “if the paper [fiat currency] that you have loses value against other papers, while you don't even control it, what does your GDP really mean?” 

He admits that trying to rewrite Africa's financial and economic rulebook has inevitably stirred silent resistance from those who benefit from the status quo. “It has honestly been tough. When I left traditional finance with all the awards, titles and big positions, I became nobody overnight. And worse than becoming nobody, you become someone people avoid, because you're touching the one thing they told you never to touch,” he says.

Quant finance has always lived close to technology, so when AI tools got better, faster, and easier to use, the obvious question followed: Is quant finance at risk from AI?
We read about layoffs, automation, and “AI traders” almost daily. So it makes sense to wonder whether this field is actually being replaced or just quietly changing.

Let's get straight to what people working in quant roles are actually seeing, without hype and without comfort talk.

If you are trying to understand AI beyond headlines and use it responsibly in finance or analytics roles, grounding yourself through an AI Certification helps separate real capability from marketing noise.

Inside quant communities, the dominant concern is not that AI will fully replace quants.

The concern is this:

This is why the conversation feels tense. Even if AI does not replace the role, it can still reduce how many people a firm hires.

Quant professionals are very careful about what they mean by AI.

They separate:

Most community discussions strongly push back against the idea that chat-style AI equals trading intelligence.

Common points raised:

This is why many quants see AI as a productivity layer, not a strategy engine.

There is strong agreement on where AI already helps.

Common, trusted uses include:

These tasks used to take a lot of time. Now they take much less.

That is exactly why output per person rises and hiring pressure increases.

This is where practitioners are very blunt.

AI struggles badly with:

Quant finance is unforgiving. Being “almost right” is not acceptable when real money and risk are involved.

This is why firms still require:

Based on community discussions, some roles feel more pressure than others.

More exposed areas:

These tasks are easiest for AI to accelerate, which is why junior hiring pipelines feel squeezed.

Other parts of quant work remain firmly human-led.

More resilient areas:

These roles require judgment, accountability, and deep domain context. AI can assist, but it cannot own the outcome.

A practical way to understand the shift looks like this:

This is not a collapse of quant finance. It is a reshaping of how teams are built.

Understanding this shift early is easier if you already have strong foundations in systems, modeling, and tooling, which is where structured paths like a Tech Certification become useful alongside finance knowledge.

The takeaway is simple and practical.

Quant finance is not disappearing. But it is becoming:

To stay relevant:

Teams are not paying for output anymore. They are paying for judgment.

Is quant finance at risk from AI?
Not in the way headlines suggest.

AI is not replacing quants wholesale. It is compressing teams, changing hiring patterns, and raising the bar on what it means to be valuable in the role.

The future belongs to quants who use AI as a force multiplier, not as a replacement for responsibility, reasoning, and risk ownership.

 By NFTPlazas Editorial Team

The digital asset world is still changing at an astounding rate. By 2025, the story has changed to use-case adoption speculative mania, especially at the point of crypto exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both of which are forming the basis of what many are calling Web3 ownership.

As either an experienced investor or a curious beginner, it is evident that the mechanisms of redefining the process of ownership and value creation and exchange are no longer limited to just Bitcoin or DeFi. Rather, they exist in an ecosystem of dynamism, a conglomeration of marketplaces and tokenized collectibles, decentralized identity systems, and the strong infrastructure of crypto exchanges.

Slow 2025 start. The NFT market has demonstrated revived strength. A recent industry report indicates that NFT trading volume has increased by 30 percent in October to $546 million, and has sold more than 10 million (the most of any month in the year) NFTs. Such an upward trend indicates that valuable utility and involvement are substituting for hypothetical buzz.

At the same time, the markets of cryptocurrencies in the world have shown significant expansion. The Q3 2025 Crypto Industry Report by CoinGecko put forward that spot trading volumes on the centralized exchanges expanded by +31.6 QoQ, and it is an incredible figure of +5.1 trillion, evidencing the increase in the depth and liquidity of the market. 

The trends are an indicator that the digital assets and Web3 applications are becoming more mature, and NFTs are increasingly being traded, acquired, and used outside of mere collectibles.

The NFT, in simple words, is a blockchain that is a cryptographically distinct digital asset that is moved. In contrast to cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible (i.e., one bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin), NFTs are one-of-a-kind and indivisible. This renders them effective instruments for displaying digital art, song, in-game goods, real-life assets, and even identity credentials.

The concept of real digital ownership is at the core of the Web3 vision, where people possess their goods with no middlemen or centralized platforms. NFTs embody this by allowing:

When people think of the notion of a crypto exchange, they subconsciously think of quick trading, market orders, or price charts. However, the power of exchanges goes much deeper during the Web3 age. Regardless of being centralized or decentralized, exchanges now serve as access points, not only to buying and selling assets, but also to the overall Web3 ecosystem.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are starting to add support for NFTs to it, providing users with an opportunity to:

Modern exchanges are evolving into multi-functional platforms where tradable assets, NFTs, and DeFi utilities coexist. A Crypto Exchange Platform today is not just about trading digital coins. it's about facilitating entry into Web3 ownership itself.

With these crypto exchanges taking an ever larger presence in the Web3 ecosystem, services such as XBO.com show how contemporary exchange systems are evolving to this new reality. XBO.com enables access to digital assets, NFTs, and wider blockchain utilities, which is why it represents the rising tendency of exchanges to define themselves as portal, and not trading, platforms. This development is essential because users are seeking safe, user-friendly spaces in which they can navigate ownership in tokens, NFTs and new Web3 applications not by moving in and out of fragmented tools and spaces.

Industry reports confirm this trend:

The centralized exchange spot volumes have increased to 5.1 trillion during Q3 2025, which indicates high trading rates and capital flow in digital finance. 

The volume of trading in NFT markets had increased dramatically in terms of quarterly trading volume, as at OpenSea, its activity grew 136 percent between Q2 and Q3 2025.

Crypto exchanges act as on-ramps  bringing users, liquidity, and tools into the decentralized world.

Exchanges provide user-friendly interfaces that simplify:

This accessibility empowers people to acquire NFTs and participate in Web3 ownership without deep technical expertise.

By listing NFT-related tokens  or even fractionalized NFTs, exchanges create secondary markets that boost liquidity and price discovery. Higher liquidity directly supports:

Numerous exchanges currently have a component of decentralized finance (DeFi) that supports users to stake assets, generate yields, and interact directly with smart contracts, all with NFTs or tokens that reflect ownership rights.

Although profile pictures and speculation on NFTs were early aspects of their perception by the general population, the utility of NFTs is quickly growing:

NFTs are the pillars of virtual worlds and games to earn. Instead, these tokens symbolize the ownership of in-game land, skins, items, and characters, making gamers real stakeholders. (colexion.io)

Identity NFTs are coming into the limelight as digital credentials that are owned and operated by their owners in their entirety, which is crucial when it comes to trustless verification, reputation systems, and access rights safety.

NFTs are currently being examined to tokenize real estate, collectibles, luxury goods, and even carbon credits, and it can be challenging to tell whether you truly own them or not.

Even in the context of rapid development, there are still serious challenges:

The trading volumes and values of NFTs continue to vary significantly, and a lot of investors are wary; only a small fraction of them believe that there will be a stable NFT recovery without any apparent use. (Reddit)

Governments all over the world are struggling with the treatment of digital assets, NFTs, and underlying technologies – creating compliance issues with exchanges and marketplaces.

Mainstream users can be discouraged with regard to wallet safety, privacy key management, and transaction charges. Crossover bridges between conventional and crypto are yet to be perfected.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and NFTs are no longer exclusive to the early adopters – they are becoming the most available path to owning a Web3. With an exchange that goes beyond mere trading platforms, users can now be linked to NFTs, tokenized assets, and decentralized apps in a manner that is easy, straightforward, and scalable.

The rejuvenated resurgence of NFT activity can be seen as a definite transition towards practical use, no longer gaming assets and digital identity, but the material worth of the blockchain. Cryptocurrency exchanges are valuable to this change because they facilitate, enhance liquidity, and make Web3 entry accessible to regular users.

With the continued maturation of the digital economy, ownership will shift less and less from centralized platforms and towards individuals. In that future, crypto exchanges will not only facilitate transactions but will also be the main entry point into Web3, where people not only interact with digital assets but also own them.

A class action lawsuit alleges that he promoted NFTs without disclosing endorsements

Steve Aoki is at the centre of a class action lawsuit after being accused of influencing purchases of “worthless” NFTs, and was allegedly paid for doing so.

Aoki is being sued along with Matthew Kalish, the co-founder of sports betting company DraftKings (per Law.com), and faced a federal court in Miami on Tuesday, January 6.

The suit alleges that both Aoki and Kalish influenced their social media followers to purchase NFTs (non-fungible tokens) from Metazoo, a now-shuttered NFT trading company.

Mixmag merch is here: Shop the collection 

It also accuses both men of being paid an undisclosed sum to promote Metazoo, which Aoki became a part-owner of in 2021, and left those who invested with losses since it became defunct.

Attorney Evan Berger reportedly filed the class action lawsuit, arguing that some NFTs promoted were priced as high as $150,000, which are now ""worthless"", according to the suit.

“There are a number of class actions now against viable companies where the same thing has happened,” Berger said (via Law.com).

“There is a specific set of rules that are in place to protect consumers, and it's of great importance that influencers know and understand those rules, because they are requirements and not suggestions.”

In 2022, Steve Aoki stopped his show mid-performance and pulled up a picture of the $859,000 NFT he'd recently purchased to show his crowds.

Aoki paused the music, turned his phone around, and said: “Check this little gorgeous alien out. Look at him! I had to stop the music because I'm so fucking excited. This is the Steve Aoki doodle, take a good look guys!”

Written & Edited by Lockridge Okoth

Pudgy Penguins announced a landmark partnership with Premier League football giant Manchester City.

This marks one of the most high-profile crossovers yet between a native Web3 brand and global sports fandom.

The collaboration will launch an exclusive NFT collection alongside premium merchandise, expanding Pudgy Penguins' reach far beyond the traditional crypto audience.

“We're excited to announce that we will be collaborating with Man City on a premium collectible and merch release to bring Pengu to the millions of Man City fans around the world,” wrote Pudgy Penguins in a post.

The team added that the partnership is designed to work both ways. This means bringing PENGU to their fans globally, while also introducing Man City to the wider Pudgy Penguins audience.

The NFT collection and merchandise drop is scheduled for January 17, 2026, and will be targeted at an 18+ audience.

With Pudgy Penguins citing “high-end collectible and merch drop,” it signals emphasis on premium positioning rather than mass-market NFTs. This strategy mirrors recent shifts across the sector toward quality, brand recognition, and real-world cultural relevance.

It is worth noting what this partnership means for Pudgy Penguins, as it represents a significant strategic expansion. Manchester City boasts one of the largest and most commercially engaged global fanbases in football.

This offers Pudgy Penguins access to millions of potential customers already accustomed to spending on licensed merchandise and collectibles tied to their favorite club.

By aligning with a top-tier sports brand, Pudgy Penguins continues its push to position PENGU as a mainstream intellectual property rather than a purely crypto-native character.

The move also highlights how established sports organizations are increasingly experimenting with digital collectibles after earlier NFT cycles faltered.

Rather than launching speculative standalone NFTs, collaborations like this focus on brand storytelling, physical merchandise, and fandom. Notably, these are areas where football clubs already excel.

Despite the headline-grabbing announcement, the PENGU token showed no immediate or notable price reaction.

The PENGU price is down by almost 5% over the last 24 hours and was trading at $0.01222 as of this writing.

This partnership appears to be more of a long-term brand play than a short-term trading catalyst. Still, sentiment around the token remains broadly optimistic.

People want “the next runner”The runner is still $PENGUConviction feels stupid before it feels genius pic.twitter.com/EpEPFV9IWv

Tazman, another popular user on X, pointed to broader ecosystem momentum, indicating that the PENGU price could still see further upside in 2026.  

“…just look at how $PENGU is ripping in 2026, up 60% since 2025!!!! Be confident about 2026, the penguins will make themselves known loud and clear,” wrote Tazman.

Tazman noted that many major projects, including OKX and Crypto.com, are already referencing penguins in their posts.

While price action remains muted for now, the Pudgy Penguins–Manchester City partnership mirrors a broader trend. Successful Web3 brands are increasingly competing on cultural relevance and global reach.

This is in contrast to focusing solely on on-chain metrics, and narrowly resembles what BitMine has just done.

If executed well, the January 17 launch could become a blueprint for how NFTs intersect with mainstream sports fandom in the next phase of crypto adoption.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","APEMARS Crypto Project Launches After Bitcoin and Tron ICO Era, Citing Projected Returns of Up to 22,367% Ahead of Closing Phase","https://www.tribuneindia.com/partner-exclusives/apemars-crypto-project-launches-after-bitcoin-and-tron-ico-era-citing-projected-returns-of-up-to-22367-ahead-of-closing-phase/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:42:00 GMT","

Few things haunt crypto investors more than the ""what if"" of missed ICOs. Bitcoin in 2009 felt like a geeky experiment. Early buyers turned tiny investments into life-changing wealth as it became digital gold. Tron in 2017 rode the blockchain hype wave, delivering big returns to those who joined its ICO before it powered decentralized entertainment empires. These weren't obvious wins at the time; they started with quiet traction, strong narratives, and community momentum that exploded later, leaving most watching from the sidelines.



The good news? Patterns repeat, and right now APEMARS ($APRZ) is teasing that same early-stage magic in a fun, meme-driven package, with emerging as the name among the best crypto projects. This story of Commander Ape's accidental Mars mission surviving 225 million km on bananas and grit has its presale live in Stage 3 (BANANA BOOST) at just $0.00002448 per token, with a planned listing at $0.0055. That creates a potential 22,367% ROI from current pricing (based on price math, not guaranteed). The real teaser? Buy in during presale, stake your tokens, and unlock 63% APY rewards two months after listing, turning your position into a yield machine while the story unfolds. Add referral bonuses (9.34% extra tokens per qualified invite over $22), and it's free crypto layered on top. With stages selling fast (earlier ones gone in hours/days, current momentum at 300+ holders and $75k+ raised), this feels like one of those rare redemption shots savvy investors chase. Let's dig more into these stories.



Bitcoin launched in 2009, not as a traditional ICO, but through a free distribution via mining and early giveaways often called the original ""missed ICO"" opportunity. Early adopters who grabbed BTC for pennies (or even nothing) saw astronomical returns as it evolved from a niche experiment into the king of crypto. A $100 investment back then would now be worth millions, with Bitcoin's market cap hitting around $1.93 trillion as of January 2025. Today, BTC trades at approximately $96,800 USD, up about 1.3% in the last 24 hours, cementing its status as one of the best crypto projects ever.



The drama lies in how many dismissed it as worthless code, yet those who believed early turned tiny bets into life-changing wealth. With a circulating supply nearing 20 million coins and a max cap of 21 million, Bitcoin's scarcity drove its dominance. It's a stark reminder: the best crypto projects often start quietly, build unstoppable momentum, and reward patient believers massively.

Tron (TRX) raised about $70 million in its 2017 ICO, with tokens sold at around $0.0019 each, making it a classic ""missed ICO"" story for those who jumped in during the frenzy. Early investors who held through the ups and downs watched TRX climb dramatically, hitting an all-time high of $0.44 in late 2024. As of January 2025, TRX trades at about $0.304 USD, with a market cap of roughly $28.8 billion and a slight dip of 1% in the last 24 hours, still delivering strong long-term ROI from its ICO price.



The project promised decentralized content and entertainment, and while it faced early skepticism, its focus on smart contracts and high throughput turned it into a top-10 player. Tron's story shows how the best crypto projects can ride hype waves to real adoption, turning modest early entries into significant gains for those who didn't miss the boat.

History has a way of repeating itself in crypto. Projects that start small, build real community interest, and offer clear early advantages often turn into the ones people talk about years later. Bitcoin and Tron did exactly that for those who got in before the crowds arrived. Now, in January 2026, a new story is unfolding with APEMARS ($APRZ), a project that's blending a fun ape-to-Mars adventure with solid mechanics. As one of the best crypto projects gaining traction right now, it's drawing eyes from investors who learned from past misses and aren't keen on repeating them.



The presale is active in Stage 3 right now, priced at $0.00002448 per token. With the planned listing at $0.0055, the price difference suggests a potential return of around 22,367% from this point (based on simple math, markets can change, of course). Recent numbers from the official site show $85,654 raised overall, Stage 3 already 87% sold, and a countdown sitting at about two days and a few hours left (or until the tokens run out). Over 380 people have joined in recent updates, and earlier stages moved even faster. Stage 1 cleared in hours, Stage 2 in a day. This kind of speed tells me demand is building quickly, and waiting could mean paying more soon.

Market trends tracked by the best crypto to buy now indicate growing demand for presale-driven projects.

What makes a project stand out early? Usually a mix of an engaging idea, fair structure, and people jumping in because they see the value before everyone else does. APEMARS fits that pattern with its light-hearted tale of Commander Ape accidentally blasting off to Mars on sheer determination and bananas. It's not just a story; it's tied to the presale's 23 stages, each one marking a step in that journey. Right now, Stage 3 is live, and at 87% sold with the timer ticking down, this feels like one of those moments where acting early could make a big difference later. Investors who caught Bitcoin or Tron at their quiet starts know the feeling: regret hits hard when the opportunity passes.

With APEMARS ($APRZ) in Stage 3 at $0.00002448 per token and listing targeted at $0.0055, a $2,500 investment buys you roughly 102 million tokens.

If it hits the listing price, that position could be worth about $561,000 (simple price math: Rs 22,367% potential return from here). Not guaranteed crypto moves with the market, but the presale-to-listing gap is what creates the opportunity.

Extra layers add more:

Stage 3 is 87% sold with Rs 2 days left (or until tokens run out). Earlier stages sold in hours. The next stage means a higher price and fewer tokens per dollar.

Getting started is easy, but with the stage nearing its end, timing matters. Visit APEMARS (double-check the site to stay safe), connect a wallet like MetaMask, and choose how much to buy with ETH or supported options. Tokens arrive in your wallet right away, with no complicated steps.

Once you have them, set up staking through the project's tools to lock in that 63% APY (rewards begin two months post-listing for stability). Then grab your referral link from the dashboard, share it, and when friends join with $22 or more, you both earn 9.34% extra tokens. It's built to grow the community naturally while putting more in your pocket.

The total supply is fixed at 70 billion tokens, with half going through this presale across 23 stages and burns planned at later checkpoints to reduce what's available over time. The contract is on Ethereum and has been checked for security.



The stories of Bitcoin and Tron remind us how the best crypto projects often start small and reward people who jump in early. Those who wait usually regret it later. In January 2026, APEMARS ($APRZ) feels like one of those moments. It has a fun story about an ape reaching Mars, plus real features like 63% APY staking (starting two months after listing), referral bonuses for extra free tokens, and a presale that's moving fast. Stage 3 is at $0.00002448, already 87% sold, with just about two days left.

Crypto is full of missed chances, but every so often, a new one gives you a real opportunity to get in from the start. APEMARS is showing that kind of promise right now, one of the best crypto projects with good momentum and smart design. If you're looking to add something new to your investments, take a quick look at apemars.com before Stage 3 ends. The timer is ticking, and these windows don't stay open long. Sometimes the best decision is to act now.



Investing early in Bitcoin, one of the best crypto projects, could have turned small amounts into millions. For example, $100 in 2009 might be worth over $100 million today due to its scarcity and adoption. Many regret missing it, but lessons highlight spotting innovative projects like APEMARS now to avoid future regrets.

Tron remains a solid choice among the best crypto projects, with its focus on decentralized entertainment and a market cap of around $28 billion. While early ICO buyers saw huge gains, current prices at $0.30 offer entry for long-term holders betting on growth in dApps and content. Research thoroughly before investing.

Many ICOs fail due to scams, poor planning, or market shifts, with studies showing over 90 percent not succeeding. Among the best crypto projects that thrive, success comes from strong teams and real utility. Failed ones often lack transparency or deliver on promises, leading investors to seek vetted presales like APEMARS.

Look for strong narratives, audited tech, and community buzz in the best crypto projects. Check tokenomics, roadmaps, and presale traction. Early signs like Bitcoin's innovation or Tron's hype can repeat in gems like APEMARS, with its meme appeal and staking rewards. Always diversify and research risks.

APEMARS is a meme coin inspired by an ape's Mars journey, positioning itself among the best crypto projects with deflationary burns and 63 percent APY staking. Its presale is live in Stage 3 at $0.00002448, targeting a $0.0055 listing for a potential 22,367 percent ROI. Join via apemars.com before it sells out.

Samson Mow, a vocal Bitcoin proponent and CEO of JAN3, who is focused on Bitcoin nation-state adoption, has once again drawn the community's attention to unique BTC features that make it the most decentralized digital currency on the market. Mow is known as one of the believers that BTC is definitely going to surge to $1 million in the near future.

Today, he took to his X account to remind the audience about the thing that makes Bitcoin what it is and drives Wall Street to chase it — the programmed scarcity of this cryptocurrency.

Mow issues important message

Samson Mow reminded the crypto community that there can only exist 21 million Bitcoin. In his tweet, he predicted that this feature of BTC will play a crucial role in the near future and have a huge impact on the world of finance: “The world is about to learn the meaning of absolute scarcity.”

The world is about to learn the meaning of absolute scarcity.

It is worth noting that more than 19 million coins have already been mined. Besides, the Bitcoin mining mechanism includes so-called halvings, created to make BTC deflationary. Every four years, miners' rewards get cut by half, thus less BTC gets injected into circulation every four years.

JAN3 boss reveals when Bitcoin may surge to $1 million

Earlier this week, Samson Mow shared the time period when he expects Bitcoin to definitely skyrocket to $1 million, and perhaps even higher. This time frame is 2031-2033. He reckons that it will be possible since Bitcoin is likely to add roughly $150,000 to its price every year before then.

During some of those years, he expects Bitcoin to print Omega candles, while in some years, Bitcoin may trade sideways, letting investors stock up on it.

What's more, Mow believes that if either option hits strong enough, Bitcoin may reach $1 million sooner than 2031.

At press time, Bitcoin is changing hands at $95,250. Over the past three days, the world's bellwether cryptocurrency has demonstrated a decline of roughly 2.75%, as it rolled down from a local peak of $97,950 — the highest price level seen by BTC over the past couple of months.

Currently, Bitcoin is largely reacting to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and other countries, including trade tariffs imposed by the U.S. on them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Is stablecoin the future of money?","https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20260116/stablecoin-future-money-part-1","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:09:29 GMT","

This article is the first in a two-part feature.



Back in the summer of last year, I published a four-part series on Bitcoin in The Gleaner (2/July/25). In that series, I tried to cut through the hype and explain what Bitcoin really is, not just the token, but the technology behind it. 

      I also touched briefly on something called a “stablecoin”. The name itself is telling. If you have to call something “stable”, it's probably because everything else around it is unstable. And that's exactly the case with crypto.  

Bitcoin, the poster child of cryptocurrency, is famously volatile. One day it's up 20 per cent, the next it's down 30 per cent. That kind of rollercoaster ride might be thrilling for traders, but it's a nightmare for anyone trying to use it like money. In fact, in Part 1 of that series, I made it clear: Bitcoin will never replace money. Why? Because money, to be useful, must be stable. And that's where stablecoins come in.  

At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that tries to do what Bitcoin can't, stay still. It's designed to hold a steady value, usually by being tied, or “pegged” to something we already trust, like the US dollar or the Euro. So while Bitcoin might swing from US$30,000 to US$60,000 in a matter of weeks, a stablecoin like USDC or USDT is supposed to stay at $1.00, give or take a cent.  

Now, how does it do that? Well, there are a few different models. Some stablecoins are backed by actual cash in a bank account, every digital coin matched by a real dollar somewhere. Others are backed by other cryptocurrencies, using smart contracts to keep the price in check. And then there are the algorithmic ones, which try to manage supply and demand with code alone. That last group? Let's just say they've had a rough ride. You may remember TerraUSD? It collapsed in spectacular fashion (Google TerraUSD).  

But regardless of the model, all stablecoins have one thing in common: they run on a blockchain, multiple blockchains in some cases. That means they inherit the same benefits as Bitcoin – speed, transparency, and the ability to move money across borders without needing a bank. Most of them live on Ethereum, but you'll also find them on Solana, Tron, and other blockchain networks.  

So what's the big deal? Why are people so excited about stablecoins?  

For starters, they solve a real problem. If you're a business owner, you can't afford to accept payment in something that might lose half its value before you restock your shelves. Stablecoins offer the speed and efficiency of crypto without the stomach-churning volatility. 

They're also a lifeline for people in countries with unstable currencies. Imagine living in a place where your pay packet loses value every week. Holding a dollar-pegged stablecoin could be a way to preserve your savings.  

But let's not get carried away. Stablecoins aren't perfect. Many of them are issued by private companies, which means you have to trust that those companies actually have the reserves they claim. And regulators are circling. Governments don't like the idea of private money floating around outside their control. So the future of stablecoins is still very much up in the air.  

They're like cousins who grew up in very different households. Bitcoin is wild, independent, and allergic to authority. It's a store of value, like digital gold. Stablecoins, on the other hand, are the straight-laced sibling – predictable, practical, and designed for everyday use. But here's the twist; they actually work well together. Traders use stablecoins to move in and out of Bitcoin positions without touching traditional banks. And for people who want to dip their toes into crypto without the risk, stablecoins are a gentle entry point.  

In fact, stablecoins are often the bridge between the crypto world and the traditional financial system. They allow people to hold digital dollars without needing a US bank account. They make it easier to send money across borders, to pay freelancers in other countries, or to move funds between crypto exchanges. And because they're programmable, they can be used in smart contracts – automated agreements that execute themselves when certain conditions are met.  

But again, stablecoins aren't silver bullets. The biggest stablecoins today – like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) – are controlled by private companies. That means they're only as trustworthy as the people running them. If those companies mismanage their reserves, or if regulators crack down, the whole system could wobble. We've already seen stablecoins lose their peg before, and when that happens, confidence evaporates quickly.  

Still, the idea behind stablecoins is powerful. They take the best parts of crypto – speed, transparency, global access – and combine them with the stability of traditional money. That's a compelling mix, especially in a world where financial systems are increasingly digital and increasingly global.  

In part 2, we'll look at how stablecoins are changing the game for cross-border trade, how they stack up against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and why geopolitics might be the biggest force shaping their future.  

Stay tuned.

Texas-Based Homebuilder Receives SEC Approval To Launch 'Universal Payments' Token","https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/26/01/49958275/earning-crypto-by-paying-rent-texas-based-homebuilder-receives-sec-approval-to-launch-universal-payments-token","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:22:43 GMT","

Leading real estate developer MegPrime Holding, LLC, said Thursday it will launch a “universal payments” cryptocurrency after receiving approval from the SEC.

The Texas-based homebuilder received a No-Action Letter from the regulator to roll out the cryptocurrency, named MegPrime Token (MP Token).

The token aims to convert routine spending into tangible value and “long-term financial progress.” Users making rent or mortgage payments through MP Token on the MegPrime app could reap up to 20% back in the same token, MegPrime said in a press release.

Furthermore, renters who use MP Token for payments could be eligible to receive 100% of their previous year's rent, capped at $25,000, towards a future home purchase. Qualified users may also avail of mortgage rates up to 2.0% below the market rate.

The token will be available for purchase during its upcoming Token Generation Event and subsequently on the MegPrime app. It is also anticipated to be listed on other third-party cryptocurrency exchanges.

“The integration of blockchain technology into the residential homebuilding space is an economic leap forward and represents what we believe to be the single greatest use case for blockchain technology of our time,” said Aaron Ipour, co-founder of Megatel Homes and MegPrime.

MegPrime described the token as a “utility-based digital currency,” rather than an investment or bank deposit. The blockchain on which the token will be based has not been disclosed.

The development comes as the market remains constrained by high borrowing costs and tight supply.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rates, which were near 2.65% in early 2021, spiked to the mid-6% region last year, impacting household affordability. 

Redfin, a real estate brokerage platform, predicted the rates will average 6.3% in 2026, only a slight dip from 2025. The firm projected rents to rise between 2% and 3% nationwide in 2026.

The world of blockchain development is moving faster than ever before. For coding students, the dream of building a custom network often feels impossible because of the sheer complexity of consensus and cryptography. However, a new standard has arrived to simplify this journey. By using the Substrate framework, developers can now build specialized blockchains without reinventing the wheel.

The ZKP project is a prime example of this modular approach in action. It combines high-level AI compute with deep privacy features. This article explores how modularity via pallets allows for a sophisticated system that stays developer-friendly. It is time to dive into the architecture of the Zero Knowledge Proof ecosystem.

Substrate is a powerful, modular framework designed for building custom blockchains.Developed by Parity Technologies, it allows engineers to focus on the unique features of their project rather than the basic plumbing like networking or database management. Think of it as a professional-grade toolkit that provides the ""skeleton"" of a blockchain. Instead of writing thousands of lines of code from zero, you use Substrate to define how your chain functions. It is written in Rust, which ensures high performance and memory safety. For the Zero Knowledge Proof project, Substrate provides the essential foundation needed to handle complex AI tasks. This framework is what makes the network scalable and interoperable with other chains. By using this modular library, the developers saved years of work, allowing them to ship a fully functional 4-layer blockchain much faster than traditional methods allowed in the past.

The most exciting part of Substrate is the use of ""Pallets."" In simple terms, a pallet is a specific module of code that performs one dedicated job. You can think of pallets like LEGO blocks; you pick the ones you need and snap them together to build your custom application. The Zero Knowledge Proof network uses several specialized pallets to achieve its goals:

By combining these, the network creates a unique environment for decentralized AI. This modular privacy approach ensures that every function is isolated and optimized.

One of the most important components in the ZKP stack is the EVM Pallet. This specific module allows the blockchain to understand and execute ""Solidity"" code, which is the primary language used by Ethereum developers. Because of this pallet, the Zero Knowledge Proof network is fully compatible with existing decentralized applications.

Engineers do not have to rewrite their entire codebase to move their projects over. They can simply deploy their smart contracts onto the ZKP chain and benefit from the faster speeds and lower costs. This compatibility is a huge advantage for the blockchain-based AI industry. It bridges the gap between the massive Ethereum ecosystem and the specialized hardware of the ZKP network. By including this pallet, the project ensures that it is not an isolated island. Instead, it becomes a high-performance extension of the wider crypto world that developers already know and love.

While standard pallets handle the basic functions, ZKP adds a custom layer for modular privacy to protect sensitive information. This is achieved through ""Zero Knowledge Wrappers."" These wrappers sit on top of the standard pallets to ensure that while the code executes on a public ledger, the actual input data remains hidden from prying eyes. This is critical for AI training, where data source and size must be verified without revealing the content itself.

The Zero Knowledge Proof system uses zk-SNARKs to create these proofs. This custom privacy layer is what separates ZKP from standard blockchains. It allows users to contribute data to a marketplace and earn rewards without ever giving up their data sovereignty. By building this on top of Substrate, the developers have created a system that is both transparent in its logic and completely private in its data handling for all global users.

Summing Up

For any student or engineer, the ZKP project is a masterclass in modern software design. It proves that you do not need to build everything from scratch to create something revolutionary. By leveraging Substrate and its modular pallets, the Zero Knowledge Proof team focused their energy on what matters: AI and privacy. This approach reduces errors and makes the network much more stable. 

As we move into an era where AI and blockchain merge, understanding these building blocks is essential. The Zero Knowledge Proof architecture shows that the future of coding is modular, efficient, and private. Now is the perfect time to start experimenting with these tools and building your own decentralized future. Reach out and start your journey today.

Crypto has always been synonymous with volatility. In this market, charts move like heart monitors, and every Instagram guru seems to have the next 100x gem until its price goes down by next week. For every trader, the routine is pretty much the same: watching crypto charts at 2 a.m., trying to decipher candlesticks like they were ancient runes, panicking, selling, and then repeating the cycle. It can be chaotic to say the least. 

However, amidst this chaos, AI has emerged as a transformative force in the industry, reshaping how people approach crypto trading through automated strategies, predictive models, and enhanced risk management. It's essentially becoming the backbone of a more lucrative future for cryptocurrency traders and helping them make better decisions. For example, while making an ada price prediction is not an easy feat, machine learning models help traders receive predictive insights and act before major price movements occur, which is quite a big deal.



In the very first years after cryptocurrency's inception, trading relied mainly on manual analysis, which was cumbersome.  Human traders would spend hours glued to their computer screens, monitoring price charts, news cycles, and social media platforms to inform their decision-making. This may have worked then, but as the crypto market evolved, the approach became entirely impractical.  With the crypto landscape becoming more complex, the need for data-driven and faster insights has become more and more visible. 

AI and ML models entered the scene as trailblazer solutions meant to change everything, as they can process vast amounts of data in real time. These state-of-the art technologies track price movements, macroeconomic indicators, and social sentiment, with the purpose of identifying trends and optimizing trading strategies.

Let's take a deeper look at the impact of AI on the crypto landscape: 

In the trading world, prediction is a big piece of the puzzle. If you can forecast price changes, you have an edge, and this matters especially when navigating such a volatile market like crypto. A study evaluating AI-driven strategies for Bitcoin trading between 2018 and 2024 concluded that an AI-led model achieved an overall return of 1640%, an outperformance of traditional buy-and-hold approach that illustrates the predictive power of AI.

Has this been possible before? Not really, given the unpredictable nature of the market. But AI and ML are on a mission to change the world by delivering accurate predictions no matter how complex the datasets are.

The crypto market runs all day long without any pause, but for human traders, it's impossible to work 24/7. That's not the case for AI, though. AI-powered trading bots can execute trades round-the-clock without compromising efficiency at all, and capture opportunities which a human eye could easily miss. In 2024 alone, the market cap of AI crypto agents increased 29% to more than $31 billion in only a few weeks, which reflected quick adoption and investor confidence. What does this mean for you as a trader? No more countless hours staring at the charts.

Human intervention is prone to errors and bias. Psychologically speaking, it's just hard to navigate the turbulent seas of crypto trading without emotions getting in the way of success. Whether it's the exhilaration of striking it rich or the distress of unexpected market downturns, emotions can sway decision-making processes very quickly. But AI is a compass guiding traders through this ocean of uncertainty. Compared to a human trader who will become fearful after seeing a price plummet, AI maintains an objective and analytical approach and therefore, ensures the decisions are based on logic and data. AI-powered trading bots enable traders to set specific conditions, like buying an asset when the price drops below a specific level and allow the bot to execute the trades automatically as soon as the conditions are met, which is what makes the trades efficient.

Crypto traders are familiar with risk in crypto trading. Lack of regulation, unexpected price drops, psychological pitfalls like panic selling and FOMO, can all turn crypto trading into an unnerving experience. But the integration of AI into trading is radically improving risk management techniques. With this technology, it becomes easy to analyze patterns from historical data and spot early signs of market instability. This means you can know if the market is about to drop or surge and adjust your positions in real time. AI also follows stringent risk management protocols, which means each trade will align with a predetermined risk profile, regardless of the emotional factors or the noise.

The role of AI in crypto is only beginning. As it evolves, there's a strong likelihood to see it merging with fascinating technologies, like voice interfaces for more intuitive control, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and multi-modal tools which can pull insights from more than numbers and charts only. One of the biggest shifts? Bots will not simply follow scripts, but adapt on the fly, learn from new data, and possibly respond to humans in real-time.

AI will also contribute to the growth of decentralized finance. As DeFi protocols expand, the technology can automate complex financial services and increase their accessibility for a global audience. AI agents, the unseen architects of a new digital era, are already working hard to drive automation and optimization in DeFi and blockchain, and support AI's expanding role in decentralized finance. The ongoing evolution of the technology promises to transform crypto by making it smarter, faster, more secure and more accessible.

There's no doubt that AI is already doing an excellent job in transforming crypto and will continue to do so. But here's the catch: many traders believe AI will trade for them and expect the technology to perform miracles. If it fails, they just blame the technology. In reality, this mindset will only sabotage your trades, because the truth is that AI isn't meant to replace your trading strategy but to enhance it. Just like there's no car without a driver, there cannot be a bot without a skilled trader behind it. The real power is in combining both human skills with algorithms, because while AI analyzes faster, humans interpret smarter, and bring experience and context to the game.

The next generation of successful traders won't be those who trade the hardest, but who leverage AI to achieve a trading system that's balanced, efficient, and emotionally stable.

In a landmark move that could redefine technological alliances in the Asia-Pacific, Taiwan and the United States have sealed a monumental investment deal, positioning Taiwan as a key strategic partner in artificial intelligence. Announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce, this agreement commits Taiwanese semiconductor and tech giants to pour $250 billion directly into U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, energy, and AI production and innovation. Coupled with an additional $250 billion in credit guarantees, the pact signals an unprecedented level of economic integration aimed at bolstering supply chain resilience amid rising global tensions.

At the heart of this agreement lies a reciprocal commitment to fortify each nation's technological foundations. Taiwanese companies, renowned for producing over half of the world's semiconductors, will channel $250 billion into expanding U.S. domestic manufacturing capabilities. This infusion targets not just semiconductors but also energy infrastructure and AI innovation, addressing critical vulnerabilities exposed by overreliance on foreign supply chains. In parallel, Taiwan pledges another $250 billion in credit guarantees to incentivize further investments from its tech enterprises, amplifying the deal's impact over an expansive timeline.

In return, the United States pledges significant investments into Taiwan's semiconductor sector, alongside defense technology, AI, telecommunications, and biotechnology industries. While specific figures for U.S. contributions remain undisclosed in the official press release, the symmetry underscores a balanced partnership designed for long-term mutual benefit. This exchange comes at a pivotal moment, just after a U.S. proclamation highlighting the national security risks of importing 90% of advanced semiconductors, emphasizing how disruptions could cripple industrial and military operations.

Beyond economics, this deal carries profound geopolitical weight. Taiwan's dominance in semiconductor production—handling more than 50% of global output—makes it indispensable to the world economy, yet it sits in the shadow of China's growing ambitions. By deepening ties with the U.S., Taiwan aims to diversify risks and enhance its strategic position, while Washington seeks to onshore critical manufacturing and reduce dependence on potentially adversarial suppliers.

The timing aligns with broader U.S. policy shifts under the Trump administration, including a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on certain advanced AI chips. These measures, coupled with ongoing trade talks, pave the way for additional semiconductor tariffs post-agreement, pressuring other nations to align with American interests. For Taiwan, the partnership elevates its role from a vital supplier to a close AI strategic ally, fostering joint research, talent exchanges, and innovation hubs that could accelerate breakthroughs in AI-driven technologies.

Observers note that this collaboration shores up defenses against supply chain chokepoints, particularly in light of China's assertive posture in the region. By establishing a robust U.S.-Taiwan technology bloc, the deal counters Beijing's influence, promoting open and secure AI ecosystems rooted in democratic principles.

Artificial intelligence emerges as a cornerstone of the agreement, with explicit allocations for joint initiatives in AI production and research. Taiwan's expertise in chip design, led by giants like TSMC, complements U.S. strengths in software, algorithms, and applications. Together, they aim to pioneer next-generation AI hardware, from efficient edge computing devices to massive data center processors capable of handling exascale workloads.

Talent exchange programs form another pillar, facilitating the movement of engineers, researchers, and executives across the Pacific. This human capital bridge will seed innovation clusters, potentially spawning startups and R&D centers that blend Taiwanese fabrication prowess with American entrepreneurial spirit. The result? Accelerated development of secure AI models that prioritize privacy, reliability, and ethical deployment—vital for applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and national defense.

Moreover, the deal extends to telecommunications and biotech, where AI intersections promise transformative gains. Imagine AI-optimized 6G networks enhancing real-time defense communications or biotech platforms leveraging semiconductor advances for personalized medicine. These synergies position the U.S.-Taiwan axis as a global leader in responsible AI stewardship.

The economic implications are staggering. In the U.S., $250 billion in direct investments could create hundreds of thousands of high-tech jobs, revitalizing Rust Belt states and tech hubs alike. New fabrication plants, or fabs, demand skilled labor in engineering, operations, and supply logistics, injecting vitality into local economies while reducing import vulnerabilities.

For Taiwan, U.S. investments safeguard its semiconductor ecosystem against geopolitical headwinds, funding expansions in AI-specific chips and defense tech. This reciprocity mitigates risks from potential blockades or trade disruptions, ensuring continuity in global chip supply. Globally, the partnership enhances supply chain diversity, benefiting industries from consumer electronics to electric vehicles.

This agreement transcends bilateral trade; it heralds a realignment of technological power. By formalizing Taiwan's status as a strategic AI partner, the U.S. constructs a counterweight to China's state-driven tech ascent. Joint defense tech investments hint at integrated systems, from AI-enhanced missile guidance to cyber resilience tools, fortifying the first island chain against aggression.

Critics may decry the massive outlays, but proponents argue the return on investment—in security, innovation, and economic dominance—far outweighs costs. With tariffs looming on non-aligned suppliers, this deal incentivizes similar pacts, potentially drawing Japan, South Korea, and Europe into a democratic tech alliance.

While promising, the path forward holds hurdles. The investment timeline remains unspecified, raising questions about pacing amid labor shortages and regulatory approvals. U.S. tariffs on AI chips could ripple through global markets, necessitating careful calibration to avoid allies' backlash. Taiwan must navigate domestic politics and China's responses, which may include economic coercion.

Yet, with committed leadership from both sides, these challenges are surmountable. Streamlined permitting, workforce training via public-private partnerships, and international standards for AI ethics will be key to unlocking the deal's potential.

This U.S.-Taiwan AI and semiconductor pact stands as a beacon of strategic foresight, weaving economic might with security imperatives to forge a resilient future. By committing half a trillion dollars to shared prosperity and innovation, both nations not only safeguard their interests but also champion a world where technology serves freedom and progress. As implementation unfolds, this partnership promises to reshape global dynamics, ensuring that democratic values prevail in the AI era.","{'href': 'https://cryptocoin.news', 'title': 'cryptocoin.news'}","cryptocurrency"

Table of Contents

 

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko signed Decree No 19 on January 16, 2026, creating a regulatory framework for crypto banks in the country. 

The decree permits High-Tech Park residents to combine token-based services with traditional banking operations. 

This development positions Belarus among nations actively integrating digital assets into mainstream financial systems.

The decree defines a crypto bank as a joint-stock company authorized to merge digital token operations with conventional banking and payment services. 

Market entry requires dual qualification: companies must hold High-Tech Park residency status and secure registration in the National Bank's crypto bank registry. 

This two-tier approval process ensures oversight from both technology sector authorities and traditional financial regulators.

Crypto banks will operate under regulations governing non-bank credit and financial institutions. Additionally, these entities must adhere to decisions issued by the Hi-Tech Park Supervisory Board.

The combined oversight mechanism creates a supervisory framework that addresses both technological innovation and financial stability concerns.

The registration requirements establish clear entry barriers for prospective crypto banks. Only joint-stock companies meeting specific criteria can participate in this market segment. 

This structural requirement suggests authorities are prioritizing institutional participants over individual operators or smaller entities.

The dual regulatory model enables crypto banks to develop financial products combining traditional banking benefits with digital token technology. 

Customers will access services that merge established banking security with the speed and efficiency of blockchain-based transactions. This hybrid approach targets users seeking both innovation and regulatory compliance.

Crypto banks must maintain compliance with existing financial institution standards while implementing token-based solutions. 

The decree does not eliminate conventional banking regulations but rather extends them to cover digital asset operations. 

Financial institutions will navigate requirements from multiple supervisory bodies throughout their operations.

The framework positions Belarus as a jurisdiction encouraging financial technology development within structured oversight. 

Unlike some jurisdictions that separate crypto activities from traditional banking, Belarus permits integration under specific conditions. 

This approach reflects growing international recognition that digital assets require specialized but connected regulatory treatment rather than complete isolation from established financial systems.

For Stars, It's Not Easy Being Green

Stars emit lots of green light, but our eyes don't let us see them that way

Every night before bedtime, I take my dogs outside to do their doggy business, letting them run around in the yard on the eastern side of my house. I live under very dark skies in rural Virginia, and even though I'm a card-carrying astronomer, it's always a shock to look up and see so many stars.

In the winter my eyes are usually drawn to the brightest stars such as Betelgeuse and Rigel in Orion and Aldebaran in nearby Taurus. They aren't just bright; they're also colorful, standing out against the standard white appearance of most other stars in the sky. Betelgeuse is red-orange, Aldebaran is orange, and Rigel is sapphire blue.

As I wrote in a previous The Universe column, “The Colors of Stars, Explained,” only the brightest stars give off enough light to activate our eyes' cones, the color-sensitive cells in the retinas. But even then, the brightest stars always appear blue, red, yellow or sometimes white. In telescopic images, even fainter stars show colors. And although astronomical photographs can be a bit tricky to interpret, the star colors in them are usually pretty representative.

What you won't see, though, are green ones.

The reason for this is both a fault in the stars and in ourselves: we don't see them as green because of the way stars emit light and the way our eyes see colors.

Stars emit light because they're hot. They radiate that heat away as light, and in fact, their apparent color depends on their temperature. Relatively cool stars emit red light, while much hotter stars glow in blue. But it's a little more complicated than that because, in reality, they emit light across a broad range of colors in different proportions. Cool stars emit almost entirely red light, but hot stars emit blue and red light; they just emit much more blue than red. It's that mix of colors that gives a star its hue.

The sun does this, too, shining in colors literally spanning the rainbow (and beyond) but not in an even distribution. A graph of solar brightness versus color shows a shape more like a lopsided bell curve, with a long tail beyond the red wavelengths. Surprisingly, the peak of that graph is in the blue-green part of the spectrum!

So why doesn't the sun look teal? That's where our eyes come in. We have three kinds of cones in our eyes, each attuned to either red, green or blue light. So if an object emits or reflects red light, red cones send a strong signal to the brain while the other two kinds don't, and we perceive that object as red.

Yet of course, we can see more colors than just three! That's because, say, a yellow object will trigger all three kinds of cones but by different amounts. Those signals are then mixed by the brain, and we see, in this example, yellow.

The sun emits the most light in blue and green. It also emits violet, yellow, orange and red, however. When our brain is done combining and interpreting all those colors' signals from our eyes, we perceive the sun as white (not yellow, as many people think, although it is classified as a yellow dwarf star).

This is why we don't see any green stars. As stars get hotter, we see their color shift from red to orange. And as their temperatures rise even higher, our eyes start to interpret them as bluish or white. There's no temperature where our cones combine their signals to produce green—and because, in most cases, cameras are designed to mimic our eyes, stars don't look green in photographs, either.

Kermit was right. It's not easy being green.

I'll note that there are a couple of stars that some people say look green. Almach is a middling-bright star system in the constellation Andromeda. It consists of an orange giant and a trinary system of three blue stars (which are so close together that they are unresolved from our perspective; they blend into a single point of light through a telescope). Some observers have claimed that they have seen the trinary as green. I suspect this is an illusion, arising because our brain sometimes relies on contextual comparisons to interpret color. This can change the apparent color of an object quite strikingly. By comparing the bluish light from the trinary with the brighter orange light of the other star, it's possible that the trinary could look green. I'll add that in photographs, it always looks blue, contributing support to the idea that the green is illusory.

Another star, Zubeneschamali in the Libra constellation, also apparently looks green to some observers. It's definitely a blue star and has no stellar companion, so it's unclear why some people see it this way. It's always looked blue to me through a telescope.

And all this is not to say that there are no green celestial objects! Many nebulas—gas clouds—show a distinct greenish hue. In those rarefied circumstances, atoms of oxygen emit very strongly in the green part of the spectrum, overwhelming the other, fainter colors, making the nebula appear green, even in photographs.

Comets can also sometimes appear emerald green! In this case, the culprit is diatomic carbon, a molecule made of two carbon atoms. Sunlight energizes the molecule, causing it to vibrate, and it then releases that energy in the form of green photons. The molecule isn't very stable, though, and gets broken down by sunlight after a day or two. This is why the main head of a comet can look green, but the tail, made of material blown off the head, tends to be a different color.

Planets can get in on the action, too. Much of Earth is green for obvious reasons. Yet Uranus can appear to be very slightly green (more blue than green, but there's still a hint of the latter) because of methane in its atmosphere. The methane absorbs red light and reflects blue and green, lending the planet a pale sea-green hue.

If you do happen to find yourself outside on a clear, crisp night, please do take a closer look at the stars above your head if you're able. I always do, and that wave of wonder I feel every time comes not just from their beauty; it's heightened by our understanding of how both physics and physiology combine to create that beauty.

We know that some animals are bilaterian—meaning they display bilateral symmetry—while others are not, but nature is rarely so black-and-white.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Make a list of complex animals as distantly related to humans as possible, and sea anemones would likely be near the top of the list. Of course, one lives in the water and the other doesn't, but the differences are more biologically fundamental than that—sea anemones don't even have brains.

So it's surprising that this species in the phylum Cnidarians (along with jellyfish, corals, and other sea creatures) contains an ancient blueprint for bilaterians, of which Homo sapiens are a card-carrying member. 

A study by a team of scientists at the University of Vienne discovered that sea anemones, whose Cnidarian status means they grow radially around a central point (after all, what is the “face” of a jellyfish), use a technique commonly associated with bilaterians, known as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) shuttling, to build their bodies. This complicates the picture of exactly when this technique evolved or if it possibly evolved independently of bilaterians. The results of the study were published last year in the journal Science Advances.

“Not all Bilateria use Chordin-mediated BMP shuttling, for example, frogs do, but fish don't, however, shuttling seems to pop up over and over again in very distantly related animals making it a good candidate for an ancestral patterning mechanism,” University of Vienna's David Mörsdorf, a lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “The fact that not only bilaterians but also sea anemones use shuttling to shape their body axes, tells us that this mechanism is incredibly ancient.”

To put it simply, BMPs are a kind of molecular messenger that signals to embryonic cells where they are in the body and what kind of tissue they should form. Local inhibition from an inhibitor named Chordin (which can also act as a shuttle) along with BMP shuttling creates gradients of BMP in the body. When these levels are their lowest, for example, the body knows to form the central nervous system. Moderate levels signal kidney development, and maximum levels signal the formation of the skin of the belly. This is how bilaterians form the body's layout from back to body. 

Mörsdorf and his colleagues found that Chordin also acts as a BMP shuttle—just as displayed in bilaterians like flies and frogs.  Thi signals that this particular evolutionary trait likely developed before Cnidarians and bilaterians diverged. Seeing as these two phylums of the animal kingdom have vastly different biological structures, that divergence occurred long ago, likely 600 to 700 million years ago. 

“We might never be able to exclude the possibility that bilaterians and bilaterally symmetric cnidarians evolved their bilateral body plans independently,” University of Vienna's Grigory Genikhovich, a senior author of the study, said in a press statement. “However, if the last common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria was a bilaterally symmetric animal, chances are that it used Chordin to shuttle BMPs to make its back-to-belly axis.”

Researchers at the Princeton University Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research have uncovered new ways a vitamin A-derived molecule can interfere with the immune system's ability to fight cancer. The molecule, known as all-trans retinoic acid, was found to weaken natural anti-cancer immune responses and, under certain conditions, reduce the effectiveness of a promising type of cancer vaccine.

Vitamin A metabolites, also called retinoids, have long sparked debate because of their mixed effects on health and disease. The new findings, described across two scientific papers, help clarify this long-standing controversy. They also led to the development of the first experimental drugs designed to shut down the cellular signaling pathway triggered by retinoic acid.

How Retinoic Acid Undermines Cancer Vaccines

One of the studies, published in Nature Immunology, was led by Ludwig Princeton researcher Yibin Kang and graduate student Cao Fang. The team found that retinoic acid produced by dendritic cells (DCs), key immune cells responsible for activating immune defenses, can reprogram these cells in a way that promotes tolerance toward tumors.

This tolerance significantly reduces the effectiveness of dendritic cell vaccines, a type of immunotherapy designed to train the immune system to recognize and attack cancer. The researchers also described the creation and preclinical testing of a drug that blocks retinoic acid production in both cancer cells and DCs. The compound, KyA33, improved the performance of DC vaccines in animal studies and also showed potential as a stand-alone cancer immunotherapy.

A New Strategy to Block Retinoid Signaling

A second study, led by former Kang lab graduate student Mark Esposito and published in the journal iScience, focused on designing drugs that inhibit retinoic acid production and disable retinoid signaling altogether. Although scientists have studied retinoids for more than a century, attempts to create drugs that safely block their signaling have repeatedly failed.

The approach described in this study combined computational modeling with large-scale drug screening. This strategy provided the framework used to develop KyA33, marking a major advance in targeting a pathway that had resisted drug development for decades.

Broad Implications for Cancer Immunotherapy

""Taken together, our findings reveal the broad influence retinoic acid has in attenuating vitally important immune responses to cancer,"" said Kang. ""In exploring this phenomenon, we also solved a longstanding challenge in pharmacology by developing safe and selective inhibitors of retinoic acid signaling and established preclinical proof of concept for their use in cancer immunotherapy.""

A Deadly Form of Immune Tolerance

Retinoic acid is produced by an enzyme called ALDH1a3, which is often found at high levels in human cancer cells. A related enzyme, ALDH1a2, produces retinoic acid in certain subsets of DCs.

Once generated, retinoic acid activates a receptor inside the cell nucleus, launching a signaling cascade that changes gene activity. In the gut, this process is known to promote the formation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which help prevent harmful autoimmune reactions. Until now, however, scientists did not understand how retinoic acid affects dendritic cells themselves.

Why Dendritic Cells Matter in Cancer Defense

Dendritic cells play a central role in coordinating immune responses. They continuously survey the body for signs of infection or cancer. When they detect danger, they process fragments of abnormal proteins and present them as antigens to T cells, which then seek out and destroy diseased or cancerous cells.

Dendritic cell vaccines are created by collecting immature immune cells from a patient's blood and growing them in the laboratory alongside antigens taken from that patient's tumor. These primed cells are then returned to the patient with the goal of triggering a powerful anti-tumor immune response.

Despite improvements in identifying suitable cancer antigens, these vaccines often fail to perform as hoped. Fang, Kang, and their colleagues, including Esposito and Princeton Branch Director Joshua Rabinowitz, set out to understand why.

How Vaccine Production Triggers Immune Suppression

""We discovered that under conditions commonly employed to produce DC vaccines, differentiating dendritic cells begin expressing ALDH1a2, producing high levels of retinoic acid,"" said Fang. ""The nuclear signaling pathway it activates then suppresses DC maturation, diminishing the ability of these cells to trigger anti-tumor immunity. This previously unknown mechanism likely contributes to the largely suboptimal performance of DC and other cancer vaccines that has been repeatedly seen in clinical trials.""

The problem does not stop there. Retinoic acid released by DCs also encourages the formation of macrophages that are less effective at fighting cancer. As these macrophages accumulate in place of functional DCs, the overall impact of DC vaccines is further reduced.

Restoring Immune Power With a New Drug

The researchers demonstrated that blocking ALDH1a2, either through genetic techniques or with KyA33, restores dendritic cell maturation and their ability to activate immune defenses. DC vaccines created in the presence of KyA33 generated strong, targeted immune responses in mouse models of melanoma. These responses delayed tumor development and slowed cancer progression.

When administered directly to mice, KyA33 also worked as an independent immunotherapy, reducing tumor growth by stimulating the immune system.

Solving the Vitamin A Cancer Paradox

Developing inhibitors that target ALDH1a2 and ALDH1a3 represents a major scientific achievement. Of the twelve classic nuclear receptor signaling pathways, the retinoic acid pathway was the first discovered and the only one that had not yet been successfully targeted by drugs.

The iScience study details the computational and experimental approach used to overcome this challenge. With these new compounds, the researchers were finally able to explain a long-standing paradox surrounding vitamin A and cancer.

In laboratory experiments, retinoic acid can cause cancer cells to stop growing or die, contributing to the belief that vitamin A has anti-cancer properties. Yet large clinical trials and other evidence show that high vitamin A intake increases the risk of cancer (and cardiovascular disease) and raises mortality rates. High levels of ALDH1A enzymes in tumors are also linked to worse survival across many cancers. Previous attempts to separate the functions of ALDH1A enzymes from retinoic acid production had largely failed.

How Cancer Exploits Retinoic Acid

""Our study reveals the mechanistic basis for this paradox,"" said Esposito. ""We've shown that ALDH1a3 is overexpressed in diverse cancers to generate retinoic acid, but that cancer cells lose their responsiveness to retinoid receptor signaling, avoiding its potential anti-proliferative or differentiating effects. This explains, in part, the paradox of vitamin A's effects on cancer growth.""

The researchers also found that retinoic acid primarily affects the immune environment around tumors rather than the cancer cells themselves. By entering the tumor microenvironment, retinoic acid suppresses immune responses, including the activity of T cells that normally target cancer.

To confirm this, the team showed that ALDH1a3 inhibitors stimulated strong immune attacks against tumors in mouse models, demonstrating their potential as powerful immunotherapies.

Toward New Treatments for Cancer and Beyond

""By developing candidate drugs that safely and specifically inhibit nuclear signaling through the retinoic acid pathway, we are paving the way for a novel therapeutic approach to cancer,"" said Kang.

Esposito and Kang have since launched a biotechnology company, Kayothera, to advance these ALDH1A inhibitors into clinical testing. The company aims to develop treatments for multiple diseases influenced by retinoic acid, including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Stretchable OLED displays take a big leap forward","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260115220608.htm","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:17:36 GMT","

The OLED technology found in flexible smartphones, curved computer monitors, and modern televisions may eventually be used in wearable devices that sit directly on the skin. These future systems could display real-time information such as changes in temperature, blood flow, or pressure. An international research team led by scientists from Seoul National University in the Republic of Korea and Drexel University has now developed a flexible and stretchable OLED that could move this idea closer to real-world use and unlock new applications.

The research, recently published in Nature, introduces a redesigned OLED that combines a flexible phosphorescent polymer layer with transparent electrodes made from MXene nanomaterial. This approach allows the display to stretch up to 1.6 times its original length while retaining most of its brightness.

""This study addresses a longstanding challenge in flexible OLED technology, namely, the durability of its luminescence after repeated mechanical flexion,"" said Yury Gogotsi, PhD, Distinguished University and Bach professor in Drexel's College of Engineering. ""While the advances creating flexible light-emitting diodes have been substantial, progress has leveled off in the last decade due to limitations introduced by the transparent conductor layer, limiting their stretchability.""

Why OLEDs Lose Performance When Bent

OLEDs generate light through a process known as electroluminescence. When electricity flows through the device, positive and negative charges move between electrodes and pass through an organic polymer layer. When these charges meet, they release light and form a particle called an exciton before settling into a stable electrical state. Adjusting the chemical composition of the organic layer determines the color of the emitted light.

Flexible OLEDs are made by depositing these layers onto bendable plastic substrates, allowing them to function while folded, bent, or rolled. The technology was first developed in the 1990s and became widely visible in the 2010s when Samsung incorporated flexible displays into shatter-resistant devices and curved-edge phones. Over time, however, it became clear that repeated bending caused OLED brightness and flexibility to decline due to gradual damage in the electrodes and organic materials.

""Imparting conducting materials with flexibility usually involves incorporating an insulating but stretchable polymer that hinders charge transport and, as a result, reduces light emission,"" said Danzhen Zhang, PhD, a co-author and postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, who conducted early work on transparent conductive MXene films as a PhD student in Gogotsi's lab at Drexel. ""In addition, the material most commonly used in electrodes can become brittle and more likely to break the longer the OLED is flexed and stretched. This issue was addressed by using MXene-contact stretchable electrodes, which feature high mechanical robustness and tunable work function, ensuring efficient hole or electron injection.""

A New Light-Emitting Layer

To overcome these challenges, the researchers redesigned the light-emitting portion of the OLED. Their solution uses a specialized organic layer that increases how often electrical charges combine to form excitons, leading to stronger light output.

This material, called an exciplex-assisted phosphorescent (ExciPh) layer, is naturally stretchable and engineered to adjust the energy levels of moving charges. By making it easier for charges to meet and form excitons, the layer boosts light production, similar to slowing a spinning ride so more people can step on safely.

More than 57% of excitons created in the ExciPh layer are converted into light. In comparison, the polymer-based emissive layers commonly used in today's OLEDs achieve only a 12-22% conversation efficiency rate.

To further improve flexibility, the team incorporated a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer matrix into the ExciPh layer. They also focused on improving how electrical charges move through the device by redesigning the electrodes.

MXene Electrodes Boost Durability and Brightness

The new electrodes combine MXene, a highly conductive two-dimensional nanomaterial developed by Drexel researchers in 2011, with silver nanowires. Together, these materials form a conductive network that helps electrical charges reach the light-emitting polymer layer more efficiently before forming excitons.

This structure improves charge injection and allows the OLED to maintain its brightness even while being bent and stretched.

""Owing to their exceptional conductivity and layered form, MXenes provide an exceptional electrode material for flexible OLEDs,"" Gogotsi said. ""We have demonstrated the performance of flexible, transparent MXene electrodes in multiple applications; thus, including them in efforts to improve OLED technology is a natural step for our research.""

Testing OLEDs Under Repeated Strain

Using these combined improvements, the researchers produced flexible green OLED displays, including one shaped like a heart and another showing numerical digits. They measured the charge-to-exciton conversion rate -- a measure of the OLEDs' ability to efficiently produce light -- along with performance during repeated stretching.

To demonstrate broader potential, researchers at Seoul National University also built a full-color, fully stretchable OLED display using four dopant materials within the ExciPh layer. In addition, they created fully stretchable passive-matrix OLEDs that showcase a simple, low-power design suitable for wearable electronics.

Compared with previous designs, the new OLEDs showed higher brightness and better energy efficiency. When stretched to 60% of their maximum strain, performance dropped by only 10.6%. After 100 cycles of repeated stretching at 2% strain, the displays retained 83% of their light output, indicating significantly improved durability.

Toward Wearable and Deformable Displays

""We anticipate the success of this approach to designing flexible, high-efficiency optoelectronic devices will enable the next generation of wearable and deformable displays,"" said Teng Zhang, PhD, a co-author and former post-doctoral researcher in Gogotsi's lab. ""This technology will play an important role in real-time health care monitoring and wearable communications technology.

Future work may involve testing alternative flexible substrates, fine-tuning organic layers to produce different colors and brightness levels, and simplifying the manufacturing process to support large-scale production of stretchable OLED devices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found the soil secret that doubles forest regrowth","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260115220612.htm","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:33:36 GMT","

Newly published research finds that tropical forests can rebound up to twice as fast after deforestation when their soils contain enough nitrogen. The study shows that what happens below ground plays a major role in how quickly forests return after land has been cleared.

Scientists led by the University of Leeds launched the largest and longest experiment ever designed to examine how nutrients shape forest regrowth. The work focused on tropical areas previously cleared for activities such as logging and agriculture.

Tracking Forest Regrowth Over Decades

The researchers selected 76 forest plots across Central America and monitored them for as long as 20 years. Each site differed in age and size, allowing the team to follow how trees grew and died as forests recovered over time.

To test the role of nutrients, the plots received different treatments. Some were given nitrogen fertilizer, others phosphorus fertilizer, some received both nutrients, and some were left untreated. This approach allowed the scientists to directly compare how forests responded under different soil conditions.

Nitrogen Emerges as a Key Driver

The results showed that soil nutrients strongly influence how quickly tropical forests regrow. During the first 10 years of recovery, forests with adequate nitrogen rebounded at about twice the rate of those lacking it. Phosphorus alone did not produce the same effect.

The study included researchers from the University of Glasgow, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Yale University, Princeton University, Cornell University, the National University of Singapore, and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. The findings were published on January 13 in the journal Nature Communications.

Implications for Climate and Reforestation

Lead author Wenguang Tang, who carried out the research while completing his PHD at the University of Leeds, said: ""Our study is exciting because it suggests there are ways we can boost the capture and storage of greenhouse gases through reforestation by managing the nutrients available to trees.""

Although nitrogen fertilizer was used in the experiment, the researchers do not recommend fertilizing forests. Widespread fertilizer use could lead to harmful side effects, including emissions of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas.

Instead, the team suggests practical alternatives. Forest managers could plant trees from the legume (bean) family, which naturally add nitrogen to the soil. Another option is restoring forests in areas that already have sufficient nitrogen due to the effects of air pollution.

Why Faster Regrowth Matters for the Climate

Tropical forests are among the world's most important carbon sinks. They help slow climate change by removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in trees, a process known as carbon sequestration.

The researchers estimate that if nitrogen shortages affect young tropical forests worldwide, about 0.69 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide may be failing to be stored each year. That amount is roughly equal to two years of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the U.K.

Policy Relevance After COP 30

The study is released just weeks after the close of COP 30 in Brazil, where the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) fund was announced. The initiative aims to help tropical forest countries protect existing forests and restore those that have been damaged.

Principal investigator Dr. Sarah Batterman, an Associate Professor in Leeds' School of Geography, said: ""Our experimental findings have implications for how we understand and manage tropical forests for natural climate solutions.

""Avoiding deforestation of mature tropical forests should always be prioritized, but our findings about nutrient impacts on carbon sequestration is important as policymakers evaluate where and how to restore forests to maximize carbon sequestration.""

To the Point

Why Lifespans Differ Across Species

Animals across the natural world age at dramatically different rates. A female elephant can live as long as 80 years, yet she produces only a small number of calves over her lifetime. By contrast, a mouse may survive just a few years but is capable of producing dozens of offspring. Evolutionary biology explains this contrast through a basic principle: energy is limited, and species must divide it between reproduction and maintaining their bodies. A new large-scale study offers fresh evidence that this trade-off plays a major role in shaping how long mammals live, including humans.

An international team of researchers, including scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, investigated how limiting reproduction influences lifespan in mammals. The study analyzed records from 117 mammal species living in zoos and aquariums worldwide and combined them with a meta-analysis of 71 previously published studies. Together, the data showed that long-term hormonal contraception and permanent surgical sterilization are linked to an average lifespan increase of about ten percent.

The reproduction -- survival trade-off

Producing offspring requires enormous biological investment. Pregnancy, nursing, sperm production, courtship behavior, and parental care all consume large amounts of energy. Even outside of active breeding, sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen continue to affect growth, behavior, and aging, drawing resources away from long-term body maintenance.

""Zoos, where reproduction is carefully managed, provide a unique setting to study these dynamics,"" says Johanna Stärk, one of the authors. ""Animals may receive contraception or sterilization to prevent breeding, creating natural comparison groups within the same environment.""

The lifespan benefits of reduced reproduction appeared across a wide range of mammals, including primates, marsupials, and rodents. In some cases, the effects were striking. Female hamadryas baboons given hormonal contraception lived 29 percent longer, while castrated males lived 19 percent longer. ""This study shows that the energetic costs of reproduction have measurable and sometimes considerable consequences for survival across mammals,"" says Fernando Colchero, one of the study's senior authors. ""Reducing reproductive investment may allow more energy to be directed toward longevity.""

Both sexes live longer -- but for different reasons

While limiting reproduction extended lifespan in both males and females, the biological pathways involved were not the same. Lead author Mike Garratt of the University of Otago explains that only castration, not vasectomy, increased male lifespan. ""This indicates that the effect stems from eliminating testosterone and its influence on core aging pathways, particularly during early-life development. The largest benefits occur when castration happens early in life,"" he says.

In females, several forms of sterilization were associated with longer lives, suggesting that the benefit comes from avoiding the intense physical demands of pregnancy, nursing, and reproductive cycling. Removing the ovaries, which stops ovarian hormone production, also extended lifespan. However, a meta-analysis of 47 laboratory rodent studies revealed potential downsides, as later-life health outcomes may worsen. These results could help explain the ""survival-health paradox"" seen in post-menopausal women, who often live longer than men but experience higher levels of frailty and chronic illness.

Different Causes of Death by Sex

The study also found notable differences in how males and females died. Castrated males were less likely to die from causes linked to aggression or risky behavior. Females whose reproduction was blocked were less likely to die from infections, supporting the idea that the high energy demands of reproduction may weaken immune defenses in mothers.

Direct evidence from humans remains limited. Some historical records, including data from Korean Eunuchs in the pre-19th century Chosun Dynasty, suggest that castrated men lived about 18 percent longer than men who were not castrated. However, researchers caution that these records are debated and should be interpreted carefully.

Among women, surgical sterilization performed for non-cancerous reasons (such as hysterectomy or oophorectomy) is linked to a very small reduction in lifespan, roughly 1 percent compared with similar women who were not sterilized. ""Reproduction is inherently costly,"" the authors note. ""However, human environments -- through healthcare, nutrition and social support -- can buffer or reshape these costs.""

A Fundamental Evolutionary Trade-Off

Overall, the findings highlight reproduction as a major biological expense for mammals. The balance between producing offspring and preserving the body represents a core evolutionary trade-off that influences aging and survival. These costs arise from a combination of hormonal effects and the physical risks and stresses tied to reproduction.

Many details remain unresolved, and the researchers emphasize the need for further study. ""Our findings show that the costs of reproduction are substantial and measurable across a vast range of mammals,"" the authors conclude. ""Understanding these trade-offs deepens our insight into how aging evolves and how males and females balance survival and reproduction differently.""

Tryptophan is widely known for its connection to sleep, but its importance goes much further. The compounds produced from tryptophan help build proteins, generate cellular energy (NAD+), and create essential brain chemicals such as serotonin and melatonin. Together, these processes support mood, learning, and healthy sleep patterns.

As the brain ages or develops neurological disease, this system begins to break down. Scientists have repeatedly observed disruptions in how tryptophan is processed in aging brains, with even stronger effects seen in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. These changes are linked to worsening mood, impaired learning, and disturbed sleep. Until now, however, researchers did not know what caused the brain to shift how it uses tryptophan in the first place.

SIRT6 Identified as a Key Regulator of Brain Chemistry

Prof. Debra Toiber and her research team at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have now uncovered a clear biological explanation. Their work points to the loss of a longevity-related protein called Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) as the driving factor behind this metabolic imbalance.

Using experiments in cells, Drosophila (fly), and mouse models, the researchers showed that SIRT6 plays an active role in controlling gene expression (e.g., TDO2, AANAT). When SIRT6 levels drop, this control is lost. As a result, tryptophan is redirected toward the kynurenic pathway, which produces neurotoxic compounds, while the production of protective neurotransmitters such as serotonin and melatonin declines.

Published Evidence and a Reversible Effect

The findings were recently published in Nature Communications.

Importantly, the researchers also found that the damage caused by this shift is not permanent. In a SIRT6 knockout fly model, blocking the enzyme TDO2 led to a significant improvement in movement problems and reduced the formation of vacuoles, which are signs of brain tissue damage. These results suggest that there may be a meaningful window for therapeutic intervention.

""Our research positions SIRT6 as a critical, upstream drug target for combating neurodegenerative pathology,"" says Prof. Toiber.

A chemical known for its danger to humans may have played an unexpected role in the earliest steps toward life on Earth. Hydrogen cyanide, which is highly poisonous, can freeze into crystals at low temperatures. Computer simulations published in ACS Central Science suggest that certain surfaces on these crystals are unusually reactive, allowing chemical processes to occur that normally cannot happen in such cold conditions. According to the researchers, these reactions may have set off a chain of events that produced several of the fundamental building blocks of life.

""We may never know precisely how life began, but understanding how some of its ingredients take shape is within reach. Hydrogen cyanide is likely one source of this chemical complexity, and we show that it can react surprisingly quickly in cold places,"" says Martin Rahm, the corresponding author of the study.

Hydrogen Cyanide Beyond Earth and in Early Chemistry

Hydrogen cyanide is not rare in the universe. It has been detected on comets and in the atmospheres of planets and moons (e.g., Saturn's moon Titan). When hydrogen cyanide interacts with water, it can give rise to polymers, amino acids and nucleobases (components of proteins and DNA strands, respectively). To better understand how reactive this molecule can be, Marco Capelletti, Hilda Sandström and Martin Rahm used computer modeling to study hydrogen cyanide in its frozen state.

In their simulations, the team modeled a stable hydrogen cyanide crystal shaped like a long cylinder about 450 nanometers in length. The structure included a rounded base and a top with multiple flat faces resembling a cut gemstone. This design closely matches earlier observations of crystal formations described as ""cobwebs,"" which spread outward from a central point where the multifaceted ends meet.

Unexpected Chemistry in Extreme Cold

The calculations showed that these frozen crystals could promote chemical reactions that are usually absent in extremely cold environments. By analyzing the chemical behavior of the crystal surfaces, the researchers identified two reaction pathways that could transform hydrogen cyanide into hydrogen isocyanide, a more reactive compound. Depending on temperature, this conversion could happen within minutes or take several days. The researchers note that having hydrogen isocyanide on the crystal surface increases the likelihood that even more complex prebiotic molecules could form there.

Testing the Predictions in the Lab

The team hopes their findings will inspire laboratory experiments to test these predictions. One proposed approach involves crushing hydrogen cyanide crystals in the presence of substances like water to expose fresh crystal surfaces. Scientists could then observe whether these surfaces promote the formation of complex molecules under extremely cold conditions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A routine eye treatment is raising new concerns for glaucoma patients","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116085136.htm","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:26:48 GMT","

New research from Nagoya University in Japan has identified a previously overlooked risk associated with widely used eye ointments. The study shows that petrolatum-based eye ointments can cause a popular glaucoma implant to swell and, in some cases, rupture. Using both patient cases and laboratory testing, the researchers demonstrated that these ointments can compromise the PRESERFLO MicroShunt, a device currently used to treat glaucoma in more than 60 countries.

This is the first study to combine clinical observations with experimental evidence to clearly link petrolatum-based eye ointments to structural damage in this type of implant.

Glaucoma and the Role of the MicroShunt

Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that damages the optic nerve and can result in permanent vision loss. The condition is often caused by elevated pressure inside the eye when fluid drainage becomes blocked. Researchers estimate that glaucoma affects approximately 76 million people worldwide.

One treatment option is the MicroShunt, a tiny filtration device surgically implanted in the eye to help excess fluid drain more effectively. Compared with traditional glaucoma surgeries, the MicroShunt is associated with fewer post-operative complications and often reduces the need for ongoing medication.

Why the Implant Material Can Be Affected

The MicroShunt is manufactured from a styrenic thermoplastic elastomer made from a polystyrene-block-polyisobutylene-block-polystyrene (SIBS) block polymer. This material is designed to be flexible, highly biocompatible, and less likely to cause inflammation or scarring inside the eye.

At the same time, the material is sensitive to contact with hydrocarbon- and oil-based substances. Because it has a strong affinity for oils, petrolatum-based eye ointments can penetrate the implant. When oil components enter the material, the device may swell and experience changes in its shape and mechanical strength.

Manufacturer Warnings Often Overlooked

The MicroShunt manufacturer specifically cautions against this type of exposure. According to the instructions, ""the MicroShunt should not be subjected to direct contact with petrolatum-based (i.e., petrolatum jelly) materials, such as ointments and dispersions."" Despite this guidance, the warning is not always widely recognized or consistently followed in clinical settings.

""Swollen MicroShunts can be structurally fragile,"" said ophthalmologist and Assistant Professor Ryo Tomita of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, the study's first author. ""During surgery, I observed a rupture in a swollen MicroShunt. If more clinicians are aware of this risk, they will be able to prevent similar problems.""

Collaboration Between Medicine and Engineering

To investigate the issue more closely, Tomita worked with Assistant Professor Taiga Inooka and Associate Professor Kenya Yuki from Nagoya University Hospital and the Graduate School of Medicine. They collaborated with Dr. Takato Kajita and Junior Associate Professor Atsushi Noro from the Graduate School of Engineering to study how the MicroShunt changes after contact with petrolatum-based eye ointments.

The medical team analyzed patient cases, while the engineering researchers carried out laboratory experiments. The results were published in Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology.

Clinical Evidence From Patient Cases

The clinical analysis involved seven glaucoma patients whose MicroShunt implants were later removed for various reasons. A clear pattern emerged based on whether the implant had been exposed to petrolatum-based ointment.

In three cases, the MicroShunt was exposed outside the conjunctiva and patients were treated with a petrolatum-based eye ointment. All three devices showed noticeable swelling, and two of them had ruptured.

In another three cases, the MicroShunt remained covered by the conjunctiva and no ointment was used. These implants maintained their original structure.

One additional case was particularly revealing. Although the MicroShunt was exposed outside the conjunctiva, no ointment was applied. In this case, the implant did not swell. This finding indicates that direct contact with the ointment, rather than conjunctival exposure alone, is the primary cause of swelling.

Laboratory Tests Confirm the Mechanism

Laboratory experiments reinforced the clinical findings. Researchers immersed unused MicroShunts in petrolatum-based eye ointment to recreate the changes observed in patients.

Microscopic measurements revealed rapid expansion. After 24 hours of exposure, the outer diameter of the MicroShunt increased to 1.44 times its original size. The fin-like portion of the device widened to 1.29 times its initial dimension.

Chemical testing explained why these changes occurred. After 24 hours of immersion, oil components accounted for about 45% of the MicroShunt's total weight. After three months, oil content increased to 73%.

These results confirmed that swelling is driven by the absorption of oil-based ointment components into the implant material.

Implications for Glaucoma Treatment

Based on their findings, the researchers advise clinicians to avoid using petrolatum-based eye ointments in patients with MicroShunt implants, especially when the device is exposed outside the conjunctiva. They recommend considering alternative post-operative treatments and note that further studies are needed to determine whether swelling affects implant performance even when rupture does not occur.

""Our study found that commonly used medical materials can cause unexpected complications if their chemical properties and usage environments are not fully understood,"" Noro stated. ""From both medical and engineering perspectives, we emphasize the importance of understanding the chemical properties of medical materials and appropriately managing their usage environments.""

Cancer interception is a preventative approach aiming to reduce cancer incidence by targeting precancers and early-stage cancers. Lynch syndrome (LS) is a prevalent hereditary cancer syndrome affecting ~1 in 300 individuals, with an overall lifetime cancer risk as high as 80%. LS is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes, leading to microsatellite instability (MSI) and accumulation of shared mutations. When these occur in coding regions, they generate frameshift peptides (FSPs). Nous-209 is a neoantigen-directed immunotherapy based on a heterologous prime boost using great ape adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus Ankara encoding 209 FSPs shared across MSI neoplasms. We present the results from cohort 1 of a phase 1b/2 single-arm trial of Nous-209 for cancer interception in LS carriers (n = 45). Safety and immunogenicity were coprimary endpoints. Safety was assessed in 45 participants. Vaccination was safe with no intervention-related serious adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs were injection-site reactions (any grade in 91% of participants after prime and 76% after boost with no grade 3) and fatigue (any grade in 80% after prime and 53% after boost with 4% grade 3 after prime or after boost). Neoantigen-specific immune responses were observed after vaccination in 100% of evaluable participants (n = 37), with induction of potent T cell immunity (mean response at peak of ~1,100 interferon-γ spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells). The immune response was durable and detectable at 1 year in 85% of participants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were induced, recognizing multiple FSPs. Peptide–human leukocyte antigen predictions allowed the identification of >100 immunogenic FSPs with demonstration of cytotoxic activity in vitro. Immunogenic FSPs were found in independent datasets of LS MSI colorectal precancers and cancers. These results highlight Nous-209 ability to efficiently stimulate immunity against neoantigens in LS, supporting its development for cancer interception (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05078866).

Lynch syndrome (LS) is one of the most prevalent hereditary cancer syndromes affecting ~1 in 300 people1. Persons with LS carry heterozygous germline mutations in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6 and PMS2), conferring 50–80% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), 40–60% risk of endometrial cancer and increased risk of multiple other tumor types2. In the US, it is estimated that nearly 1 million individuals are affected by LS3. However, LS remains vastly underdiagnosed and current preventive options are limited to surveillance and prophylactic surgeries. The results of the CAPP2 study supported the role of aspirin 600 mg daily taken for 2 years as chemoprevention for at-risk LS carriers4. However, the use of high-dose aspirin in clinical practice is limited because of perceived risks of side effects; therefore, novel strategies for cancer interception remain an unmet need for this population.

The development of LS-associated cancers typically results from the acquisition of MMR deficiency because of a second inactivating somatic hit on the alternative wild-type allele of the MMR gene, thus leading to subsequent accumulation of mutations within microsatellite (MS) regions5. The most common type of mutations in MS regions are frameshift insertions and deletions (indels)6. When they involve regions coding MS, indels result in the synthesis of frameshift peptide (FSP) neoantigens (neoAgs), which are expected to be highly immunogenic and dissimilar to native proteins. Recurrent and shared neoAgs across neoplastic lesions and different individuals have been identified in LS carriers, some of which have immunogenic features7. In this context, LS represents an ideal condition to leverage immune-interception strategies such as neoAg-based cancer vaccines targeting both precancers and cancers8.

The development of ‘off-the-shelf' vaccines for LS carriers represents indeed a promising approach to cancer interception and prevention. By targeting shared neoAgs generated through the accumulation of genetic mutations, such vaccines could stimulate the immune system to recognize and eliminate precancers before they develop into cancers. The discovery of neoAgs has revived the interest in the field of cancer vaccines that are emerging as promising approaches for targeting personalized or shared neoAgs9. The first phase 1/2a clinical trial leveraging peptide-based neoAg vaccination in LS carriers involved the use of three recurrent FSPs (TAF1B, HT001 and AIM2) in 22 participants with a history of stage III/IV MMR-deficient (MMRd) CRC10. The intervention was well tolerated and induced both humoral and cellular immune responses. Another phase 1/2 study evaluated a neoAg-based dendritic cell vaccine in 23 LS carriers and reported the induction of neoAg-specific immune responses and no incidence of LS-related cancers in transforming growth factor-β receptor 2–responsive participants over a 10-year follow-up11.

Recently, novel delivery platforms have been developed, including DNA, RNA and viral vectored vaccines. Several clinical trials have now demonstrated the safety, immunogenicity and initial evidence of antitumor efficacy of neoAg-based vaccines across cancer types and settings12,13,14,15.

Therefore, the selection of the vaccine platform is key in determining the magnitude, quality and breadth of T cell responses to achieve effective and durable antitumor immunity. Among these new platforms, viral vector-based vaccines represent a powerful platform capable of inducing strong and durable T cell responses in human16,17. Their ability to deliver large gene inserts allows the targeting of many neoAgs simultaneously. This is a crucial aspect for cancer interception linked to the need to induce a broad T cell response for high coverage and for addressing the heterogeneity of their potential future tumors. Vaccination based on great ape adenovirus (GAd) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors encoding 209 shared frameshift mutations (Nous-209) was used to target shared neoAgs in persons with metastatic tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and demonstrated safety and potent immunogenicity18. Moreover, early signs of clinical efficacy, observed when the vaccine is used in combination with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 agent, are supported by evidence of vaccine-induced T cells infiltrating tumor biopsies after treatment, along with the expansion and diversification of the T cell receptor-β repertoire in persons showing clinical response18. Here, we present results from a phase 1b/2 open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Nous-209 monotherapy in 45 healthy LS carriers. Comprehensive characterization of T cell responses, including breadth, longevity and functional cytotoxic activity, is reported here to demonstrate the ability of Nous-209 to promote the induction of T cell responses targeting FSPs identified in colorectal precancers and cancers from an independent LS dataset.

NCT05078866 is a phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label, clinical trial testing Nous-209 for cancer immune interception in LS carriers.

Eligible participants included adults of age ≥ 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of LS and with no evidence of active or recurrent invasive cancers for at least 6 months before screening. Safety and immunogenicity were the primary endpoints of this study. Changes in the number of colorectal adenomas, advanced neoplasia and/or carcinomas were prespecified secondary endpoints. The trial enrolled two cohorts: cohort 1 (initial vaccination) reported in this study, and cohort 2, consisting of a subset of participants from cohort 1 who were revaccinated at 1 year to assess the benefit of annual boost. The safety and immunogenicity of cohort 2 will be reported in a separate manuscript.

Nous-209 was administered intramuscularly (IM) as a ‘priming' dose of GAd20-209-FSPs on week 0 day 1, followed by a ‘boost' with MVA-209-FSPs at week 8. Blood samples were collected serially at baseline and weeks 3, 8, 9, 24 and 52/68 (Fig. 1a). Before vaccination, all potentially eligible participants underwent standard-of-care screening colonoscopies or flexible sigmoidoscopy. Participants identified to have colorectal adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or diagnosis of invasive carcinoma at baseline were excluded from the study. More specifically, there were five screening failures. Two of them were excluded because of diagnosis of gastric cancer and one with diagnosis of bladder cancer within the previous 6 months.

Source data

A total of 45 healthy LS participants enrolled between November 2022 and November 2023 were vaccinated (Fig. 1b), with the first participant of the study enrolled on November 10, 2022 and the last participant enrolled on November 30, 2023. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. All participants carried a pathogenic germline MMR mutation with the majority in MSH2 (47%), while the remainder were in MSH6 (24%), MLH1 (18%) and PMS2 (11%). The median age was 50 years (range, 24–71) and 42% of participants (19/45) were cancer survivors (Extended Data Table 1) and had no evidence of active malignancy within the 6 months before study enrollment. Most study participants were male (56%) and self-reported white (91%). The coprimary endpoints of the trial were safety (rate of adverse events, AEs) and immunogenicity against the FSPs encoded by the Nous-209 vaccine.

AEs were reported by 98% (44/45) of participants during the first 9 weeks after vaccination with GAd-209-FSP prime (Fig. 1c and Table 2). Overall, no treatment-related serious AEs (SAEs) were observed and vaccination was well tolerated. The most common treatment-related AEs included systemic reactogenicity symptoms and local injection-site reaction. Specifically, injection-site reactions of any grade occurred in 91% of participants following GAd-209-FSP prime vaccination and 76% following MVA-209-FSP boost vaccination; no grade 3 injection-site reactions were observed. With respect to systemic reactogenicity, the most common events included fatigue (any grade: 36 of 45 participants (80%) after GAd-209-FSP prime, 24 of 45 (53%) after MVA-209-FSP boost; grade 3: 2 of 45 (4%) participants after GAd-209 prime or after MVA-209-boost) and myalgia (any grade: 34 of 45 participants (76%) after GAd-209-FSP prime, 11 of 45 (24%) after MVA-209-FSP boost; grade 3: 2 of 45 participants (4%) after GAd-209-FSP prime or after MVA-209-FSP boost) (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). All grade 3 symptoms occurred after the GAd prime dose. In all cases, symptoms were transient, lasting 1–4 days, did not require hospitalization and were managed with self-administered acetaminophen in some cases (Extended Data Table 2). All AEs reached full resolution and, indeed, all participants were able to receive the booster MVA dose as scheduled.

Vaccine immunogenicity was the coprimary endpoint of the study and was evaluated using an ex vivo enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay against 16 peptide pools that covered the entire repertoire of the 209 FSPs encoded by Nous-209, with each pool covering multiple FSPs (Fig. 2a). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated at different time points before (baseline) and after vaccination. The presence of Nous-209-induced neoAg-specific responses before and after vaccination was evaluable in 37 participants. Nous-209 elicited a positive interferon-γ (IFNγ) T cell response at peak (week 9) in 100% (37/37) of evaluable participants determined according to the predefined protocol criteria for ELISpot positivity (Methods). Total responses at peak after vaccination reached a mean of ~1,100 spot-forming cells (SFCs) (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, 10% of participants (4/37) showed positive spontaneous T cell responses to neoAg peptide pools at baseline before vaccination. In these four subjects, Nous-209 either boosted or induced de novo T cell responses to the vaccine neoAg. Long-term immune responses at 6 months and 1 year after vaccination were evaluable in 33 participants, showing maintenance of elevated and long-lasting T cell immunity with a decline in immune response occurring after the initial peak response at 1 year. Positive T cell responses were indeed still detectable ex vivo in 97% and 85% of evaluable participants at 6 months and 1 year, respectively (Fig. 2b). Responses were directed against different peptide pools with the induction of a broad polytope response to vaccine neoAg (Fig. 2c,d). More specifically, the breadth of the cellular immune response was evaluated by counting the number of Nous-209 peptide pools targeted across visits with an average of eight immunogenic pools per participant. A total of 13% of participants showed reactivity against 1–3 pools, 54% showed reactivity against 4–9 pools and 33% showed reactivity against 10–16 pools (Fig. 2d). In exploratory analyses, we observed no statistically significant associations between the number of positive pools at peak and gender, age, self-reported race/ethnicity, mutated MMR gene or cancer previvor versus survivor status. However, the increase in positive pools at peak from baseline was significantly higher in females compared to males (P = 0.045; Supplementary Table 2).

Full deconvolution of T cell responses against all 209 FSPs and relative minimal epitopes was not feasible given the high number of encoded neoAgs and the limited availability of PBMC samples. To further dissect immune responses after Nous-209 at the level of individual FSPs, we pursued an alternative approach that first determined the reactive peptide pools in each participant and then predicted the top epitopes included in the immunogenic pools on the basis of each participant's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genotyping, when full deconvolution of T cell response was not feasible (Fig. 3a). Following this strategy, we restricted the analysis to top FSPs and epitopes with the best participant's class I HLA-binding prediction (half-maximal effective concentration < 500 nM), which were considered the best target candidates of Nous-209 immune response. This work of deconvoluting the peptide pools, while not comprehensive for all 16 available pools, provides insights into the immunogenicity of specific individual FSP, thus leading to the identification of 115 immunogenic FSPs in our trial cohort of LS carriers (Supplementary Table 3).

To demonstrate the ability of Nous-209 to elicit an immune response against FSPs present in colorectal precancers and cancers of LS carriers, we leveraged available genomic and transcriptomic data from previously published work in an independent cohort of 12 MSI precancers (eight adenomas and four advanced adenomas) and 11 MSI CRCs7. Overall, we identified the presence of a median of 32 FSPs per lesion that are encoded by Nous-209 (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, when restricting the analysis to the 115 immunogenic FSP identified in our trial cohort, we specifically found that 94 of 115 (82%) were present in colorectal precancers and cancers (Fig. 3c). To distinguish CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated responses, CD8+ T cells were depleted. Ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed before and after depletion of CD8+ T cells in presence of the highest reactive pools or FSPs identified as immunogenic. Responses were defined as CD8+ mediated if IFNγ production was reduced after depletion and as CD4⁺ mediated if no substantial change was observed. The results showed that the immunogenic FSPs or reactive pools were able to stimulate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the five tested participants (Fig. 3d).

To analyze the phenotype and killing activity of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells, we generated HLA class I dextramer-detecting neoAg-reactive CD8+ T cells against an FSP from SPEF2 that was identified among the most recurrent immunogenic FSP in multiple LS carriers (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The SPEF2 FSP sequence includes an 8-mer peptide (IAKKRIKL) predicted in silico to be a strong binder to HLA-B*08:01, which is shared by several trial participants and was confirmed as immunogenic by ELISpot in 11 participants (participants 16, 18, 19, 27, 29, 30, 31,39, 40, 10 and 32; Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). In two participants (participants 10 and 32) SPEF2 FSP was mapped as immunogenic after in vitro stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 3). In participant 18, class I dextramer staining detected SPEF2 FSP vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells directly ex vivo at week 9 after MVA boost, representing ~1.64 % of all circulating CD8+ cells, which persisted at 6 months and 1 year after vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 2d), consistent with the longevity of T cell responses observed using ex vivo ELISpot assays. Vaccine-induced SPEF2 FSP dextramer-positive CD8+ T cells were further characterized by examining the phenotype of nave (CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (CD45RA−CCR7+), effector memory (CD45RA−CCR7−) and terminally differentiated (TemRA; CD45RA+CCR7−) memory subsets. The analysis showed that, after Nous-209, antigen-specific T cells display a TemRA phenotype, thus demonstrating the induction of a long-term memory response by Nous-209 (Extended Data Fig. 2d). This was confirmed in additional participants who mounted an immune response against SPEF2 FSP after Nous-209 vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 1). Lastly, the cytotoxic potential was investigated by flow cytometry analysis with intracellular cytokine staining in participant 18 PBMCs stimulated ex vivo with SPEF2 peptide. We observed antigen-specific IFNγ secretion and detection of CD8+ T cells expressing the degranulation marker CD107a, thus indicating a cytotoxic function that was stimulated after Nous-209 vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

A second neoAg, CDC7, found recurrently immunogenic in participants with HLA-A*03:01, was selected to further evaluate the ability of Nous-209-induced T cells to eliminate tumor cells presenting the neoAg. We conducted a direct killing assay using a microfluidic three-dimensional coculture system (Extended Data Fig. 4b). This approach modeled T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing CDC7 FSP using PBMCs from participant 12. Our in vitro assay was based on the MMRd HCT116 human colon cancer cell line that was genetically modified to express the FSP from CDC7 and their matching HLAs (CDC7-HCT116 herein; Methods) and cocultured with in vitro-stimulated effector PBMCs obtained from the same participant before and after vaccination with Nous-209. HCT116 cells were cocultured with PBMCs at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 5:1. To assess both functional and cytotoxic responses, PBMCs were divided into two groups after in vitro stimulation; half of the cells were analyzed for IFNγ secretion using ELISpot and the remaining cells were used for the microfluidic coculture assay. After 48 h, target cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using luminescence-based assays. Our results showed a significant reduction in CDC7-HCT116 tumor cell survival when cocultured with T cells after Nous-209 vaccination compared to both baseline PBMCs from the same participant and all controls (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). To ensure rigorous evaluation, we used multiple control conditions, including HCT116 cells transduced with CDC7 and HCT116 cells transduced only with the HLA of interest but without the CDC7 neoAg. These controls helped determine whether tumor cell killing was CDC7 dependent rather than influenced by HLA expression alone or intrinsic effects of CDC7 transduction. Quantitative viability assays revealed a marked decrease in tumor cell survival after Nous-209 vaccination compared to baseline and all control conditions (P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 4d). In addition, a significant increase in caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis was observed in CDC7-HCT116 cells following coculture with PBMCs after vaccination with Nous-209 (P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 4d), thus confirming antigen-specific T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing the CDC7 cognate pHLA. To strengthen these findings, we assessed the IFNγ secretion capacity of the stimulated PBMCs in response to CDC7 neoAg stimulation. At baseline, there was no significant difference between CDC7-stimulated PBMCs and the negative control (DMSO; P > 0.05), indicating that CDC7-specific responses were not detectable before vaccination. In contrast, PBMCs after Nous-209 vaccination from participant 12 exhibited significantly higher IFNγ secretion compared to both the negative control (DMSO; P < 0.0001) and baseline PBMCs (P < 0.0001), thus reinforcing the antigen-specific activation of Nous-209-induced T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4e). These findings demonstrate that Nous-209 vaccination induces a potent and durable neoAg-specific CD8+ T cell response capable of both cytokine secretion and direct tumor cell killing. The presence of long-lived TemRA CD8+ T cells, their ability to degranulate and their direct cytotoxic function provide compelling evidence that Nous-209 effectively primes the immune system to target and eliminate neoAg-expressing tumor cells in LS carriers.

As a prespecified secondary endpoint of our study, we aimed to characterize the number, size and pathology features of colorectal neoplasia among 43 of 45 vaccinated participants who underwent their standard-of-care screening lower endoscopy at the end of the study. Two vaccinated participants withdrew from the study before undergoing the end-of-study colonoscopy and were not evaluable for this analysis. Overall, the majority of participants (n = 31) had no colorectal adenomas on their end-of-study colonoscopies. Interestingly, of the total 23 adenomas detected in 12 participants, none were classified as advanced adenomas (diameter > 10 mm, presence of high-grade dysplasia and/or villous histology), while two participants had advanced adenomas at baseline colonoscopy (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 4). Compared to baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed in the overall proportion of study participants with detectable adenomas or advanced adenomas or in the total counts at their end-of-study colonoscopy (Extended Data Tables 3 and 4). Genomic characterization of available precancers removed at baseline (n = 10) and end-of-study (n = 12) colonoscopies was performed by next-generation sequencing assessing both the MSI status and the presence of Nous-209 FSPs. Although not statistically significant, the analysis showed a decrease in the proportion of MSI-High (MSI-H) and MSI-Low (MSI-L) precancers observed at baseline compared to end of study. More specifically, MSI-H and MSI-L precancers were observed in 30% and 30% of participants at baseline and 17% and 8% of participants at end-of-study colonoscopy, respectively. After vaccination, two precancers were MSI-H and one was MSI-L, while the remaining nine were microsatellite stable (MSS) (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Regarding the presence of Nous-209 FSPs after vaccination, none of the MSS precancers displayed any of the Nous-209 FSPs, which were only identified in the two MSI-H lesions and in the MSI-L lesion (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Source data

In exploratory analyses performed among 34 participants with evaluable immune response data at 6 months, we observed an association between the breadth of immune response (number of reactive FSP pools) at 6 months and the presence versus absence of any detectable adenomas on the end-of-study colonoscopy (mean: 1.5 versus 4 pools, respectively; Fig. 4c). A similar trend was observed at peak, whereas no statistically significant difference was detected at 12 months, likely because of the expected contraction of the immune response over time. No CRC was identified at colonoscopy. Furthermore, three of 45 vaccinated participants were subsequently diagnosed with invasive noncolorectal carcinomas, including one participant with MMRd gastric cancer, one with MMR-unknown non-small cell lung cancer and one with MMR-proficient prostate cancer.

Cancer interception aims to halt or reverse carcinogenesis at early stages by targeting aberrant cells within precancers. Vaccine-based interception strategies that induce tumor-specific T cells are especially promising in the context of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, where the immune microenvironment of precancers may be less immunosuppressive compared to that of advanced cancers, where immune suppression often blocks T cell activity against tumor antigens, thus preventing effective immune responses. Indeed, for solid tumors, there has been notable recent progress in the development of novel neoAg-based cancer vaccines targeting micrometastatic disease in the adjuvant setting. For example, a recent randomized phase 2 trial of adjuvant personalized mRNA vaccine combined with immune checkpoint blockade in participants with resected high-risk melanoma demonstrated significantly improved recurrence-free survival versus checkpoint blockade alone12. Similarly, among participants with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a phase 1 study of a personalized neoAg mRNA vaccine combined with checkpoint blockade in the adjuvant setting demonstrated a strong correlation between induction of neoAg-specific T cell responses and delayed tumor recurrence14. In both of these examples, the approaches relied on a pipeline of personalized vaccine design and production informed by somatic mutation profiling of surgical tumor specimens. However, when transitioning from adjuvant therapy to cancer interception, personalized vaccine approaches have limited practical application, primarily because of the absence of bulk tumor tissue for sequencing. Therefore, we propose that off-the-shelf vaccine strategies are optimally suited for clinical development towards cancer interception. By focusing on recurrent and shared antigen targets, off-the-shelf vaccines avoid the potential pitfalls and resource-intensity of personalized vaccine design and production. Indeed, recent efforts have demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary signals of activity of an adjuvant off-the-shelf vaccine against the most common and recurrent somatic KRAS mutations observed in colorectal and pancreatic cancers19.

LS carriers represent a well-defined, high-risk population of individuals who are likely to benefit from novel interception strategies against colorectal and other cancers8. Defects in the DNA MMR pathway lead to the development of MSI in LS-associated neoplasms (precancers and cancers) and the accumulation of many shared FSP. These peptides are non-self-antigens and foreign to the immune system, thus representing potentially the most immunogenic and safest type of neoAg. The rationale behind the use of a preventive neoAg-based vaccination study with Nous-209 relies on the induction of a broad T cell response against shared mutations targeting precancers and early-stage tumors to prevent cancer progression in this population. We reasoned that targeting a large number of neoAg is the most effective approach to achieve tumor control across a broad population, maximizing the likelihood of engaging and eradicating tumor cells. Therefore, a vaccine designed to target a wide range of shared neoAg could be particularly valuable in anticipating and targeting mutations that may emerge during tumorigenesis. One key distinction between the vaccine platform used in this study and other neoAg vaccines is that the latter have generally targeted a more limited number of neoAgs, as not all platforms allow for the inclusion of 209 neoAgs for an overall length of 6,000 aa.

In this study, we report the safety and immunogenicity of Nous-209 assessed in a phase 1b/2 trial in healthy LS carriers. Nous-209 was safe in all treated participants with no treatment-related SAEs reported and with mostly mild reactions to the vaccines, consistent with expected safety profile of heterologous prime and boost vaccines with GAd and MVA vectors20,21. NeoAg-specific T cell response was elicited in all evaluable participants after Nous-209 by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot, with induction of broad and polytopic responses targeting multiple FSPs. Although we primarily focused on characterizing CD8+ T cell responses, induction of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was also observed following vaccination, in line with previous data on the capacity of the platform to induce both component of the T cell immunity13,22,23. This is a desirable feature, as several pieces of evidence suggest that promoting both subsets of T cells is beneficial for effective antitumor immunity24,25. Vaccination resulted in the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ with effector memory phenotype. In particular, the observed predominance of TemRA (CCR7⁻CD45RA+) cells among the dextramer+ CD8+ population possibly reflects a repeated antigen exposure in persons with LS, who may experience ongoing presentation of frameshift-derived neoAgs in MSI precancer lesions, contributing to a skewing toward more differentiated effector memory phenotype.

Overall, these results are consistent with the findings from a phase 1 study in metastatic MMRd cancer showing that Nous-209 elicits broad T cell responses in most treated participants18. Interestingly, a recurrent immunogenic FSP (derived from SPEF2) was characterized after vaccination both in LS carriers and in participants with metastatic disease18, with evidence of in vitro induction of cytotoxic T cells determined by the expression of degranulation marker CD107a in LS and trafficking in the tumor bed in vivo in metastatic disease, concomitant with clinical response. Taken together, these findings, including the in vitro cytotoxic activity against a tumor cell line expressing a second recurrent antigen targeted by Nous-209, are supportive for the tumor killing activity of the vaccine-induced T cells.

The selection of our Nous-209 FSPs was initially validated primarily in sporadic metastatic MMRd tumors26,27 and more recently confirmed in a large dataset of 58 incident MMRd CRCs from LS carriers detected during routine surveillance28, thus providing further evidence of the vaccine's potential to target early-stage tumors. An important new finding from our study is the demonstration of the presence of Nous-209 FSPs in the MSI precancers within an independent dataset. This observation underscores the potential of Nous-209 to target precancers and highlights its relevance in the context of cancer interception. At the yearly colonoscopy following vaccination, the frequency of study participants in which at least one adenoma was detected (~28%) was similar to the frequency observed at baseline before vaccination and in line with the expectations29,30. Interestingly, genomic analysis of available precancerous lesions from baseline and end-of-study colonoscopies showed a trend toward reduced frequency of MSI precancers after vaccine exposure, in line with the mechanism of action of Nous-209 targeting frameshift mutations occurring as a consequence of the impairment of the MMR system. Moreover, when focusing on advanced adenomas, their baseline detection rate was 4.65%, consistent with previous reports31, whereas, following Nous-209 administration, no participants with advanced adenomas were found. Advanced adenomas are considered CRC precursors and previous reports have shown that the MMRd status is more frequently observed in advanced adenomas than in adenomas7,32. Therefore, although this trial was not powered to detect significant differences in advanced adenomas among participants, we consider the observed reduction in the frequency of advanced adenomas as a potentially encouraging early signal of efficacy. Nonetheless, these data will help inform the development of further larger and randomized studies of Nous-209 as a strategy for immune interception in LS.

We acknowledge several limitations in our study, including the small sample size that limits the power of correlative analysis. In addition, most participants were self-reported non-Hispanic white, which limits the assessment for differences in safety and immunogenicity across races and ethnicities. By addressing barriers to accrual, future studies with larger cohorts that are representative of all who are affected by LS will be able to confirm the generalizability of our findings. We further acknowledge that deeper characterization of immune responses at the level of individual immunogenic FSPs was limited by the availability and volume of collected blood specimens. While our study provides important safety and immunogenicity signals, a larger randomized study will be essential to evaluate the clinical activity of Nous-209 toward a reduction in cancer incidence in LS. Lastly, except for cardioprotective aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was not allowed during study participation. Given the potential use of aspirin at different dosing as a chemoprevention in LS participants, future studies may need to consider combinatorial strategies.

Overall, this clinical trial provides important proof-of-concept data of the safety and the robustness of induced immunogenicity of Nous-209 in LS carriers, representing a neoAg vaccine-based approach for LS and supporting its clinical development as a valuable intervention for cancer immune interception.

Our study population comprised individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of LS, as determined by documented carrier status of a deleterious or pathogenic or suspected to be deleterious or pathogenic (known or predicted to be detrimental or result in loss of function, respectively) germline mutation in MLH1, MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6 or PMS2, identified by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory test. Consistent with the primary objectives to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Nous-209 amongst healthy LS carriers, eligible trial participants had no evidence of active or recurrent invasive cancers for at least 6 months before screening and received no cancer-directed treatment (surgery, systemic therapy, hormonal therapy or radiation) within 6 months before screening. We excluded participants who had histologic evidence of high-grade dysplasia and/or invasive cancer at baseline screening. Eligible participants had adequate organ function and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1. Except for cardiopreventive aspirin (<100 mg daily), participants consented to refrain from the use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase inhibitors for the duration of the study treatment. At the study entry, a total of nine participants reported taking aspirin at a low dose (<81 mg orally daily) for cardiovascular or cancer prevention. Three of them decided to discontinue its use upon recruitment and six continued, with three stating the use for cardiovascular and three stating the use for cancer-preventive reasons. Participants consented to refrain from receiving other vaccinations within the first 10 weeks of initiating study treatment and from receiving adenoviral-based vaccines for the duration of study participation (including postintervention follow-up from week 9 through week 52). We excluded individuals with active infection, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) except those with documented laboratory evidence of cleared HBV or HCV infection, individuals with a history of organ allograft or other history of immunodeficiency or individuals with a intercurrent condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily of prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study treatment. Females who were pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or men attempting or planning to conceive children within 6 months of the end of study treatment were excluded. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in the study protocol (Supplementary Information).

The trial was a phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label, multicenter, prospective study originally designed with the coprimary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity following initial vaccination with Nous-209 monotherapy. To achieve a goal of at least 36 individuals evaluable for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, up to 45 participants were enrolled between November 2022 and November 2023 at four institutions (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), The University of Puerto Rico, Fox Chase Cancer Center and City of Hope) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) iCAN PREVENT clinical trial consortium. At baseline, all participants underwent standard-of-care screening lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy). Confirmed eligible participants received initial Nous-209 vaccination as a single 1-ml IM injection of GAd20-209-FSPs (nominal concentration of 2 × 1011 viral particles per ml) at week 0 (prime), followed by a single 1-ml IM injection of MVA-209-FSPs (nominal concentration of 2 × 108 infectious units per ml) at week 8 (boost).

Following key preactivation amendments, protocol version 5 was approved for study initiation in August 2022. In October 2023, protocol version 5.3 was approved, allowing for the addition of a revaccination cohort (cohort 2) in which a subset of eligible participants who completed initial Nous-209 vaccination at week 0 and wk 8 (cohort 1) were then randomized to receive either an MVA-209-FSP IM injection at week 52 or a GAd20-209-FSP IM injection at week 52 followed by an MVA-209-FSP IM injection at week 60. Safety and immunogenicity outcomes related to cohort 2 will be reported in a future manuscript. Separate reporting of cohorts 1 and 2 was permitted by protocol.

Our study was designed and developed by academic authors in collaboration with the Division of Cancer Prevention of the NCI and Nouscom. All authors confirm that the study and analyses were conducted in accordance with the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The NCI Central Institutional Review Board and The University of Texas MDACC Institutional Review Board approved this study (protocol nos. MDA21-06-01 and 2022-0065, respectively). Safety monitoring was performed regularly by the Data Safety Monitoring Board of MDACC. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05078866).

The coprimary endpoints of the trial were safety (rate of grade 2 and 3 AEs) and immunogenicity following initial Nous-209 vaccination. Our primary safety and tolerability endpoint was assessed during the prime and boost vaccination phase (week 0 through week 9 + 7 days). AEs were monitored throughout the study (up to 52 weeks + 14 days following initial vaccination) in all participants who received at least the GAd-209-FSP vaccination at week 0 and were graded according to version 5.0 of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs. After each vaccine injection, participants were asked to record symptom reactivity events daily on a memory aid (vaccine report card) for up to 7 days (or up to 8 days after symptom resolution). Protocol-defined injection-site reactions included pain, tenderness, erythema or redness, induration or swelling, itching and bruising, while systemic reactogenicity symptoms included fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, myalgia or muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and arthralgia or joint pain.

Our coprimary immunogenicity endpoint was assessed at week 9 and was defined as reactivity to at least one of the 16 FSP pools using an ELISpot assay. Notably, in the case of detection of reactivity pools at baseline, an increase of at least 80% in the preexisting reactivity (measured at baseline) was considered as a positive response to the vaccine.

Per protocol, evaluable participants underwent screening lower endoscopy (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) at week 52 ± 14 days (cohort 1) or week 68 ± 14 days (cohort 2) for standard-of-care endoscopic assessment in accordance with local institutional practices for high-risk screening populations and for collection of research biopsies. For all participants, clinical endoscopic biopsies of abnormal mucosa and/or resected polyp specimens (if any) were submitted for routine clinical pathology assessment at each participating study site. As prespecified secondary endpoints, we recorded polyp burden (count, size, histology and presence or absence of high-grade dysplasia) and neoplasia incidence. Additional secondary endpoints are detailed in the study protocol (Supplementary Information).

PBMCs from whole blood were isolated at different time points and cryopreserved at each of the clinical sites before shipment to the central laboratory for immunogenicity assessment at Nouscom. To maintain the functionality of PBMCs, isolation and freezing procedures were completed within a maximum of 8 h from blood collection. PBMCs were isolated using Leucosep Bio-One polypropylene tubes (prefilled; Greiner, Merck) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cryopreserved cells were thawed, washed, counted and rested overnight before use in immunological assays.

A set of 976 recombinant, lyophilized peptides, with the majority of them being 15 aa in length, overlapping by 11 aa and spanning the entire sequence of Nous-209, were produced by JPT Peptide Technologies. Individual FSPs were covered by its specific pool of overlapping peptides and then arranged in 16 peptide pools for immunogenicity assessment, as described below. Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted at 40 mg ml−1 in sterile DMSO (Sigma, D2650), aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. To prepare pools 1–16, the peptides were mixed to a final concentration of 0.4 mg ml−1 for each peptide.

IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed ex vivo in triplicate with 2 × 105 PBMCs per well in R10. PBMCs were resuspended in R10 medium, stimulated with a set of peptides designed to cover the 209 FSPs encoded by the vaccine and arranged into 16 peptide pools (P1–P16) at a final concentration of 3 µg ml−1. Cells were plated in ELISpot plates (human IFNγ ELISpot PLUS kit, Mabtech) and incubated for 18–20 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. At the end of incubation, the ELISpot assay was developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spontaneous cytokine production (background) was measured by incubating PBMCs with medium alone, supplemented with the peptide diluent DMSO (negative control, Sigma-Aldrich), whereas CEFX (JPT Peptide Technologies), a pool of known peptide epitopes for a range of HLA subtypes and different infectious agents, was used as positive control. Results are expressed as SFCs per 106 PBMCs in stimulated cultures after subtracting the DMSO background. A response was considered positive if (1) the number of SFCs per 106 PBMCs ≥ 50 and (2) it was at least twice the DMSO background value. A subject was classified as a responder if reactivity to at least one of the 16 FSP peptide pools is induced after vaccination. If a subject exhibited preexisting reactivity to a peptide pool at baseline, the vaccine was expected to enhance this response by at least 80% in at least one of the 16 FSP peptide pools; in this case, such participants were considered as responders. NeoAg vaccine peptide pools were deconvoluted to identify immunogenic peptides by IFNγ ELISpot assays ex vivo or after in vitro stimulation. ELISpot plates were analyzed on the CTL ImmunoSpot S6 universal analyzer.

To characterize neoAg-induced CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell responses, CD8+ T cells were selectively depleted from the total using anti-CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, 130-045-201) following the manufacturer's instructions. The CD8− cell population was then stimulated with either individual peptides or peptide pools (final concentration 3 μg ml−1) and T cell responses against specific peptides were assessed using an IFNγ ELISpot assay. The depletion efficiency of CD8+ T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. T cell responses were classified as CD8⁺ mediated if a significant reduction in IFNγ spot count was observed following CD8⁺ T cell depletion. Conversely, responses were classified as CD4⁺ mediated if no substantial change in spot count was detected after depletion

PBMCs were thawed and rested for 1 h at 37 °C in R10. The samples were then incubated with anti-human Fc block (Pharmingen BD) at a 1:50 dilution in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1× PBS and 0.5% FBS) for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing with FACS buffer, the samples were stained with HLA class I dextramer HLA-B*0801/IAKKRIKL 8-mer peptide (SPEF2 FSP) conjugated to PE at room temperature for 30 min, protected from light. The live/dead near-IR dead cell stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L10119) was added at 1:100 dilution and cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The following surface staining antibodies were added: CD4 (BioLegend, clone A161A1, 357406), CD8 (BioLegend, clone SK1, 344710), CD45RA (BioLegend, clone HI100, 304142) and CCR7 (CD197; BioLegend, clone G043H7, 353226). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer until acquisition. For intracellular staining, PBMCs were stimulated with the vaccine single peptide (from SPEF2, 11-mer) (4 µg ml−1), DMSO (control) and PMA/ionomycin cell stimulation cocktail (positive control; Affymetrix) in the presence of anti-human CD107a (LAMP1; BioLegend, clone H4A3, 328618). After overnight coculture, BD GolgiPlug transport inhibitors (BD, 51-2301KZ) were added. Following 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with Fc block for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed and stained with live/dead dye in staining buffer for 15 minutes at room temperature. For surface staining, cells were labeled with CD4 (BioLegend, clone A161A1, 357406) and CD8 (BioLegend, clone SK1, 344710) antibodies. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed twice before fixation and permeabilization with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit) for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were washed twice and resuspended in 1× perm/wash buffer (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit) for intracellular staining with IFNγ (BioLegend, clone 4S.B3, 502532). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed and then resuspended in perm/wash buffer until acquisition. Data were acquired on a BD FACS Canto II and analyzed using FlowJo (version 10.1). The gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2.

To investigate neoAg-specific immune responses, we genetically modified the MMRd HCT116 colon cancer cell line, which harbors an MLH1 mutation, to express multiple HLA alleles and neoAg minigenes (MGs) derived from the CDC7 gene mutation. These MGs encode neoAg peptides of varying amino acid lengths (specifically 50-mer, 15-mer and 9-mer) designed to be presented by both MHC class I and class II alleles, as informed by previous studies7. The codon-optimized CDC7 50-mer construct was cloned into a lentiviral backbone obtained from VectorBuilder (plasmid VB240607-1533chz). The design of the construct included an N-terminal signal peptide (MSPMRVTAPRTLILLLSGALALTETWAGS), the mutated CDC7 epitope containing the HLA-A*03:01-restricted 15-mer (TSRILNLQVLKKILR) with its minimal 9-mer core (TSRILNLQV), an MHC I trafficking domain (MCLRLRTKLEKALSALFIWPQHSYKIVGIVAGLAVLAVVVIGAVVATVMCRRKSSGG) and a flexible C-terminal linker (KGGSYSQAASSDSAQGSDVSLTA). This configuration ensured efficient routing of the CDC7 construct through the secretory pathway and enhanced antigen processing and presentation for recognition by neoAg-specific T cells. HCT116 cells were transfected to express HLA-A11:02, A24:01, A03:01 and B07:02, in addition to their endogenous alleles (HLA-A02:01, A01:01, and B45:01). The transfection process followed a two-step protocol. In the first step, HLA allele expression cassettes were cloned into PiggyBac transposon vectors under constitutive promoters and cotransfected with a transposase helper plasmid into HCT116 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescent reporters (red fluorescent protein, blue fluorescent protein and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)) were included to enable tracking of transgene expression and selection of stable clones by drug selection, followed by flow cytometry sorting to ensure the expression of all transgenes within single cells. In the second step, HCT116 cells carrying the HLA constructs were transduced with ready-to-use lentiviral particles generated by VectorBuilder carrying the CDC7 50-mer construct. Cells were plated 1 day before infection, exposed to viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene and spinoculated at 800g for 90 min at 32 °C to enhance transduction efficiency. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh complete DMEM and cells were expanded for 5–7 days. Puromycin selection was applied to enrich for stable integrants, which were further purified by FACS on the basis of EGFP expression. Stable clones were subsequently validated by PCR and sequencing for integration, by western blot and flow cytometry for expression and by functional assays to confirm HLA surface expression and CDC7 MG presentation.

For the functional evaluation of neoAg-specific immune responses, the 15-mer peptide CDC7 (TSRILNLQVLKKILR), which is restricted to MHC I, was used for in vitro validation. The peptide was synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies and used to stimulate PBMCs derived from LS trial participant 12 collected at baseline and at week 8 after Nous-209. PBMCs were cultured in R10 medium (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine (Corning, 10040CV), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone, SH30070.03), 10 mM HEPES buffer (Corning, 25060-CI) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Corning, 30002CI)), supplemented with 330 U per ml recombinant human IL-7. Stimulation was carried out using 4 µg ml−1 CDC7 peptide per well, with concanavalin A and DMSO serving as positive and negative controls, respectively. On days 3, 7 and 10, the cells were replenished with R10 medium containing 10 U per ml interleukin 2 (IL-2). After 12 days of culture, the expanded T cells were divided into two populations; one half was used for microfluidic coculture assays to assess tumor cell-targeting potency, while the other half was subjected to IL-2 withdrawal for subsequent IFNγ ELISpot analysis. On day 13, the second population of stimulated PBMCs was seeded in triplicate (3 × 105 cells per well) into 96-well ELISpot plates precoated with human IFNγ capture antibodies. The cells were restimulated with 3 µg ml−1 CDC7 peptide and incubated for 16–20 h. IFNγ secretion was measured using the ELISpot assay, following the manufacturer's protocol (Mabtech). SFCs were quantified using the ImmunoSpot S6 UNIVERSAL analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited).

To evaluate the tumor-targeting potency of neoAg-stimulated T cells, experiments were performed using the OrganoPlate three-lane 64 microfluidic system (MIMETAS). A collagen I extracellular matrix (ECM) gel was prepared by mixing collagen I (5 mg ml−1; AMSbio), 1 M HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and NaHCO3 (Sigma) in a 1:1:8 ratio on ice. Then, 2 μl of the gel mixture was loaded into each gel inlet and polymerized in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Genetically modified HCT116 cells expressing CDC7 MG derived from the CDC7 gene mutation, encoding peptides of varying amino acid lengths, were used in these experiments. Cells were labeled with the fluorescent dye CellTracker red CMTPX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded into the top perfusion inlets adjacent to the ECM gel channels at a density of 10,000 cells per µl (2 µl per chip). The plate was incubated on its side for 3–4 h to ensure cell attachment to the ECM gel. NeoAg-stimulated PBMCs were labeled with the fluorescent dye CellTracker green CMFDA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded into the bottom perfusion channels at a 5:1 E:T ratio. Following cell seeding, 50 µl of culture medium was added to all perfusion inlets and outlets to ensure complete filling of the channels without air bubbles. The coculture system was maintained on a rocker platform (14° inclination, 8-min intervals) for 48 h to enable continuous medium perfusion. After the 48-h incubation, genetically modified HCT116 cells and control cells were collected from the microfluidic chamber outlets. Migrated T cells were depleted from the collected samples using CD3 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and column-based magnetic separation according to the manufacturer's instructions. This process ensured the efficient removal of CD3+ T cells, leaving a purified tumor cell population for downstream analyses. Tumor cell viability was subsequently assessed using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Apoptotic cell death was quantified using a caspase 3/7 luminescence assay, performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols. For viability, equal volumes of reagent and culture medium were added to samples, inducing cell lysis and generating a stable luminescent signal proportional to intracellular adenosine triphosphate content. Luminescence was recorded using a plate luminometer, expressed as relative luminescence units, normalized to untreated control wells and reported as percentage viability relative to control. For apoptosis, equal volumes of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent and sample were combined, resulting in caspase-mediated cleavage of a luminogenic DEVD substrate and light emission proportional to caspase 3/7 activity. Luminescence was recorded on a plate luminometer, normalized to control wells and expressed as percentage apoptosis relative to baseline.

Genomic DNA was extracted from five serial slides from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of endoscopic resections of colorectal adenomas from on-study colonoscopies. First, we deparaffinized the tissue sections with xylene and 100% alcohol. Then, tissues were collected and incubated with lysis buffer in the presence of proteinase K using the Roche microRNA isolation kit. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm and cell pellets were used for extraction of genomic DNA using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA quality was assessed using TapeStation analyzer; then, Twist exome capture, library preparation and raw sequencing were performed by the Advanced Technology Genomics Core at The University of Texas MDACC using the Illumina NovaSeqX platform. Alignment of WES data was performed using BWA-mem (version 0.7.19) with default parameters to human genome reference hg38. Duplicate reads were marked with GATK (version 4.6.2.0). Base quality recalibration was performed with GATK Apply BQSR.

Tumor exome data were processed starting from the raw data (FASTQ files), which were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information under BioProject PRJNA954699. A preliminary quality control of the raw sequence data was performed by filtering out reads of low quality with Trimmomatic (version 0.33)33. The remaining reads were aligned on the GRCh37 human genome BWA-mem (version 0.7.17-r1188)34. Multimapping reads were filtered out using SAMtools (version 1.9)35. Optical duplicates were marked using Picard's MarkDuplicates tool with Picard tools. DNA alignments were further optimized at regions around indels and base scores were recalibrated after the optimization step using GATK software (version 3.7)36. Frameshift mutations within the Nous-209 neoAgs were identified from aligned sequencing data (BAM files) using a lookup-based approach. A mutation was considered present if a minimum of three reads supported the variant and the variant allele frequency (VAF) exceeded 10%, consistent with previously established criteria.27

MSI status of previously published datasets7 and colorectal adenomas from on-study colonoscopies was determined using MSIsensor2 (version 0.1; https://github.com/niu-lab/msisensor2.git)37 in ‘tumor-only' mode. The pipeline involved indexing the reference genome (hg19), scanning 2,793 MS sites and calculating MSI scores on the basis of the proportion of unstable loci. A sample was classified as MSI-H if the MSI score exceeded the predefined threshold of 20%, MSI-L if the MSI score was between 10% and 20% and MSS if the score was <10%, according to the recommended cutoffs from MSIsensor2.

MHC class I binding affinity predictions were performed using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource MHC I prediction tool (https://www.iedb.org/). Peptide sequences of interest were analyzed for their potential to bind HLA class I molecules using the Consensus method (version 2.18) with peptide lengths of 8, 9 and 10 aa. The analysis included the prediction of binding affinities (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values) for HLA alleles. Downstream immunogenicity analyses were performed, prioritizing peptides on the basis of the results of MHC class I binding affinity predictions.

The trial was conducted using Simon's minimax two-stage design, wherein the immunogenicity response rate was defined by the number of evaluable participants with immunogenicity by ELISpot assay among all treated participants. On the basis of prior evidence38, our primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated with respect to a predefined target immunogenicity response rate of ≥75%; by contrast, we considered a immunogenicity response rate of ≤55% to be unacceptable. In the first stage, 24 participants were enrolled and accrual halted to fully evaluate immunogenicity at week 9; with 16 or more responses observed in the first stage, additional participants enrolled in the study to reach a total of 36 evaluable participants. Upon study completion, Nous-209 vaccination was considered effective if >24 participants demonstrated immunogenicity. Under these operating characteristics, if the true immunogenicity response rate is 0.55, the probability of stopping the trial early was 83% at an expected sample size 26. Immunogenicity rates are reported with 95% exact confidence intervals evaluated using the Clopper–Pearson method. Our study applied a Bayesian toxicity monitoring plan in which treatment would be considered unsafe if the estimated rate of unacceptable toxicity (grade 3 of higher treatment-related AEs except for vaccine reactogenicity symptoms) was ≥30% with a probability of ≥70%. Assuming a β prior probability of toxicity with parameters (0.3, 0.7) and considering the Simon's two-stage design, the trial had a 99.6% chance of stopping early if the true toxicity rate was 50% when the true response rate was 55%. SAS 9.4 was used for exploratory statistical analyses of associations between clinical and demographic factors and immunogenicity. Frequencies and percentages are reported for categorical variables. Summary statistics such as number of nonmissing observations, mean, median, s.d., minimum and maximum are provided for continuous data. The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the association between categorical variables and vaccine responses. Wilcoxon's rank sum test or Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the distributions of continuous response variables (such as the number positive pools at specific time points), across different demographic or clinical groups. Statistical analyses for cell viability, apoptosis and cytokine secretion were conducted using Prism 10 (GraphPad Software). For cell viability and apoptosis assays, data were analyzed across the following groups: genetically modified HCT116 cells cocultured with CDC7-stimulated PBMCs (patient 12 at baseline and after Nous-209), nongenetically modified HCT116 cells cocultured with CDC7-stimulated patient 12 PBMCs at baseline and after Nous-209 (control group) and genetically modified HCT116 cells cultured alone (CDC7-HCT116 control). Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-sided unpaired t-test, with significance indicated in the figure (P values < 0.0001). For the CTL-related IFNγ ELISpot secretion assay, paired t-tests were used to compare PBMCs at baseline and after Nous-209, with comparisons to the negative control (DMSO) and results expressed as the mean ± s.d.; statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Levels of significance are indicated as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001. Significant differences are annotated in the respective figures for clarity. All other ELISpot data were presented as the mean ± s.e.m., with significance tested using a two-tailed, Mann–Whitney statistical analysis.

Pie charts shows frequencies of naive (CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (CM; CD45RA−CCR7+), effector memory (EM; CD45RA−CCR7−) and T effector memory RA+ (TEMRA; CD45RA+CCR7−) cells in total CD8+ population (left-most chart) and CD8+dextramer+ populations from corresponding dot plots.

Source data

Bars represent pre-IVS and post-IVS ELISpot results, shown as mean SFC/10⁶ PBMCs ± SEM, dots represent the 3 biological replicates used to generate each mean. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test; ****P < 0.0001.

Source data

a) Representative dot plot for participant 18 intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for CD8+ cells producing CD107α (left) and IFN-γ (right) in ex vivo culture with DMSO or SPEF2 CD8 peptide. Cells were gated on PBMCs [forward scatter (FSC)-A versus side scatter (SSC)-A], singlets (FSC-A versus FSC-H), live cells (FSC-A versus Live/Dead), CD8 and cytokine + cells. b) Schematic representation of the microfluidic 3D co-culture system used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of Nous-209-induced T cells against CDC7-expressing HCT116 cells. Effector T cells were co-cultured with genetically modified HCT116 target cells within an extracellular matrix gel under gravity-driven flow at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 5:1. Cytotoxicity was assessed using caspase 3/7 apoptosis assays and viability measurements after 48 hours. c) Representative fluorescence microscopy images showing CDC7-HCT116 target cells (red) and T cells (green) before and after Nous-209 vaccination. Images depict baseline PBMCs from Pt12 and post-vaccination PBMCs, alongside control conditions. A reduction in red fluorescence in the post-vaccination condition indicates antigen-specific tumor cell killing. Scale bar: 100 µm. d) Quantification of tumor cell viability and caspase-3/7 apoptosis after 48-hour co-culture. Each point represents one independent microfluidic culture (n = 3 technical replicates from the same donor). Bar graphs show the percentage of viable and apoptotic cells across experimental conditions, including baseline and post-Nous-209 T cells, as well as control conditions (HCT116 cells co-cultured with baseline PBMCs, post-Nous-209 PBMCs, and CDC7-HCT116 without T cells). Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-sided unpaired t-test, with significance indicated in the figure (P-value < 0.0001 where shown). e) IFN-γ ELISpot analysis of in vitro expanded baseline and post-vaccination PBMCs from Pt12 in response to CDC7 neoantigen stimulation. Each dot represents one technical replicate well, defined as an independently plated well from the same PBMC sample subjected to identical stimulation conditions (n = 3 wells per condition). DMSO and ConA were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Bars show mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed using a two-sided paired t-test, with significance indicated in the figure (P-value < 0.0001 where shown).

Source data

a) Microsatellite Instability (MSI) status derived from whole-exome sequencing data pre-cancers endoscopically removed at baseline (N = 10) and post-vaccination (N = 12). MSI status was categorized as high (MSI-H, MSI score >20%), low (MSI-L, score between 10 and 20%), or stable (MSS, score <10%) based on established thresholds; b) Number of Nous-209 FSPs identified in baseline (N = 10) and post-vaccination (N = 12) pre-cancers.

Humanoid robots are being trialed in car manufacturing.Credit: VCG/Getty

Humanoid robots are on the brink of being commercially useful, say Chinese and US firms that have announced plans to produce them at scale in the past three months.

Many researchers agree that there has been a step change in humanoid capability over the past five years, owing to cheaper parts as well as innovations such as improved battery power and artificial-intelligence algorithms, which allow for better perception and autonomy.

In November, Chinese firm UBTECH announced that it had made “the world's first mass delivery of humanoid robots”. More than 1,000 of its Walker S2 model humanoids were sent to factories in 2025, says Yu Zheng, a roboticist and vice-dean of the UBTECH Research Institute in Shenzhen. The silver-white humanoid can walk autonomously and stably, as well as grab and move objects, but deployment “is still at an early stage”, says Zheng.

Whether humanoids are saving companies time or money remains to be seen. Battery time is limited to hours and many activities still require human operators, who use the robots as puppets to complete tasks while gathering data for future iterations. Other researchers caution that technical and safety limitations mean that humanoids are far from ready for general-purpose use in homes and offices.

“They can do maybe one or two things autonomously, or semi-autonomously,” says Esyin Chew, a roboticist at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom, who is overseeing a project involving trialling more than 80 robots in service and health-care settings. “But they cannot react to real-world problems like our human brains,” she says.

The AI revolution is coming to robots: how will it change them?

The AI revolution is coming to robots: how will it change them?

Science fiction has long fuelled the idea that robots will ultimately come in human form, despite the body type being inherently complex and unstable compared with the static or quadruped robots already used in industry, says Oskar Palinko, a roboticist at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. “A humanoid will fall over if it loses power,” he says.

But humanoids have the advantage of functioning in environments people have created. This in theory could make a humanoid a “universal tool” that could do the job of multiple other types of machines, says Palinko.

Humanoids are much closer to this dream than a decade ago, he says, thanks to denser batteries that fuel bots for hours rather than minutes, cheaper and more precise actuators (that convert electricity to movement) and AI learning algorithms in robot control systems. Developers are increasingly making use of generative models that enable robots to 'reason' and make sense of the world, as well as imbue them with the ability to learn tasks for which they are not pre-programmed.

Humanoids first application could be in car factories. Some US robotics developers, including Boston Dynamics and Tesla, are running pilots of humanoid robots in their parent company's industrial plants. The automotive industry is “an ideal setting” in which to apply humanoids, says Carolina Parada, based in Boulder, Colorado, who leads the robotics team at Google DeepMind, which last week announced a partnership with Boston Dynamics. Their factories host diverse and complex tasks and “in a semi-structured environment that is built for robots”, she says.

Companies are pinning their hopes on robots learning on the job. When a UBTECH Walker S2 fails while working autonomously, a backup remote operator takes over, completing the task, says Zheng. This process gathers data to improve future functionality he says. UBTECH and Boston Dynamics are applying the same technique in vast data-collection centres, in which humans remotely operate humanoid robots to teach them to perform a range of tasks.

Robots demonstrate principles of collective intelligence

Although China and the United States are leading the way in humanoid development, China seems particularly poised to embrace the robots. Factories in the country are willing to let UBTECH test out and improve their robots, says Zheng. ""Currently the efficiency and productivity of a humanoid robot may not match those of a human worker, and our customers know that well,"" adds a UBTECH spokesperson. ""They see it as the beginning.""

Despite advances in lipid-lowering treatment, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality, underscoring the need to address residual risk. Targeting both the synthesis and clearance of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins is a promising approach. Liver X receptor (LXR) repression can reduce plasma TG and cholesterol and improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing de novo lipogenesis and intestinal lipid absorption and enhancing clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins, but its clinical utility remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate the role of LXR inverse agonists in lipid metabolism and metabolic diseases in preclinical models and humans. Given concerns that systemic LXR repression may impair reverse cholesterol transport, we developed TLC-2716, an orally administered, gut- and liver-restricted LXR inverse agonist. In human liver organoids modeling steatohepatitis, TLC-2716 reduced lipid accumulation and suppressed inflammation and fibrotic gene expression. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial, 14-day treatment with TLC-2716 was well tolerated (primary endpoints) and resulted in placebo-adjusted reductions up to 38.5% in plasma TG and 61% in postprandial remnant cholesterol (secondary endpoints). In conclusion, these results highlight the tolerability and therapeutic potential of TLC-2716 as a treatment for managing dyslipidemia and reducing residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in humans. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05483998.

Dyslipidemia encompasses a broad spectrum of lipid abnormalities, including hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride (TG) > 150 mg dl−1, a common dyslipidemia in adults1), elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Excessive circulating TG contributes to metabolic disorders, including acute pancreatitis2, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)3 and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)4. Elevated remnant cholesterol (RC), which represents the cholesterol in TG-rich lipoproteins, is also an independent risk factor for ASCVD5. Currently, management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg dl−1) focuses on lifestyle modification and fibrates as first-line therapy6. Given the increasing prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, research into more effective treatment strategies remains essential.

Hypertriglyceridemia results from an imbalance between the production and release of TG-rich lipoproteins from the liver (very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)) and intestine (chylomicrons) and lipolytic removal of TG from these lipoproteins and their remnants5. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the main enzyme involved in hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins, and its activity is inhibited by apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) and angiopoietin-like proteins (for example, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4); therapies that inhibit ANGPTLs and ApoC3 to reduce plasma TG are under investigation7,8,9. Furthermore, inhibiting de novo lipogenesis (DNL)10 provides another strategy to reduce serum TG and potentially tissue inflammation attributable to lipotoxic mediators11.

The liver X receptors (LXRs; LXRα (encoded by NR1H3) and LXRβ (encoded by NR1H2)) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and key transcriptional regulators of systemic lipid metabolism12,13. LXR activation increases liver and plasma TG and LDL-C in animal models14,15,16,17 and humans18 by upregulating DNL genes10, including SREBF1, ACACA and FASN, and suppressing hepatic LPL activity by inducing ANGPTL3 and APOC3 (ref. 7). By contrast, repression of LXR activity in the liver reduces hepatic DNL and, consequently, plasma and liver TG and improves hypertriglyceridemia and related comorbidities in preclinical models19. Therapies that inhibit LXR target genes involved in lipogenesis (for example, ACACA and FASN) and lipid clearance (for example, ANGPTL3 and APOC3) show promising safety and efficacy in clinical trials20. Repression of LXR systemically carries potential risks, including the impairment of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells such as macrophages, which could promote atherogenesis and negatively impact cardiometabolic health21. In fact, LXR agonists increase ABCA1 expression and RCT22,23 and reduce atherosclerosis in mice24, but their clinical development was hindered by parallel increases in plasma TG and LDL-C. Together, these data formed the basis for the development of LXR inverse agonists that have shown beneficial effects on hyperlipidemia25, alcoholic liver disease26,27 or MASLD28 preclinically. However, to date, no LXR inverse agonist has been evaluated in humans.

Here, we leveraged human genetic data, dysmetabolic rodent models, humanized experimental models, toxicology studies and a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of TLC-2716, an orally administered LXR inverse agonist, which to date has not been tested in humans19,29. In dysmetabolic rodents, TLC-2716 and an analog (TLC-6665) reduced serum and liver TG and plasma cholesterol; these results were validated in humanized liver mice and a human liver organoid (HLO) model of steatohepatitis. Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment of TLC-2716 revealed that its activity is primarily restricted to the liver and gut, thereby avoiding inhibition of peripheral RCT and reducing atherogenic risk. The preclinical safety of TLC-2716 was confirmed in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) toxicology studies, and its preliminary tolerability, efficacy and PK were demonstrated in a phase 1 trial in healthy participants. In conclusion, LXR repression by TLC-2716 improved lipid homeostasis without notable adverse effects (in preclinical studies and humans), supporting its further clinical development for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and associated cardiometabolic disorders.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the UK Biobank (UKBB)30,31. As expected32, genetic variants within NR1H3, but not NR1H2 (Extended Data Fig. 1a), are associated with lipid biomarkers, such as TG, HDL-C and ApoA, glucose and plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Fig. 1a). In two other unrelated human populations (FinnGen33 and the Million Veteran Program34), GWAS results confirmed the associations between genetic variants within NR1H3, but not NR1H2, and its target genes (for example, APOC3, APOE, IDOL and ACACA) and metabolism-related phenotypic traits, including hyperlipidemia and plasma TG (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Fine-mapping indicated that rs61731956, an NR1H3 locus, might be the potential causal signal for HDL-C and ApoA. Burden testing also suggested a link between NR1H3 function and lipid metabolism (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b).

We also analyzed human liver gene expression data from Gene Expression Omnibus35, Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx)36 and the Human Liver Cohort37. Consistent with previous studies, expression of NR1H3 correlated positively with genes associated with amino acid, fatty acid, TG and cholesterol metabolism, indicating its essential role in lipid regulation (Fig. 1b,c). However, associations between lipid metabolism and NR1H2 were less robust (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). We then explored two human MASLD datasets38,39 and found that hepatic expression of NR1H3 is increased in individuals with MASLD Activity Scores (NAS) from 1 to 7, compared with those without MASLD (NAS = 0; Fig. 1d). Moreover, half of LXR target genes are upregulated in individuals with advanced hepatic fibrosis (stage > 2; Fig. 1e). Consistently, hepatic expression of LXR target genes, such as Fasn, Scd1 and Acaca, positively correlates with liver steatosis and liver TG in MASLD mouse models, whereas Srebf1 expression positively correlates with plasma TG40 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). In addition, we performed Mendelian randomization to test whether changes in NR1H3 expression are causally linked to lipid homeostasis. We confirmed that higher NR1H3 expression in blood causes an increase in TG in humans, and its expression is also associated with HDL-C and liver disease markers (Fig. 1f).

TLC-2716 (ref. 41) and its analog TLC-6665 (ref. 41) are two LXR inverse agonists. Information on these compounds is available in patent US11970484B2 (ref. 41; Supplementary Fig. 1). Their potencies against LXRα and LXRβ were evaluated in biochemical binding assays, cellular mammalian two-hybrid interaction assays evaluating nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCOR) recruitment and cellular reporter assays evaluating transcriptional activity (Fig. 2a). TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 demonstrated comparable binding to and repression of LXRα and LXRβ activity with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of 7–15 and 14–17 nM, respectively (Fig. 2a). Repression of LXR activity by TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced intracellular TG accumulation in primary human Upcyte hepatocytes with an EC50 of 289 ± 34 nM via inhibition of DNL19 (Fig. 2b).

To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LXR inverse agonists in vivo, we used three different dysmetabolic rodent models, including high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice, HFD-fed Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and HFD-fed Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (Extended Data Fig. 3a). In these models, TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced hepatic expression of DNL genes and plasma and liver TG (Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 3b). The area under curve (AUC) for plasma TG and total cholesterol (TC) was significantly reduced at the highest dose of TLC-2716 (1 mg per kg (body weight) per day) in DIO mice and ZDF rats (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Importantly, TLC-2716 did not impact liver injury biomarkers, including plasma alanine transaminase (Extended Data Fig. 3d) or aspartate aminotransferase (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Similarly, TLC-6665 also inhibited hepatic expression of DNL genes (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d) and reduced liver and plasma TG levels in DIO mice and ZDF rats (Fig. 2g,h).

In addition to direct effects on hepatic lipid synthesis, LXR repression exerts pleiotropic effects to reduce dyslipidemia. TLC-6665 reduced intestinal lipid absorption, measured by the uptake of 3H-labeled triolein tracer, in DIO mice (Fig. 2i). Further, TLC-2716 dose dependently inhibited ileal Srebp1c expression in DIO mice (Fig. 2j). In ZDF rats, TLC-2716 reduced hepatic Angptl3 expression and plasma levels of ANGPTL3 (Fig. 2k). Similarly, liver expression of Angptl3, Angptl4 and Angptl8, as well as Apoc1, Apoc2 and Apoc3, was suppressed by TLC-6665 in ZDF rats (Fig. 2l). Together, these data confirm that LXR inverse agonists improve dyslipidemia via multiple mechanisms, including direct inhibition of lipid synthesis in the liver (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d) and intestine (Fig. 2j), reduced intestinal absorption of dietary lipids (Fig. 2i) and increased lipid clearance from circulation (Fig. 2k,l).

The therapeutic effects of our LXR inverse agonists in MASLD were evaluated in the choline-deficient HFD and sodium nitrite rat model42 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Over 6 weeks of treatment, TLC-6665 decreased liver fibrosis (assessed histologically with picrosirius red staining; Extended Data Fig. 5b) and hepatic hydroxyproline and collagen content by 64% and 50%, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Liver TG (Extended Data Fig. 5e) and hepatic expression of DNL-related genes, stellate cell activation genes and fibrogenesis-related genes (Timp1) were also reduced (Extended Data Fig. 5f).

The effect of LXR repression by TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight) per day) on insulin sensitivity in DIO mice was assessed after 4 weeks of treatment using a two-step hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp, where pioglitazone (30 mg per kg (body weight) per day) served as a positive control. The glucose infusion rate was higher in mice on TLC-6665 than in those treated with vehicle and was noninferior to pioglitazone, indicating enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). Hepatic glucose production suppression with TLC-6665 trended to be similarly reduced to pioglitazone during the 8 mU kg−1 min−1 insulin infusion (Extended Data Fig. 5h). Glucose utilization by muscle was also higher with TLC-6665, particularly in the oxidative soleus muscle (Extended Data Fig. 5i). A higher dose of TLC-2716 (15 mg per kg (body weight) per day) also improved glucose homeostasis in ZDF rats, as evidenced by an approximately 56% reduction in fasting plasma glucose after four weeks of treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5j). LXR inverse agonists hence improve insulin sensitivity in dysmetabolic rodents.

Because cholesterol metabolism differs between rodents and humans, humanized liver chimeric PXB mice were used to confirm the effects of TLC-2716 on lipid metabolism43. TLC-2716 trended to reduce hepatic TG, despite the short duration (8 days) of dosing (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Moreover, hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol and TG metabolism was suggestively reduced (adjusted P < 0.1) with TLC-2716 (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Specifically, TLC-2716 reduced the expression of HMGCR, indicative of reduced cholesterol synthesis, and genes involved in hepatic LDL-C uptake (PCSK9 and IDOL) and bile acids synthesis (CYP7A1). Reductions in the expression of ANGPTL3 and DNL-associated genes were also observed with TLC-2716 (Extended Data Fig. 6c).

The effect of TLC-2716 on lipid accumulation was also evaluated in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived HLOs established from human donors with different genetic backgrounds, including those with a known risk variant for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH; the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) rs1260326: C (GCKRCC) > T variant (GCKRTT))44. These HLOs were exposed to high concentrations of oleate for 3 days to induce a MASH-like phenotype (steatotic HLOs (sHLOs)) and then treated with TLC-2716 or vehicle (Fig. 3a). TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced intracellular lipid content in sHLOs (Fig. 3b,c). RNA sequencing revealed that sHLOs with different GCKR genotypes were segregated by principal component 1 (PC1), whereas PC2 separated sHLOs by TLC-2716 (5 µM; Fig. 3d). Gene set enrichment analysis further illustrated that TLC-2716 suppressed the expression of LXR-associated genes (Fig. 3e) and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis, with a more pronounced effect in the GCKRTT sHLOs, wherein lipid biosynthesis is upregulated45,46 (Fig. 3f).

Source data

Plasma and tissue (liver and ileum) concentrations of TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 were evaluated in male DIO mice after 14 days of treatment. The compounds demonstrated different pharmacology in vivo, with TLC-2716 having lower plasma exposures and higher and sustained ileum and liver exposures (due to active uptake into hepatocytes) than TLC-6665 (ratio of AUCs of TLC-2716/TLC-6665 in plasma and liver of 0.17 and 6.24, respectively; Fig. 3g). TLC-2716 also dose dependently reduced the expression of transcripts involved in cholesterol synthesis (Hmgcr) in the liver and cholesterol efflux transporters (Abca1, Abcg5 and Abcg8) in the intestine (Fig. 3h). However, TLC-2716 did not alter the expression of the cholesterol efflux transporters Abca1 and Abcg1 in the buffy coat, the fraction of blood that primarily contains white blood cells (Fig. 3h). These data indicate that TLC-2716 acts primarily in the liver and intestine and does not inhibit LXR activity in white blood cells, which are responsible for RCT and associated with atherogenic risk. Given its lower plasma exposure, TLC-2716 was selected for clinical evaluation in the treatment of severe dyslipidemias and related disorders.

The safety of TLC-2716 was assessed in preclinical toxicology studies in mice and NHPs. TLC-2716 was administered orally at 1, 5 and 15 mg per kg (body weight) per day (2- to 28-fold the maximum clinical dose based on allometric scaling) for 28 days to young, lean male and female NHPs. Dose-dependent reductions in plasma TG and TC were observed in TLC-2716-treated monkeys (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), without adverse clinical or histopathological observations at any tested doses. In mice, TLC-2716 was administered orally at 15, 60 and 120 mg per kg (body weight) per day (7- to 57-fold the maximum clinical dose) to lean male and female CD-1 mice for 26 weeks. Consistent with observations in dysmetabolic rodents, plasma TG and TC were reduced at all doses of TLC-2716 in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). No adverse clinical observations or changes in liver biochemistry or histopathology indicative of liver injury were present at any tested doses (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). In both toxicology studies, the no-observed-adverse-effect level was the highest dose evaluated.

Given the favorable efficacy and toxicological profile in preclinical species, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of TLC-2716 was conducted in humans (ClinicalTrials.govNCT05483998, from 27 July 2022 to 18 June 2023; Fig. 4a). TLC-2716 was first tested in a single-ascending dose (SAD) study in 50 healthy individuals in which single doses of up to 20 mg were well tolerated19,29 (Fig. 4a,b). To explore the PK and effect of multiple doses on safety-related endpoints and plasma lipids and biomarkers, another 50 healthy individuals were randomized into a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) trial (Fig. 4a,c). At baseline, mean plasma TG was 102 ± 39 mg dl−1 and LDL-C was 111 ± 30 mg dl−1; TG ≥ 100 mg dl−1, RC ≥ 20 mg dl−1 and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg dl−1 were observed in 23, 20 and 30 individuals, respectively (Table 1). Participants were randomized to receive either placebo (two participants per dose) or TLC-2716 0.5, 2, 6 or 12 mg (eight participants per dose) orally once daily for 14 days. All doses were administered in a fed state except in an additional cohort of eight participants treated with 6 mg of TLC-2716 daily for 14 days after an overnight fast. PK analysis revealed a short half-life (mean t1/2 of 1.43–1.74 h) and time to maximal plasma concentration (mean tmax of 2.0–4.0 h) and low maximal plasma concentrations (mean Cmax of 0.95–6.37 ng ml−1) on day 14, consistent with rapid hepatic uptake of TLC-2716 (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b).

Following 14 days of treatment, TLC-2716 caused dose-dependent improvements in atherogenic plasma lipids (exploratory outcomes), including TG, RC, TC, non-HDL-C, LDL-C and the number of LDL and small LDL particles (Fig. 5a–g and Table 1). Although a trend to reduced ApoB was noted (Fig. 5h), decreasing HDL-C in the placebo and the highest dose of TLC-2716 were observed (Fig. 5i). Consistent with preclinical improvement in insulin sensitivity, TLC-2716 dose dependently reduced the TG/HDL-C ratio47 and lipoprotein insulin resistance index (Lipo-IR)48, both exploratory surrogate markers of insulin resistance (Fig. 5j,k).

The significance of comparisons between day 14 and day 1 within the same dose group was calculated by two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test and adjusted by the BH method, while the significance of relative (%) changes of each parameter following 14 days of treatment compared with placebo calculated by [(day 14 – day 1) / day 1] was calculated by two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test and adjusted by the BH method.

Source data

The 6- and 12-mg doses of TLC-2716 had the most favorable effects on plasma lipids (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Placebo-adjusted median percentage changes in TG from day 1 to day 14 were −37.6% (95% confidence interval (95% CI), −54.0 to −19.9) with 6 mg and −38.5% (95% CI, −67.9 to −7.2) with 12 mg (Fig. 5a and Table 1). Likewise, placebo-adjusted reductions in RC in the 6- and 12-mg groups were −33.5% (95% CI, −50.3 to −16.9) and −29.5% (95% CI, −59.1 to 2.6), respectively, when measured predose (Fig. 5b and Table 1) and −59.2% (95% CI, −90.2 to −7.1) and −61.0% (95% CI, −100 to −11.7), respectively, when measured postprandially 12 h postdose (Table 1). Finally, placebo-adjusted reductions in total LDL particles were robustly decreased: −20.3% (95% CI, −45.9 to −3.4) with the 6-mg dose and −36.5% (95% CI, −67.8 to −19.8) with the 12-mg dose (Fig. 5f and Table 1). Corresponding placebo-adjusted reductions in the number of small LDL particles were −52.2% (−100.1 to 9.8) and −60.8% (−121.4 to 0.1), respectively (Fig. 5g and Table 1). In exploratory analyses, reductions in TG, RC and LDL-C in participants treated with 6 or 12 mg of TLC-2716 were greatest in participants with higher baseline values of these parameters (Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). For example, in participants with baseline TG of ≥100 mg dl−1, the placebo-adjusted reductions in TG from day 1 to day 14 were −45.2% (95% CI, −61.3 to −27.9) with 6 mg and −60.8% (95% CI, −70.4 to −37.9) with 12 mg.

In addition, both the 6- and 12-mg doses of TLC-2716 led to reductions in plasma levels of the LXR-related proteins ApoC3 and ANGPTL3 between days 1 and 14 (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), suggesting that the benefits of TLC-2716 are driven, at least in part, by the repression of LXR target genes, upregulation of LPL and increased clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins. Effects on RCT were assessed by measuring ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells on day 14, at predose (plasma TLC-2716 levels are undetectable) and 4 h postdose (approximate tmax of TLC-2716). TLC-2716 did not reduce the expression of either of these genes (Extended Data Fig. 8h), likely due to transient and low systemic exposure of the compound attributable to active hepatic uptake.

TLC-2716 was well tolerated in this phase 1 study19,29. No clinically notable changes in vital signs or safety laboratory and electrocardiogram parameters, deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuations of study medication were reported. All treatment-emergent AEs in the TLC-2716 cohorts were mild (grade 1), except for a single moderate (grade 2) AE of thrombophlebitis in the 2-mg MAD group, which was considered unrelated to treatment. The most common AEs (reported in at least three participants overall) were mild diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, back pain and pruritus (Extended Data Fig. 9). In general, the incidences of these AEs were similar between participants treated with placebo and TLC-2716 and were not dose dependent.

First-generation LXR inverse agonists have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia and MASLD19,28. TLC-2716, developed based on this generation of LXR inverse agonists, has not been evaluated in humans, nor has any other compound of its kind19,29. Here, we demonstrated consistent metabolic benefits of an oral, gut- and liver-restricted LXR inverse agonist, TLC-2716, in rodent, NHP and HLO models and, ultimately, in healthy human participants, supporting the potential of this approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.

As previously described32, genetic variants within NR1H3 are associated with lipid metabolism in human datasets, whereas such associations were not found for NR1H2. Similarly, hepatic expression of NR1H3 appears to play a more prominent role in regulating lipid metabolism, likely due to its greater hepatic expression than NR1H2 (ref. 36). These observations may partially explain why Nr1h2-knockout mice exhibit lower plasma TG reductions in atherosclerosis models than Nr1h3-knockout mice49, further indicating the impact of LXR activity on the regulation of DNL and lipid metabolism12,50. Here, we used two LXR inverse agonists, TLC-2716 and an analog TLC-6665 (ref. 41), which potently suppress both LXRα and LXRβ. Both compounds reduced serum TG while improving cholesterol metabolism by three primary mechanisms: (1) repression of hepatic ANGPTL3 and APOC3 expression, causing increased LPL activity and clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins; (2) repression of hepatic SREBP1C, mediating reduced DNL and VLDL synthesis and release by the liver; and (3) reduced fatty acid absorption and chylomicron assembly in the intestine.

Homeostasis of LXR activity plays an important role in maintaining global metabolic health. On the one hand, the LXR pathway is upregulated in metabolic diseases, including hypertriglyceridemia and MASLD (Fig. 1d), wherein exaggerated DNL leads to hepatic steatosis, lipotoxicity, inflammation and progressive fibrosis51. On the other hand, Nr1h3-knockout mice fed a high-cholesterol and/or HFD develop a MASH-like phenotype32,52,53. In two recent studies, knock-in mice carrying dominant-negative Nr1h3 mutations (W441F and W441R) exhibited more severe liver injury than Nr1h3-knockout mice following a MASH-inducing diet32,52. Overall, the exacerbation of liver damage caused by Nr1h3 loss-of-function/knockout or dominant-negative Nr1h3 mutations in MASH may be due to severely perturbed LXR activity in these settings. By contrast, LXR inverse agonists, which reduce the basal activity of this constitutively active receptor (favoring interaction with the co-repressor NCOR1), have demonstrated potential in reducing plasma lipids25 and hepatic fibrosis28. Here, two LXR inverse agonists reduced plasma TG and TC, without inducing a MASH-related phenotype in rodents or NHPs. In a MASH rat model, 6 weeks of LXR inverse agonist treatment reduced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis (Extended Data Fig. 5b–e), and, importantly, liver biochemistry remained stable with both short-term (2–3 weeks) and long-term (26 weeks) treatment (Extended Data Figs. 3d,e and 7e,f). RNA-sequencing analysis of sHLOs further confirmed that TLC-2716 does not elevate the expression of proinflammatory or profibrotic gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 10). Indeed, consistent with alleviation of the MASH phenotype, the expression of fibrosis-related genes was downregulated following TLC-2716 treatment of sHLOs harboring a risk variant (GCKRTT) associated with enhanced lipogenesis (Fig. 3f). Together, our data provide evidence that LXR inverse agonists restore basal LXR homeostasis in dysmetabolic models, leading to improved lipid metabolism and hepato-protection.

Dyslipidemia commonly accompanies insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and ectopic lipid accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle contributes causally to the development of insulin resistance54. Hence, we hypothesized that LXR inverse agonism may improve insulin sensitivity by reducing dyslipidemia. Indeed, TLC-2716 improved fasting glycemia in ZDF rats (Extended Data Fig. 5j), and TLC-6665 had comparable effects on insulin sensitivity to the approved PPARγ agonist pioglitazone55 in DIO mice (Extended Data Fig. 5g). These insulin-sensitizing effects of LXR repression may offer additional cardioprotective benefit to that attributable to improvements in circulating lipids56. Despite comparable therapeutic effects, TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 exhibit distinct PK profiles, with TLC-2716 showing restricted distribution to both the intestine and liver due to active uptake by hepatic transporters. The limited systemic activity of TLC-2716 likely minimizes the risk of disrupting RCT (as demonstrated by unchanged expression of relevant genes in rodents and humans) and potential proatherogenic effects that have been linked to systemic LXR repression21. These data provide a rationale for the evaluation of TLC-2716 to treat individuals with severe dyslipidemia and suggest that TLC-2716 may reduce residual cardiovascular risk due to benefits on both lipid and glucose metabolism.

TLC-2716 was demonstrated to be safe in preclinical toxicology studies. In addition, all doses of TLC-2716 were safe and well tolerated in this phase 1 trial involving 100 healthy volunteers. TLC-2716 treatment for 14 days led to dose-dependent improvements in plasma TG and RC and other atherogenic lipids, including non-HDL-C and both total and small LDL particle number (Fig. 5). Although these data must be interpreted cautiously due to our evaluation of healthy volunteers and multiple exploratory endpoints, we observed greater benefits of TLC-2716 in individuals with higher baseline lipids, potentially due to LXR upregulation in these individuals. For example, in individuals with baseline TG of ≥100 mg dl−1 or RC of ≥20 mg dl−1 (roughly one-half of included participants), TLC-2716 at 12 mg led to placebo-adjusted reductions in TG and RC of >60% after only 14 days of dosing. These improvements are within the range of other therapies that target TG-rich lipoproteins, including injectable inhibitors of ApoC3 (refs. 57,58), ANGPTL3 (ref. 59) and ANGPTL4 (ref. 60), and support the potential of TLC-2716 to provide meaningful clinical benefit in individuals at risk for ASCVD. Inhibitors of ApoC3 and ANGPTL3 increase LDL-C concentrations, likely due to LPL-mediated conversion of TG-rich lipoproteins into LDL particles61. By contrast, the repression of LXR activity with TLC-2716 led to dose-dependent reductions in plasma LDL particles. This distinction, which is likely relevant from an ASCVD risk perspective, presumably reflects the pleiotropic mechanisms of LXR repression, including reductions in both ANGPTL3 and ApoC3 (as demonstrated in this study), decreased hepatic synthesis of TG-rich lipoproteins and reduced intestinal lipid absorption. Overall, the oral administration of TLC-2716 may offer a compelling advantage over these alternative therapies due to patient convenience, reduced cost and the potential to combine with other lipid-lowering therapies in fixed-dose oral combinations.

Several additional findings of this phase 1 study warrant discussion. First, TLC-2716 caused dose-dependent reductions in the TG/HDL-C ratio and Lipo-IR index, both surrogate markers of insulin resistance, suggesting that TLC-2716 may improve insulin sensitivity, as observed in preclinical studies. However, because our study population comprised insulin-sensitive healthy volunteers, the potential benefits of TLC-2716 should be confirmed in insulin-resistant individuals with dyslipidemia. Similarly, because baseline lipids were relatively normal in these healthy volunteers and lipid-lowering therapies were contraindicated in this study, the benefits of TLC-2716 when added to background therapies for hypertriglyceridemia (for example, fibrates and statins) in individuals with disease require confirmation. Ultimately, these questions will be answered in upcoming phase 2 studies, including an ongoing phase 2a study of TLC-2716 in individuals with overweight/obesity with moderate-to-severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 350 mg dl−1) and MASLD (NCT06564584).

In conclusion, this randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 study has demonstrated that TLC-2716 (a liver- and gut-restricted oral LXR inverse agonist) is safe and well tolerated and produces substantial improvements in plasma lipid metabolism. These clinical results are consistent with findings from genetic analysis and preclinical studies, reinforcing both safety and therapeutic promise of LXR repression in improving circulating lipids and addressing hepatic consequences of metabolic dysfunction.

Biochemical binding of TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 to LXRα or LXRβ was determined by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biochemical assays evaluating the concentration-dependent displacement of a N-terminally biotinylated coactivator NCOA3 to recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged LXRα or LXRβ ligand-binding domain (LBD). Briefly, different concentrations of TLC-2716 or TLC-6665 were incubated with an assay buffer (Tris/HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 240 mM KCl, 1 µg µl−1 bovine serum albumin and 0.002% Triton X-100) containing 530 µg ml−1 recombinant GST-tagged LXRα/LXRβ LBD, 125 pg µl−1 GST-Tb cryptate (CisBio), 400 nM N-terminally biotinylated NCOA3 (coactivator) peptide, 1 μM 24(S)-25-epoxycholesterol (LXR agonist, only in the NCOA3 assay) and 2.5 ng µl−1 Streptavidin-XL665 (CisBio) for 1 h at 4 °C, following which fluorescence was measured in a VictorX4 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Science) using 340 nm as excitation and 615 and 665 nm as emission wavelengths. Assays were performed in triplicate.

LXRα and LXRβ activity status was determined via detection of interaction with coactivator and co-repressor proteins in mammalian two-hybrid experiments. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with full length proteins of LXRα or LXRβ and their respective LBD domains under the pCMV-AD promoter(Stratagene). The cofactors, either the coactivator SRC1 or the co-repressor NCoR, were expressed as fusions to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4. Interaction was monitored via activation of a coexpressed Firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of a promoter containing repetitive GAL4 response elements (vector pFRLuc, Stratagene). Four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with a concentration range of TLC-2716 and TLC-6665 for 16 h, after which they were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured sequentially in the same cell extract using a BMG luminometer.

HT-29 or HepG2 cells were stably transfected with pGL4 luciferase reporter plasmid containing the ABCA1 or SREBP1C, respectively, promoter region upstream of the Firefly luciferase reporter gene and incubated with a concentration range of TLC-2716 or TLC-6665 for 16 h as described above.

Human primary Upcyte hepatocytes were cultivated in medium containing high concentrations of glucose (25 mM) and palmitate (100 nM) for 5 days in the presence or absence of TLC-2716, and intracellular lipids were measured by Bodipy staining.

The in vivo studies were performed at Synovo in accordance with their bioethical guidelines, which are fully compliant with ethical regulations and internationally accepted principles for the care and use of laboratory animals. Animal housing facilities were maintained at 20–22 °C with 30–50% humidity. Mice were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.

Eighteen-week-old male C57BL/6 DIO mice (14 weeks on HFD, Research Diets), purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, were dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (0.3 or 1 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for 3 weeks.

Six- to 7-week-old male obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats (ZUCKER-Leprfa, Charles River Laboratories) were fed a HFD for a total of 5 weeks and dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (0.1 or 1 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for the last 2 weeks. In a second study, 6- to 7-week-old male ZDF rats (ZDF-Leprfa/Crl) were prefed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 2 weeks and dosed with vehicle or TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for 4 weeks.

Six- to 7-week-old male SD rats (Charles River Laboratories) were fed a HFD for a total of 5 weeks and dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (0.1 or 1 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for the last 3 weeks.

Six- to 8-week-old male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) were fed an L-amino acid rodent diet with 60 kcal% fat with no added choline and 0.1% methionine (Research Diets, A06071302) for a total of 12 weeks. After 4 weeks of diet feeding, animals started receiving sodium nitrite injections (25 mg per kg (body weight) intraperitonially) three times a week for the remainder of the study. After 6 weeks of choline-deficient HFD feeding, animals were dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for the last 6 weeks.

Human liver chimeric PXB mice were purchased from PheonexBio, and in-life procedures were performed at InterVivo Solution in accordance with their bioethical guidelines, which are fully compliant with ethical regulations and internationally accepted principles for the care and use of laboratory animals. Briefly, animals were assigned to two groups (n = 5 male mice per group), vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% Kollidon-30 in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer) or TLC-2716 (1 mg per kg (body weight) daily by oral gavage) for 8 days, after which animals were humanely killed by cardiac puncture, and plasma and tissues were collected for lipid and gene expression endpoints as described below.

Liver tissue was dipped into ice-cold PBS for 1 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight for a maximum of 16 h. Afterward, samples were transferred to cold 70% ethanol/PBS to avoid prolonged fixation and embedded in paraffin before sectioning. Sections were stained with picrosirius red to visualize collagen.

Plasma samples were analyzed for levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglycerides using respons 910 (Diasys Diagnostics Systems), as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Collected frozen liver samples were ground to a fine powder with a pestle and mortar under liquid nitrogen. An aliquot was subjected to lipid isolation using organic solvents (hexane and isopropanol), and, after extraction, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were quantified using commercially available kits (FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals Europe). An additional aliquot was used for collagen determination after acid hydrolysis (Total Collagen Assay, Quickzyme Biosciences).

The study was performed at Physiogenex S.A.S. in accordance with ethical regulations, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (revised 1996 and 2011, 2010/63/EU) and French laws.

Twenty-four-week-old DIO mice (Jackson Laboratories) were fed a HFD (Research Diets, D12492) for 18 weeks and dosed with vehicle (5% DMSO and 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in phosphate-buffered saline), TLC-6665 (5 mg per kg (body weight)) or pioglitazone (30 mg per kg (body weight)) once daily by oral gavage for 4 weeks. Animals were subjected to a two-stage hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp procedure after a 6-h fast and 2 h after the last dose. Briefly, animals received a bolus of D-[3-3H]glucose (30 μCi per mouse) followed by D-[3-3H]glucose (30 μCi min−1 kg−1) infusion (2 μl min−1) for up to 210 min. Insulin was simultaneously infused at 8 mU kg−1 min−1 for the first 100 min and at 18 mU kg−1 min−1 for the last 110 min. Blood glucose was measured from the tip of the tail every 10 min by a glucometer. The glucose infusion rate was adjusted according to blood glucose levels until a first euglycemic steady state was reached (from ~70 to 100 min of infusion) and similarly adjusted until a second euglycemic steady-state was reached (from ~150 to 210 min of infusion). During both steady states, blood (5 μl) was collected frequently from the tail tip for 3H-radioactivity measurements and calculations of glucose flux.

A 26-week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study was conducted at Inotiv according to the protocol, Inotiv's Standard Operating Procedures and in compliance with the current US Food and Drug Administration GLP Regulations for Non-Clinical Studies (21 CFR Part 58). Animal housing facilities were maintained at 20–26 °C with 30–70% humidity. Mice were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Briefly, the safety profile of TLC-2716 was evaluated in CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) administered orally once daily at 0 (vehicle: 100 mM sodium phosphate puffer, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; pH 7.4) and 3% DMSO), 15, 60 and 120 mg per kg (body weight) per day for 26 weeks. This terminal study included comprehensive assessments of toxicokinetics and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis). Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs, with regular measurements of body weight, food consumption and vital signs. Necropsy and detailed tissue analysis were performed at study termination.

A 4-week GLP toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (Guangzhou Xiangguan Biotech) to evaluate the safety profile of TLC-2716 administered orally once daily at 1, 5 and 15 mg per kg (body weight) per day. This terminal study included comprehensive assessments of toxicokinetics and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis). Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs, with regular measurements of body weight, food consumption and vital signs. Necropsy and detailed tissue analysis were performed at study termination. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.

Target organs (liver and intestine) were subjected to gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR). Aliquots of liver and ileum were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently homogenized with a pestle and mortar under liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of the homogenized tissues were processed for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Aliquots from the reverse-transcribed samples were used for the detection of specific mRNA transcripts of different genes of interest by RT–qPCR using commercially available mouse cDNA sequence-specific PCR primers and Taqman probes. Resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values were normalized to the housekeeping gene Tbp measured in the same sample. Results are plotted as fold change compared with vehicle controls. All primers or product codes for RT–qPCR are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

HLOs were generated as previously described63. Briefly, human iPS cells were differentiated into foregut progenitor cells using a published protocol44. To initiate organoid formation, foregut cells were resuspended in Matrigel at a final concentration of 750,000 cells per ml. Fifty-microliter droplets of the cell–Matrigel mixture were plated and cultured in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with B27, N2, 10 mM HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 5 ng ml−1 FGF2, 10 ng ml−1 VEGF, 20 ng ml−1 EGF, 3 μM CHIR99021, 0.5 μM A83-01 and 50 µg ml−1 ascorbic acid for 4 days. The medium was then replaced with the same basal formulation containing 2 μM retinoic acid and cultured for an additional 4 days. Finally, the organoids were maintained in hepatocyte culture medium (Lonza) for 6 days to promote hepatic maturation. To induce a steatohepatitis-like phenotype, HLOs were gently retrieved from the Matrigel and washed with PBS. HLOs were then exposed to 300 μM sodium oleate (Sigma) in hepatocyte culture medium for 3 days using ultra-low attachment six-well plates (Corning). For quantification of intracellular lipid accumulation, sHLOs were rinsed three times with prewarmed PBS and stained with 2 μM BODIPY 493/503 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for neutral lipid detection, along with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for nuclear counterstaining. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X710 automated fluorescence microscope. Lipid droplet volume was quantified using the Hybrid Cell Count application (Keyence) and normalized to nuclear signal intensity. For RNA sequencing, total RNA was extracted from iPS cell-derived HLOs using an RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality were assessed using a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and only samples with an RNA Quality Number of ≥8.0 were used for library preparation.

Genotypes of GCKR variants were determined using an Illumina Infinium Global Diversity Array with the Enhanced PGx platform (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was extracted from undifferentiated iPS cells using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Genotyping was performed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Genomics Sequencing Facility using standard Infinium HTS assay protocols. Quality control steps included removal of samples with a call rate of <98%, excess heterozygosity or sex mismatch. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a call rate of <95%, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P of <1 × 10−6 or minor allele frequency of <1% were excluded from downstream analysis. Genomic positions were mapped to the GRCh38 (hg38) human reference genome.

We analyzed metabolic-related phenotypic traits from the UKBB30,31 under Application Number 48020 by focusing on participants of European ancestry only (based on the UKBB return dataset 2442). A GWAS was performed using REGENIE. Step 1 involved the estimation of population structure using genotyping arrays (UKBB field 22418). Step 2 calculated genetic variant–phenotype associations based on the WES data (UKBB field 23159) using the following covariates: the first ten genetic PCs, age, sex and age–sex interaction. Gene-based testing (burden test) was performed using REGENIE step 2 by collapsing single-variant test statistics into gene-level results. Variants were grouped into functional sets defined by mask objects, where each mask represents a labeled variant category that combines different types of annotations.

Summary statistics from the FinnGen33 study were downloaded from https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results, and those for the Million Veteran Program34 database were accessed through dbGaP under accession number phs002453.v1.p1 through the AgingX project (ID 10143). The significant (P < 5 × 10−8) associated phenotypic traits of genetic variants within candidate genes in each human population were further extracted. Fine-mapping results were downloaded from https://www.finucanelab.org/data (ref. 64).

Significant cis-eQTLs of LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) in liver or blood were obtained from the GTEx (version 8, 208 individuals)36 or eQTLGen (31,684 individuals)65. Linkage disequilibrium clumping for SNPs was estimated using Plink (genetics.binaRies R package, window size 1 Mb, minor allele frequency ≥ 1%) on the 1000 Genomes reference panel66. Only one independent SNP was found within NR1H3 using the GTEx liver cis-eQTLs, whereas eight independent SNPs were identified using the eQTLGen blood cis-eQTLs, suggesting that the eQTLGen blood cis-eQTLs are more reliable for Mendelian randomization analysis. Therefore, significant cis-eQTLs of LXR in blood extracted from eQTLGen were applied as exposures in the Mendelian randomization analysis. GWAS summary statistics for plasma lipid-related traits were derived from WES data in the UKBB and served as outcomes. The causal effects of NR1H3 and NR1H2 gene expression on lipid traits were estimated by Inverse Variance Weighted approach using the TwoSampleMR67,68,69,70 R package (v0.6.2).

Liver gene expression datasets were obtained from GTEx36 and the Human Liver Cohort37. Correlation coefficients between each gene and LXRα (NR1H3) or LXRβ (NR1H2) were calculated by Pearson correlation. Genes were ranked by correlation coefficient, and gene sets were extracted using the msigdbr R package (version 7.5.1)71. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (4.12.6)72.

RNA was sequenced by BGI with the DNBSEQ platform. The quality of the reads was then verified using FastQC (version 0.11.9). Low-quality reads were removed, and no trimming was needed. Alignment was performed against the human genome (GRCh38, v113) following the STAR (version 2.73a) manual guidelines73. Normalized effective library sizes were calculated by trimmed mean of M values. The voom function of the Limma R package (version 3.60.0)74 was applied to transform gene counts for linear modeling with precision weights. The differential expression analysis for the transcriptome was performed using the R package Limma (version 3.60.0)74. Genes were ranked by log2 (fold change), and gene sets were extracted using the msigdbr R package (version 7.5.1)71. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (version 4.12.6)72.

The study protocol was approved by the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee (2022 FULL 12858). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration: NCT05483998) and was conducted at a single site in New Zealand (Auckland Clinical Research) from 27 July 2022 to 18 June 2023, in accordance with relevant local regulatory policies. Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment.

The randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 study included SAD and MAD cohorts. In the SAD cohorts, healthy participants were treated with single oral doses of TLC-2716 (0.5, 2, 6, 12 and 20 mg) or placebo, and in the MAD cohorts, participants received once-daily oral doses of TLC-2716 (0.5, 2, 6 and 12 mg) or placebo for 14 days. For each cohort, eight participants were randomized to receive TLC-2716, and two participants were randomized to receive placebo; study medications were administered in a fed state within 5 min of completing a standardized breakfast. In an additional MAD cohort, eight participants received TLC-2716 (6 mg) after an overnight fast to evaluate the effects of fasted versus fed dosing on the PKs of TLC-2716. Participants were confined in the study center until 72 h following the last dose of study drug, and all participants returned to the study center 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up visit. To maximize participant safety in SAD cohorts, safety and tolerability of the study drug through day 2 were assessed in two sentinel participants (one randomized to TLC-2716 and one randomized to placebo) per cohort before dosing of the remaining participants in each cohort. In addition, TLC-2716 dose escalation was preceded by a review of safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data by a safety review committee consisting of the principal investigator and sponsor representatives.

In brief, eligible study participants were healthy, nonsmoking men and women between 18 and 55 years of age and with a BMI from 19 to 35 kg m−2, inclusive at screening. All participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥80 ml min−1, normal liver biochemistry (total bilirubin 1.0- to 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal was permitted in participants with Gilbert's syndrome) and 12-lead electrocardiograms and screening laboratory evaluations (for example, hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) that were normal or considered to have no clinical importance by the investigator. In the MAD cohorts, an attempt was made to enroll participants with TG of ≥150 mg dl−1 and/or LDL-C of ≥130 mg dl−1 to enable preliminary assessment of the lipid-lowering benefits of TLC-2716. Key exclusion criteria included women who were pregnant or lactating, TG of ≥500 mg dl−1, LDL-C of ≥190 mg dl−1, the presence of serious active medical or psychiatric illness, excessive alcohol consumption (defined as greater than 21 units per week for men and 14 units per week for women), substance abuse or recent receipt of an investigational compound. Participants who had taken any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including herbal products, within 28 days before the start of study drug dosing, except vitamins, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and/or hormonal contraceptives, were excluded. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is available from the authors.

Safety and tolerability assessments, including AE monitoring, laboratory tests, physical examinations and electrocardiogram evaluations, were performed throughout the study. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grading Scale v5.0. Intensive PK sampling over 72 h after dosing on day 1 (in SAD and MAD cohorts) and day 14 (in MAD cohorts) was conducted, and TLC-2716 plasma concentrations were determined using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay. PK parameters were estimated via noncompartmental methods using Pheonix WinNonlin 6.2.1 and 8.3.4 (Certara).

Plasma lipid parameters, including ApoB, were evaluated by NMR LipoProfile (Labcorp). RC was calculated as the difference between TC and the sum of direct LDL-C and HDL-C. Unless indicated, lipid parameters were measured before dosing following an overnight fast. Plasma ApoC3 and ANGPTL3 were evaluated by ELISA (360biolabs), and the impact of TLC-2716 on peripheral RCT was evaluated by assessing changes in the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, before dosing and 4 h after dosing on day 14 (Gnomix).

Due to its exploratory nature, no formal power or sample size calculations were used to determine the sample size for this study. Empirically, the sample size was selected to adequately characterize the safety, PKs and pharmacodynamics of TLC-2716. Given the skewed distribution of plasma lipid data, we applied the Hodges–Lehmann estimator in deriving placebo-adjusted percentage change from baseline values in lipid parameters. This method estimates the median (and 95% confidence interval) of all possible pairwise differences between treatment groups and addresses the potential impact of skewed data or outliers. For analyses of changes from baseline, two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for comparisons within groups) and two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests (for comparisons between groups) were used, which were adjusted using the BH adjustment method. In this clinical trial study, sex is self-reported. Due to the small sample size of each group, sex is not considered in the analysis.

You know what's great about a show like Pluribus? It's that we don't really know what's going on, so we get to speculate. Just like real life! In case you haven't seen this show, which just finished its first season, here's a quick recap:

A radio transmission arrives from a planet 600 light years away, and the message turns out to be RNA code for an alien virus. Some fool synthesizes it, and it infects almost everyone on Earth, causing them to act as one entity—a hive mind with common goals, values, knowledge, everything. The show's title comes from the old US motto “E pluribus unum”—out of many, one.

Only 13 people remain immune, including Carol Sturka, an ornery romance novelist who's intent on keeping her individuality, against all efforts by the collective to absorb her. We don't know for sure how the hive mind works, but it seems that the plurbs (the infected people) commune with each other unconsciously through radio waves. Talk to one of them and you talk to all of them.

It has advantages. For instance, there's no need to remember phone numbers. You can call any number and the same “person” answers. The downside is that they're not really a person.

Anyway, if the radio theory is correct, how might this collective consciousness operate from a physics standpoint? Let's investigate!

In case you forgot (or never knew), we used to listen to music on devices called radios. There were two types of stations: AM radio with broadcast frequencies from 535 to 1,700 kilohertz (kHZ) and FM radio from 88 to 108 megahertz (MHz).

Now, radio waves are electromagnetic (EM) waves. That means they consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. In other words, they're a type of light, along with visible light, infrared, microwaves, x-rays, and so on, which differ only in frequency and wavelength. Radio waves are on one end of the EM spectrum, with the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths. That makes them ideal for long-range communication.

Fine. But how do you make a radio wave? Since EM waves use changing electric fields, you can induce a wave by accelerating an electric charge. The radio station that you no longer listen to has a very large electric wire called an antenna. Electric current goes up and down the wire accelerating electrons. There's your radio wave.

But can a human body do this? Well … maybe? Our nervous systems are essentially electric circuits, though the “current” consists of charged ions, not electrons. Maybe the alien civilization figured out how to harness this.

So if we're right, each former human is now essentially a radio transmitter and receiver. One plurb sends out a signal that is detected by others, who pass it on to others, etc. It sounds like some kind of decentralized mesh network. But how far can one plurb transmit?

First, let's estimate the total power output of the transmission—the amount of energy radiated per second. A person's metabolic system produces about 80 watts of power at rest, and this is used for basic functions like breathing, pumping blood, digesting food, and so on. For a plurb, let's say 10 percent of it goes into radio transmission, so that's 8 watts.

Let's also assume that plurbs are “isotropic” transmitters, meaning they emit energy in all directions equally, like in the old RKO Radio Pictures logo. As it radiates outward, that power is spread over an expanding sphere. Total power remains the same as at the source (P0), but the power per area, which we call intensity (I), declines. That means the power of a signal declines with distance (r). Knowing the surface area of a sphere, we can easily calculate intensity:

Finally, we need a minimum detection level. What's the weakest signal that a plurb can receive? I'm just going to grab a value out of the air and say they can detect radio at an intensity of 1 microwatt per square meter.

So now, putting these two things together, we can solve for the maximum communication range, which is 798 meters (about half a mile). Oh sure, maybe they can detect much lower intensities, but we'd still be looking at a distance of less than 20 miles or so. Astronauts in orbit would be totally at loose ends. Even camping trips could be dicey.

So if everyone around you is basically a radio tower, would you hear their communications? No, because we don't hear radio waves. Remember, radio emissions are a type of light. But around 1900, humans invented radio receivers that turn radio waves into electric pulses, which then jiggle a magnetic speaker back and forth, creating ripples of air pressure. Those are sound waves.

At one point, another uninfected human scanning through the dial on a shortwave radio notices some activity on a particular frequency: 8,613 kHz. All others are silent. Could this be the channel for plurb-to-plurb communication? If we converted the radio waves to sound waves would we hear something?

Unfortunately no. Humans can only detect sounds from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and this channel is way beyond that range. But wait! Then how do real-world radio stations send music to radios at even higher frequencies? I'm glad you asked, because this is pretty cool.

There are two basic tricks—our old AM and FM. AM stands for amplitude modulation. Amplitude is the height, or intensity, of a wave at its peak (or the depth at its trough). The idea is that you have some carrier wave frequency, which is what people turn their radio dial to. For example, the legendary Chicago station WLS, which brought rock 'n roll to Middle America in the early '60s, was at 890 on the AM dial, so its carrier frequency was 890 kHz.

Then what you do is modulate the amplitude of that carrier wave, so that the changes in amplitude actually encode the audio signal. For a single tone, it might look something like this, where the blue squiggly line is the high-frequency carrier wave, and the red wave is the lower-frequency audio signal as decoded by your radio.

For FM radio, it's not the amplitude of the carrier wave that changes but the frequency. It doesn't look as cool, but here is a plot of a blue carrier wave with the resulting red audio signal.

Those are two of the ways that audio signals are carried over radio waves. But it doesn't seem like these methods would work to connect the hive mind of plurbs, as they aren't speaking through sound but rather something like a mesh Wi-Fi network. But wait! There's another way to send data via radio waves: by using digital values.

Imagine that your radio signal changes from a value of 0 to 1 and back over a very short time interval. Basically you're repeatedly turning the power on and off. You can turn this into a binary number where an amplitude of 1 is the binary value 1 and 0 is of course zero. These binary numbers can then be turned into any kind of data. I guess you could even share thoughts and feelings with the rest of the hive. Here's what it would look like:

Now for the cool part. If the rate at which the values switch between 0 and 1 is less than 15 kHz, a normal human could  hear this as some type of audio signal. So maybe the Plurbs are digital.

I have no idea where the show is going in season 2, but if Carol is looking for a way to de-plurb a human, like her “chaperone,” Zosia, I'd recommend a Faraday cage. What's that, you ask? A Faraday cage is a metal container that prevents the detection of electromagnetic signals.

There are a few things to know. First, people say these containers block EM waves, but they don't. What they do is produce another electromagnetic wave that cancels the first one. Recall that metals are electric conductors. That's because they have electrons that aren't bound to particular atoms and can move around freely.

When an EM wave encounters a metal, the electric part of the wave exerts a force on these electrons and causes them to accelerate. Oh hey! Remember, we said accelerating charges create EM waves? It turns out these induced EM waves have amplitudes that are opposite to the incident waves, so they mostly offset. It's kind of the same idea as noise-canceling headphones.

Would it be hard to build Faraday cages to shut down the hive mind? Not at all. Even simple chicken wire would work. It turns out that a Faraday cage with holes works just fine, so long as the holes are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave. Well, like we said, radio waves are long. An 8.6-MHz signal would have a wavelength of 35 meters, so this would do the trick. Yep, you heard it here first: Expect chicken wire in season 2.

That's all for now. And may we just add, we hope this article made you happy. All we want is for you to be happy …

A smart plug is a pretty handy gadget, but for a while they were touted as a device you could add to anything to turn it smart. That's true to a certain degree; you can use a smart plug to add instant power control to any outlet, letting you turn the outlet on and off at your command from anywhere in your home (or even if you aren't there). The TV can now turn off on command, the lights will automatically flip on at 5 pm, and a simple coffee maker or appliance can essentially run itself if all it needs is power.

If you're looking to control something simple that really only needs power sent to it for the full experience, then we've found some of the best smart plugs to do that for you. TP-Link's smart plugs have been my favorite for years, and the TP-Link Tapo Matter-Certified Smart Plug Mini (P125M) ($19, 3-pack) lets you skip getting an app and use Matter to directly connect it to your home hub of choice. Smart plugs are also great for outdoor use, and the Cync Outdoor Smart Plug ($19) is made for the outdoors and has two plugs built into it.

Uncertain if a smart plug can solve your dumb device problems? Read on for all of our tips on what smart plugs are really for, how to best use them, and how to tell if they're a fit for your device. While you're at it, be sure to check out our other smart-home buying guides, including Best Smart Bulbs, Best Security Cameras, Best Smart Speakers, and Best Smart Displays.

Smart plugs get plugged into an outlet socket, and then you plug your device of choice (a lamp, a coffee maker, et cetera) into the plug to allow you control over the power flow. The smart plug can connect to Wi-Fi and an app, along with your smart speaker if you have one, to let you control it with automated schedules, the dedicated app, or your voice.

Controlling the power flow to a device can let you switch on lamps around your house at a certain time or turn them off without leaving your bed. It can also let you turn on simple coffee machines or turn off the TV for you. But for many devices, sending power back to the device doesn't necessarily turn it back on.

A smart plug is a great fit for a device that has a simple on-and-off switch you can leave on, and let the smart plug take over the on-and-off part. The best example is a lamp with a manual switch, and it's my most frequent use of a smart plug around my house. I also really like outdoor-specific smart plugs for “dumb” outdoor lights and decorations (like my Santa Claus inflatable that hangs off my balcony), though I've now switched to permanent outdoor lights that have controls akin to a smart bulb.

Smart plugs also have scheduling abilities in the app, so you can set the smart plug to turn your lights on and off at certain times to appear home, or have all the lights and TV turn off automatically at 11 pm to force yourself to go to bed. (I do this, but I just tell Alexa to turn it back on. Maybe one day I'll go to bed on time.)

I've used my smart plugs with a TV to turn it off, but sending power back to it doesn't actually turn it back on, so it wasn't as useful to me at the time. Now, with a 3-year-old, that could be a handy way to claim that the TV is broken so that I don't have to watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for the umpteenth time.

Smart plugs aren't a great fit for devices that require you to push buttons or select a mode for it to work after the power is already sent to it. My electric tea kettle won't heat up until I choose how hot it should become, for example, so I can't use a smart plug to start my morning routine, as some people recommend. Many coffee machines work the same way. As mentioned above, the TV is another example that won't turn on when power is restored; I would still need to find the remote to turn it on and choose what I want to watch.

We've tested many smart plugs over the years. These are our favorites.

TP-Link

Amazon (3-Pack)

Best Buy (3-Pack)

The Tapo Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini (TP15) has everything I'm looking for in a smart plug: a small form factor that doesn't block other outlets, Matter compatibility, and easy setup. The Matter aspect means you can skip getting the TP-Link app and set it up directly with home hubs like Google, Alexa, and Apple.

Works with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Matter

Cync

Home Depot

If you need a smart plug made to withstand the elements, we like this one from Cync. I used it for controlling my outdoor Christmas decorations that aren't already smart (it's permanently attached to my inflatable Santa), while my smart string lights are plugged in next to it. It's two outlets hanging off a cord, so it's easy to plug into recessed outdoor outlets.

Works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa

Meross

Amazon (4 Pack)

Walmart (2 Pack)

If you want a smart plug you're certain will play well with Siri and Apple Home, Meross' plugs are my go-to. The MSS110 smart plug costs more than our other picks, but it's designed with Apple HomeKit in mind while also being compatible with Google and Alexa. It behaves like everything else–you're just paying extra for those HomeKit powers, and you will need an Apple HomePod, HomePod Mini, or Apple TV to act as your smart home hub.

Works with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings

TP-Link

Amazon

TP-Link's Kasa line of mini smart plugs is a favorite at WIRED. They perform the same as the larger plugs but in a compact body that's easier to stack with others. If you use just one, it won't obstruct the second outlet at all. The app is pretty simple to navigate; there are scenes, timers, and schedules you can program to your liking. WIRED editor Julian Chokkattu has also been using the larger version of these plugs, the HS103 ($14), for years on his lamps, Christmas lights, and fans with no issues. There's also the EP25 ($23) version of that offers energy monitoring.

Works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa

There are many smart plugs with similar features and designs, so choosing one might come down to price and brand preference. Here are some others we like.

Alexa Smart Plug for $25: Look, any Matter-compatible plug (like the one we recommend above) is just as easy to add to your Alexa as Amazon's own Smart Plug. But if you aren't interested in mixing ecosystems and want to guarantee you'll never, ever need another app (which Matter plugs also guarantee!), this smart plug is fine.

Cync Smart Plug for $15: We haven't tried this particular version, but we did use an older one when the brand was still C by GE, and we liked it. The new app is super simple to use and controls all your products. It works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.

Eve Energy Strip for $75: Eve's sleek black-and-silver casing will fit right in with your Apple aesthetic, and it also works with HomeKit. But it's very expensive and has only three outlets, despite its size.

Hubspace Defiant Smart Indoor Plug for $10: This is made by Home Depot's smart home ecosystem, and it works fine, besides needing a little more effort to plug something into it. It also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.

Roku Indoor Smart Plug SE for $9: Roku's smart-home ecosystem is made by Wyze, so it's the same product with some extra compatibility. Roku's version works with Roku Voice, so if you have a Roku Voice Remote you use with a Roku player (can I say Roku six more times?), you can use that to command your smart plug.

Wyze Smart Plug for $29 (2-pack): This used to be my budget pick, but now that it's $15 a plug (in a two-pack for $30 total), it's been moved down to an honorable mention. It's still a great, reliable plug that works with Amazon and Google, if you're a fan of Wyze.

Can You Control Smart Plugs Away From Home?

Yes, smart plugs connect to Wi-Fi to allow you to switch them on and off away from home, so long as they're successfully connected to Wi-Fi and a hub, if necessary.

What Should You Not Plug Into a Smart Plug?

Don't plug in anything that will still need to be turned on after power is established to the device. I also don't recommend plugging in major appliances or putting it behind something so heavy that you won't be able to reach it if you needed to reset it or wanted to remove it.

Are Smart Plugs or Smart Bulbs Better for Making a Lamp Smarter?

Personally, I prefer smart bulbs (see our guide to those here) since you'll get many more options, including control over the lamp's color and brightness, and can even sync some bulbs to music. Plugs are a better option if you have a lamp that won't work with standard light bulbs or if you just want simple on-and-off controls.

How Does WIRED Test Smart Plugs?

Smart plugs aren't a super-complicated item, but they should integrate easily and quickly with your existing smart home ecosystem. My main test is always to determine how easy a plug is to set up and use in my everyday life, so I can tell you if it would be easy to use in yours.

I test smart plugs by setting them up with both the associated app and via the smart home interoperability standard Matter, if available, to compare ease of setup. After setup is complete, I plug a lamp into the smart plug—usually a table lamp near my desk or a floor lamp in the living room. I also keep an eye out for whether it takes too much manual effort to plug something into the smart plug, if it isn't secure when plugged in, or if it blocks other outlets. Then I connect the smart plug with different voice assistants to check compatibility and response time, and use the plug in my everyday routines for about a week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","RFK Jr. Says He's Ending the War on Protein. It Doesn't Exist","https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-says-hes-ending-the-war-on-protein-it-doesnt-exist/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

In a somewhat baffling directive, US Health Secretary RFK Jr. claims he's “ending the war on protein.”

The announcement, posted to White House's X account on January 11 alongside an ominously lit photo of Kennedy, came as part of the federal government's 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which now prioritize protein “at every meal.” Some of the advice—particularly the avoidance of ultra-processed foods and added sugars—has been well received by dietary experts and health organizations like the American Heart Association. But other aspects of it represent shake-ups that defy scientific consensus. For example, the recommendation of consuming saturated fats found in full-fat milk, butter, and beef tallow contradicts previous nutritional guidance, which generally advised limiting saturated fats.

But one of the biggest takeaways from the new food guide—which will influence everything from SNAP to school lunches—is that Americans should be consuming more protein, ideally from animals.

“Today the lies stop,” Kennedy, leader of MAGA's brawnier and crunchier offshoot, the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, said in an announcement about the new guidance on January 7. “ Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.”

The thing is, there is no war on protein. If ever there was one, it was lost long ago. Americans have quite literally never been as obsessed with protein as they are today, with consumption levels in the United States reaching record highs, even as protein deficiency is nearly nonexistent.

Still, Kennedy's screed makes sense in the context of a MAGA movement that has made body image, fitness, and masculinity central tenets.

""They're trying to tie it into the war on masculinity, the war on warrior culture. All of this stuff is connected,” said Colin Davis, a personal trainer and political commentator who has been critical of MAGA's encroachment into the fitness space.

In August, Kennedy and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted videos online of themselves doing push-ups and pull-ups as part of what they called the “Pete and Bobby Fitness Challenge.” Hegseth also convened an unprecedented meeting of US generals in Quantico, Virginia, in September to accost them over the military's fitness and grooming standards. “It's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon,” Hegseth said to the hundreds of generals in attendance.

President Trump himself has connected his movement to fitness through his friendship with UFC CEO Dana White, orchestrating a number of campaign appearances at UFC events in 2024. These de facto rallies put the then-presidential candidate in close proximity to young, physically fit men who would sometimes launch into post-fight rants supporting him; Trump would go on to flip the young male vote by a nearly 30-point margin in his favor during the 2024 election. In June, the White House is hosting a UFC cage fight as part of America's 250th anniversary celebrations, Trump has said.

Some experts say Kennedy's reworking of the dietary guidelines is a continuation of that project, in particular the emphasis on animal proteins, projecting a form of idealized masculinity by playing into long-held and well-researched cultural perceptions around food and gender.

“ There's a long-standing association of men with meat, fire, cooking outdoors,” said Charlotte Biltekoff, professor of food, wine and culture at the University of California, Davis. “And women with lighter food, dieting for weight loss, vegetables, fruits and salads.”

All of this serves to put the president and his broader political movement into the proximity of a kind of aspirational masculinity that is high agency, strong, physically attractive, and neatly situated within traditional gender roles.

Though red meat and whole milk have become central to the MAGA brand, high-protein diets are hardly new. Psychologist and self-help author Jordan Peterson, once a darling in right-wing media circles, has expounded on the virtues of his all-beef “carnivore” diet, while online fitness influencer Brian Johnson, known as “The Liver King,” advocated for an all-meat diet that included the consumption of raw animal organs. (In 2022, Johnson admitted to using steroids to achieve his bulging physique). And before any of that, the low-carb/high-protein Atkins and South Beach diets achieved massive mainstream popularity.

The reality is, Americans have long been consuming more than enough protein.

“Most American men are eating twice as much [protein] as they need, even with the new guidelines,” said Samantha King, director of sociocultural studies of sport, health, and the body at Queens University, and coauthor of Protein: The Making of a Nutritional Superstar. “And women on average are also exceeding.”

Food and beverage companies are responding to this meteoric demand. Starbucks began offering a protein cold foam in September, while Khloe Kardashian has launched her own brand of protein popcorn. Meanwhile, Chipotle debuted its “high protein menu” in December that includes, among other things, a bunch of straight-up chicken in a cup.

Experts say this surge in popularity has been driven by a number of factors, including the rising popularity of weightlifting for both men and women and, most significantly, marketing from food and beverage companies designed to equate general health with higher protein consumption.

“ So [protein] is sort of this magical thing, right? You eat something with enhanced protein and you've done something,” said King about the message being sold to consumers. “You don't need to go to the gym. You don't need to eat your fruits and vegetables. Just buy that protein-fueled latte.” (It's worth noting that having too much protein in your diet does come with potential health risks.)

But if there's no war on protein, why act like there is? As is so often the case with this administration, it boils down to optics.

“They wanna seem cool and tough and aggressive,"" Davis said. ""What's cooler, tougher, and more aggressive than raw steak to these guys?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Former USDS Leaders Launch Tech Reform Project to Fix What DOGE Broke","https://www.wired.com/story/former-usds-leaders-launch-tech-reform-project-doge/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT","

The past year has been traumatic for many of the volunteer tech warriors of what was once called the United States Digital Service (USDS). The team's former coders, designers, and UX experts have watched in horror as Donald Trump rebranded the service as DOGE, effectively forced out its staff, and employed a strike force of young and reckless engineers to dismantle government agencies under the guise of eliminating fraud. But one aspect of the Trump initiative triggered envy in tech reformers: the Trump administration's fearlessness in upending generations of cruft and inertia in government services. What if government leaders actually used that decisiveness and clout in service of the people instead of following the murky agendas of Donald Trump or DOGE maestro Elon Musk?

A small though influential team is proposing to answer that exact question, working on a solution they hope to deploy during the next Democratic administration. The initiative is called Tech Viaduct, and its goal is to create a complete plan to reboot how the US delivers services to citizens. The Viaduct cadre of experienced federal tech officials is in the process of cooking up specifics on how to remake the government, aiming to produce initial recommendations by the spring. By 2029, if a Democrat wins, it hopes to have its plan adopted by the White House.

Tech Viaduct's advisory panel includes former Obama chief of staff and Biden's secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough; Biden's deputy CTO Alexander Macgillivray; Marina Nitze, former CTO of the VA; and Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. But most attention-grabbing is its senior adviser and spiritual leader, Mikey Dickerson, the crusty former Google engineer who was the first leader of USDS. His hands-on ethic and unfiltered distaste for bureaucracy embodied the spirit of Obama's tech surge. No one is more familiar with how government tech services fail American citizens than Dickerson. And no one is more disgusted with the various ways they have fallen short.

Dickerson himself unwittingly put the Viaduct project in motion last April. He was packing up the contents of his DC-area condo to move as far away as possible from the political scrum (to an abandoned sky observatory in a remote corner of Arizona) when McDonough suggested he meet with Mook. When the two got together, they bemoaned the DOGE initiative but agreed that the impulse to shred the dysfunctional system and start over was a good one. “The basic idea is that it's too hard to get things done,” says Dickerson. “They're not wrong about that.” He admits that Democrats had blown a big opportunity “For 10 years we've had tiny wins here and there but never terraformed the whole ecosystem,” Dickerson says. “What would that look like?”

Dickerson was surprised a few months later when Mook called him to say he found funding from Searchlight Institute, a liberal think tank devoted to novel policy initiatives, to get the idea off the ground. (A Searchlight spokesperson says that the think tank is budgeting $1 million for the project.) Dickerson, like Al Pacino in Godfather III, was pulled back in. Ironically, it was Trump's reckless-abandon approach to government that convinced him that change was possible. “When I was there, we were severely outgunned, 200 people running around trying to improve websites,” he says. “Trump has knocked over all the beehives—the beltway bandits, the contractor industrial complex, the union industrial complex.”

Tech Viaduct has two aims. The first is to produce a master plan to remake government services—establishing an unbiased procurement process, creating a merit-based hiring process, and assuring oversight to make sure things don't go awry. (Welcome back, inspector generals!) The idea is to design signature-ready executive orders and legislative drafts that will guide the recruiting strategy for a revitalized civil service. In the next few months, the group plans to devise and test a framework that could be executed immediately in 2029, without any momentum-killing consensus building. In Viaduct's vision that consensus will be achieved before the election. “Thinking up bright ideas is going to be the easy part,“ Dickerson says. “As hard as we're going to work in the next three to six months, we're going to have to spend another two to three years, through a primary season and through an election, advocating as if we were a lobbying group.”

The group's second aim is to roll back what it regards as the damage of the Trump administration. “There needs to be a task force to triage and figure out what has been done” by DOGE, Dickerson says. One challenge will be reversing the de-siloing of personal information that violated previous privacy standards. It's a lot easier to blow up a silo than to replace spilled grain. “That was DOGE's whole schtick from the very beginning. That's going to take years to figure out,” says Dickerson.

Writing a plan to roll back DOGE is tricky, because there are three years left for the current White House to muck things up—or perhaps course-correct to mitigate some of the missteps made in 2025. For instance, after trashing the existing USDS, the administration recently revived the initiative's idealistic original premise of recruiting Silicon Valley talent to revamp government operations, branding this new initiative as the US Tech Force “It's all copy-pasted from 2014—it's the same exact thing,” says Dickerson. “How dumb and unnecessary it was to fire everybody and then run a new flag up the pole and say, ‘Hey, everybody, come get hired.'”

Obviously, the diciest part of the project is its dependence on the election of a democrat to the presidency in 2028. (Dickerson says that it's also possible that the plan could be executed by “a McCain Republican,” but that animal appears to be extinct.)

Even if an amenable democrat does take the White House, Viaduct's work will be squandered if the new president doesn't go all in on the plan. “Getting the buy-in is the key to a successful plan,” says Jenny Wang, a former official under both Obama and Biden, who is now Tech Viaduct's project manager. “If there's no support, it doesn't matter.” Republicans are usually willing to walk through coals to achieve their aims, while Democrats tiptoe over eggshells. “Surrendering to a status quo that is not working right is a natural reaction, but it would be terrible for leadership to do that,” says one longtime government reformer familiar with the Viaduct plan.

Dickerson acknowledges Viaduct's effort might well be for naught. “I am not sure at all that there's going to be what we recognize as a fair election in 2029, and I'm even less sure that someone who's not crazy is going to win it. But if an opportunity comes to us as it did in 2020, let's be better prepared for it,” he says.

If the worst happens, Dickerson is prepared for that, too. “I'm half-retired in the middle of the Arizona desert, and if the US is going to continue to collapse into chaos, there's nothing I can do about it except be as far away from it as I can,” he says. In that case, a lot of his friends—and maybe a certain journalist—might show up on his doorstep, offering help to restore that abandoned sky observatory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Why Everyone Is Suddenly in a ‘Very Chinese Time' in Their Lives","https://www.wired.com/story/made-in-china-chinese-time-of-my-life/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:00:00 GMT","

In case you didn't get the memo, everyone is feeling very Chinese these days. Across social media, people are proclaiming that “You met me at a very Chinese time of my life,” while performing stereotypically Chinese-coded activities like eating dim sum or wearing the viral Adidas Chinese jacket. The trend blew up so much in recent weeks that celebrities like comedian Jimmy O Yang and influencer Hasan Piker even got in on it. It has now evolved into variations like “Chinamaxxing” (acting increasingly more Chinese) and “u will turn Chinese tomorrow” (a kind of affirmation or blessing).

It's hard to quantify a zeitgeist, but here at WIRED, chronically online people like us have been noticing a distinct vibe shift when it comes to China over the past year. Despite all of the tariffs, export controls, and anti-China rhetoric, many people in the United States, especially younger generations, have fallen in love with Chinese technology, Chinese brands, Chinese cities, and are overall consuming more Chinese-made products than ever before. In a sense the only logical thing left to do was to literally become Chinese.

“It has occurred to me that a lot of you guys have not come to terms with your newfound Chinese identity,” the influencer Chao Ban joked in a TikTok video that has racked up over 340,000 likes. “Let me just ask you this: Aren't you scrolling on this Chinese app, probably on a Chinese made phone, wearing clothes that are made in China, collecting dolls that are from China?”

As is often the case with Western narratives about China, these memes are not really meant to paint an accurate picture of life in the country. Instead, they function as a projection of “all of the undesirable aspects of American life—or the decay of the American dream,” says Tianyu Fang, a PhD researcher at Harvard who studies science and technology in China.

At a moment when America's infrastructure is crumbling and once-unthinkable forms of state violence are being normalized, China is starting to look pretty good in contrast. “When people say it's the Chinese century, part of that is this ironic defeat,” says Fang.

As the Trump administration remade the US government in its own image and smashed long-standing democratic norms, people started yearning for an alternative role model, and they found a pretty good one in China. With its awe-inspiring skylines and abundant high-speed trains, the country serves as a symbol of the earnest and urgent desire among many Americans for something completely different from their own realities.

Critics frequently point to China's massive clean energy investments to highlight America's climate policy failures, or they point to its urban infrastructure development to shame the US housing shortage. These narratives tend to emphasize China's strengths while sidelining the uglier facets of its development—but that selectivity is the point. China is being used less as a real place than as an abstraction, a way of exposing America's own shortcomings. As writer Minh Tran observed in a recent Substack post, “In the twilight of the American empire, our Orientalism is not a patronizing one, but an aspirational one.”

Part of why China is on everyone's mind is that it's become totally unavoidable. No matter where you live in the world, you are likely going to be surrounded by things made in China. Here at WIRED, we've been documenting that exhaustively: Your phone or laptop or robot vacuum is made in China; your favorite AI slop joke is made in China; Labubu, the world's most coveted toy, is made in China; the solar panels powering the Global South are made in China; the world's best-selling EV brand, which officially overtook Tesla last year, is made in China. Even the most-talked about open-source AI model is from China. All of these examples are why this newsletter is called Made in China.

China has been the factory of the world for decades, but last year, many people in the US realized for the first time just how dependent they were on exports from the country. When tariffs hit, Americans suddenly realized their American-branded goods were all sourced from China. And thanks to Chinese apps like TikTok and DHGate, they could now communicate directly with factories there instead of browsing intermediaries like Walmart or Amazon. At the same time, language barriers became less of an issue. The latest large language models are excellent at translating text and audio from Chinese into English. While Chinese tech companies like Red Note still aren't great at localizing for foreign markets, they don't have to be when overseas users can easily interpret a Chinese joke by simply pressing the translate button.

Sure, some of the Chinamaxxing content people are seeing is likely being bankrolled by the Chinese government or other entities associated with it. But the brutal truth is that Chinese state-sponsored content is often simply too crude or heavy-handed to actually influence public opinion. No matter how hard the state apparatus tries, its content will never be as viral as a random joke from a D-list Western creator about how drinking hot water makes them Chinese.

For the most part, this is a fun and innocuous trend, often interpreted as a show of admiration for China and Chinese culture. That's why some Chinese or Chinese diaspora creators have joined in on the meme, telling their followers yes, you are Chinese if you enjoy hot pot. Chinese artists have also rode the viral wave by producing art that is “Orientalism chic,” a term coined by the culture writer Patrick Kho. By repackaging orientalist tropes with better taste and a light dose of identity politics, they can meet Western audiences where they are, without fully surrendering to familiar caricatures.

Part of what makes Chinamaxxing appealing, at least for some people, is that it feels a little transgressive. Saying that you were becoming another race, however ironically, used to be the kind of thing that would get you canceled. “Ten years ago, this would've been the fodder for an essay about ‘cultural appropriation' from some second-generation Asian American who believed that congee was a sacred food or that white people needed permits to enter Asian supermarkets,” Tran observed wryly in his Substack post.

But plenty of actual Chinese people have voiced discomfort with these memes for understandable reasons. Some of the creators who have participated in the trend can speak flawless Mandarin and actually live in China (100 percent respectful to me, says Zeyi), but others are just feeling themselves for cooking orange chicken from scratch for the first time.

Is it really necessary to celebrate minimum effort? Even at their most Chinese time, these people's Chineseness reflects only a tiny fraction of what it actually means to be Chinese. “It's convenient to hop on any trend to avoid FOMO, and that trend happens to be China these days,” says Yunyun Gu, a Chinese diaspora artist based in Houston who made a TikTok video commenting on Chinamaxxing memes. “It's convenient to eat Chinese food, buy Chinese products, learn Nihao, or do any surface-level stuff to feel like you're part of a movement without internalizing Chinese culture itself,” she says.

By definition, the phrase “at a very Chinese time” implies it's a temporary state. Like a Shein dress that is discarded in a landfill after a few months, this form of Chineseness feels disposable. If all people are looking for is another culture to aspire to, they could very well become Mexican in 2027, Indian the next month, or Filipino tomorrow.

Meanwhile, some of us are stuck being Chinese forever, including all the less fun parts that come with it, like worrying about the stability of staying in the US amid immigration policy chaos.

Social media trends come and go, and we can't predict how this meme will evolve with time. But unless Chinese technology and manufacturing somehow become less dominant, Chineseness may become the new normal, expanding far beyond the terminally online crowd. It's 2026, and the Chinese century, or the “American century of humiliation” as some are calling it, has only just begun.

Claude Code has become one of the hottest AI tools in recent months — and software engineers in Seattle are taking notice.

More than 150 techies packed the house at a Claude Code meetup event in Seattle on Thursday evening, eager to trade use cases and share how they're using Anthropic's fast-growing technology. 

Claude Code is a specialized AI tool that acts like a supercharged pair-programmer for software developers. Interest in Claude Code has surged alongside improvements to Anthropic's underlying models that let Claude handle longer, more complex workflows. 

“The biggest thing is closing the feedback loop — it can take actions on its own and look at the results of those actions, and then take the next action,” explained Carly Rector, a product engineer at Pioneer Square Labs, the Seattle startup studio that organized Thursday's event at Thinkspace.

Software development has emerged as the first profession to be thoroughly reshaped by large language models, as AI systems move beyond answering questions to actively doing the work. Last summer GeekWire reported on a similar event in Seattle focused on Cursor, another AI coding tool that developers described as a major productivity booster.

Claude Code is “one of a new generation of AI coding tools that represent a sudden capability leap in AI in the past month or so,” wrote Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor and AI researcher, in a Jan. 7 blog post.

Mollick notes that these tools are better at self-correcting their own errors and now have “agentic harness” that helps them work around long-standing AI limitations, including context-window constraints that affect how much information models can remember.

On stage at Thursday's event, Rector demoed an app that automatically fixed front-end bugs by having Claude Code control a browser. Johnny Leung, a software engineer at Stripe, said Claude Code has changed how he thinks about being a developer. “It's kind of evolving the mentality from just writing code to becoming like an architect, almost like a product manager,” he said on stage during his demo.

R. Conner Howell, a software engineer in Seattle, showed how Claude Code can act as a personal cycling coach, querying performance data from databases and generating custom training plans — an example of the tool's impact extending beyond traditional software development.

Earlier this week Anthropic — which is reportedly raising another $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation — released Claude Cowork, essentially Claude Code's non-developer cousin that is built for everyday knowledge work instead of just programming.

AI coding tools are energizing longtime software developers like Damon Cortesi, who co-founded Seattle startup Simply Measured in 2010 and is now an engineer at Airbnb. He said Thursday's event was the first tech meetup he's attended in more than five years. 

“There's no limit to what I can think about and put out there and actually make real,” he said. 

In a post titled “How Claude Reset the AI Race,” New York Magazine columnist John Herrman noted the growing concern around coding automation and job displacement. “If you work in software development, the future feels incredibly uncertain,” he wrote.

Anthropic, which opened an office in Seattle in 2024, said it used Claude Code to build Claude Cowork itself. However, analysts at William Blair issued a report this week expressing skepticism that other businesses will simply start building their own software with these new AI tools.

“Vibe coding and AI code generation certainly make it easier to build software, but the technical barriers to coding have not been the drivers of software moats for some time,” they wrote. “For the most successful and scaled software companies, determining what to build next and how it should function within a broader system is fundamentally more important and more challenging than the technical act of building and coding it.”

For now, Claude Code is being rapidly adopted. The tool reached a $1 billion run rate six months after launch in May. OpenAI's Codex and Google's Antigravity offer similar capabilities. 

“We're excited to see all the cool things you do with Claude Code,” Caleb John, a Seattle entrepreneur working at Pioneer Square Labs, told the crowd. “It's really a new era of software development.”

University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

YouTube is updating its advertiser-friendly content guidelines to allow more videos on controversial issues to earn full ad revenue, as long as they're dramatized or discussed in a non-graphic manner. These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization. 

YouTube announced the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.

“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week's update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”

The Google-owned company says it's making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube's guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.

“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”

The move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform. 

The company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. The New York Times reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were rolling back online speech moderation after President Donald Trump returned to office. 

YouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, paving the way for companies like Geely, BYD, Xiaomi, and others to establish a second foothold in the North American automotive market. 

Canada is not going all-in on Chinese EVs, though. The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, according to the Associated Press. 

It's a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he'd be open to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.

China has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter especially booming in 2025. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate is aiming to announce an entry into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.

Automotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years. 

But the 100% tariff on Chinese cars has so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That's despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.

China's ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China's EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia.

On Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America's Future Energy, cautioned against Trump's idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States.

“We've seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.”

OpenAI and Microsoft tried to dodge a courtroom showdown with Elon Musk, but a federal judge wasn't having it, as reported earlier by Bloomberg. On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they'll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.

The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn't last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.

The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to archenemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk's lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.

The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk's claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.

Italy has launched two investigations into Microsoft's Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.

The country's competition regulator, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.

“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM wrote in a statement.

The AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases. 

That isn't particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200. 

Given the nature of the game, it's not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.

Both Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands. 

The authority is also looking into the games' parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company's consent process for harvesting and using personal data.

“In the Authority's view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.

Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat. 

Armed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.   

“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”   

So, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.   

Yu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.  

It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale. 

For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.   

Then there's Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.   

One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend. 

Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby. 

Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don't require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said. 

“It's similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it's] software itself.”   

Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It's really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.  

In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What's new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.

Mobile micro apps still aren't as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps. 

Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.

Still, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn't hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.  

Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can't just be sold as-is to the masses. 

But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.  

The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.  

Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco's tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.  

Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”

Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. 

Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.   

“It's really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.  

One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn't like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies. 

She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.  

“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I'd love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”   

She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn't have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.  

“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”

You mention you've done work for public transit - well, if public transit documentation suddenly starts being terrible, will it lead to an immediate, noticeable drop in revenue? Doubt it. Firing the technical writer however has an immediate and quantifiable effect on the budget.Apply the same for software (have you seen how bad tech is lately?) or basically any kind of vertical with a nontrivial barrier to entry where someone can't just say ""this sucks and I'm gonna build a better one in a weekend"".

I don't work for the public transit company; I introduce immigrants to Berlin's public transit. To answer to the broader question, good documentation is one of the many little things that affect how you feel about a company. The BVG clearly cares about that, because their marketing department is famously competent. Good documentation also means that fewer people will queue at their service centre and waste an employee's time. Documentation is the cheaper form of customer service.Besides, how people feels about the public transit company does matter, because their funding is partly a political question. No one will come to defend a much-hated, customer-hostile service.

Sure, the megacorps may start rotting from the inside out, but we already see a retrenchment to smaller private communities, and if more of the benefits of the big platforms trickle down, why wouldn't that continue?Nicbou, do you see AI as increasing your personal output? If it lets enthusiastic individuals get more leverage on good causes then I still have hope.

When it became cheaper to make games did the quality go up?When it became cheaper to mass produce X (sneakers, tshirts, anything really) did the quality go up?It's a world that is made of an abundance of trash. The volume of low quality production saturates the market and drowns out whatever high quality things still remain. In such a world you're just better of reallocating your resources from the production quality towards the the shouting match of marketing and try to win by finding ways to be more visible than the others. (SEO hacking etc shenanigans)When you drive down the cost of doing something to zero you you also effectively destroy the economy based around that thing. Like online print, basically nobody can make a living with focusing on publishing news or articles but alternative revenue streams (ads) are needed. Same for games too.

No, but the availability (more people can afford it) and diversity (different needs are met) increased. I would say that's a positive. Some of the expensive ""legacy"" things still exist and people pay for it (e.g. newspapers / professional journalism).Of course low quality stuff increased by a lot and you're right, that leads to problems.

Maybe my opinion is just biased and I'm in the comfortable position to pass judgment but I'd like to believe that more people would be more ethical and conscious about their materialistic needs if things had more value and were better quality and instead of focusing on the ""price"" as the primary value proposition people were actually able to afford to buy other than the cheapest of things.Wouldn't the economy also be in much better shape if more people could buy things such as handmade shoes or suits?

I hear ya but I wonder how that reflects on Open source software which was the GP request created by LLM let's say. Yes I know it can have bugs but its free of cost and you can own it and modify it with source code availability and run it on your own hardwareThere really isn't much of a difference in terms of hardware/electricity just because of these Open source projectsBut probably some for LLM's so its a little tricky but I feel like open source projects/ running far with ideas gets incentivizedAtleast I feel like its one of the more acceptable uses of LLM in so far. Its better because you are open sourcing it for others to run. If someone doesn't want to use it, that's their freedom but you built it for yourself or running with an idea which couldn't have existed if you didn't know the details on implementations or would have taken months or years for 0 gains when now you can do it in less timeIt significantly improves to see which ideas would be beneficial or not and I feel like if AI is so worrying then if an idea is good and it can be tested, it can always be rewritten or documented heavily by a human.

When it became cheaper to mass produce sneakers, tshirts, and anything, the quality of the individual product probably did go down, but more people around the world were able to afford the product, which raised the standard of living for people in the aggregate.  Now,  if these products were absolute trash, life wouldn't make much sense, but there's a friction point in there between high quality and trash, where things are acceptable and affordable to the many.  Making things cheaper isn't a net negative for human progress: hitting that friction point of acceptable affordability helps spread progress more democratically and raise the standard of living.The question at hand is whether AI can more affordably produce acceptable technical writing, or if it's trash.  My own experiences with AI make me think that it won't produce acceptable results, because you never know when AI is lying: catching those errors requires someone who might as well just write the documentation.  But, if it could produce truthful technical writing affordably, that would not be a bad thing for humanity.

Today the situation is very different and I'm not quite sure why you compare a time in history where the average person was illiterate and (printed) books were limited to a very small audience who could afford them, with the current era where everybody is exposed to the written word all the time and is even dependent on it, in many cases even dependent on it's accuracy (think public services). The quality of AI writing in some cases is so subpar, it resembles word salad. Example goodreads: the blurb of this book https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237615295-of-venom-and-v... was so surreal I wrote to the author to correct it (see in comments to the authors own review). It's better now, but it still has mistakes. This is in no way comparable with the pasts goes down a bit this is destroying trust even more than everything else, because it this gets to be the norm for official documents people are going to be hurt.

It introduces a lower barrier to entry, so more low-quality things are also created, but it also increases the quality of the higher-tier as well. It's important to note that in FOSS, we (Or atleast...I) don't generally care who wrote the code, as long as it compiles and isn't malicious. This overlays with the original discussion...If I was paying you to read your posts, I expect them to be hand-written. If I'm paying for software, it better not be AI Slop. If you're offering me something for free, I'm not really in a position to complain about the quality.It's undeniable that, especially in software, cheaper costs and a lower barrier to get started will bring more great FOSS software. This is like one of the pillars of FOSS, right? That's how we got LetsEncrypt, OpenDNS, etc. It will also 100% bring more slop. Both can be true at the same time.

I'd argue that this started 30  years ago when automated phone trees started replacing the first line of workers and making users figure out how to navigate where they needed to in order to get the service they needed.I can't remember if chat bots or ""knowledge bases"" came first, but that was the next step in the ""figure it out yourself"" attitude corporations adopted (under the guise of empowering users to ""self help"").Then we started letting corporations use the ""we're just too big to actually have humans deal with things"" excuse (eg online moderation, or paid services with basically no support).And all these companies look at each other to see who can lower the bar next and jump on the bandwagon.It's one of my ""favorite"" rants, I guess.The way I see this next era going is that it's basically going to become exclusively the users' responsibility to figure out how to talk to the bots to solve any issue they have.

The quality of AI-made documentation may be poor, but calling it 0% is just silly.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who was reading about some interesting but flawed system only to discover later that they were talking about MY OWN SOFTWARE!? (only half-joking here)

First, I understand what you're saying and generally agree with it, in the sense that that is how the organization will ""experience"" it.However, the answer to ""will it lead to a noticeable drop in revenue"" is actually yes. The problem is that it won't lead to a traceable drop in revenue. You may see the numbers go down. But the numbers don't come with labels why. You may go out and ask users why they are using your service less, but people are generally very terrible at explaining why they do anything, and few of them will be able to tell you ""your documentation is just terrible and everything confuses me"". They'll tell you a variety of cognitively available stories, like the place is dirty or crowded or loud or the vending machines are always broken, but they're terrible at identifying the real root causes.This sort of thing is why not only is everything enshittifying, but even as the entire world enshittifies, everybody's metrics are going up up up. It takes leadership willing to go against the numbers a bit to say, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we provide quality documentation, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we use screws that don't rust after six months, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we don't take the cheapest bidder every single time for every single thing in our product but put a bit of extra money in the right place. Otherwise you just get enshittification-by-numbers until you eventually go under and get outcompeted and can't figure out why because all your numbers just kept going up.

It means you need judgement-based management to be able to over-ride metric-based decisions, at times.

That's one way to frame it. An other one is, sometime people are stuck in a situation where all options that come to their mind have repulsive consequences.As always some consequences are deemed more immediate, and other will seem remoter. And often the incentives can be quite at odd between expectations in the short/long terms.>this sucks and I'm gonna build a better one in a weekendHey, this is me looking at the world this morning. Bear with me, the bright new harmonious world should be there on Monday. ;)

Coding is like writing documentation for the computer to read. It is common to say that you should write documentation any idiot can understand, and compared to people, computers really are idiots that do exactly as you say with a complete lack of common sense. Computers understand nothing, so all the understanding has to come from the programmer, which is his actual job.Just because LLMs can produce grammatically correct sentences doesn't mean they can write proper documentation. In the same way, just because they are able to produce code that compiles doesn't mean they can write the program the user needs.

“Technology needs soul”I suppose this can be generalized to “__ needs soul”.   Eg.  Technical writing needs soul, User interfaces need soul, etc.   We are seriously discounting the value we receive from embedding a level of humanity into the things we choose (or are forced) to experience.

I completely agree that the ambitions of AI proponents to replace workers is insulting.  You hit the nail on the head with pointing out that we simply dont write everything down.  And the more common sense / well known something is the less likely it is to be written down, yet the more likely it might be needed by an AI to align itself properly.

Nicely written (which, I guess, is sort of the point).

I'm exploring ways to organize my Obsidian vault such that it can be shared with friends, but not the whole Internet (and its bots). I'm extracting value out the curation I've done, but I'd like to share with others.

Not from a moral perspective of course, but the technical possibility. And the overton window has shifted already so far, the moral aspect might align soon, too.IMO there is an entirely different problem, that's not going to go away just about ever, but could be solved right now easily. And whatever AI company does so first instantly wipes out all competition:Accept full responsibility and liability for any damages caused by their model making wrong decisions and either not meeting a minimum quality standard or the agreed upon quality.You know, just like the human it'd replace.

That's not sufficient, at least from the likes of OpenAI, because, realistically, that's a liability that would go away in bankruptcy. Companies aren't going to want to depend on it. People _might_ take, say, _Microsoft_ up on that, but Microsoft wouldn't offer it.

I call it the banana bread problem.To curate a list of the best cafés in your city, someone must eventually go out and try a few of them. A human being with taste honed by years of sensory experiences will have to order a coffee, sit down, appreciate the vibe, and taste the banana bread.At some point, you need someone to go out in the world and feel things. A machine that cannot feel will never be a good curator of human experiences.

Granted, there's lots that's dystopian about that picture, I'm not advocating for it, but it does start to feel like the main value of the ""curator"" is actually just data capture. Then they put their own subjective take on that data, but I'm not totally convinced that's better than something that could tell me a data-driven story of: ""Here are the top three banana breads in the city that customers keep coming back to have a taste orgasm for"".I don't know though, it's a brave new world and I'm skeptical of anyone who thinks they know how all this will play out.

You may enjoy this story about her work:https://www.folklore.org/Inside_Macintosh.htmlAs a counterpoint, the very worst ""documentation"" (scare quotes intended) I've ever seen was when I worked at IBM. We were all required to participate in a corporate training about IBM's Watson coding assistant. (We weren't allowed to use external AIs in our work.)As an exercise, one of my colleagues asked the coding assistant to write documentation for a Python source file I'd written for the QA team. This code implemented a concept of a ""test suite"", which was a CSV file listing a collection of ""test sets"". Each test set was a CSV file listing any number of individual tests.The code was straightforward, easy to read and well-commented. There was an outer loop to read each line of the test suite and get the filename of a test set, and an inner loop to read each line of the test set and run the test.The coding assistant hallucinated away the nested loop and just described the outer loop as going through a test suite and running each test.There were a number of small helper functions with docstrings and comments and type hints. (We type hinted everything and used mypy and other tools to enforce this.)The assistant wrote its own ""documentation"" for each of these functions in this form:""The 'foo' function takes a 'bar' parameter as input and returns a 'baz'""Dude, anyone reading the code could have told you that!All of this ""documentation"" was lumped together in a massive wall of text at the top of the source file. So:When you're reading the docs, you're not reading the code.When you're reading the code, you're not reading the docs.Even worse, whenever someone updates the actual code and its internal documentation, they are unlikely to update the generated ""documentation"". So it started out bad and would get worse over time.Note that this Python source file didn't implement an API where an external user might want a concise summary of each API function. It was an internal module where anyone working on it would go to the actual code to understand it.

If you are in charge of a herd of bots that are following a prompt scaffolding in order to automate a work product that meets 90% of the quality of the pure human output you produce, that gives you a starting point with only 10% of the work to be done. I'd hazard a guess that if you spent 6 months crafting a prompt scaffold you could reach 99% of your own quality, with the odd outliers here and there.The first person or company to do that well then has an automation framework, and they can suddenly achieve 10x or 100x the output with a nominal cost in operating the AI. They can ensure that each and every work product is lovingly finished and artisanally handcrafted , go the extra mile, and maybe reach 8x to 80x output with a QA loss.In order to do 8-80x one expert's output, you might need to hire a bunch of people to do segmented tasks - some to do interviews, build relationships, the other things that require in person socialization. Or, maybe AI can identify commonalities and do good enough at predicting a plausible enough model that anyone paying for what you do will be satisfied with the 90% as good AI product but without that personal touch, and as soon as an AI centric firm decides to eat your lunch, your human oriented edge is gone. If it comes down to beancounting, AI is going to win.I don't think there's anything that doesn't require physically interacting with the world that isn't susceptible to significant disruption, from augmentation to outright replacement, depending on the cost of tailoring a model to the tasks.For valuable enough work, companies will pay the millions to fine-tune frontier models, either through OpenAI or open source options like Kimi or DeepSeek, and those models will give those companies an edge over the competition.I love human customer service, especially when it's someone who's competent, enjoys what they do, and actually gives a shit. Those people are awesome - but they're not necessary, and the cost of not having them is less than the cost of maintaining a big team of customer service agents. If a vendor tells a big company that they can replace 40k service agents being paid ~$3.2 billion a year with a few datacenters, custom AI models, AI IT and Support staff, and totally automated customer service system for $100 million a year, that might well be worth the reputation hit and savings. None of the AI will be able to match the top 20% of human service agents in the edge cases, and there will be a new set of problems that come from customer and AI conflict, etc.Even so. If your job depends on processing information - even information in a deeply human, emotional, psychologically nuanced and complex context - it's susceptible to automation, because the ones with the money are happy with ""good enough."" AI just has to be good enough to make more money than the human work it supplants, and frontier models are far past that threshold.

For valuable enough work, companies will pay the millions to fine-tune frontier models, either through OpenAI or open source options like Kimi or DeepSeek, and those models will give those companies an edge over the competition.I love human customer service, especially when it's someone who's competent, enjoys what they do, and actually gives a shit. Those people are awesome - but they're not necessary, and the cost of not having them is less than the cost of maintaining a big team of customer service agents. If a vendor tells a big company that they can replace 40k service agents being paid ~$3.2 billion a year with a few datacenters, custom AI models, AI IT and Support staff, and totally automated customer service system for $100 million a year, that might well be worth the reputation hit and savings. None of the AI will be able to match the top 20% of human service agents in the edge cases, and there will be a new set of problems that come from customer and AI conflict, etc.Even so.

- Most people don't communicate as thoroughly and complete - written and verbal - as they think they do. Very often there is what I call ""assumptive communication"". That is, sender's ambiguity that's resolved by the receiver making assumptions about what was REALLY meant. Often, filling in the blanks is easy to do - as it's done all the time - but not always. The resolution doesn't change the fact there was ambiguity at the root.Next time you're communicating, listen carefully. Make note of how often the other person sends something that could be interpreted differently, how often you assume by using the default of ""what they likely meant was...""- That said, AI might not replace people like you. Or me? But it's an improvement for the majority of people. AI isn't perfect, hardly. But most people don't have the skills a/o willingness to communicate at a level AI can simulate. Improved communication is not easy. People generally want ease and comfort. AI is their answer. They believe you are replaceable because it replaces them and they assume they're good communicators. Classic Dunning-Kruger.p.s. One of my fave comms' heuristics is from Frank Luntz*:""It's not what you say, it's what they hear."" (<< edit was changing to ""say"" from ""said"".)One of the keys to improved comms is to embrace that clarify and completeness is the sole responsibility of the sender, not the receiver. Some people don't want to hear that, and be accountable, especially then assumption communication is a viable shortcut.* Note: I'm not a fan of his politics, and perhaps he's not The Source of this heuristic, but read it first in his ""Words That Work"". The first chapter of ""WTW"" is evergreen comms gold.

I could say I make my living with various forms of communication.I am not worried about AI replacing me 1:1 communication wise. What is going to happen is the structure around me that gives my current communication skill set value is going to change so much and be optimized to a degree that my current skill set is no longer going to have much value in the new structures that arise. I will have to figure out how to fit into these new structures and it surely won't be doing the same thing I am doing now. That seems so obvious.

Your use of the word parasite, especially in the context of TFA, reminds me of the article James Michener wrote for Reader's Digest in 1972 recounting President Nixon's trip to China that year. In an anecdote from the end of the trip, Michener explained that Chinese officials gave parting gifts to the American journalists and their coordinating staffs covering the presidential trip. In the case of the radio/TV journalists, those staffs included various audio and video technicians.As Michener told it, the officials' gifts to the technicians were unexpectedly valuable and carefully chosen; but, when the newspaper and magazine writers in the group got their official gifts, they turned out to be relatively cheap trinkets. When one writer was bold enough to complain about this apparent disparity, a translator replied that the Chinese highly valued those who held technical skills (especially in view of the radical changes then going on in China's attempt to rebuild itself).“So what do you think about writers?” the complainer responded.To that, the translator said darkly, “We consider writers to be parasites.”

All the more as part of the underlying representation is actually starting from a structuralist analysis. We try to clarify the situation through classes of issues. But then mid journey we see what looks like an easy ride shortcut, where mapping ontological assessment over social forces in interaction is always one step on the side away. Goat scape is nothing new.So we quickly jump from, what social structures/forces lead to that awful results, to who can be blamed while we continue to let the underlying anthropological issue rules everyone.

The kind of documentation no one reads, that is just here to please some manager, or meet some compliance requirement. These are, unfortunately, the most common kind I see, by volume. Usually, they are named something like QQF-FFT-44388-IssueD.doc and they are completely outdated with regard to the thing they document despite having seen several revisions, as evidenced by the inconsistent style.Common features are:- A glossary that describe terms that don't need describing, such as CPU or RAM, but not ambiguous and domain-specific terms, of which there are many- References to documents you don't have access to- UML diagrams, not matching the code of course- Signatures by people who left the project long ago and are nowhere to be seen- A bunch of screenshots, all with different UIs taken at different stages of development, would be of great value to archeologists- Wildly inconsistent formatting, some people realize that Word has styles and can generate a table of contents, others don't, and few careOf course, no one reads them, besides maybe a depressive QA manager.

I think everyone on the team should get involved in this kind of feedback because raw first impressions on new content (which you can only experience once, and will be somewhat similar to impatient new users) is super valuable.I remember as a dev flagging some tech marketing copy aimed at non-devs as confusing and being told by a manager not to give any more feedback like that because I wasn't in marketing... If your own team that's familiar with your product is a little confused, you can probably x10 that confusion for outside users, and multiply that again if a dev is confused by tech content aimed at non-devs.I find it really common as well that you get non-tech people writing about tech topics for marketing and landing pages, and because they only have a surface level understanding of the the tech the text becomes really vague with little meaning.And you'll get lots devs and other people on the team agreeing in secret the e.g. the product homepage content isn't great but are scared to say anything because they feel they have to stay inside their bubble and there isn't a culture of sharing feedback like that.

But today's AI might do better than the average tech writer.

A lot of projects don't just have poor technical documentation, they have no technical documentation.

I think I agree, at least in the current state of AI, but can't quite put my finger on what exactly it's missing. I did have some limited success with getting Claude Code to go through tutorials (actually implementing each step as they go), and then having it iterate on the tutorial, but it's definitely not at the level of a human tech writer.Would you be willing to take a stab at the competencies that a future AI agent would require to be excellent at this (or possibly never achieve)? I mean, TFA talks about ""empathy"" and emotions and feeling the pain, but I can't help feel that this wording is a bit too magical to be useful.

For tech documentation, I suppose that AI agents would mainly benefit from Skills files managed as part of the tool's repo, and I absolutely do imagine future AI agents being set up (e.g. as part of their AGENTS.md) to propose PRs to these Skills as they use the tools. And I'm wondering whether AI agents might end up with different usability concerns and pain-points from those that we have.

Also true that most tech writers are bad. And companies aren't going to spend >$200k/year on a tech writer until they hit tens of millions in revenue. So AI fills the gap.As a horror story, our docs team didn't understand that having correct installation links should be one of their top priorities. Obviously if a potential customer can't install product, they'd assume it's bs and try to find an alternative. It's so much more important than e.g. grammar in a middle of some guide.

Tech writing seems especially vulnerable to people not really understanding the job (and then devaluing it, because ""everybody can write"" - which, no, if you'll excuse the slight self-promotion but it saves me repeating myself https://deborahwrites.com/blog/nobody-can-write/)In my experience, tech writers often contribute to UX and testing (they're often the first user, and thus bug reporter). They're the ones who are going to notice when your API naming conventions are out of whack. They're also the ones writing the quickstart with sales & marketing impact. And then, yes, they're the ones bringing a deep understanding of structure and clarity.I've tried AI for writing docs. It can be helpful at points, but my goodness I would not want to let anything an AI wrote out the door without heavy editing.

Even people with decent portfolio tend to be very bad at their job.The only good option now is to hire a software developer to do the writing. There's a decent amount of them who have experience with that. Obviously devs won't like to have it on their CV instead of proper development.Honestly this is a catastrophe. If you're firing a tech writer that writes something even semi-decent, you're ruining your business.Reminder: AI is only good at things that existed in bulk during its training, such as README files, configs that always look the same (package.json, dockerfile), and tests. The documentation for your product, or for products of that kind, or even in general, either never existed, or not such a commodity to have AI generate it well.

I do not think that these skills are so easily replaced; certainly the machine can do a lot, but if you acquire those skills yourself you shape your brain in a way that is definitely useful to you in many other aspects of life.In my humble opinion we will be losing that from people, the upscaling of skills will be lost for sure, but the human upscaling is the real loss.

Yep, and reading you will feel less boring.The uniform style of LLMs gets old fast and I wouldn't be surprised if it were a fundamental flaw due to how they work.And it's not even sure speed gains from using LLMs make up for the skill loss in the long term.

I thought it was saying ""a letter to those who fired tech writers because they were caught using AI,"" not ""a letter to those who fired tech writers to replace them with AI.""The whole article felt imprecise with language.

On one hand, recent models seem to be less useful than the previous generation of them, the scale needed for training improved networks seems to be following the expected quadratic curve, and we don't have more data to train larger models.On the other hand, many people claim that what tooling integration is the bottleneck, and that the next generation of LLMs are much better than anything we have seen up to now.

But, when we use ""AI"" acronym, our brains still recognize ""intelligence"" attribute and tend to perceive LLMs as more powerful than they actually are.Current models are like trained parrots that can draw colored blocks and insert them into the appropriate slots. Sure, much faster and with incomparably more data. But they're still parrots.This story and the discussions remind me of reports and articles about the first computers. People were so impressed by the speed of their mathematical calculations that they called them ""electronic brains"" and considered, even feared, ""robot intelligence.""Now we're so impressed by the speed of pattern matching that we called them ""artificial intelligence,"" and we're back to where we are.

Obviously we still need people to oil the machine, but... a person who deeply understands the product, can communicate shortcomings in process or user flows, can quickly and effectively organize their thoughts and communicate them, can navigate up and down abstraction levels and dive into details when necessary - these are the skills LLMs require.

But because AI makes it that much more efficient, many businesses that weren't financially viable when it needed 100 engineers might become viable with 10 engineers + AI.

Au contraire. It's not very often that the cost of labor actually drops to anywhere close to zero, but we have some examples. The elevator operator is a prime example. When it was costly to hire an operator we could only hire a few of them. Nowadays anyone who is willing to operate an elevator just has to show up and they automatically get the job.If 1,000 engineers are worth having around, why not an infinite number of them, just like those working as elevator operators? Again, there is no cost in this hypothetical scenario.> Cost is not the only driver to demand.Technically true, but we're not talking about garbage here. Humans are always valuable to some degree, just not necessarily valuable enough when there is a cost to balance. But, again, we're talking about zero cost. I expect you are getting caught up in thinking about scenarios where labor still has a cost, perhaps confusing zero cost with zero payroll?

Five engineers could be turned into maybe two, but probably not less.It's the 'bus factor' at play. If you still want human approvals on pull requests then  If one of those engineers goes on vacation or leaves the company you're stuck with one engineer for a while.If both leave then you're screwed.If you're a small startup, then sure there are no rules and it's the wild west. One dev can run the world.

Peak productivity has always been somewhere between 1-3 people, though if any one of those people can't or won't continue working for one reason or another, it's generally game over for the project.  So you hire more.This is why small software startups time and time again manage to run circles around with organizations with much larger budgets.  A 10 person game studio like Team Cherry can release smash hit after smash hit, while Ubisoft with 170,000% the personnel count visibly flounders.  Imagine doing that in hardware, like if you could just grab some buddies and start a business successfully competing with TSMC out of your garage.  That's clearly not possible.  But in software, it actually is.

I am not even quite sure I know how to manage a team of more than two programmers right now. Opus 4.5, in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, can develop software almost as fast as I can write specs and review code. And it's just plain better at writing code than 60% of my graduating class was back in the day. I have banned at least one person from ever writing a commit message or pull request again, because Claude will explain it better.Now, most people don't know to squeeze that much productivity out of it, most corporate procurement would take 9 months to buy a bucket if it was raining money outside, and it's possible to turn your code into unmaintainable slop at warp speed. And Claude is better at writing code than it is at almost anything else, so the rest of y'all are safe for a while.But if you think that tech writers, or translators, or software developers are the only people who are going to get hit by waves of downsizing, then you're not paying attention.Even if the underlying AI tech stalls out hard and permanently in 2026, there's a wave of change coming, and we are not ready. Nothing in our society, economy or politics is ready to deal with what's coming. And that scares me a bit these days.

I suspect a lot of folks are asking ChatGPT to summarize it…I can't imagine just letting an LLM write an app, server, or documentation package, wholesale and unsupervised, but have found them to be extremely helpful in editing and writing portions of a whole.The one thing that could be a light in the darkness, is that publishers have already fired all their editors (nothing to do with AI), and the writing out there shows it. This means there's the possibility that AI could bring back editing.

Two years ago, I asked chatgpt to rewrite my resume. It looked fantastic at a first sight, then, one week later I re-read it, and feel ashamed to have sent it to some prospective employers. It was full of cringe inducing babble.You see, for an LLM there are no hierarchies other than what it observed in their training, and even then, applying it in a different context may be tricky for them. Because it can describe hierarchies, relationships by mimicry, but it doesn't actually have a model of them.Just an example: It may be able to generate text that recognizes that a PhD title is a step above from a Master's degree, but sometimes it won't be able to translate this fact (instead of the description of this fact) into the subtle differences in attention and emphasis we do in our written text to reflect those real world hierarchies of value. It can repeat the fact to you, can even kind of generalize it, but it won't take a decision based on it.It can, even more now, get a very close simulation of this, because relative importance of stuff would have been semantically capture, and it is very good at capturing those subtle semantical relationships, but, in linguistic terms, it absolutely sucks at pragmatics.An example: Let's say in one of your experiences, you improved a model that detected malignancy in a certain kind of tumor images, improving its false negative rate to something like 0.001%, then in the same experience you casually mention that you tied the CEOs toddler tennis shoes once. Given your prompt to write a resume according to the usual resume enhancement formulas, there's a big chance it will emphasize the irrelevant tennis lace tying activity in a ridiculously pompous manner, making it hierarchically equivalent to your model kung-fu accomplishments.So in the end, you end up with some bizarre stuff that looks like:""Tied our CEO's toddler tennis shoes, enabling her to raise 20M with minimal equity dilution in our Series B round""

One thing to add is that the LLM doesn't know what it can't see. It just amplifies what is there. Assumed knowledge is quite common with developers and their own code. Or the more common ""it works on my machine"" because something is set outside of the code environment.Sadly other fields are experiencing the same issue of someone outside their field saying AI can straight up replace them.

I was terrible writer, but we had to write good docs and make it easy for our customers to integrate with our products. So, I prepared the context to our tech writers and they have created nice documentation pages.The cycle was (reasonably takes 1 week, depending on tech writer workload):    1. prepare context
    2. create ticket to tech writers, wait until they respond
    3. discuss messaging over the call
    4. couple days later I get first draft
    5. iterate on draft, then finally publish it

Today its different:    1. I prepare all the context and style guide, then feed them into LLM.
    1.1. context is extracted directly from code by coding agents 
    2. I proofread it and 97% of cases accept it, because it follows the style guide and mostly transforms my context correctly into customer consumable content
    3. Done. less than 20 minutes

Tech writers were doing amazing job of course, but I can get 90-95% quality in 1% of the time spend for that work.

During the nineties of the last century I was still naive enough to believe that the great improvements in technology, i.e. the widespread availability of powerful word processors and the availability of the Internet for extremely cheap distribution will lead to an improvement in the quality of technical documentation and to easy access to it for everybody.The reverse has happened, the quality of the technical documentation has become worse and worse, with very rare exceptions, and the access to much of what has remained has become very restricted, either by requiring NDAs or by requiring very high prices (e.g. big annual fees for membership to some industry standards organization).A likely explanation for the worse and worse technical documentation is a reduction in the number of professional technical writers.It is very obvious that the current management of most big companies does not understand at all the value of competent technical writers and of good product documentation; not only for their customers and potential customers, but also for their internal R&D teams or customer support teams.I have worked for several decades at many companies, very big and very small, on several continents, but, unfortunately only at one of them the importance of technical documentation was well understood by the management, therefore the hardware and software developers had an adequate amount of time planned for writing documentation in their schedules for product development. Despite the fact that the project schedules at that company appeared to allocate much more time for ""non-productive tasks"" like documentation, than in other places, in reality it was there where the R&D projects were completed the fastest and with the least delays over the initially estimated completion time, one important factor being that every developer understood very well what must be done in the future and what has already been done and why.

At best there may have been a doubling of the speed, though something like +50% is much more likely.Between e.g. 1980 and 1995 the speed of writing documentation has increased much faster than the speed of writing programs has ever increased, due to the generalization of the use of word processors on personal computers, instead of using typewriting machines.Many software projects might be completed today much faster than in the past only when they do not start from zero, but they are able to reuse various libraries or program components from past projects, so the part that is actually written now is very small. Using an AI coding assistant does exactly the same thing, except that it automates the search through past programs and it also circumvents the copyright barriers that would prevent the reuse of programs in many cases.

This is not writing something new for scratch, but just using an already existing framework, with minor customization for the new project.Writing an essentially new program, which does something never accomplished before, proceeds barely faster today than what could be done in 1990, with a programming environment like those of Microsoft or Borland C/C++.

The technology is improving rapidly, and even now, with proper context, AI can write technical documentation extremely well. It can include clear examples (and only a very small number of technical writers know how to do that properly), and it can also anticipate and explain potential errors.

   The decision to stop hiring technical writers usually feels reasonable at the moment it's made. It does not feel reckless. It feels modern. Words have become cheap, and documentation looks like words. Faced with new tools that can produce fluent text on demand, it is easy to conclude that documentation is finally solved, or at least solved well enough.

   That conclusion rests on a misunderstanding so basic it's hard to see once you've stepped over it.

   Documentation is not writing. Writing is what remains after something more difficult has already happened. Documentation is the act of deciding what a system actually is, where it breaks, and what a user is allowed to rely on. It is not about describing software at its best, but about constraining the damage it can do at its worst.

   This is why generated documentation feels impressive and unsatisfying at the same time. It speaks with confidence, but never with caution. It fills gaps that should remain visible. It smooths over uncertainty instead of marking it. The result reads well and fails quietly.

   Technical writers exist to make that failure loud early rather than silent later. Their job is not to explain what engineers already know, but to notice what engineers have stopped seeing. They sit at the fault line between intention and behavior, between what the system was designed to do and what it actually does once released into the world. They ask the kinds of questions that slow teams down and prevent larger failures later.

   When that role disappears, nothing dramatic happens. The documentation still exists. In fact, it often looks better than before. But it slowly detaches from reality. Examples become promises. Workarounds become features. Caveats evaporate. Not because anyone chose to remove them, but because no one was responsible for keeping them.

   What replaces responsibility is process. Prompts are refined. Review checklists are added. Output is skimmed rather than owned. And because the text sounds finished, it stops being interrogated. Fluency becomes a substitute for truth.

   Over time, this produces something more dangerous than bad documentation: believable documentation. The kind that invites trust without earning it. The kind that teaches users how the system ought to work, not how it actually does. By the time the mismatch surfaces, it no longer looks like a documentation problem. It looks like a user problem. Or a support problem. Or a legal problem.

   There is a deeper irony here. The organizations that rely most heavily on AI are also the ones that depend most on high-quality documentation. Retrieval pipelines, curated knowledge bases, semantic structure, instruction hierarchies: these systems do not replace technical writing. They consume it. When writers are removed, the context degrades, and the AI built on top of it begins to hallucinate with confidence. This failure is often blamed on the model, but it is really a failure of stewardship.

   Responsibility, meanwhile, does not dissolve. When documentation causes harm, the model will not answer for it. The process will not stand trial. Someone will be asked why no one caught it. At that point, “the AI wrote it” will sound less like innovation and more like abdication.

   Documentation has always been where software becomes accountable. Interfaces can imply. Marketing can persuade. Documentation must commit. It must say what happens when things go wrong, not just when they go right. That commitment requires judgment, and judgment requires the ability to care about consequences.

   This is why the future that works is not one where technical writers are replaced, but one where they are amplified. AI removes the mechanical cost of drafting. It does not remove the need for someone to decide what should be said, what must be warned, and what should remain uncertain. When writers are given tools instead of ultimatums, they move faster not because they write more, but because they spend their time where it matters: deciding what users are allowed to trust.

   Technical writers are not a luxury. They are the last line of defense between a system and the stories it tells about itself. Without them, products do not fall silent. They speak freely, confidently, and incorrectly.

   Language is now abundant.
   Truth is not.

   That difference still matters.

We looked at documentation and thought, Ah yes. Words.

The problem is that documentation is where software stops flirting and starts making promises. And promises are where the lawsuits live.Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: technical writers are not paid to write. They are paid to be annoying in very specific, very expensive ways. They ask questions nobody likes. They slow things down. They keep pointing at edge cases like a toddler pointing at a dead bug going, “This too? This too?”Yes. Especially this too.When you replaced them with AI, nothing broke. Which is why you think this worked. The docs still shipped. They even looked better. Cleaner. Confident. Calm. That soothing corporate voice that says, “Everything is fine. You are holding it wrong.”And that's when the rot set in.Because AI does not experience dread. It does not wake up at 3 a.m. thinking, “If this sentence is wrong, someone is going to lose a week of their life.” It does not feel that tightening in the chest that tells a human writer, This paragraph is lying by omission.So it smooths. It resolves. It fills in gaps that should stay jagged. It confidently explains things no one actually understands yet. It does what bad managers do: it mistakes silence for agreement.Over time, your documentation stops describing reality and starts describing a slightly nicer alternate universe where the product behaves itself and nobody does anything weird.This is how you get users “misusing” your product in ways your own docs taught them.Then comes my favorite part.You notice the AI is hallucinating.

Only now it's worse, because it's invisible, fragmented, and no one knows who's responsible for it.Context curation is documentation.
Instruction hierarchies are documentation.
If your AI is dumb, it's because you fired the people who knew what the truth was supposed to look like.And don't worry, accountability did not get automated away while you weren't looking. When the docs cause real damage, the model will not be present. You cannot subpoena a neural net. You cannot fire a prompt. You will be standing there explaining that “the system generated it,” and everyone will hear exactly what that means.It means nobody was in charge.Documentation is where software admits the truth. Not the aspirational truth. The annoying truth. The truth about what breaks, what's undefined, what's still half-baked and kind of scary. Marketing can lie. Interfaces can hint.

Writers with AI are dangerous in the good way. AI without writers is dangerous in the other way. One produces clarity. The other produces confidence without consent.Technical writers are not a luxury. They are the people who stop your product from gaslighting its users.AI can generate language forever.Truth still needs a human with a little fear in their heart and a pen they're willing to hesitate with.Hire them back.

AI can write sentences all day. That's not the problem. The problem is that documentation is where software stops flirting and starts making promises. And promises are where the lawsuits live.Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: technical writers are not paid to write. They are paid to be annoying in very specific, very expensive ways. They ask questions nobody likes. They slow things down. They keep pointing at edge cases like a toddler pointing at a dead bug going, “This too? This too?”Yes. Especially this too.When you replaced them with AI, nothing broke. Which is why you think this worked. The docs still shipped. They even looked better. Cleaner. Confident. Calm. That soothing corporate voice that says, “Everything is fine. You are holding it wrong.”And that's when the rot set in.Because AI does not experience dread. It does not wake up at 3 a.m. thinking, “If this sentence is wrong, someone is going to lose a week of their life.” It does not feel that tightening in the chest that tells a human writer, This paragraph is lying by omission.So it smooths. It resolves. It fills in gaps that should stay jagged. It confidently explains things no one actually understands yet. It does what bad managers do: it mistakes silence for agreement.Over time, your documentation stops describing reality and starts describing a slightly nicer alternate universe where the product behaves itself and nobody does anything weird.This is how you get users “misusing” your product in ways your own docs taught them.Then comes my favorite part.You notice the AI is hallucinating. So you add tooling. Retrieval. Semantic layers. Prompt rules. Context hygiene. You hire someone with “AI” in their title to fix the hallucinations.What you are rebuilding, piece by piece, is technical writing. Only now it's worse, because it's invisible, fragmented, and no one knows who's responsible for it.Context curation is documentation.
Instruction hierarchies are documentation.
If your AI is dumb, it's because you fired the people who knew what the truth was supposed to look like.And don't worry, accountability did not get automated away while you weren't looking. When the docs cause real damage, the model will not be present. You cannot subpoena a neural net. You cannot fire a prompt. You will be standing there explaining that “the system generated it,” and everyone will hear exactly what that means.It means nobody was in charge.Documentation is where software admits the truth. Not the aspirational truth. The annoying truth. The truth about what breaks, what's undefined, what's still half-baked and kind of scary. Marketing can lie. Interfaces can hint. Documentation has to commit.Commitment requires judgment.
Judgment requires caring.

The parts about hallucinations and processes are also a bit dated. We're either at, or very close to the point where ""agentic"" stuff works in a ""GAN"" kind of way to ""produce docs"" -> read docs and try to reproduce -> resolve conflicts -> loop back, that will ""solve"" both hallucinations and processes, at least at the quality of human-written docs. My bet is actually better in some places. Bitter lesson and all that. (at least for 80% of projects, where current human written docs are horrendous. ymmv. artisan projects not included)What I do agree with is that you'll still want someone to hold accountable. But that's just normal business. This has been the case for integrators / 3rd party providers since forever. Every project requiring 3rd party people still had internal folks that were held accountable when things didn't work out. But, you probably won't need 10 people writing docs. You can hold accountable the few that remain.

Google returns the best result based on both it's calculations, and click history of what clicks were most successful for a search.LLM's don't really have that same response partially because it's strength is writing one sentence many different ways.  The many different ways to write a sentence doesn't mean it's the best way. If it can write deep sentences, keeping a coherent, connected arc through sentences and storiesLLMs' also generally return the ""best"" answer as the most ""common"" one, without weight towards outliers as easily that might be the most true, or the best.The definition of what is ""good"" and ""correct"" can also vary quite a bit, especially with writing.AI can be configured to look for patterns humans might not see, but we also know humans can see things and scenarios that LLM's aren't trained on and can miss getting to.As we can tell with AI copy, it all starts to sound the same even if it's new.

Why should I hire a dedicated writer if I have people with better understanding of the system? Also worth noting that like in any profession the most writers are... mediocre. Especially when you hire someone on contract. I had mostly bad experience with them in past. They happily charge $1000 for a few pages of garbage that is not even LLM-quality. No creativity, just pumping out words.I can chip in like $20 to pay some ""good writer"" that ""observes, listens and understands"" for writing documentation on something and compare it with LLM-made one.""Write a manual for air travel for someone who never flew. Cover topics like buying a ticket, preparing for travel, getting to airport, doing things in the airport, etc""Let's compare!

Many engineers are terrible at documentation, not just because they find it boring or cannot put it into words (that's the part an LLM could actually help with) but because they cannot tell what to document, what is unneeded detail, how best to address the target audience (or what is the profile of the target audience to begin with; something you can tell an LLM but which it cannot find on its own), etc, etc. The Fine Article goes into these nuances; it's the whole point of it.> ""Write a manual for air travel for someone who never flew.

There are plenty of people who can read code who don't work as devs. You could ask the same about testers, ops, sysadmins, technical support, some of the more technical product managers etc. These roles all have value, and there are people who enjoy them.Worth noting that the blog post isn't just about documenting code. There's a LOT more to tech writing than just that niche. I still remember the guy whose job was writing user manuals for large ship controls, as a particularly interesting example of where the profession can take you.

The other way around. For example the Python C documentation is full of errors and omissions where engineers described what they thought should happen. There is a documentation project that describes what actually happens (look in the index for ""Documentation Lacunae""): https://pythonextensionpatterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ind...

Also, the primary task of a tech writer isn't to document code. They're supposed to write tutorials, user guides, how to guides, explanations, manuals, books, etc.

My advise to tech writers would be to get really good at directing and orchestrating AI tools to do the heavy lifting of producing documentation. If you are stuck using content management systems or word processors, consider adopting a more code centric workflow. The AI tools can work with those a lot better. And you can't afford to be doing things manually that an AI does faster and better. Your value is making sure the right documentation gets written and produced correctly; correcting things that need correcting/perfecting. It's not in doing everything manually; you need to cherry pick where your skills still add value.Another bit of insight is that a lot of technical documentation now has AIs as the main consumer. A friend of mine who runs a small SAAS service has been complaining that nobody actually reads his documentation (which is pretty decent) and instead relies on LLMs to do that for them. The more documentation you have, the less people will read all of it. Or any of it.But you still need documentation. It's easier than ever to produce it. The quality standards for that documentation are high and increasing. There are very few excuses for not having great documentation.

My blog runs on Dotclear (a very good open source PHP+MySQL blog engine) with a homemade theme.My website runs on a hand written static site generator made of a Makefile and Bash scripts relying on the xml2 and 2xml commands, and coreutils in between them (especially sed). Those are automatically executed by a Git hook on my server to update the website on push. It's been like this since the beginning so I have the full history of my website's version back up to 2008 (I'm not even sure GitHub Pages were a thing back then!). It's fun to sometimes go back and see how it looked like almost 20 years ago.

This is probably a ""me"" problem for assuming otherwise (you even have HN in your URL), but it's not what I expected from a post asking people to share their personal websites.edit: judging by the number of personal website links posted here that do not meet that criteria, it appears I was not the only one with the wrong impression.

Yes, I was not entirely happy with the restrictive wording either.  The original requirement was added mainly out of concern about spam submissions (blogspam, AI-generated content and similar).  But the quality of submissions has been surprisingly good and I am genuinely delighted by the number of interesting websites I have came across in the last few hours.So I have gone ahead and removed the overly restrictive criteria language.> Was hoping it would be a way to stumble upon potentially underrepresented content from folks in the hacker news community who don't normally get attention.Yes, that was exactly my intention as well.  Thanks for raising this concern.  It gave me the push to update the README and make the intent clearer.

I mentioned in a sibling thread that this requirement was originally
added out of caution, mainly to discourage spam submissions. It no
longer seems necessary, and I was not entirely happy with it either,
so I have removed it now. Thanks for the discussion here, which prompted me to drop the restrictive requirement.

Everyone think of a number between 0~9, put it in a bracket (so that it's search-friendly), and add it to their post, e.g. ""[7] check out my example.com"".Readers of this thread are then encouraged to search for a random number between 0~9, search for it (e.g., ""[5]"") via browser, do a few ""find next"" (just to randomize), and then visit as many results as they enjoy.

https://wanderinglines.art/Context: I started from an existing Bootstrap gallery template and stripped it down to the bare minimum. The site is static with all the sorting and grouping done client-side. Images are just files in a folder, with metadata in a JSON file. Adding a new piece is just dropping in an image and updating the JSON. It's hosted on GitHub Pages with a cheap domain from Namecheap.

I'm a software architect with 23 years of professional experience, mainly in C#/.NET environments, and I currently lead a development team. Over the years, my focus has shifted from purely technical excellence to the human side of software development: communication, decision-making, responsibility, and sustainable performance.
In parallel to my tech career, I trained as a licensed psychological counsellor and supervisor in Austria, Vienna.
Today, I work with individuals and teams on topics like leadership, mental load, clarity in roles, burnout prevention, and turning reflection into action, especially in complex, high-responsibility environments such as software teams.
My work bridges structured engineering thinking with psychological depth and practical implementation.AMA!

I started my website in 2001, writing a lot of it, much of which is pretty embarrassing later in life, but I kept almost all of it. More often than not, I go back to read them and laugh.In some weird way, I also feel an obligation to keep them alive for as long as I can, so that the websites linking back to mine are not greeted with a 404. I cannot disappoint the likes of Wikipedia, USA Patents, quite a few other megacorps' websites, Russian and Chinese websites, and many others who trusted that I'm someone with a mark/presence on the Internet.

https://www.potluria.comI only have one blog post, it's effectively a host for my resume and there's a lot of work to do to make it nicer. For one, while I'm trying to convey an aesthetic with the three.js-powered background, it is _not_ performant on some devices. Choosing a SPA architecture in order to keep the background seamless is also biting me in the butt. From an SEO perspective, for example, I can't implement proper OpenGraph metadata on the blog posts since crawlers don't execute JS.I'm happy though. I'm excited to make it a long-lived shrine.

However: I don't see the innovative idea behind this yet-another-private-blog-directory. As you correctly mentioned: There's a list for that. And just putting this list into a browsable website seems like not the step that drives serendepity or value at all.Now people will add all their blogs, mainly to increase their reach. Fair enough. But what's the benefit for the reader?

Kind of a collection of rants, tools, and old projects... largely from before GitHub became a thing.My site's getting kind of old and creaky, but I update it from time to time.There's a fair number of articles that were ""I ran into this problem at work, so I wrote a blog post about how I fixed it"" we just had the amazing upside of having a link to send somebody when they run into the same problem. I've been told by coworkers that they found my posts googling their problems before.

I built a Q&A style blog about cruising, with an initial focus on Disney Cruise Line. We're heading out on our first family cruise, and I had a lot of very specific questions. LLM answers were usually close, but often missed important nuances, so I ended up digging through countless Reddit threads and forum posts to piece together reliable answers.I started collecting those answers for my own reference, which gradually turned into a public blog. The funny part is that the posts themselves will probably end up as training data for future LLMs, closing the loop.

If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.ioIf only there was a language that could run in all of our browsers, maybe even easily executable via some Quake-like console window that could open next to the website, that could just grab all visible URLs within some specific parts...

My submission of my then-new website got a little time on the front page: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12193273I have a bunch of notes for posts I started but haven't yet finished. The Predicaments of Old People seems important. A Medical Hack Job is about a young woman who couldn't afford the pills the ER doctors had prescribed her.There have been a few posts since K5 went away. 'False Prophecy' was about the time I became a false prophet. I'd forgotten all about this anecdote until the next time I went out to look at a lunar eclipse. https://www.taxiwars.org/2020/10/false-prophesy.html

Also, the guideline of 100+ total votes across five or fewer posts is not a strict rule. It exists mainly to discourage submissions that point to very thin sites with little or no content. I have already made exceptions when a website has interesting content even if it has never been posted on HN or received many upvotes.Also, a website shared today might not meet the 100+ votes guideline now but could meet it at some point in the future. That is another reason why all personal websites are welcome in this thread. Again, this is only a guideline, not a hard rule. If a site clearly meets the criteria, I can add it quickly and save time. If it does not, I will spend a bit more time checking that it is not spam and that it genuinely has something interesting to offer.

And encouraging 'Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely' but then saying you're discouraging submissions with little content etc. Who knows what people decided to put on their personal domains, ya know?Anyways, obviously a ton of ppl just threw in their urls here without much concern so it's up to you what you want to include. Onwards!

I would share my personal website which I owned for 25+ years, but AWS deregistered it because of $36.In case you use AWS as a registrar, be warned: If your account is ""closed"", they will release your domains. In other words, they make them available as if they were expired. Immediately.Short summary: I consolidated my domains at AWS years ago just to make it easier to manage everything from one spot. Earlier last year, my credit card I used for auto payments didn't have the $18 I pay for monthly costs. I didn't notice, until my email stopped working because my account was ""suspended"" due to non payment after a couple months.When AWS suspended the account, they turned off DNS routing which I managed from Route 53, so not only did my websites stop working, so did my email account (which had DNS entries to route to Gmail).So I went to log in to pay my bill, but in the time since I had last signed in, AWS had added two factor authentication.

But all the policy support that would have let North American automakers build up a competitive position with China is gone, so this is more about just acknowledging reality now.

As someone who's worked in the auto industry (in Canada) I have to 'hard disagree.' The big three have proven time and time again that we (Canadians) are second-class citizens when it comes to how they operate the facilities built here. Even before any of this nonsensical tariff nonsense, billions in government money has been given to the likes of Stellantis and GM over the years in an effort to keep jobs in Canada, with them putting in the bare-minimum effort to satisfy people in the short-term and thanking us by continuing their movement of production out of the country. Instead of trying to talk the president down from his pointlessly harmful tariffs, or doing what Toyota/Honda have done in pivoting to building worldwide models beside the domestic ones, the big three are gleefully taking the opportunity to expedite the closure or downsizing of facilities here.Outside of the chuds who 'need' a pickup truck to satisfy their fragile ego, sales of ""American"" vehicles are starting to drop, with buyers choosing domestically-produced where possible (like the Toyota Rav4, Lexus NX/RX, or Honda Civic/CR-V).[0][0]: https://ca.investing.com/news/economy-news/market-share-of-u...

This is patently false. The US could have competed with China if it had maintained investments spinning up battery manufacturing and downstream systems to build EVs at scale, while subsidizing EVs (fossil fuels are subsidized to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars per year [1]) and increasing taxes on combustion mobility.

(if you look at a random sampling of 100 cars, 5 will be from this year, 5 from 2025, and so on until you've counted the 5 cars from 2005 ; the average age will be 10.5 years)If you assume that there are more cars sold every year (due to demographics: way more humans are alive today than in 2005), then this is consistent with a useful lifespan of 25 years or more per car since the ""10.5"" average is skewed younger because of the age pyramid bias.

Its a dependency that I have to think almost all countries/businesses are evaluating.

Having their formally closest trade partner looking over to China for trade is a massive signal.The trade off is the market is large and strong financial (availability of capital) foundation - but I fear thats changing.

The U.S. has historically saved Europe from itself on multiple occasions, it saved South Korea from being a communist dictatorship, it saved China from being completely subdued by Japan, along with the rest of the pacific.It then helped to reestablish and rebuild Japan and Germany after WW2, it helped Canada's commonwealth the United Kingdom from certain disaster.China has never done anything like that in its multi-thousand year history.

Chinese car companies face far more ruthless competition than western ones so could end up making better cars as a result, imo.

This is these companies own fault. These companies have grown cozy rent seeking with little competition and have completely missed the electrification of cars as a result. Cheaper cars will hurt those workers, but all of society will be better off when one of their largest expenses decreases.

Musk and crew know how to make cheap stuff - they've chosen high margin for Tesla however.

TBH, Tesla is in a tough position with their EVs in NA. They can't really build a cheap enough crossover/suv to compete directly with ICE RAV4, and virtually anything they do at >$50k would negatively impact their existing product sales. The base Model 3/Y are too expensive compared to ICE and have met tepid reviews because of their slightly odd mix of price and features.So they've chosen instead to focus on autonomy and car hiring. I can't blame them for that. There's a huge potential for recurring revenue in that space and they've been positioning themselves to be in an excellent position to capture a lot of it over the next five years.

Vehicles imported under this provision that do not conform to U.S. safety and emission standards must be exported within one year and may not be sold in the U.S. There is no exemption or extension of the export requirements.There's certainly a question of if it's personal use if your canadian friend leaves their vehicle at your place and you drive it around.

What concerns me is why does the west think China is trustworthy? Why are we all fighting one another? Culture is important. China knows this, and is unequivocally Chinese relative to the Europeans.

reply

Let me be clear: here in Canada, the idea we are ever going to have anything like the same relationship with the United States again is held by a small and shrinking minority. And with every day, with the shit show that's happening down south, this becomes more true. The old adage is true, trust takes years to build and seconds to break.As for China, I doubt anyone among the Canadian leadership, and most people here, ""trusts"" China, but it has nothing to do with trust but with cold hard calculus of who we can sell our stuff to. China is a big market, and speaking of trust, China has not threatened us with annexation. Words matter, as do deeds.Culture is important, but has relatively little to do with geopolitics. Europe had thousands of years of shared history and values, and 2 world wars.

Per you GGP: China was previously considered untrustworthy, so its products tariffed to exclude them. It implies more trust if now those tariffs are being removed to allow them in.

Every Chinese business big enough to play at the global scale has the government in it's power structure. They don't necessarily dictate business decisions but every bit of data collected is by default accessible by the government.Having a significant fraction of a country driving around in Chinese EVs gives an insane amount of information to the Chinese government for free. It's not just direct information either like the driver's identity and personals, with millions of cars on the road a lot can be inferred, like if the parking lots at military bases suddenly fill up on a Tuesday afternoon or traffic between a high value person's home and an airport gets unusually slow.These correlation attacks are not just theoretical, Strava leaked the location and layout of a military base in Afghanistan, accidentally, by showing the most commonly jogged routes by users on their public map.These cars have cellular modems, they will have wifi and bluetooth hardware, if a particular person's device was identified at, for example, a political meeting or business conference then that person could be trivially tracked by the dozens of Chinese cars that they pass in a day. The information could be smuggled home along with all the normal diagnostic, update and service info that streams out of a modern car.This could be done today by the American government, and it is to some extent, to identify, and locate, protesters and criminals by their mobile devices but it takes time, access to equipment/logs that the government does not always own.And it may sound paranoid but remember that China was caught operating their own ""police"" force around the world not long ago, they will take advantage of any opportunity they are given to spy on other countries.

I had a wake up call on this yesterday. After a recent HN thread about Zed editor, I decided to give it another try, so I loaded it up, disabled AI, and tried writing some code from scratch. No AI completion, no intellisence. Two things came to mind. First, my editor seems so much more peaceful without being told what to do. Second, it was a bit scary how lost I felt. It was obvious that my own ability to communicate through code had declined a bit since I began using AI coding assistants. It turns out that as expected, coding assistants really are competitive cognitive artifacts. After that experience, I've decided that I am going to do at least part of my coding with all completions turned off. Unfortunately at work you are paid to produce quickly, so I think my AI free editor will have to be reserved for personal projects.Further related to your statement about thought, the hallucinations persist, and even last night I got a response about 80's pop culture that was over 50% bullshit.

I guess i'll start with calling two well known law professors ""$500 an hour nitpickers"" when they don't earn 500 an hour and have been professors for 15+ years (20+ in Jessica's case), so aren't earning anything close to 500 an hour, is not a great start?I don't know if they are nitpickers, i've never taken their classes :)Also, this is an op-ed, not a science paper.
Which you'd know if you had bothered to read it at all.You say elsewhere you didn't bother to read anything other than the abstract, because ""you didn't need to"", so besides being a totally uninformed opinion, complaining about something else being speculation when you are literally speculating on the contents of the paper is pretty ironic.I also find it amazingly humorous given that Jessica's previous papers on IP has been celebrated by HN, in part because she roughly believes copyright/patents as they currently exist are all glorified BS that doesn't help anything, and has written many papers as to why :)

1. It is entirely based on speculation of what is going to happen in the future.2. The authors have a clear financial (and status based) interest in the outcome.3. I have a negative opinion of lawyers and universities due to personal experience.  (This is, of course, the weakest point by far.)Speculation on future outcomes is not by itself a bad thing, but when that speculation is formatted like a scientific paper describing an experimental result I immediately feel I am being manipulated by appeal to authority.  And the conflict of interest of the authors is about as irrelevant as pointing out that a paper on why Oxycodone is not addictive is paid for by Perdue Pharma.  Perhaps Jessica's papers on IP are respected because they do not suffer from these obvious flaws?  I owe the author no deference for the quality of her previous writing nor for her status as a professor.

Law review articles look like this. Scientific journals don't own the concept of an abstract, nor are law review articles pretending to be scientific research.

Perhaps that's the point of the paper: to warn us not to use the technology in the dumbest possible way.

Worries about reduced quality of work are overblown, because there's always a human operator of the AI, reviewing the text between copying and pasting (no different from StackOverflow!).  Enter vibe-coding.Worries about AI becoming malicious or Skynet are overblown.  Again, it's just a text interface, so the worst it can do is to write text that says ""launch the nukes"".  Enter agents and MCP.It still staggers me that I occasionally read about a judge calling out a lawyer for citing non-existent cases (this far into chatgpt's life).  It was bound to happen to the first moron, but every other lawyer should have heard about it then.  But it still happens.Dumbest possible way is what we do.

One might say that deinstitutionalization is actually good for plurality of opinions (some call it a democracy). If AI cause it, I'm fine with that.

Pointing to a system with problems and then saying you have no issue with something that has the potential to be orders of magnitude more problematic seems an odd approach to me.

Can't tell if you're referring to media outlets or AI companies here.I do remember this incident - it was an embarrassment for the outlets that jumped on that story. Especially because the general public has come to know there is a overriding tendency towards sensationalism.But surely this is very different from actual outright propaganda operations?

On the other hand when countries feel the need to legislate a new law enforcing writing documents in the human understandable language, one doesn't need to be an expert to suspect there was a systemic rot in those industries. It is totally valid to cry foul when even a parliament is concerned about about reading texts they produce for 500$/h.https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/946https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2022/0054/latest/...

You can criticise the hourly cost of lawyers all you like, and it should be a beautiful demonstration to people like you that no, ""high costs means more people go into the profession and lower the costs"" is not and has never been a reality. But to think that any AI could ever be efficient in a system such common law, the most batshit insane, inefficient, ""rethoric matters more than logic"" system is delusional.

2. Get owned out of court because you couldn't afford the $100K (minimum) that you have to pay to the lawyer's cartel to even be able to make your argument in front of a judge.I'll take number 1.  At least you have a fighting chance.  And it's only going to get better.  LLMs today are the worst they will ever be, whereas the lawyer's cartel rarely gets better and never cuts its prices.

I also used to maintain up to date reading lists of various areas (compiler optimization, for example) because I would read so many of the papers.Let me give you a piece of advice:First, gather facts, then respond.Here you start by sarcastically asserting i wouldn't have read it, but it would generally be better to ask if i read it (fact gathering), and then devise a response based on my answer.  Because your assertion is simply wrong, making the rest of it even sillier.As for the strawman about the bible - i'm kinda surprised you are really trying to equate not reading any part of something with not reading every part of something, and really trying to defend what you did here, instead of just owning up to it and moving on.This speaks a lot more about you than anything else.That said -When you make a claim covering that everything in a book is the literal truth, you only have to find a part that is not the literal truth to prove the claim wrong. Which may or may not require reading the entire thing to start (if it turns out your counter-claim is wrong, you at least have to read and find another)In the original comment, you'll note your claim was ""This is nothing but speculation"" - IE all of the paper is speculation.If we are being accurate, this would require you reading the entire thing to be able to say all of it is speculation.  How could you know otherwise?Even if we were being nice, and treat your claim colloquially as meaning ""most of it is speculation"", this would still require reading some of the paper, which you didn't do either.Perhaps you should just quit while you are behind, and learn that when you screw up, the correct thing to do is say ""yeah, i screwed up, i should have read it before saying that"", instead of trying to double down on it.Doubling down like this just makes you look worse.As an aside - I was always an avid reader, and very bored in synagogue, so i have read every word of a number of books of the hebrew bible because it was more interesting than paying attention to the sermons.

when one of the juniors makes a mistake, i can talk to them about it and help them understand where they went wrong, if they continue to make mistakes we can change their position to something more suited for them. we can always let them go if they have too much hubris to learn.who do we hold to account when a model makes a mistake?  we're already beginning to see, after major fuckups, companies blackhole nullrouting accountability into “not our fault, don't look at us, ai was wrong”the other thing is, if you have done a good job selecting your team, you'll have people who understand their limits, who understand when to ask for help, who understand when they don't know something.  a major problem with current models is that it will always just guess or stretch toward random rather than halt.so yes, people will make mistakes, but at least you can count on being able to mitigate for those after.

First we stop anthromorphising the program as capable of making a ""mistake"". We recognise it merely as machine providing incorrect output, so we see the only mistake was made by the human who chose to rely upon it.The courts so far agree. Judges are punishing the gulled lawyers rather than their faux-intelligent tools.

It generated some really nice documentation.The difference is, I (as a team member) now have the understanding. Generating the documentation does not increase the understanding of the team.

> They (AI systems) delegitimization knowledge, inhibit cognitive development, short-circuit long term thinking processes, and isolate humans by displacing or degrading long term human connection.This is a pretty good summary of the worry I've seen expressed about extensive use to build large pieces of software. Large pieces of software aren't just the code that describes them. They exist in some sense in their authors as well.Effective projects seek to expand understanding of software systems across the organization so that relevant decisions can be made about their future. By relegating much of the decision making around structure of the software to AI you lose the systemic knowledge shared across the organization.

Similarly, today's critics, often from within the very institutions they defend, frame AI as a threat to ""expertise"" and ""civic life"" when in reality, they fear it as a threat to their own status as the sole arbiters of truth. Their resistance is less a principled defense of democracy and more a desperate attempt to protect a crumbling monopoly on knowledge.

reply

More like a war on the traditional, human-based knowledge, leveraged by people who believe that via coveting the world's supply of RAM, SSDs, GPUs, and what not, can achieve their own monopoly on knowledge under the pretense of liberating it. Note that running your own LLM becomes impossible if you can no longer afford the hardware to run it on.

Not all of them, but given the same questionable or outright false assumptions (e.g. AI companies are doing interference at a loss, the exaggerated water consumption number, etc) keeping getting repeated on YouTube, Reddit and even HN where the user base is far more tech-savvy than the population, I think misinformation is the primary reason.

The linguists who call AI a ""stochastic parrot"" are the perfect example. Their panic isn't for the public good; it's the existential terror of seeing a machine master language without needing their decades of grammatical theory. They are watching their entire intellectual paradigm—their very claim to authority—be rendered obsolete.This isn't a grassroots movement. It's an immune response from the cognitive elite, desperately trying to delegitimize a technology that threatens to trivialize their expertise. They aren't defending society; they're defending their status.

It's some wild claim. Every linguist worth their salt had known that you don't need grammatical theory to reach native level. Grammar being descriptive rather than prescriptive is the mainstream idea and had been long before LLM.If you actually ask them, I bet most linguists will say they are not even excellent English (or whichever language they studied the most) teachers.Plus, ""stochastic parrot"" was coined before ChatGPT. If linguists really felt that threatened by the time when people's concerns over AI was like ""sure it can beat go master but how about league of legends?"" you have to admit they did have some special insights, right?

His central argument has always been that language is too complex and nuanced to be learned simply from exposure. Therefore, he concluded, humans must possess an innate, pre-wired ""language organ""—a Universal Grammar.LLMs are a spectacular demolition of that premise. They prove that with a vast enough dataset, complex linguistic structure can be mastered through statistical pattern recognition alone.The panic from Chomsky and his acolytes isn't that of a humble linguist. It is the fury of a high priest watching a machine commit the ultimate heresy: achieving linguistic mastery without needing his innate, god-given grammar.

It really isn't. While I personally think the Universal Grammar theory is flawed (or at least Chomsky's presentation is flawed), LLM doesn't debunk it.Right now we have machines that recognized faces better than humans. But it doesn't mean humans do not have some innate biological ""hardware"" for facial recognition that machines don't possess. The machines simply outperform the biological hardware with their own different approach.Also, I highly recommend you express your ideas with your own words instead of letting an LLM present them. It's painfully obvious.

I have learned one foreign language just by being exposed to it almost daily, by watching movies spoken in that language, without using any additional means, like a dictionary or a grammar (because none were available where I lived; this was before the Internet). However, I have been helped in guessing the meaning of the words and the grammar of the language, not only by seeing what the characters of the movie were doing, correlated to the spoken phrases, but also by the fact that I knew a couple of languages that had many similarities with the language of the movies that I was watching.In any case, the amount of the spoken language to which I had been exposed for a year or so, until becoming fluent in it, had been many orders of magnitudes less than what is used by a LLM for training.I do not know whether any innate knowledge of some grammar was involved, but certainly the knowledge of the grammar of other languages had helped tremendously in reducing the need for being exposed to greater amounts of text, because after seeing only a few examples I could guess the generally-applicable grammar rules.There is no doubt that the way by which a LLM learns is much dumber than how a human learns, which is why this must be compensated by a much bigger amount of training data.Seeing how the current inefficiency of LLM training has already caused serious problems for a great number of people, who either had to give up on buying various kinds of electronic devices or they had to accept to buy devices of a much worse quality than previously desired and planned, because the prices for DRAM modules and for big SSDs have skyrocketed, due to the hoarding of memory devices by the rich who hope to become richer by using LLMs, I believe that it has been proven beyond doubt that the way how LLMs learn, for now, is not good enough and it is certainly not a positive achievement, as more people have been hurt by it than the people who have benefited from it.

You read the works of the cognitive elite, when they support AI.

The more complex the realm, the deeper the expertise to find value in it.Secondly, linguists are not the sole group espousing the concerns with these tools. I've seen rando streamers and normal folk in WhatsApp groups, completely disconnected from the AI elite hating what is being wrought. Students and young adults outright wonder if they will have any worthwhile economic future.Perhaps it is not a “movement”, but there is an all pervasive fear and concern in the population when it comes to AI.Finally, position is eerily similar to the dismissal of concerns from mid level and factory floor job workers in the 80s and 90s. It was forgivable given the then prevalent belief that people would be retrained and reabsorbed into equivalently sustaining roles in other new industries.

Martin Luther used it to spread his influence extremely quickly for example. Similarly, the clergy used new innovations in book layout and writing to spread Christianity across Europe a thousand years before that.What is weird about LLMs though, is that it isn't a simple catalyst of human labor. The printing press or the internet can be used to spread information quickly that you have previously compiled or created. These technologies both have a democratizing effect and have objectively created new opportunities.But LLMs are to some degree parasitical to human labor. I feel like their centralizing effect is stronger than their democratizing one.

Wanted to show our open source agent harness called Gambit.If you're not familiar, agent harnesses are sort of like an operating system for an agent... they handle tool calling, planning, context window management, and don't require as much developer orchestration.Normally you might see an agent orchestration framework pipeline like:compute -> compute -> compute -> LLM -> compute -> compute -> LLMwe invert this so with an agent harness, it's more like:LLM -> LLM -> LLM -> compute -> LLM -> LLM -> compute -> LLMEssentially you describe each agent in either a self contained markdown file, or as a typescript program. Your root agent can bring in other agents as needed, and we create a typesafe way for you to define the interfaces between those agents.

If you're not familiar, agent harnesses are sort of like an operating system for an agent... they handle tool calling, planning, context window management, and don't require as much developer orchestration.Normally you might see an agent orchestration framework pipeline like:compute -> compute -> compute -> LLM -> compute -> compute -> LLMwe invert this so with an agent harness, it's more like:LLM -> LLM -> LLM -> compute -> LLM -> LLM -> compute -> LLMEssentially you describe each agent in either a self contained markdown file, or as a typescript program.

How would it compare?

I look at Gambit as more of an ""agent harness"", meaning you're building agents that can decide what to do more than you're orchestrating pipelines.Basically, if we're successful, you should be able to chain agents together to accomplish things extremely simply (using markdown). Mastra, as far as I'm aware, is focused on helping people use programming languages (typescript) to build pipelines and workflows.So yes it's an alternative, but more like an alternative approach rather than a direct competitor if that makes sense.

What helped was treating agents less like “always-on brains” and more like short-lived executors. Each step had an explicit goal, explicit inputs, and a defined end. Once the step finished, the agent stopped and context was rebuilt deliberately.Harnesses like this feel important because they shift the problem from “make the model smarter” to “make the system more predictable.” In our experience, reliability came more from reducing degrees of freedom than from adding intelligence.

My philosophy is make the LLMs do as little work as possible. Only small, simple steps. Anything that can be reasonably done in code (orchestration, tool calls, etc) should be done in code. Basically any time you find yourself instructing an LLM to follow a certain recipe, just break it down to multiple agents and do what you can with code.

reply

Gambit hopefully solves some of  that, giving you a set of primitives and principles that make it simpler to communicate intent.

Anything you'd like to share? I did some research within the realm of classic robotic-like planning ([1]) and the results were impressive with local LLMs already a year ago, to the point that obtaining textual descriptions for complex enough problems became the bottleneck, suggesting that prompting is of limited use when you could describe the problem in Prolog concisely and directly already, given Prolog's NLP roots and one-to-one mapping of simple English sentences. Hence that report isn't updated to GLM 4.7, Claude whatever, or other ""frontier"" models yet.[1]: https://quantumprolog.sgml.net/llm-demo/part1.html

I think much of the frustration with older tech like this comes from the fact that these things were mostly written(and rewritten till perfection) on paper first and only the near-end program was input into a computer with a keyboard.Modern ways of carving out a program with 'Successive Approximations' with a keyboard and monitor until you get to something to work is mostly a recent phenomenon. Most of us are used to working like this. Which quite honestly is mostly trial and error. The frustration is understandable because you are basically throwing darts, most of the times in the dark.I knew a programmer from the 1980s who(built medical electronics equipment) would tell me how even writing C worked back then. It was mostly writing a lot, on paper. You had to prove things on paper first.

The frustration is understandable because you are basically throwing darts, most of the times in the dark.I knew a programmer from the 1980s who(built medical electronics equipment) would tell me how even writing C worked back then. It was mostly writing a lot, on paper. You had to prove things on paper first.

I very much agree with this, especially since Prolog's execution model doesn't seem to go that well with the ""successive approximations"" method.

One can imagine how development would work in a ecosystem like that. You have to understand both the problem, and your solution, and you need to be sure it would work before you start typing it out at a terminal.This the classic Donald Knuth workflow. Like he is away disconnected from a computer for long periods of time, focussed on the problems and solutions, and he is working them out on paper and pen. Until he has arrived solutions that just work, correctly. And well enough to be explained in a text book.When you take this away. You also take away the need to put in hard work required to make things work correctly. Take a look at how many Java devs are out there who try to use a wrong data structure for the problem, and then try to shoe horn their solution to roughly fit the problem. Eventually solution does work for some acceptable inputs, and remainder is left to be discovered by an eventual production bug. Stackoverflow is full of such questions.Languages like Prolog just don't offer that sort of freedom. And you have to be in some way serious about what you are doing in terms of truly understanding both the problem and solution well enough to make them work.

Its not iterative refinement which is bad. Its just that when you use a keyboard a thinking device, there is a tendency to assume the first trivially working solution to be completely true.This is doesn't happen with pen and paper as it slows you down. You get mental space to think through a lot of things, exceptions etc etc. Until even with iterative refinement you are likely to build something that is correct compared to just committing the first typed function to the repo.

Heck, even the SWI-Prolog codbase itself is quite approachable!I'm also mildly surprised at some of OG's gripes. A while back, I ran through Triska's The Power of Prolog[0], which crisply grounds Prolog's mental model and introduces standard conventions. In particular, it covers desugaring syntax into normal predicates, e.g. -/2 as pairs, [,]/2 as special syntax for ./2 cons cells, etc. Apparently, I just serendipitously stumbled into good pedagogical resources!I'd be interested in ways that people utilize logical programming concepts and techniques into non-LP languages.[0]:https://www.metalevel.at/prolog

The reason Prolog doesn't support trailing commas is exactly the same reason JSON doesn't support trailing commas: the language is designed to be parsed by an operator precedence parser, and the comma is an infix operator.The fact that Prolog is a purely operator precedence syntax, with a dynamic operator table, allows you to build DSLs embedded in Prolog. CLP(FD) uses this to create the #= operator.

Prolog is also unusual in a sense that it is essential to understand what the interpreter does with your code in order to be able to write it well. For vanilla Prolog, that's not so hard. However, when constraint programming and other extensions are added, that becomes much harder to do.

reply

My understanding is that they have very different evaluation strategies, bottom up vs top down. But with laziness and pruning you can still achieve the same goals in datalog with more ergonomics, right?I think every language should have a prolog or datalog implementation, kind of like regex.

By which I mean there are Datalogs that look like Prolog a bit, and others that don't. And things that are ""Datalogs"" that don't even have their own PL but instead more of an API. And no standard at all.

There were only two prevalent attitudes, some of us really loved FP (me included), others hated it and could hardly wait to get it done.Somehow there was a similar overlap with those of us that enjoyed going out of mainstream languages, and those that rather stay with Pascal and C.

It's all the other programming languages that have weird syntax, including LISP btw. Prolog's syntax is the quintessential syntax of a formal language for computation.As to the ""data description"" part this is just a leaky abstraction almost universally adopted by programming languages, other than LISPs and logic programming languages. In truth, there is no separation between data and computation. And so there is no need for special syntax for either. Prolog is a ""data description"" language only in the sense that you can describe data and computation in one go.

Just kidding. Some of those are stylistic choices I don't have gripes but can understand the criticism. There is however one thing about ""Non-cuts are confusing"" I'd like to clarify:In this example:    foo(A, B) :-
      \+ (A = B),
      A = 1,
      B = 2.

It's very obvious why it fails and it has nothing to do with non-cut. Let's say A can be apple and B can be orange and now you're asking Prolog to compare apples to oranges! ;)In short one has to ""hint"" Prolog what A and B can be so then it can ""figure out"" whethever comparison can be made and what is its result. Assuming there exist is_number(X) clause that can instantiate X as a number following would work just fine:    foo(A, B) :-
      is_number(A),
      is_number(B),
      \+ (A = B),
      A = 1,
      B = 2.

(note that this would be stupid and very slow clause. Instantiation in such clauses like is_number(X) usually starts with some defined bounds. For A = 10000, B = 10001 and lower bound of 1 pessimistic case this clause would require 100M checks!

You can't do length + 1 as a single expression in any language though, in python for example len(ls) + 1 is two expressions, but I get what you mean, it is a little less terse. But those commas in prolog are super useful. And you can make your example bidirectional too:```

    length(List, Out),
    X #= Out + 1.

-----No standarized collection types:I think that's a feature rather than a bug. The ability to just use infix and compound terms in a generic way without it being tied to a clause or operator is a huge feature. For example:```
pets(dog-rex-poodle, dog-fluffy-bishon).
```That defines the collection in a semantic or mathematical sort of way, then you can pass that into whatever data structure you want, whether it's a ordered map or a hashmap or whatever.----No boolean values:That's also a feature in prolog, same as having no null.

The thing to keep in mind is that Prolog borrows its syntax and semantics from (a fragment of) First Order Logic, and that's where its treatment of functions comes from. In FOL there's a concept of a ""term"": a variable is a term, a constant is a term, and a function symbol followed by one or more comma-separated terms in parentheses is a term. So if f is a function symbol, f(X,a(b), c) is a term, where X is a variable (in Prolog notation where variables start with capital letters or _). Terms are mapped to functions over objects in the domain of discourse by a pre-interpretation (long story). Terms are arguments to atomic formulae which look exactly like terms with one or more arguments, except they have predicate symbols rather than function symbols, so if p is a predicate symbol, then p(f(X,a(b), c), d, 1, 2, 3) is an atomic formula, or atom.There's a bit of terminological confusion here because Prolog calls everything a ""term"", including atomic formulae, and it calls its constants ""atoms"", but, well, you learn to deal with it.The difference between terms (in both Prolog and FOL) and functions (in most programming languages) is that terms are not evaluated and they are not replaced by their values. Rather, during execution of a Prolog program, variables in a term are bound to values, by unification, and when execution is over, if you've got all your ducks in a row, all variables in your program should be bound to some term with no variables, and all terms be ""ground"" (i.e. have no variables).That's because a ground term is essentially a proposition, and so it has a truth value of true or false. The point of FOL and of Prolog, and every other logic programming language is to carry out a proof of a theorem, expressed as a logic program. If a term has variables we can't know its truth value because it may correspond to a different value of a function, depending on the values of its variables. So to know the truth or falsehood of a term we need to ground it. Unification in Prolog is a dirty hack that allows the proof to proceed without fully grounding terms, until the truth of an entire theorem is known, at which point everything becomes ground (or should be ... more or less, it depends).ASP (Answer Set Programming) instead starts by grounding every term. Then, it basically treats a logic program as a SAT formula and uses a SAT-solver to find its truth or falsehood (it does more than that: it gives you all models of the theorem, i.e. every set of ground atoms that makes it true).And that's where the tiger got its stripes. Don't expect Prolog (or ASP for that matter) to work like other languages, it has its own semantics. You don't have to like them, but there's a reason why everything is the way it is.

It's perfectly fine to not like Prolog, but I do feel that if you're going to write an article about why you don't like it, you should at least spend some time figuring it out first.He says of the cut operator ""This is necessary for optimization but can lead to invalid programs."" Imagine if a programmer new to C++ said the same thing of the ""break"" keyword. That's how ridiculous it sounds. Yes, cut can be used to prune backtracking and eliminate unneeded work, but that's hardly it's purpose. It leads to ""invalid"" programs (by which I assume he means, programs that do something other than what he wants) only in cases where you are using it wrong. Cut is no more ""necessary for optimization"" than break is. It's a control structure that you don't understandNegation (\+) is confusing, and the author correctly provides examples where its meaning is unintuitive when applied to unbound variables. That's because it's not strictly speaking a negation predicate, but rather a ""not provable"" predicate. In that light, the examples in the article make perfect sense. Yes, Prolog is a programming language, so the order of terms matter, even if the order wouldn't matter in pure logic.Look, Prolog is a weird language. It has a learning curve. It's not ""just another language"" in the Java, C++, Pascal, Python mold. I get it. But this article has the flavor of an impatient newbie getting frustrated because he can't be bothered to read the documentation.

Open any Prolog programming textbook (Clocksin & Mellish, Bratko, Sterling & Shapiro, O'Keefe, anything) and the first thing you learn about Prolog is that ""code logic"" is expressed in facts and rules, and that Prolog predicates don't ""return"" anything.The confusion only deepens after that. There are no boolean values? In an untyped language? Imagine that. true/0 and false/0 are not values? In a language where everything is a predicate? Imagine that. Complete lack of understanding that ""="" is a unification operator, and that unification is not assignment, like, really, it's not, it's not just a fancy way to pretend you don't do assignment while sneaking it in by the backdoor to be all smug and laugh at the noobs who aren't in the in-group, it's unification, it doesn't work as you think it should work if you think it should work like assignment because everything is immutable so you really, really don't need assignment. Complete misunderstanding of the cut, and its real dangers, complete misunderstanding of Negation as Failure, a central concept in logic programming (including in ASP) and so on and so on and so on and on.The author failed to do due diligence.

  The original example in the last section was this:

  foo(A, B) :-
      \+ (A = B),
      A = 1,
      B = 2.

  foo(1, 2) returns true, so you'd expect f(A, B) to return A=1, B=2. But it returns false.


foo(A,B) fails because \+(A = B) fails, because A = B succeeds. That's because = is not an assignment but a unification, and in the query foo(A,B), A and B are variables, so they always unify.In fact here I'm not sure whether the author expects = to work as an assignment or an equality. In \+(A = B) they seem to expect it to work as an equality, but in A = 1, B = 2, they seem to expect it to work as an assignment. It is neither.I appreciate unification is confusing and takes effort to get one's head around, but note that the author is selling a book titled LOGIC FOR PROGR∀MMERS (in small caps) so they should really try to understand what the damn heck this logic programming stuff is all about. The book is $30.

Fair enough. I believe this is a variation of Cunningham's Law, which states ""the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.""Everything you wrote about backtracking is completely correct. If I may paraphrase, it boils down to: cut can be used to avoid executing unnecessary code, but using it the wrong place will avoid executing necessary code, and that would be bad. My point is: the same could be said about the ""break"" keyword in C++: it can avoid unnecessary iterations in a loop, or it can exit a loop prematurely. Cut and break are both control structures which make sense in the context of their respective languages, but neither would be accurately described as ""for optimization.""

That's right, but missing valid solutions doesn't mean that your program is ""invalid"", whatever that means. The author doesn't say.Cuts are difficult and dangerous. The danger is that they make your program behave in unexpected ways. Then again, Prolor programs behave in unexpected ways even without the cut, and once you understand why, you can use the cut to make them behave.In my experience, when one begins to program in Prolog, they pepper their code with cuts to try and stop unwanted bactracking, which can often be avoided by understanding why Prolog is backtracking in the first place. But that's a hard thing to get one's head around, so everyone who starts out makes a mess of their code with the cut.There are very legitimate and safe ways to use cuts. Prolog textbooks sometimes introduce a terminology of ""red"" and ""green"" cuts. Red cuts change the set of answers found by a query, green cuts don't. And that, in itself, is already hard enough to get one's head around.At first, don't use the cut, until you know what you're doing, is I think the best advice to give to beginner Prolog programmers.

Then again, Prolor programs behave in unexpected ways even without the cut, and once you understand why, you can use the cut to make them behave.In my experience, when one begins to program in Prolog, they pepper their code with cuts to try and stop unwanted bactracking, which can often be avoided by understanding why Prolog is backtracking in the first place. But that's a hard thing to get one's head around, so everyone who starts out makes a mess of their code with the cut.There are very legitimate and safe ways to use cuts. Prolog textbooks sometimes introduce a terminology of ""red"" and ""green"" cuts. Red cuts change the set of answers found by a query, green cuts don't. And that, in itself, is already hard enough to get one's head around.At first, don't use the cut, until you know what you're doing, is I think the best advice to give to beginner Prolog programmers.

This gets to the heart of my problem with Prolog: it's sold as if it's logic programming - just write your first-order predicate logic and we'll solve it. But then to actually use it you have to understand how it's executed - ""understanding why Prolog is backtracking in the first place"".At that point, I would just prefer a regular imperative programming language, where understanding how it's executed is really straightforward, combined with some nice unification library and maybe a backtracking library that I can use explicitly when they are the appropriate tools.

Prolog is a logic-flavored programming language. I don't recall Prolog ever being ""sold"" as pure logic. More likely, an uninformed person simply assumed that Prolog used pure logic.Complaining that Prolog logic doesn't match mathematical logic is like complaining that C++ objects don't accurately model real-life objects.

Prolog isn't ""sold"" as a logic programming language. It is a logic programming language. Like, what else is it?I have to be honest and say I've heard this criticism before and it's just letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. The criticism is really that Prolog is not a 100% purely declarative language with 100% the same syntax and semantics as First Order Logic.Well, it isn't, but if it was, it would be unusable. That would make the critics very happy, or at least the kind of critics that don't want anyone else to have cool stuff, but in the current timeline we just have a programming language that defines the logic programming paradigm, so it makes no sense to say it isn't a logic programming language.Edit:>> At that point, I would just prefer a regular imperative programming language, where understanding how it's executed is really straightforward, combined with some nice unification library and maybe a backtracking library that I can use explicitly when they are the appropriate tools.Yeah, see what I mean? Let's just use Python, or Java, or C++ instead, which has 0% of FOL syntax and semantics and is 0% declarative (or maybe 10% in the case of C++ templates). Because we can't make do with 99% logic-based and declarative, gosh no. Better have no alternative than have a less than absolutely idealised perfect ivory tower alternative.Btw, Prolog's value is its SLD-Resolution based interpretation. Backtracking is an implementation detail. If you need backtracking use yield or whatever other keyword your favourite imperative language gives you. As to unification, good luck with a ""nice unification library"" for other languages. Most programmers can't even get their head around regexes. And good luck convincing functional programmers that ""two-way pattern matching"" (i.e. unification) is less deadly than the Bubonic Plague.

Ohhh, interesting. So a green cut is basically what I described as cutting branches you know are a waste of time, and red cuts are the ones where you're wrong and cut real solutions?> At first, don't use the cut, until you know what you're doing, is I think the best advice to give to beginner Prolog programmers. And to advanced ones sometimes. I've seen things...Yeah, I'm wondering how much of this is almost social or use-case in nature?E.g., I'm experimenting with Prolog strictly as a logic language and I experiment with (at a really novice level) things like program synthesis or model-to-model transformations to emulate macro systems that flow kind of how JetBrains MPS handles similar things. I'm basically just trying to bend and flex bidirectional pure relations (I'm probably conflating fp terms here) because it's just sort of fun to me, yeah?So cut _feels_ like something I'd only use if I were optimizing and largely just as something I'd never use because for my specific goals, it'd be kind of antithetical--and also I'm not an expert so it scares me. Basically I'm using it strictly because of the logic angle, and cut doesn't feel like a bad thing, but it feels like something I wouldn't use unless I created a situation where I needed it to get solutions faster or something--again, naively anyway.Whereas if I were using Prolog as a daily GP language to actually get stuff done, which I know it's capable of, it makes a lot of sense to me to see cut and `break` as similar constructs for breaking out of a branch of computation that you know doesn't actually go anywhere?I'm mostly spit-balling here and could be off base. Very much appreciate the response, either way.

Basically, yes, except it's not necessarily ""wrong"", just dangerous because it's tempting to use it when you don't really understand what answers you're cutting. So you may end up cutting answers you'd like to see after all. The ""red"" is supposed to signify danger. Think of it as red stripes, like.Which make stuff go faster too (well, a little bit). So, yeah, cuts in general help the compiler/interpreter optimise code execution. I however use it much more for its ability to help me control my program. Prolog makes many concessions to efficiency and usability, and the upshot of this is you need to be aware of its idiosyncrasies, the cut being just one of them.>> Whereas if I were using Prolog as a daily GP language to actually get stuff done, which I know it's capable of, it makes a lot of sense to me to see cut and `break` as similar constructs for breaking out of a branch of computation that you know doesn't actually go anywhere?Cuts work like breaks sometimes, but not always. To give a clear example of where I always use cuts, there's a skeleton you use when you want to process the elements of a list that looks like this:  list_processing([], Bind, Bind):-
    !. % <-- Easiest way to not backtrack once the list is empty.

  list_processing([X|Xs], ..., Acc, Bind, ... ):-
     condition(X)
     ,! % Easiest way to not fall over to the last clause.
     ,process_a(X,Y)
    ,list_processing(Xs, ..., [Y|Acc], Bind, ... ).

  list_processing([X|Xs], ..., Acc, Bind, ... ):-
     process_b(X,Y)
    ,list_processing(Xs, ..., [Y|Acc], Bind, ... ).

So, the first cut is a green cut because it doesn't change the set of answers your program will find, because once the list in the first argument is empty, it's empty, there's no more to process. However, Prolog will leave two choice points behind, for each of the other two clauses, because it can't know what you're trying to do, so it can't just stop because it found an empty list.The second cut is technically a red cut: you'd get more answers if you allowed both process_a and process_b to modify your list's elements, but the point is you don't want that, so you cut as soon as you know you only want process_a. So this is forcing a path down one branch of search, not quite like a break (nor a continue).You could also get the same behaviour without a cut, by e.g. having a negated condition(X) check in the last clause and also checking that the list is not empty in every other clause (most compilers are smart enough to know that means no more choice points are needed), but, why? All you gain this way is theoretical purity, and more verbose code. I prefer to just cut there and get it done. Others of course disagree.

I, too, am a big fan of prolog and have (at least) yearly binges where I write a lot of it for fun and profit (and some frustration), but I do not consider myself to be an expert. But even I can see that the author has what I would consider a pretty basic understanding of prolog. Which makes it even more surprising they are writing a book that uses prolog.

reply

IMO it would be better to have something like Prolog as part of a 
""better designed"" language per se. I can't come up with a good 
proposal myself - language design is hard, including syntax design -
but imagine if Prolog would be a part of python. That feature would
then be used by more people. (This is just an example; just randomly
creeping in features into a more successful language, also often won't
work. I am just giving this as an example that MIGHT be better.)

Count yourself lucky you (probably) learned programming in a language like Java or Python, and not, say, FORTRAN. Because then you'd really pray for the simplicity and elegance of definite clauses.(Or not. FORTRAN programmers can write FORTRAN in any language, even FORTRAN).

In that case I won't try to correct any of the author's misconceptions, but I'll advise anyone reading the article to not take anything the author says seriously because they are seriously confused and have no idea what they're talking about.Sorry to be harsh, but it seems to me the author is trying their damnedest best to misunderstand everything ever written about Prolog, and to instead apply entirely the wrong abstractions to it. I don't want to go into the weeds, since the author doesn't seem ready to appreciate that, but Prolog isn't Python, or Java, or even Picat, and to say e.g. that Prolog predicates ""return true or false"" is a strong hint that the author failed to read any of the many textbooks on Prolog programming, because they all make sure to drill into you the fact that Prolog predicates don't ""return"" anything because they're not functions. And btw, Prolog does have functions, but like I say, not going into the weeds.Just stay away. Very misinformed article.

A 20-year-old man's switch to the keto diet dramatically changed his body—just not in the way anyone would have expected.

Doctors writing in this week's New England Journal of Medicine detailed how the man developed a rare skin condition often caused by switching to keto, one that covered his neck and chest in itchy rashes. Despite the alarming symptoms, the condition is readily treatable, provided the person can be convinced to stop their diet.

This latest case was presented as a part of a regular segment in the NEJM detailing unusual or noteworthy medical images.

According to the report, the otherwise healthy man visited a dermatology clinic four weeks after developing a peculiar rash. He told doctors that two months earlier, he had started a keto diet for weight loss.

The skin condition is formally called prurigo pigmentosa, though it's better known by its nickname, “keto rash.”

Scientists aren't really sure why the condition occurs, but it's strongly linked to someone entering ketosis, a metabolic state in which the body breaks down stored fat as its primary source of energy instead of glucose. Keto diets induce ketosis by heavily limiting carbohydrate-rich foods, though other health conditions can trigger it as well.

A Florida Man's Meat, Cheese, and Butter Diet Caused His Hands to Seep out Cholesterol

The rash develops across several phases. It usually begins as small, itchy red or purple bumps along the neck, chest, and back. These bumps then enlarge and form a distinctive net-like (reticular) pattern on the skin; they can sometimes fill with fluid and crust over, similar to blisters. The bumps may become less itchy and fade over time but can recur repeatedly, eventually leaving behind persistent darkened (hyperpigmented) spots.

All this said, keto rash remains an incredibly rare complication of ketosis.

According to a 2019 paper, only around 300 cases had been documented worldwide at the time, including just 20 cases in the U.S. The condition has been most commonly reported among women of East Asian ancestry, particularly in Japan, but not exclusively, as with this latest report.

Rare as the rash is, its incidence could be rising with the increased popularity of keto diets. And because it's seldom seen, doctors may mistake the rash for more common skin conditions like eczema. Once identified, however, it can be easily treated.

The rash eventually goes away once a person leaves ketosis, though it might take a few weeks to clear. For most cases, that means ending the keto diet (cases not linked to a keto diet tend to go away on their own). Tetracycline antibiotics are commonly used to manage its symptoms, since they have anti-inflammatory effects. As for our protagonist, the report authors didn't detail whether the man took their advice and ditched the keto diet.

Strange rashes aren't the only weird side effect of trendy diets. Last January, doctors described how a man's high-fat “carnivore” diet full of cheese, butter, and meat caused his hands to literally seep out cholesterol.

Availability questions linger despite denial

Asus has released a public statement clarifying that the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti models are not discontinued or marked as end-of-life (EOL). The company also confirmed that fluctuations in supply for both models have been primarily due to the ongoing memory crisis, ""which have temporarily affected production output and restocking cycles.”

The statement appears to be a response to a recent report from the YouTube channel Hardware Unboxed, which claimed that an Asus PR representative had confirmed the RTX 5070 Ti was end-of-life after the outlet requested a review unit. Asus has since backtracked, stating that the information shared by its PR representative was incomplete and that the company has no plans to discontinue these models. ""We would like to clarify recent reports regarding the ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB,"" the company stated. ""Certain media may have received incomplete information from an ASUS PR representative regarding these products.""

In a recent post on X, Hardware Unboxed, which first reported the issues, says that the whole situation unfolded when the outlet initially requested RTX 5070 Ti review samples from Asus, as well as other board partners. An Asus PR representative apparently responded to the request, saying that samples could not be provided due to supply constraints, claiming the models were “end of life.” When asked to clarify, Asus reportedly confirmed that this was indeed the case.

Sorry everyone but we've just been provided with ANOTHER clarifying statement from Asus. This one completely walks back their original statement to us“We would like to clarify recent reports regarding the ASUS GeForce RTX™ 5070 Ti and RTX™ 5060 Ti 16 GB. Certain media may…January 16, 2026

Hardware Unboxed then contacted retailers to verify the claim, who similarly indicated that no stock was available. Based on both Asus' purported confirmation and retailer feedback, the outlet published a video detailing the situation. Shortly after, Nvidia released a media statement saying that all GeForce SKUs were still being shipped, despite the ongoing memory constraints. "" Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,"" the company told Tom's Hardware.

Asus followed up, stating that Nvidia had informed them the RTX 5070 Ti was not EOL and that Asus was instead streamlining some models. Hardware Unboxed published an updated statement, only for Asus to release yet another statement for clarification, directly contradicting the original claim and clarifying its original statement, which stated that the RTX 5070 Ti was neither discontinued nor at end of life. ""The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL). ASUS has no plans to stop selling these models,"" the company said.

Following this, Hardware Unboxed immediately renewed its request for RTX 5070 Ti samples, but says it has yet to receive a response. The conflicting statements add confusion for consumers at a time when GPU availability is already limited. While Asus says the cards aren't discontinued, inconsistent supply and messaging suggest availability could remain uneven in the coming days.

On a separate note, Nvidia is rumored to be cutting graphics card supply to its board partners by roughly 15–20%, which could potentially tighten inventory and push prices even higher. The GPU market is already in shambles thanks to the recent price increases on flagship models, including the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, which have witnessed a price surge of 79% and 35%, respectively. If Nvidia reduces the number of GPUs it supplies to manufacturers, the current pricing crisis could get even worse.

Be quiet! maintains its reputation for engineering products that prioritize acoustic performance without compromising functionality. The German manufacturer's portfolio spans power supplies, cases, and thermal solutions, all designed with noise reduction as a fundamental principle. This focus has cultivated a loyal following among enthusiasts who refuse to accept unnecessary system noise as inevitable.

The Pure Power 13 M 650W represents Be quiet!'s latest effort to balance performance, efficiency, and value in the mid-range segment. This unit targets builders constructing systems where reliable power delivery and quiet operation matter more than bleeding-edge specifications. The ATX 3.1 compliance ensures compatibility with current and upcoming hardware, particularly graphics cards utilizing the 12V-2x6 connector standard. This 650W model provides adequate capacity for mainstream gaming configurations while maintaining headroom for transient load spikes, making it one of the best power supplies on the market.

The Pure Power 13 M 650W arrives in sturdy cardboard packaging with an all-black aesthetic. A picture of the unit dominates the front panel, while specifications occupy the rear. Internal protection consists of a nylon pouch and basic paper inserts that secure the PSU during shipping. This packaging approach prioritizes function over presentation.

 




The bundle includes only essential items. Mounting screws and an AC power cable constitute the entirety of included accessories. A few cable ties assist with management. A basic printed manual provides necessary installation guidance without excessive documentation.

 




The fully modular cable configuration allows complete customization of connected cables, including the 24-pin ATX connector. All cables feature uniform black coloring across connectors and wires. Most cables utilize flat ribbon-style construction for simplified routing, though the 24-pin ATX and 12V-2x6 cables feature black nylon sleeving. The 12V-2x6 connector carries a 450W rating, appropriate for the unit's capacity. An unusual CPU power configuration provides one 4+4 pin EPS connector alongside a single 4-pin EPS connector, creating an asymmetric arrangement rarely seen in modern designs.

The chassis measures 86 mm × 150 mm × 160 mm (H × W × D), exceeding standard ATX dimensions quite a bit. This 160mm depth represents a compromise. Given the 120mm fan and 650W output, a more compact design could have been achievable with a slightly different internal layout, but Be Quiet! is primarily focused on optimal heat dissipation and would not let 20 mm's of extra length get in the way

 




The external finish employs satin black chassis paint, applied with precision. Be Quiet!'s embossed logo appears on the right side panel, providing subtle branding without visual clutter. A removable parallel wire fan guard sits above the intake, with a white decorative ring beneath creating modest visual interest. The left side contains the standard electrical specifications sticker. The top panel remains completely unadorned.

The rear panel houses the standard on/off switch adjacent to the AC receptacle. The front accommodates modular cable connectors with subtle white legends printed alongside each position. Notably, Be Quiet! clearly marks the 12V-2x6 connector's 450W limitation, preventing confusion about power delivery capabilities. With a total sustained output of just 650W, this unit is definitely not designed to power a top-tier graphics card.

The cooling solution employs a Be Quiet! QF2-12025-MS 120mm fan featuring a rifle bearing engine. While rifle bearings represent an advancement over basic sleeve designs through enhanced lubrication and structural improvements, they typically exhibit shorter operational lifespans compared to fluid dynamic bearing or ball bearing alternatives. The 10-year warranty mitigates concerns about premature failure.

 




The platform employs established but modern topologies, emphasizing on reliability and cost effectiveness. Input filtering incorporates four Y capacitors, two X capacitors, and two filtering inductors at the AC receptacle entry point. Two rectifying bridges occupy a dedicated heatsink immediately following the filtration stage, providing adequate thermal management for the rectification components.

 




The APFC circuitry features two Toshiba TK20A60W MOSFETs and one diode on a substantial heatsink spanning the PCB edge. One filtering inductor and two Elite capacitors (330 μF and 270 μF) complete the APFC components. These Elite capacitors represent the first indicator of cost optimization in component selection.

 




The primary stage utilizes a half-bridge LLC resonant converter topology with two STM 24N60DM2 MOSFETs mounted on the same heatsink as the APFC components. This configuration has become standard in modern mid-range units, offering good efficiency characteristics. The heatsink dimensions provide ample thermal dissipation area, contributing to strong thermal performance.

Four MOSFETs generate the 12V rail through synchronous rectification, with small PCB-mounted heatsinks providing cooling. DC-to-DC conversion circuits on an additional daughterboard produce the 3.3V and 5V rails.

 




Secondary side capacitors consist primarily of Elite units, with just one Rubycon capacitor present. Elite typically appears in lower-tier products, rarely in units carrying extensive warranties. This component choice contrasts with the otherwise premium design and raises questions about long-term reliability despite the company's confidence indicated by the warranty period.

For the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox and various other bits and parts.

The Pure Power 13 M 650W achieves remarkable electrical conversion efficiency despite the Gold certification badges on its box. With 115 VAC input, the unit demonstrates 91.2% average efficiency across the nominal load range (20% to 100% capacity). This figure increases to 93.3% with 230 VAC input. Peak efficiency occurs near 50% load, reaching approximately 94% with 230 VAC input. These figures comfortably exceed 80Plus Platinum requirements and approach Titanium-level performance, making the Gold certification a curious understatement. It actually does have a Platinum certification from both Cybenetics and CLEAResult. Be Quiet! likely chose conservative marketing to position this unit below their Straight Power series, avoiding internal product cannibalization.

The semi-passive cooling mode keeps the fan stationary until load exceeds approximately 200W. Once operational, the fan maintains extremely low speeds across most of the load range. This design choice prioritizes acoustic performance during typical operating conditions. Beyond 600W, fan speed increases very sharply but not to its top speed. Internal temperatures remain remarkably low throughout testing.

Elevated ambient temperature testing reveals measurable but passable efficiency degradation. Even though the unit is technically rated for operation up to 40°C, it effortlessly delivers its full output while maintaining commendable performance levels. The efficiency drops by about 1% evenly across the load range, without any signs of significant thermal stress. This thermal headroom demonstrates robust component selection and effective heatsink design.

The semi-passive mode activates more readily under elevated temperatures, with the fan engaging right after the load exceeds 100W. Despite earlier activation, fan speed remains subdued until load reaches approximately 90% of capacity. At this threshold, the thermal control circuit prioritizes reliability over acoustics, commanding maximum fan speed. This transition is very aggressive, suggesting that the unit it programmed to prioritize component protection over consistent acoustic performance when stressed. The internal temperatures remain relatively low even at maximum output, well below the point where over-temperature protection would engage.

The electrical performance demonstrates competitive characteristics within its segment. Voltage regulation maintains tight tolerances, with the 12V rail exhibiting approximately 1% variance. The 3.3V and 5V rails demonstrate even tighter regulation at 1.5% and 1.6% respectively. This precision is rather typical performance for Gold-certified units but not bad compared to more premium Platinum-certified products either. Ripple suppression achieves outstanding results. The 12V rail exhibits maximum ripple of 30 mV, while the 5V and 3.3V rails measure 20 mV maximum. These figures are way below the ATX specification limits, demonstrating exceptional filtering capabilities.

During our routine evaluation, we examine the fundamental protection features of all power supply units we review, including Over Current Protection (OCP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Power Protection (OPP), and Short Circuit Protection (SCP). The 3.3V and 5V rails trigger OCP at 146% and 142% of maximum current respectively – a bit high but not unnaturally so for a modern PSU. The 12V rail OCP activates at 120%, a bit sharp for an ATX 3.1 unit. The OPP permits sustained operation up to 128% of nominal capacity before shutdown, offering substantial headroom for transient loads.

The Pure Power 13 M 650W occupies an interesting position in the power supply market. FSP's platform delivers very solid performance through mature design choices rather than innovative approaches. This conservative strategy ensures reliability while potentially limiting competitive differentiation beyond the core specifications.

 




The construction quality meets expectations for a unit carrying a 10-year warranty from an experienced OEM. FSP's in-house manufacturing and quality control processes provide consistency that contract manufacturing arrangements often struggle to match. The electrical characteristics consistently exceed its Gold-level markings substantially, with efficiency and power quality reaching Platinum-tier performance. The ripple suppression achieves exemplary results, delivering cleaner power than many higher-certified competitors.

The component selection presents the primary concern. While active components utilize quality silicon from reputable manufacturers, the reliance on Elite capacitors for bulk filtering raises questions about long-term stability. Elite is an established manufacturer and has been around for decades but we rarely see their products in top-tier products. The company's willingness to back this design with a decade warranty suggests confidence in the platform's longevity despite the unconventional capacitor choice.

 




Thermal and acoustic performance delivers great results, with a hint of. The semi-passive mode provides excellent silence during light loads, aligning with Be Quiet!'s brand philosophy. However, the aggressive thermal management above 90% load creates noticeable noise as the control circuit prioritizes component protection. This design choice favors reliability over consistent acoustic refinement, a reasonable engineering decision that nevertheless creates a slight contradiction with the company's quiet-focused branding.

The pricing represents the most significant consideration. At approximately $100 retail, this Gold-certified unit commands a premium compared to competitors with identical certification. However, when evaluated against Platinum-certified alternatives with similar specifications, the value proposition becomes more compelling. The 10-year warranty, ATX 3.1 compliance, and genuine Platinum-level efficiency provide tangible benefits that justify the price premium for users prioritizing long-term reliability over initial cost savings.

The Pure Power 13 M 650W targets a specific audience. Budget-focused builders seeking minimum cost for adequate Gold certification will find better value elsewhere. Conversely, enthusiasts and professionals valuing balanced performance, comprehensive compatibility, and warranty-backed reliability will appreciate the investment. The ATX 3.1 compliance ensures compatibility with current and future mainstream graphics cards, providing partial protection against obsolescence. The only setback is the high retail price but, considering this should be compared to Platinum-level products when reaching the shopping cart, the Pure Power 13 M 650W is a great investment for those seeking a premium unit at this power range.

Cheaper graphics cards with lots of memory are an endangered species 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Reports and rumors of how Nvidia plans to prioritize production of its RTX 50-series graphics cards in 2026 are swirling after a CES with no new consumer GPU launches, followed by reports that the company is ending the production of some RTX 50-series gaming GPUs and moving them to end-of-life status.

We've received a comment from Nvidia on the matter. We also spoke with the CEO of Gigabyte during CES, and his comments provide context about the overall situation and outlined a rather simple calculation that Nvidia could use to determine which GPUs it will prioritize.

We asked Nvidia for comment on the recent news that some models are being cancelled and received the following statement: ""Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability."" 

While that statement suggests that it's full steam ahead for existing RTX 50-series products, there's more to the story. Tom's Hardware's Paul Alcorn was able to sit down with Gigabyte CEO Eddie Lin at CES for a wide-ranging interview that suggests Nvidia will still prioritize production of some of its GPUs over others based on a rather straightforward calculation, and that we should expect some RTX 50-series products to be in relatively short supply as the year progresses.

Lin described Nvidia's potential GPU allocation strategy, which focuses on maximizing profit from the limited memory resource, as follows: ""They cannot produce only high-end or low-end [products]... but they can, for example, they have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, five segments. They focus on 1, 3, and 5, and reduce the percentage on 2 and 4, because on 2 and 4, the revenue contribution per gigabyte of memory is lower. They will calculate how much revenue [each segment] contributes per gigabyte of memory."" [Emphasis added]

Lin went on to share the example of a $300 GPU (like the RTX 5060), for which ""the memory contributes $35 per GB of revenue, whereas for a $400 8GB GPU, that product would contribute $50 per GB of memory. For a $500 [card] with 16GB of memory, that puts you at only $32 of revenue per GB, then the [contribution] is lower.""

Additionally, Lin noted that Gigabyte continues to receive bundled memory from Nvidia with its GPUs. Rumors have swirled that Nvidia is no longer providing board makers with memory, which would portend a dire situation for smaller-scale players if they were forced to buy memory on the open market. Other vendors could be subject to different agreements and conditions with Nvidia, but we haven't received any confirmation from vendors that Nvidia is no longer bundling memory.

Using Lin's framework, we can understand what graphics cards are likely to be prioritized and deprioritized for allocation in 2026. Consider the following table:

At the lower end of the market, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB contributes $47.38 of gross revenue per gigabyte of GDDR7 compared to the RTX 5060's $37.38, meaning that the 5060 Ti will likely be prioritized for allocation despite its wildly underwhelming initial reception.

The RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is the most threatened card of the bunch by this measure, since as a byproduct of its MSRP and higher VRAM capacity, it contributes just $26.81 of revenue per GB of GDDR7 on board — the lowest of any RTX 50-series card.

Moving up the stack, the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti contribute the same gross revenue per gigabyte, meaning that the cheaper-to-produce 5070 will likely be favored over its Ti sibling (which uses a bigger, more power-hungry GPU and a more complex board design)—or that both cards are likely to be deprioritized in favor of the more profitable RTX 5060 Ti 8GB.

At the highest end, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 contribute nearly the same revenue per gig of VRAM, meaning that the RTX 5080 will likely take precedence for allocation of 2GB GDDR7 chips going forward due to its smaller GPU die (half the size of the RTX 5090's) and much less complex board design. It would also mean that the 32GB of VRAM needed to produce one large 5090 GPU would instead create two 16GB RTX 5080s, which would help with overall supply and possibly lead to more margin.

Just for fun, the RTX 5090 and RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell share the same GB202 GPU (albeit with differing SM counts), but even with 96GB of GDDR7 on board, the RTX Pro 6000 contributes a whopping 41% more revenue per GB of GDDR7 on board versus the 5090.

Of course, the RTX Pro 6000 uses 3GB GDDR7 chips in clamshell mode to achieve its memory capacity rather than the 2GB single-side parts on the RTX 5090, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.

But it does make it obvious why Nvidia may have foregone launching the RTX 50-series Super refresh at CES: the margins afforded by using 3GB packages on RTX Pro products are simply much more attractive than they would have been for GeForce cards that presumably would have sold for near the same MSRPs as non-Super cards did at launch.

Going forward, we expect that the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, RTX 5070, and RTX 5080 may be the easiest cards to find on shelves, relatively speaking, while enthusiast favorites like the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 5070 Ti will be in short supply. The writing is also on the wall for the RTX 5090 — we can already see the supply situation reflected in today's empty e-tail shelves and dramatically inflated prices from third-party sellers. We'll continue to monitor this situation and update our list of the best GPUs for gaming accordingly.

OpenAI is investing as it sees BCIs as ‘an important new frontier' that will deliver seamless AI interactions. It is focused on non-invasive AI-accelerated tech.

OpenAI has signaled its intentions to become a major player in brain computer interfaces (BCIs). The scale of the firm's first round of investment in Merge Labs, as it emerges from stealth mode, places it among the most heavily funded BCI efforts in the U.S., second only to Neuralink. That's because Merge Labs, co-founded by Altman, will be going forward with $252 million in its tech advancement war chest, reports Bloomberg. However, it admits there's a long road ahead.

OpenAI wasn't the only contributor in this investment round, but it was the biggest. Another notable investor was Gabe Newell, co-founder of Valve, which owns the gaming storefront Steam. Newell's hat is already in this ring with his own brain tech company, Starfish Neuroscience.

OpenAI's interest in Merge Labs BCIs could result in further public sparring matches between two of the biggest personalities in tech. Altman's Merge Labs will be making ripples in Musk's Neuralink pond. However, their approaches to BCIs, as we currently understand them, are quite different. These differences will likely be pivotal to their relative successes.

The limited amount of Merge Labs' currently public materials confirms that the fledgling BCI outfit will be developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ to this technology. “We believe this requires increasing the bandwidth and brain coverage of BCIs by several orders of magnitude while making them much less invasive,” explains a blog penned by the freshly uncloaked firm. “To make this happen, we're developing entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes, transmit and receive information using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound, and avoid implants into brain tissue.”

Merge Labs also claims that the most recent breakthroughs in biotechnology, hardware, neuroscience, and computing will be adopted. The resulting BCIs, according to the company, will be “equal parts biology, device, and AI,” mixed into an accessible form factor.

So, in brief, Merge Labs BCIs will contrast with Neuralink's approach because they will avoid implants into brain tissue. The key will be whether the firm's technology can achieve workable results from “AI operating systems that can interpret intent, adapt to individuals, and operate reliably with limited and noisy signals.”

The $252 million investment in Merge Labs sounds like quite a gamble, as Bloomberg's report suggests the money will effectively establish a research lab to fix the disadvantages of the non-invasive BCI route. In other words, the money raised appears to be for a pre-prototype outfit, not a product-ready company. Meanwhile, Neuralink is pretty deep into testing its BCIs with humans, as are various Chinese competitors.

A huge downturn

Even though Nvidia's AI GPUs and rack-scale solutions remain the most sought-after AI accelerators, curbs set on exports of Nvidia's AI processors to China, first by the White House and then by Beijing, are having a drastic effect on the company's presence in the People's Republic. As a result, the company's share in China could drop to just 8% in the coming years as domestic suppliers can satisfy around 80% of local demand, reports Nikkei, citing analysis from Bernstein.

""The new products meet the needs of domestic developers,"" said Zhang Jianzhong, chief executive of Moore Threads, at a news conference while announcing the codenamed Huashan product, the company's first GPU dedicated solely for the acceleration of AI workloads. ""There will be no more need to wait for advanced products from overseas.""

Analysts from Bernstein cited by Chinese media expect Nvidia's share of China's AI processor market to drop to around 8% this year from 66% in 2024 as Huawei, Cambricon, and other local independent hardware vendors (IHVs) together approaching 80%. The rise of Chinese hardware accelerators is a result of a combination of events, including restrictions set on Nvidia hardware, progress of hardware from companies like Huawei, Cambricon, Moore Threads, and MetaX, as well as substantial improvements in their software stacks.

Moore Threads' Huashan can compete against Nvidia's Hopper H100 and H200 products, the company's previous-generation AI accelerators that the U.S. recently allowed to export to China, but with some serious strings attached. However, they are considerably slower than Nvidia's existing Blackwell B200 and B300 GPUs, which are barred from export to the People's Republic. Meanwhile, Huawei's AI CloudMatrix 384 can beat both GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 systems in BF16 FLOPS, a popular format used for AI training, albeit with four times more power consumption. The company's next-generation Atlas 950 SuperCluster, based on 524,288 Ascend 950DT AI accelerators, is projected to offer up to 524 FP8 ExaFLOPS for AI training and up to 1 FP4 ZettaFLOPS for AI inference (MXFP4 to be more specific) sometimes in 2026 – 2027 and 4 ZettaFLOPS by the end of 2028. This is still behind leading Blackwell-based clusters, such as Oracle's OCI Supercluster running 131,072 B200 GPUs and offering peak performance of up to 2.4 FP4 ZettaFLOPS for inference, but it is evident that Chinese developers are rapidly increasing the performance of their AI hardware.

Given the progress, the remaining hurdle is completing the transition from an ecosystem long centered on Nvidia to a fully domestic hardware and software stack, which may not be that easy to achieve, as many existing AI deployments use Nvidia hardware and Nvidia CUDA software stack and porting them to Chinese hardware and software is hard and expensive.

Yet, transition to domestic AI hardware (and domestic hardware in general) is China's long-term national goal. A draft five-year plan reportedly circulated by the Communist Party in October calls for semiconductor self-reliance under a 'new national system' that directs state bodies, private companies, and financial institutions. At the heart of this effort are the so-called 'four little dragons' of Chinese GPUs: Moore Threads, MetaX, Biren Technology, and Suiyuan Technology (Enflame).

Large hyperscalers are also intensifying their custom silicon programs. Baidu's Kunlunxin unit plans to introduce five AI processors by 2030, and Alibaba is also not giving up on its own silicon efforts. Yet, to a large degree, China's AI industry is limited by SMIC's ability to produce chips on its 7nm-class process technologies in sizable quantities. If the company cannot increase its output substantially in the coming years, then either China's AI sector will fall behind America's dramatically, or it will find a way to obtain high-performance GPUs from Nvidia to keep up.

 January 16, 2026  

Tightened Medicaid eligibility rules under last year's One Big Beautiful Bill Act could result in more than 1 million missed cancer screenings within 2 years and over 150 avoidable cancer deaths, new findings suggested.

“Clinicians should be genuinely concerned,” corresponding author Adrian Diaz, MD, MPH, a surgical oncology fellow at the University of Chicago, Chicago, told Medscape Medical News. “These projections suggest that Medicaid eligibility restrictions are likely to translate into delayed diagnoses, more advanced disease at presentation, and worse outcomes.”

The new law, which significantly reduces federal Medicaid funding, introduces mandatory work or community-engagement requirements for working-age adults as well as more frequent recertification starting in 2027.

In the study, a Research Letter published online on January 8 in JAMA Oncology, Diaz and Sarah Shubeck, MD, also from the University of Chicago, drew on data from Arkansas to model how these 2025 federal Medicaid eligibility restrictions could lead to loss of Medicaid coverage and consequently missed cancer screenings, especially in states that expanded Medicaid.

Diaz and Shubeck then paired coverage losses with state-level self-reported screening prevalences and estimated incident breast, colorectal, and lung cancers using 2-year risks.

In the first 2 years after implementation, the researchers predicted that 7.5 million adults (range, 5.0-10.8 million) will lose Medicaid coverage due to the new provisions.

This coverage loss will lead to an estimated 405,706 missed mammograms, 679,745 missed colorectal screenings, and 67,213 missed lung cancer screenings.

As a result, 1055 breast cancers, 748 colorectal cancers, and 538 lung cancers will go undetected, with excess deaths totaling 155 — 70 for breast, 50 for colorectal, and 35 for lung cancers.

Predicted missed screenings and related cancer outcomes varied considerably by state, with missed screening rates generally lower in states that didn't expand Medicaid.

“Importantly, our estimates focus on missed screening and do not account for patients already undergoing cancer treatment whose coverage could be interrupted, meaning the real-world impact is likely larger,” Diaz said.

Farhad Islami, MD, PhD, senior scientific director of Cancer Disparity Research at the American Cancer Society, said the estimated coverage losses are “consistent with the number” — 7.8 million — “estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.”

Islami also stressed that the harm caused by the new restrictions would be “far greater” than what the study reports, with coverage losses leading to delays in care seeking for cancer symptoms of all kinds “and consequently, delayed diagnosis for many more cancer cases.”

“Moreover,” he added, “the restrictions can reduce the utilization of preventive care (eg, counselling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation among people who smoke, counselling for reducing weight, and so on) and receipt of guideline-concordant cancer treatments among those who will lose Medicaid coverage.”

In Diaz' view, clinicians can help mitigate the adverse effects of the new provisions.

“For example, proactively identifying patients at risk of coverage loss, engaging financial counselors and social workers early, and connecting uninsured or underinsured patients to safety-net screening and treatment programs,” he said. “At a systems level, clinicians also have an important role in documenting and communicating these downstream clinical consequences to health systems and policymakers.”

Drug-induced fever is commonly misdiagnosed, particularly in cases of suspected or confirmed infection.

A 21-year-old woman developed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced fever, confirmed by a reproducible febrile response during a drug provocation test, with supportive evidence from intradermal testing and a lymphocyte transformation test.

The case report by Maria Lages, MD, from the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Department, Unidade Local de Saúde do Algarve, Faro, Portugal, and colleagues aimed to raise awareness of drug-induced fever and emphasised the diagnostic value of drug provocation testing when performed under appropriate clinical supervision.

The patient with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections was referred to the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Department for suspected hypersensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. On the sixth day of treatment for a urinary tract infection, she developed a fever, with a maximum temperature of 39.9 °C, along with diarrhoea and myalgia.

She was subsequently self-medicated with ibuprofen 600 mg and paracetamol 1000 mg. After completing an 8-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, she noted the appearance of a pruritic macular rash, prompting evaluation in the emergency department.

On admission, vital signs showed fever (39.9 °C). Respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were normal. Physical examination confirmed a generalised rash.

Laboratory analysis revealed relative lymphopenia without leucocytosis or eosinophilia. C-reactive protein was elevated at 16.64 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/dL). Urinalysis was normal, and blood and urine cultures were negative.

The patient was discharged on bilastine and prednisolone therapy. Skin lesions resolved completely within 2-3 days, and the fever subsided within 48 hours.

As part of the initial allergy workup, patch testing with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 10% in petrolatum was performed and was negative at 48 and 72 hours.

Single-blind, placebo-controlled oral drug provocation tests with a cumulative dose of 1000 mg of paracetamol and a cumulative dose of 600 mg of ibuprofen were subsequently conducted and were negative.

Eleven months after the initial reaction, a single-blind, placebo-controlled drug provocation test with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was performed, reaching a cumulative dose of 800 mg plus 160 mg, administered in two divided doses 30 minutes apart.

Approximately 4 hours after the test, the patient developed a fever, with a maximum temperature of 39.3 °C, which was unresponsive to paracetamol and was accompanied by bradycardia. Erythema was observed on the cervical region, face, and palms, along with conjunctival hyperaemia. The patient also reported a frontal headache and cervical pain with limited neck flexion.

She was evaluated in the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Department and treated with 1000 mg of paracetamol and 20 mg of ebastine, which initially improved symptoms. 

Several hours later, while still under observation, worsening cervical pain and stiffness prompted referral to the emergency department.

Repeat laboratory testing showed relative lymphopenia without leucocytosis or eosinophilia, with a C-reactive protein level of 11.34 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/dL). Urinalysis was normal, and blood and urine cultures remained negative.

Given the concern for infectious or aseptic meningitis, a neurologic assessment was performed, followed by lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no pleocytosis, protein abnormalities, or hypoglycorrhachia, effectively excluding meningitis.

Clinical improvement occurred with symptomatic treatment using paracetamol, and the fever resolved within 48 hours.

The close similarity between this episode and the initial reaction reinforced the suspicion of drug-induced fever. Three months after the drug provocation test, a lymphocyte transformation test with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole demonstrated probable sensitisation, defined as a stimulation index of at least 3 with a minimum of two positive replicates at any tested concentration.

“Drug-induced fever remains an underdiagnosed and often overlooked condition, particularly during antibiotic therapy, where it may be mistaken for infection recurrence,” wrote the authors. Diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion, a clear temporal relationship with drug exposure, resolution after withdrawal, and careful exclusion of alternative causes.

Advances in targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have increased the importance of identifying oncogenic drivers that can act both as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Contemporary guidelines and real-world studies highlight comprehensive molecular and biomarker testing as a standard part of advanced NSCLC evaluation, enabling more individualized treatment selection.

Predictive/actionable biomarkers usually inform the likelihood of benefit from a specific targeted therapy. In contrast, prognostic biomarkers are more often indicative of patient survival, independent of the treatment received because they indicate elements such as innate tumor aggressiveness. Current guidelines emphasize broad-panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) to efficiently detect multiple actionable drivers rather than testing biomarkers individually.

Learn more about molecular testing in NSCLC.

Recent data confirm that CGP with NGS can be used instead of sequential single-gene testing for advanced NSCLC as it detects many actionable alterations in one test and conserves tissue. A recent interim report from the European Program for Routine Testing of Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer showed that central CGP identified hundreds of targetable alterations and enabled identification of biomarker-matched clinical trial options. Patients with targetable molecular alterations who received corresponding targeted therapies demonstrated significantly enhanced survival outcomes. 

Real-world research from the American Society of Clinical Oncology shows that when CGP results are available before starting initial treatment, there is greater use of matched targeted therapies and improved patient outcomes. Additionally, inappropriate use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is reduced. Therefore, it does not need to be reserved for later lines of therapy. By contrast, restricting testing to a few individual genes or deferring CGP until after immunotherapy can lead to missed opportunities for matched targeted therapy and suboptimal outcomes.

Learn more about molecular testing in NSCLC.

Activating BRAF mutations, particularly BRAF V600E, lead to constitutive, direct activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in NSCLC, driving uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation and survival. This provides the rationale for using combined BRAF and MEK inhibition in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated NSCLC.

Other oncogenic signaling pathways implicated in NSCLC include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription, but these are not consistently or directly activated by BRAF V600E.

The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is implicated in tumor growth and treatment resistance in various cancers, but it is not directly activated by BRAF V600E in NSCLC.

Learn more about genetic mutations in NSCLC.

Current guidelines and research emphasizes that histology and stage, not clinical demographics, should drive biomarker testing decisions in NSCLC. For patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC, especially adenocarcinoma, comprehensive molecular testing for actionable alterations is recommended regardless of sex, weight, and ethnicity.

Recommended panels typically include alterations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600E, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, NTRK1/2/3, ERBB2/HER2, KRAS (eg, G12C), as well as PD-L1 expression. Many guidelines now also support testing selected squamous tumors (eg, in never-smokers or small biopsy specimens) when feasible.

Learn more about NSCLC management guidelines.

PD-L1, expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, binds to PD-1 receptors on T cells, delivering an inhibitory signal that reduces T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. This PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is a key mechanism of immune escape in NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 block this interaction, restoring antitumor T-cell activity and can improve clinical outcomes for many patients with advanced NSCLC.

In contrast, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and MET exon 14 skipping mutations are oncogenic driver alterations that are primarily targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors rather than immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Nancy A. Melville

 January 16, 2026  

The FDA has issued an early alert warning of a “potentially high-risk” device safety issue regarding the Prismaflex control units, manufactured by Vantive, noting that the sets may continue to be used with some precautions.

The control units are primarily used for continuous renal replacement therapy and other renal replacement therapies in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.

According to the alert, Vantive has been made aware of reports of the control units' deaeration chambers potentially dislodging from the control unit and falling out of the proper upright position.

The chamber's dislodging could result in an “Air in Blood” alarm during the priming phase prior to the initiation of therapy or during therapy.

Importantly, the alarm could lead to delays or interruptions of therapy, in addition to blood loss due to clotting and failure to return blood manually, according to the alert.

No serious injuries or deaths had been reported as of December 17, 2025, and the FDA notes that users may continue to perform therapy using affected Prismaflex sets.

“Vantive is aware of customers who have experienced this issue and attempted to further secure the deaeration chamber in an upright position,” the alert explains.

Users should “monitor the deaeration chamber during therapy to ensure it remains in an upright position within the holder,” the FDA advises.

Should a repositioning to an upright position be necessary, users should make sure there are no kinks in the tubing and that the deaeration chamber remains visible.

If the Prismaflex control unit issues an “Air in Blood” alarm, users should check to determine if air is indeed present, and if not, check to see if the deaeration chamber has been dislodged from its holder, while making sure no clots are present. 

In the absence of dislodgement, the operator's manual instructions for an “Air in Blood” alarm should be followed.

If dislodgement has occurred with clotting, the instructions for those circumstances in the Prismaflex control unit operator's manual should be followed to discontinue the therapy and replace the set.

Only when dislodgement occurs without clotting or any other alarms and the chamber is secured in an upright position the corresponding instructions within the Prismaflex control unit operator's manual be followed to proceed with treatment.

Of note, there have not been similar reports with the PrisMax control units, which feature a different deaeration chamber holder design.

The specific product information of affected devices is detailed on the FDA Alert page.

Relapses in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) largely mirrored the initial disease pattern, most often affecting the ENT, lungs, or kidneys, with serious features recurring. Involvement of new organs was uncommon and usually occurred alongside previously affected organs.

“Patients should be informed of the increased risk of recurrence in the organs initially involved at diagnosis, while also remaining vigilant for warning signs of new organ involvement,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Michele Iudici, MD, PhD, MPH, Geneva University Hospitals and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. It was published online on December 31, 2025, in RMD Open.

Patients with more severe disease may have been overrepresented because the recruitment occurred at tertiary referral centers. Not all patients met the 2022 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria due to missing data. Changes in treatment across decades may have influenced relapse patterns and limited generalizability over time.

The authors did not receive any specific grant or funding for this study. The authors acknowledged receiving support in part from the Directorate of Health Care Supply of the French Ministry of Health. One author reported receiving consulting fees, speaking fees, honoraria, and funding for congress registration, travel, and accommodation from Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline. Two other authors reported having similar financial ties with several pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. All authors reported being co-investigators in academic studies for which rituximab was provided by Roche Pharma.

Preexisting alcohol misuse, present in more than 58% of participants, was associated with increased Generalised Anxiety Disorder seven-item (GAD-7) scores during the COVID-19 pandemic in France, particularly affecting women and those with high perceived loneliness.

""We identified women and people with high perceived loneliness as groups particularly vulnerable to anxiety, with a worsening of their psychic state as the crisis persisted,"" the authors wrote.

""Our current findings suggest that certain groups may benefit now from targeted psychological support in primary care or in addiction centres. Implementing a simple non-intrusive question about perceived loneliness in clinical practice could help to screen those at the greatest risk for high anxiety,"" they added.

This study was led by Charline Galesne, University of Bordeaux College of Health Sciences, Bordeaux, France. It was published online on January 06, 2026, in BMJ Open.

The use of a convenience sample recruited through online networks meant the results were not representative of the general French population. A high attrition rate was present, with only 39% of participants completing at least one follow-up questionnaire.

This study received funding from the University of Bordeaux, Kap Code, and the Kappa Santé CRO. Additional funding was received from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Regional Health Agency, Public Health France, and the National Institute Against Cancer. One author received support through a PhD grant from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Regional Council.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

New York-based performer Cynthia Freeman, 61, has been trying to figure out how to keep the Affordable Care Act health plan that she and her husband depend on.

""If we didn't have health issues, I'd just go back to where I was in my 40s and not have health insurance,"" she said, ""but we're not in that position now.""

Freeman and her husband, Brad Lawrence, are freelancers who work in storytelling and podcasting.

In October, Lawrence, 52, got very sick, very fast.

""I knew I was in trouble,"" he said. ""I went into the emergency room, and I walked over to the desk, and I said, 'Hi, I've gained 25 pounds in five days and I'm having trouble breathing and my chest hurts.' And they stopped blinking.""

Doctors diagnosed him with kidney disease, and he was hospitalized for four days.

Now Lawrence has to take medication with an average cost without insurance of $760 a month.

In January, the cost of the couple's current ""silver"" plan rose nearly 75%, to $801 a month.

To bring in extra cash, Freeman has picked up a part-time bartending gig.

Millions of middle-class Americans who have ACA health plans are facing soaring premium payments in 2026, without help from the enhanced subsidies that Congress failed to renew. Some are contemplating big life changes to deal with new rates that kicked in on Jan. 1.

It often falls to women to figure out a family's insurance puzzle.

Women generally use more health care than men, in part because of their need for reproductive services, according to Elizabeth Tobin-Tyler, a professor at Brown University's School of Public Health.

Women also tend to be the medical decision-makers for the family, she said, especially for the children.

""There's a disproportionate role that women play in families around what we think of as the mental load,"" said Tobin-Tyler, and that includes ""making decisions around health insurance.""

Before the holidays, Congress considered a few forms of relief for the premium hikes, but nothing has materialized, and significant deadlines have already passed.

As the clock ticked down on 2025, B. agonized over her family's insurance options. She was looking for a full-time job with benefits, because the premium prices she was seeing for 2026 ACA plans were alarming.

In the meantime, she decided, she and her husband would drop coverage and insure only the kids. But it would be risky.

""My husband works with major tools all day,"" she said, ""so it feels like rolling the dice.""

NPR and KFF Health News are identifying B. by her middle initial because she believes her insurance needs could affect her ongoing search for a job with health benefits.

The family lives in Providence, Rhode Island. Her husband is a self-employed woodworker, and she worked full-time as a nonprofit manager before she lost her job last spring.

After she lost her job, she turned to the ACA marketplace. The family's ""gold"" plan cost them nearly $2,000 a month in premiums.

It was a lot, and they dug into retirement savings to pay for it while B. kept looking for a new position.

Because Congress failed to extend enhanced subsidies for ACA plans, despite ongoing political battles and a lengthy government shutdown over the issue, B.'s family plan would have cost even more in 2026 — almost $3,000 a month.

""I don't have an additional $900 lying around in my family budget to pay for this,"" she said.

B. had already pulled $12,000 out of retirement funds to pay her family's 2025 rates.

Unless she finds a new job soon, the family's projected income for 2026 will be less than 266% of the federal poverty level. That means the children qualify for free coverage through Medicaid.

So B. decided to buy a plan on the ACA marketplace for herself and her husband, paying premiums of $1,200 a month.

""The bottom line is none of this is affordable,"" she said, ""so we're going to be dipping into savings to pay for this.""

The prospect of soaring insurance premiums put a pause on Nicole Benisch's plans to get married.

Benisch, 45, owns a holistic wellness business in Providence. She paid $108 a month for a zero-deductible ""silver"" plan on Rhode Island's insurance exchange.

But the cost in 2026 more than doubled, to $220 a month.

She and her fiance had planned to marry on Dec. 19, her late mother's birthday. ""And then,"" she said, ""we realized how drastically that was going to change the cost of my premium.""

As a married couple, their combined income would exceed 400% of the federal poverty level and make Benisch ineligible for financial help. Her current plan's monthly premium payments would triple, costing her more than $700 a month.

Benisch considered a less expensive ""bronze"" plan, but it wouldn't cover vocal therapy, which she needs to treat muscle tension dysphonia, a condition that can make her voice strain or give out.

If they get married, there's another option: Switch to her fiance's health plan in Massachusetts. But that would mean losing all her Rhode Island doctors, who would be out-of-network.

""We have some tough decisions to make,"" she said, ""and none of the options are really great for us.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Natural brakes on inflammation could treat chronic diseases","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Natural-brakes-on-inflammation-could-treat-chronic-diseases.aspx","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:34:00 GMT","

Researchers at University College London (UCL) have uncovered a key mechanism that helps the body switch off inflammation – a breakthrough that could lead to new treatments for chronic diseases affecting millions worldwide.

Inflammation is the body's frontline defence against infection and injury, but when it doesn't switch off properly, it can drive serious health conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. Until now, scientists didn't fully understand how the body decides to stop the immune 'fight' response and start healing.

Published in Nature Communications, the study reveals that tiny fat-derived molecules called epoxy-oxylipins act as natural brakes on the immune system. These molecules prevent the overgrowth of certain immune cells, known as intermediate monocytes, that can cause chronic inflammation – linked to tissue damage, illness and disease progression.

For the study, healthy human volunteers were given a tiny injection of UV-killed E. coli bacteria into the forearm, which triggered a short-lived inflammatory reaction – pain, redness, heat and swelling – similar to what happens after an infection or injury.

Volunteers were split into two groups: prophylactic arm and therapeutic arm.

At different times the volunteer groups were given a drug called GSK2256294, which blocks an enzyme known as soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which naturally breaks down epoxy-oxylipins.

Both approaches showed that blocking the enzyme sEH with GSK2256294 raised epoxy-oxylipin levels, accelerated pain resolution, and sharply reduced levels of intermediate monocytes in blood and tissue – the immune cells linked to chronic inflammation and disease. Interestingly, the drug did not significantly alter external symptoms, such as redness and swelling.

Further tests revealed that one epoxy-oxylipin, 12,13-EpOME, works by shutting down a protein signal called p38 MAPK, which drives monocyte transformation. This was confirmed in lab experiments and in volunteers given a p38-blocking drug.

Our findings reveal a natural pathway that limits harmful immune cell expansion and helps calm inflammation more quickly.

Targeting this mechanism could lead to safer treatments that restore immune balance without suppressing overall immunity.

With chronic inflammation ranked as a major global health threat, this discovery opens a promising avenue for new therapies.""

Dr. Olivia Bracken, first author, UCL Department of Aging, Rheumatology and Regenerative Medicine

Corresponding author Professor Derek Gilroy (UCL Division of Medicine) said: ""This is the first study to map epoxy-oxylipin activity in humans during inflammation.

""By boosting these protective fat molecules, we could design safer treatments for diseases driven by chronic inflammation.""

He added: ""This was an entirely human-based study with direct relevance to autoimmune diseases, as we used a drug already suitable for human use – one that could be repurposed to treat flares in chronic inflammatory conditions, an area currently bereft of effective therapies.""

Scientists chose to study epoxy-oxylipins because these fat-derived molecules were known from animal research to reduce inflammation and pain, but their role in humans remained unknown. Unlike well-studied inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and cytokines, epoxy-oxylipins are part of an underexplored pathway that scientists believed could naturally calm the immune system.

The discovery opens the door to clinical trials exploring sEH inhibitors as potential therapies for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease.

Dr Bracken said: ""For instance, rheumatoid arthritis is a condition in which the immune system attacks the cells that line your joints. sEH inhibitors could be trialled alongside existing medications to investigate if they can help prevent or slow down joint damage incurred by the condition.""

Dr Caroline Aylott, Head of Research Delivery at Arthritis UK, said: ""The pain of arthritis can affect how we move, think, sleep and feel, along with our ability to spend time with loved ones. Pain is incredibly complex and is affected by many different factors. We also know that everybody's pain is different.

""That is why it is important that we invest in research like this, that helps us understand what causes and influences people's experience of pain.

""We are excited to see the results of this study which has found a natural process that could stop inflammation and pain. We hope in the future that this will lead to new pain management options for people with arthritis.""

The study was funded by Arthritis UK and involved researchers at UCL, King's College London, University of Oxford, Queen Mary University of London, and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, USA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Experts issue strong call for overhaul of UK dementia prevention strategy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Experts-issue-strong-call-for-overhaul-of-UK-dementia-prevention-strategy.aspx","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:27:00 GMT","

A national panel of experts has issued the strongest call yet for the Department of Health and Social Care to overhaul how it approaches dementia prevention, pointing to vital evidence that dementia risk can be reduced and providing a framework for the development of new government policy that could improve brain health for millions. 

The Nottingham Consensus, published in Nature Reviews Neurology, was led by researchers at the NIHR Policy Research Unit in Dementia and Neurodegeneration at Queen Mary University of London (DeNPRU-QM). It sets out 56 recommendations aimed at turning decades of research into tangible policy. 

The recommendations span four policy areas: 

Across all the recommendations, the panel emphasised the importance of addressing health inequalities to ensure that everyone in society has the same chance of living to an old age with a healthy brain. This means creating policies that account for how individual choices interact with social, economic and environmental conditions to influence brain health across a lifetime. 

We know dementia risk can be reduced, but the evidence has not yet been transformed into a coherent governmental strategy. People need clear, evidence-based guidance on protecting their brain health, but the information they receive can be confusing or make them feel blamed. What we need now is coordinated, structural action to develop dementia prevention policies that are equitable, realistic and grounded in the lives people actually lead."" 

Dr. Harriet Demnitz-King, Lead Author, Postdoc Research Fellow, Queen Mary University of London

Senior author Charles Marshall, Professor of Clinical Neurology at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""Dementia is now the leading cause of death in the UK, so we desperately need a clear public health plan to improve this situation. We hope that this consensus will lead to better public messaging about dementia, improved recognition and management of other conditions that increase dementia risk, a strategy on structural approaches to improving brain health, and research that addresses gaps in our knowledge about how best to do all this. Implementing our recommendations will ensure that as many people as possible live to old age without dementia."" 

Dementia cases are set to triple by 2050, yet public awareness that dementia risk can be reduced remains strikingly low. The panel, made up of a diverse group of 40 experts, identified three high-priority areas for individual action where evidence is particularly strong: hearing loss, social isolation and high blood pressure. But they also warned that without structural support – such as affordable hearing services, accessible social infrastructure and effective blood pressure management – these interventions will fail to reach the people who need them most. 

The Nottingham Consensus provides clear, actionable recommendations to support a policy shift towards dementia prevention in line with the 10 Year Health Plan for England. It calls for a joined-up approach that builds dementia prevention into wider government action on issues such as smoking, alcohol, pollution and social inequality. Putting the recommendations into practice would send a clear signal that, with the right structural support, dementia risk can be reduced.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Regulatory strategy as a competitive advantage in modern drug development","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260116/Regulatory-strategy-as-a-competitive-advantage-in-modern-drug-development.aspx","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:54:00 GMT","

Regulatory affairs have long been regarded as a necessary hurdle in drug development, with drug developers routinely required to ensure compliance by preparing dossiers and managing submissions via complicated national and international frameworks.

That perception is outdated, however, as regulatory strategy now represents a source of competitive advantage rather than mere compliance. Regulatory expertise can de‑risk programs, accelerate timelines, and even improve a compound's commercial value when it is integrated into drug development planning at an early stage.

Regulatory experts at hVIVO have seen this transformation firsthand, with their extensive experience across human challenge studies, early‑phase clinical trials, and complex therapeutic areas highlighting that regulatory affairs are no longer solely confined to the back room.

Rather, regulatory affairs are key to influencing policy, shaping development pathways, and ensuring that innovative and vital treatments reach patients as quickly as possible.

Compliance remains the foundation of any work related to regulatory affairs, because no program can progress without robust documentation, including CTAs, INDs, eCTDs, and GxP validation.

Acceleration is assured by embedding a well‑designed regulatory strategy from the outset. For example, beginning with a Target Product Profile (TPP) and a specifically tailored regulatory roadmap allows sponsors to align on population, indication, and endpoints prior to committing any major resources.

Employing such a proactive approach ensures the avoidance of potentially expensive missteps while maintaining developmental focus on the defined end goal.

hVIVO emphasizes that the importance of a regulatory strategy is not simply a static checklist. Rather, this strategy must be a living plan that is adaptable to both commercial realities and scientific progress.

The early involvement of regulatory experts ensures that sponsors are clear on what is acceptable to regulatory agencies, what is realistically feasible, and how best to position their specific product for success. 

Regulatory designations such as EMA PRIME, FDA Fast Track, and orphan status are more than just badges of honor. These strategic assets help accelerate development and enhance commercial value, with smaller biotechs leveraging them to attract partners and investors, and larger pharmaceutical companies using them to reduce their products' time to market.

The team of regulatory consultants at hVIVO has guided sponsors through these regulatory pathways, helping them secure designations that transform a program's trajectory. 

A universal flu vaccine application for the EMA PRIME scheme provides a useful example of how a combination of these expedited pathways and an appropriate regulatory strategy can directly impact both commercial outcomes and scientific progress.

Regulatory success depends on more than just technical expertise, however. Relationships with sponsors, agencies, and policymakers are also key to a program's success, and hVIVO's experienced consultants have extensive experience preparing briefing packages, rehearsing meetings, and managing interactions with regulators to improve the likelihood of a positive outcome.

hVIVO's team understands that simplicity and clarity are essential, especially when working with agencies that operate under tight review timelines.

Human challenge studies highlight the importance of this point because acceptance of these models varies, as they are not currently fully codified in regulatory guidance. hVIVO's teams have helped challenge models to become more widely accepted by directly engaging regulators, clearly explaining the science, and lobbying for greater and wider inclusion in guidance.

This approach is a notable example of regulatory strategy in action: influencing policy and creating pathways for innovation that would otherwise be blocked by building trust and rapport with regulators.

Challenge models may be considered less rigorous than field trials, but they offer vital proof‑of‑concept data that is key to de‑risking subsequent development and accelerating antiviral and vaccine programs.

Regulatory strategy makes challenge studies acceptable, and hVIVO's experts have secured regulatory confidence by positioning them as controlled, scientifically robust, and ethical, and by aligning endpoints with field trial triggers where applicable.

This increased acceptance must continue to broaden into the future, expanding into later phases, patient populations, and new therapeutic areas. This will require a robust combination of scientific excellence and regulatory advocacy, but it remains a clear example of how strategy elevates compliance into competitive advantage.

Its integrated approach is another of hVIVO's key strengths. The company's regulatory services operate seamlessly across non‑clinical, clinical, and CMC.

Senior experts undertake the work, supported by a network of specialists across the group, ensuring delivery is never delegated to less experienced or junior team members.

Sponsors benefit from end‑to‑end support thanks to this breadth and depth, ranging from marketing authorization dossiers to consultancy and operational support for IND‑enabling toxicology packages.

Integration also ensures quality and consistency across the development lifecycle. Sponsors benefit from cross‑functional expertise, whether in cardiometabolic research, respiratory or infectious diseases, or complex combination products. This rare holistic approach affords sponsors a genuine competitive advantage.

Regulatory strategy continues to evolve, with this evolving landscape being reshaped by early adaptive designs, real‑world evidence, and master protocols such as umbrella and platform protocols.

Agencies are increasingly open to innovative approaches, but only when sponsors present them clearly and convincingly. The role of regulatory affairs has also evolved and is now as much about negotiation and communication as it is about comprehensive documentation.

Partnership is the future, regulators are increasingly encouraging dialogue, sponsors are seeking greater acceleration, and experienced service providers are required to serve as the bridge between. The right combination of technical expertise and relational skill is key to regulatory professionals' ability to shape policy, influence guidance, and accelerate innovation.

Regulatory affairs are no longer the hurdle that they were historically considered to be; rather, they can become a lever for credibility, speed, and commercial success with the right strategy.

Compliance is imperative, but competitive advantage stems from acceleration. Strong relationships, expedited pathways, and integrated expertise all help to ensure a regulatory strategy that drives innovation rather than simply satisfying requirements.

hVIVO understands that regulatory strategy is essential, making the difference between success and delay, or confidence and uncertainty. Sponsors opting to partner with experienced regulatory experts will do more than meet obligations; they will gain a competitive edge in the race to provide improved therapies to patients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Why is cryopreservation needed for disaster prevention?","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260116/Why-is-cryopreservation-needed-for-disaster-prevention.aspx","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:29:00 GMT","

Cryogenic laboratories carry significant responsibility, including the safe storage of samples for researchers, medical teams, IVF patients, and others. From a financial perspective, these samples can be worth millions, while on a personal level, many are simply irreplaceable.

For any laboratory manager, the thought that an uncontrollable event could destroy those samples is a daunting prospect.

External power outages, equipment malfunctions, alarm failures, or disruptions to liquid nitrogen supply all have the potential to compromise stored samples. In addition to the financial liability associated with sample loss, the reputational impact could be devastating for a laboratory or clinic.

Although complete system failures are relatively rare and therefore often overlooked, they do occur, and when they do, the consequences can be severe.

There have been several incidents in recent years where a combination of circumstances resulted in the loss of cryopreserved samples.

In late 2023, for example, a freezer malfunction led to the loss of decades of research, primarily focused on leukemia, at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. In 2019, a hospital in Los Angeles lost 56 stem cell samples from pediatric cancer patients due to freezer failure.

In 2012, legal action was taken against Edinburgh's Western General Hospital following damage to stored sperm samples caused by freezer issues. Two separate fertility clinics in Ohio and San Francisco were also sued after catastrophic cryostorage failures.

In another 2012 incident, a hospital in Rome lost 94 embryos when liquid nitrogen levels were no longer sufficient. While the hospital attributed the issue to its liquid nitrogen supplier, an alarm had indicated rising temperatures but went unheard because it was located in the basement, while the laboratory was on the floor above.

Cases such as these highlight the importance of every laboratory having a well-defined emergency plan in place. It is difficult to overstate the importance of such preparation.

An article published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States provides an example of the contingency planning used in cryogenic storage facilities to manage power outages caused by hurricanes.

Every laboratory is different, with its own variables and risks. Preparing for all potential scenarios requires an assessment tailored to the specific facility. The challenge is knowing where to begin.

This long-standing principle is especially relevant in cryogenic storage. Preparing for worst-case scenarios requires advance planning for failures that could occur at any time. What happens if power is lost? What if a freezer fails? What if there is an issue with the liquid nitrogen line or a disruption somewhere along the LN2 supply chain?

Adopting a “what if” approach is the foundation of effective emergency planning. Reviewing each potential issue helps identify vulnerabilities, allowing safeguards to be implemented that protect storage integrity, reduce risk, and ensure regulatory compliance.

The Air Products Biomedical team regularly advises customers on potential failure points and how to strengthen cryogenic storage systems. Two of the most common vulnerabilities identified involve power outages and equipment failure.

A range of solutions addresses these risks. Hospitals and universities may already have uninterruptible power supplies or emergency generators in place, and some liquid nitrogen freezers come equipped with battery backup systems.

To address equipment failure, some organizations maintain backup freezers on standby, although for many laboratories, this approach can be inefficient or cost-prohibitive.

In the event of a failure, effective mitigation depends largely on one factor: time. The more time available before samples reach critical temperatures, the greater the likelihood that they can be preserved without damage.

For this reason, Air Products emphasizes solutions that maximize response time, such as backup power systems, alarm functionality, and remote monitoring that provides immediate notification of failures.

This is also why high-efficiency liquid nitrogen freezers, including those in the MVE range, are often recommended over ultra-low temperature freezers. While ULT freezers typically offer a hold time of up to 96 hours, High Efficiency models can provide hold times ranging from 13 to 27 days, depending on the model. This significantly increases safety margins and supports uninterrupted preservation.

While it is impossible to anticipate every scenario that could disrupt cryogenic storage, the importance of preparation cannot be overstated. Every laboratory should implement a basic checklist to reduce the risk of serious incidents:

This checklist serves as a starting point. Many other issues can arise in cryogenic storage facilities, and it is always better to be overly prepared.

Every storage facility is unique, and many laboratory managers lack the time or specialized expertise required to conduct thorough risk assessments and implement appropriate safeguards.

Working with an experienced and trusted partner can therefore be invaluable in helping ensure that a laboratory is resilient enough to avoid potentially catastrophic events. The Air Products Biomedical team is available as a long-term strategic partner, offering expert guidance based on existing infrastructure, operational needs, location, and budget.

For organizations planning upgrades or new facilities, Air Products can support decision-making that promotes long-term sample security, scalability, and sustainability.

Guidance is also available for integrating new technologies into existing systems, balancing cost and risk for backup solutions, and establishing effective emergency protocols and training programs.

These services are designed to help laboratories define priorities, strengthen operational resilience, and provide lasting peace of mind.

A new review reveals how complications after overseas cosmetic and weight-loss surgery are landing back in UK hospitals, exposing serious risks for patients and unresolved pressures for the NHS.

Study: Complications and costs to the UK National Health Service due to outward medical tourism for elective surgery: a rapid review. Image credit: Pla2na/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in BMJ Open, researchers examined reported cases of complications linked to outward medical tourism from the UK, residents traveling abroad for elective surgery, and the implications for NHS care on patients' return.

They found that outward medical tourism, mainly involving bariatric, metabolic, and cosmetic surgery, with only a small number of ophthalmic cases, can lead to serious postoperative complications requiring the use of NHS services.

Outward medical tourism refers to people travelling abroad to obtain elective medical procedures that are not urgently required. This practice has grown steadily over recent decades, as suggested by earlier estimates and policy analyses. It has been supported by low-cost international travel and online marketing by overseas providers. While such travel may benefit individual patients by reducing costs or shortening waiting times, it raises concerns for health systems in patients' home countries.

For the UK NHS, outward medical tourism poses challenges because patients may return with complications requiring follow-up care, hospital admission, or further surgery. These complications can be difficult to manage when details of the original procedure are incomplete or unavailable. Previous evidence suggests that wound infections, poor healing, sepsis, and organ failure are among the most common and severe outcomes, particularly after cosmetic and bariatric surgery.

Although estimates suggest a large and growing number of UK residents seek medical care abroad, the scale, costs, and consequences for the NHS remain unclear. Earlier research highlighted variable motivations for travel, limited patient awareness of risks, and reliance on NHS services to manage complications.

Researchers conducted a rapid review design to synthesize UK-based evidence on the costs, complications, and benefits of outward medical tourism undertaken for elective procedures, seeking to provide insights for policy and practice. They followed recognized guidance for such reviews, adhered to established reporting standards, and prospectively registered the study.

Comprehensive searches were conducted across multiple medical and scientific databases, covering studies published during 2012, 24. Additionally, citation tracking and searches of grey literature were undertaken, with relevant earlier studies identified from a previous review.

Eligible studies were quantitative or descriptive UK-based reports examining complications, costs, or benefits to the NHS resulting from elective surgery undertaken abroad. Case reports, case series, surveys, conference abstracts, and grey literature were included, while opinion pieces were excluded. Emergency, cancer, fertility, dental, and transplant-related tourism were also excluded.

Screening and data extraction were primarily conducted by one reviewer, with quality checks by additional reviewers. Outcomes included types of surgery, complications, NHS resource use, and treatment costs. Data were synthesized narratively, complications graded where possible, and reported costs were adjusted to 2024 prices. The study quality and overall certainty of evidence were evaluated using standardized tools.

The search identified 38 reports describing 37 studies published between 2007 and 2025. These studies reported on 655 patients treated by the NHS for complications following elective surgery abroad. Most evidence related to bariatric, metabolic surgery, 385 patients, and cosmetic surgery, 265 patients, while ophthalmic surgery accounted for only five reported cases. No studies reported benefits or savings to the NHS.

Most patients were women, around 90 percent, with an average age of 38 years. The most common destination country was Turkey, accounting for over 60 percent of reported cases. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most frequent bariatric procedure, while abdominoplasty and breast surgery dominated cosmetic procedures.

At least 53 percent of patients experienced severe complications, often requiring surgery, prolonged hospitalisation, or intensive treatment. Although no deaths were reported, hospital stays were substantial, averaging 17 days for bariatric surgery complications and 6 days for cosmetic surgery complications. These figures were derived from subsets of reported cases rather than from comprehensive national data.

Reported NHS costs ranged from £1,058 to £19,549 per patient at 2024 prices. Longer hospital stays and surgical interventions were the main drivers of cost. However, the evidence base was weak, and cost estimates were likely to be underreported due to missing or incomplete data.

The rapid review shows that outbound medical tourism for elective surgery can result in serious complications that place considerable demands on NHS specialist hospital services, particularly in secondary and tertiary care, as reported. Most cases involved bariatric or cosmetic surgery, with no evidence of financial or system-level benefits to the NHS.

A major strength of the review is its comprehensive and systematic search, including grey literature, and its capture of data from over 650 patients. However, the evidence base is limited by retrospective case reports and small case series, high risk of bias, incomplete reporting, and poor generalisability. Many studies only included emergency presentations, likely underestimating the true burden.

Overall, there is little certainty about the evidence on costs, and key gaps remain, particularly regarding primary care impacts, long-term outcomes, and population-level estimates. The authors caution that current evidence does not allow reliable quantification of the overall national impact on the NHS. The findings highlight the need for clear NHS policy on postoperative responsibility, better public information about risks, and improved data collection to support informed decision-making and future health service planning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Smoking cessation drug shows promise for treating cannabis use disorder","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260115/Smoking-cessation-drug-shows-promise-for-treating-cannabis-use-disorder.aspx","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:03:00 GMT","

A new randomized controlled trial has found promising evidence that the smoking cessation medication varenicline (Chantix/Champix) can help people with cannabis use disorder (CUD) to reduce cannabis use. CUD is a rising problem globally, partly due to recent legalization in several countries and US states, and until now no medications have been found to treat it. 

CUD is characterized by continued use of cannabis despite 'clinically significant impairment' such as ignoring important social, occupational, or recreational activities and persistent use despite physical or psychological problems associated with cannabis. Cannabis use is also associated with psychosis, sleep disorders, withdrawal, and mood and anxiety disorders.

Varenicline is an effective medication for quitting tobacco. This trial, conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina and published in Addiction, tested whether varenicline could help with CUD. Results showed it helped men reduce cannabis use, but not women. (Varenicline works equally well for both sexes as a stop-smoking aid.)

The trial included 174 participants with CUD who used cannabis at least three days per week. Participants were randomized to varenicline (working up to a dose of 1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants also received a weekly brief medical management session to encourage their adherence to both the medication and the treatment plan.

The men in the study who received varenicline used cannabis fewer times per week than the men on placebo. Specifically, the varenicline group averaged 7.9 cannabis sessions per week during the study and 5.7 sessions in the week following the study, compared with more than 12 weekly sessions for the placebo group. The male varenicline group also used cannabis an average of 3.8 days per week, compared with 4.7 days per week for the male placebo group.

The women in the study who received varenicline did not differ in their cannabis use from the women on placebo. The varenicline group averaged just over 10 sessions per week, compared with the placebo group's 9.2 weekly sessions (which dropped to 8.2 in the week following the study). The female varenicline group used cannabis an average of 4.9 days per week, compared with 3.6 days for the female placebo group.

The female varenicline group showed higher withdrawal and craving scores and higher anxiety than any of the other groups. Perhaps connected with that, women receiving varenicline reported lower medication adherence than women receiving placebo.

Cannabis use disorder is rising quickly in the United States. Current pharmacological treatment options are very limited, and so our ability to help people reduce their cannabis use is also limited. Our study found that varenicline, a drug that helps people to reduce or stop smoking, may be effective at reducing cannabis use as well, but only for men. Our next step is to further explore varenicline for cannabis use disorder, using a larger sample size of women, to better understand this sex difference in the treatment outcome. In the meantime, we are encouraged that varenicline shows potential promise in treating this fast-growing problem.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study connects adolescent exercise with breast cancer risk biomarkers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Study-connects-adolescent-exercise-with-breast-cancer-risk-biomarkers.aspx","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:27:00 GMT","

Recreational physical activity may be associated with breast tissue composition and biomarkers of stress in adolescent girls, according to a new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC). The findings shed new light on how physical activity during adolescence-a critical period of breast development-may influence biological pathways related to future breast cancer risk.

In adult women, higher levels of recreational physical activity (RPA) are consistently linked to a lower risk of breast cancer, with studies showing roughly a 20 percent reduction in risk among the most active women compared with the least active. Until now, however, the biological mechanisms underlying this association-particularly earlier in life-have remained poorly understood. The new study provides some of the first evidence linking RPA to breast tissue composition and stress-related biomarkers in adolescent girls. The findings are published in the journal Breast Cancer Research.

The importance and urgency of this research are underscored by the rising incidence of breast cancer in young women and the alarmingly low levels of recreational physical activity observed both in this study and among adolescents across the United States and globally. Our findings suggest that recreational physical activity is associated with breast tissue composition and stress biomarker changes in adolescent girls, independent of body fat, which could have important implications for breast cancer risk.""

Rebecca Kehm, PhD, assistant professor of Epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, and first author of the study

Girls who reported engaging in at least two hours of recreational physical activity in the prior week, compared with none, had lower percent water content in breast tissue-an indicator of lower breast density- and lower concentrations of urinary biomarkers linked to stress. These findings align with previous research in adult women showing that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower mammographic breast density, a key predictor of breat cancer risk.The researchers analyzed data from the population-based Columbia Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program Study, which draws from the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) Mothers and Newborns birth cohort. Participants were originally recruited to the cohort between 1998 and 2006 from prenatal clinics at NewYork-Presbyterian and Harlem Hospital, as well as affiliated satellite clinics, serving urban neighborhoods including Washington Heights, Central Harlem, and the South Bronx.

During adolescence, participants self-reported past-week engagement in recreational physical activity, including both organized and unorganized activities, and completed clinic visits that included blood and urine collection as well as breast tissue assessments.

The average age of girls in the study was 16 years, and 64 percent identified as Hispanic. More than half (51 percent) reported no recreational physical activity in the past week. Seventy-three percent reported no participation in organized activities, and 66 percent reported no participation in unorganized activities.

""Our research has several strengths, including the use of multiple biomarkers measured in urine, blood, and breast tissue,"" said Mary Beth Terry, PhD, Columbia Mailman School professor of Epidemiology, and senior author of the study. ""We measured biomarkers of stress and chronic inflammation that are widely validated and commonly used in epidemiologic research, enhancing confidence in our findings. Importantly, this research was conducted in a population-based, urban cohort of Black/African American and Hispanic girls-groups that are historically underrepresented in research and face persistent disparities in both physical activity levels and breast cancer outcomes.""

""Our study population of urban Hispanic (Dominican) and non-Hispanic Black/African American adolescent girls is critical to include in breast cancer research,"" added Kehm, who is also affiliated with HICCC. ""These groups not only have been historically underrepresented in studies but they face higher risks of developing breast cancer at younger ages and of experiencing more aggressive subtypes. At the same time, Black and Hispanic girls consistently report lower levels of recreational physical activity than their non-Hispanic White peers.""

The authors note that additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine how these adolescent biomarkers may translate into breast cancer risk later in life, and say the findings underscore the potential importance of promoting physical activity early in development.

In the largest Medicare Advantage fraud settlement to date, Kaiser Permanente has agreed to pay $556 million to settle Justice Department allegations that it billed the government for medical conditions patients didn't have.

The settlement, announced Jan. 14, resolves whistleblower lawsuits that accused the giant health insurer of mounting a years-long scheme in which it overstated how sick patients were to illegally boost revenues.

""Medicare Advantage is a vital program that must serve patients' needs, not corporate profits,"" said U.S. Attorney Craig Missakian for the Northern District of California, in announcing the settlement.

""Fraud on Medicare costs the public billions annually, so when a health plan knowingly submits false information to obtain higher payments, everyone — from beneficiaries to taxpayers — loses,"" he said.

Medicare Advantage plans offer seniors a private alternative to original Medicare. The insurance plans have grown dramatically in recent years and now enroll about 34 million members, more than half of the people eligible for Medicare. About 2 million Medicare members are enrolled in KP plans.

Attorney Max Voldman, who represents whistleblower James Taylor, said the case shows the need for a ""continued effort to fight fraud in health care.""

""It's important to send a signal to the industry, and this number hopefully does that,"" he said.

Taylor, a longtime Kaiser Permanente physician, filed his suit against the company in October 2014.

""It was a long, hard-fought case,"" Voldman said.

The Justice Department took over his case, bundled with others, in July 2021. In court filings, the government argued the health plan ""pressured"" doctors in Colorado and California to add diagnoses ""regardless of whether these conditions were actually considered or addressed by the physician during the patient visits,"" policies that violated Medicare requirements.

From 2009 through 2018, KP added roughly half a million diagnoses that generated about $1 billion in improper payments to the health plan, according to the complaint.

The government pays Medicare Advantage plans higher rates to cover sicker patients. But over the past decade, dozens of whistleblower lawsuits, government audits, and other investigations have alleged that health plans exaggerate how sick patients are to pocket payments they don't deserve, a tactic known in the industry as ""upcoding.""

The Justice Department alleged that Kaiser Permanente officials knew its practices were ""widespread and unlawful"" but that the company ""ignored numerous red flags and internal warnings that it was violating"" Medicare rules. In settling the case, KP did not admit any wrongdoing.

In a statement posted on its website, the company said it settled the case ""to avoid the delay, uncertainty, and cost of prolonged litigation.""

The company noted that other health plans had ""faced similar government scrutiny"" over Medicare Advantage billing practices. It said the whistleblower cases ""involved a dispute about how to interpret"" Medicare's billing requirements.

The civil suits were filed under the False Claims Act, a federal law that permits private citizens to sue on behalf of the government and share any money collected as a result.

In all, six whistleblowers filed cases against Kaiser Permanente. In June 2021, the District Court for the Northern District of California consolidated the cases into two, one brought by Taylor and the other by Ronda Osinek, also a former KP employee.

Osinek, who trained physicians on medical coding guidelines, filed her case in August 2013. In her suit, she alleged that Kaiser Permanente inflated claims submitted to Medicare by having doctors amend medical files, often months after a patient's visit, to slap on diagnoses that were not treated at the time or didn't exist.

Under the settlement, the whistleblowers, known as ""relators,"" are set to receive a combined $95 million, according to the Justice Department.

The KP settlement comes on the heels of a Senate report this month that accused UnitedHealth Group of ""gaming"" the Medicare Advantage payment system, which is called ""risk adjustment.""

""My investigation has shown UnitedHealth Group appears to be gaming the system and abusing the risk adjustment process to turn a steep profit,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a statement accompanying the report's release.

Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his findings were based on a review of more than 50,000 pages of internal company documents. UnitedHealth Group disputed the findings and has long denied that its coding practice triggers improper payments.

The report cited several medical conditions that have repeatedly been linked to overbilling by Medicare Advantage plans, such as coding for opioid dependence disorder in patients who are taking their medications as directed for pain.

The Senate report also alleged that Medicare Advantage plans have improperly diagnosed dementia.

The report said that Medicare removed dementia from its list of codes in 2014 partly due to concerns over upcoding. After the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reintroduced the code in 2020, researchers found that ""annual incident dementia diagnosis rates in MA increased by 11.5%"" relative to traditional Medicare, the report said.

""Medicare Advantage is an important option for America's seniors, but as the program adds more patients and spends billions in taxpayer dollars, Congress has a responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight,"" Grassley said. ""Bloated federal spending to UnitedHealth Group is not only hurting the Medicare Advantage program, it's harming the American taxpayer.""

Obesity causes hypertension. Hypertension causes cardiovascular disease. And cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. While the link between fat and high blood pressure is clearly central to this deadly chain, its biological basis long remained unclear. What is it about fat that impacts vascular function and blood pressure control?

Now, a new study demonstrates how thermogenic beige fat-a type of adipose tissue, distinct from white fat, that helps the body burn energy-directly shapes blood pressure control. Building on clinical evidence that people with brown fat have lower odds of hypertension, the researchers created mouse models that cannot form beige fat (the thermogenic fat depot in mice that most closely resembles adult human brown fat) to watch what happens when this tissue is lost. They found that the loss of beige fat increases the sensitivity of blood vessels to one of the most important vasoconstricting hormones (angiotensin II)-and that blocking an enzyme involved in stiffening vessels and disrupting normal signaling can restore healthy vascular function in mice. These results, published in Science, reveal a previously unknown mechanism driving high blood pressure and point toward more precise therapies that target communication between fat and blood vessels.

We've known for a really long time that obesity raises the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, but the underlying biology has never been fully understood. We now know that it's not just fat, per se, but the type of fat-in this case, beige fat-that influences how the vasculature functions and regulates the whole body's blood pressure.""

Paul Cohen, head of the Weslie R. and William H. Janeway Laboratory of Molecular Metabolism

Cohen and colleagues were well aware that brown fat held clues to the mystery of hypertension. Found in newborns, animals, and some adults (typically around the neck and shoulders) brown fat burns energy and generates heat, unlike its better known cousin, white fat, which stores calories. Prior work from the lab had shown that individuals with more brown fat have significantly lower odds of hypertension and other cardiometabolic disorders. But this patient data could only establish correlation. Demonstrating causation-and uncovering the mechanism at play-would require controlled experiments in the lab.

""We knew there was a link between thermogenic adipose tissue-brown fat-and hypertension, but we had no mechanistic understanding of why,"" says Mascha Koenen, a postdoctoral fellow in the Cohen lab.

So the team engineered mouse models that were healthy in every way except for one: a complete loss of beige fat identity, the murine counterpart of inducible brown fat seen in adult humans. By deleting the Prdm16 gene specifically in fat cells, the researchers selectively removed beige fat identity in otherwise healthy mice, isolating the beige fat variable from confounding factors, such as obesity or inflammation. ""We didn't want the model to be analogous to an obese versus lean individual,"" Koenen explains. ""We wanted the only difference to be whether the fat cells in the mouse were white or beige. In that way, the engineered mice represent a healthy individual who just happens to not have brown fat.""

It was a seemingly minor change with outsize impact. The fat that wraps around the blood vessels of these engineered mice began expressing the markers of white fat, including angiotensinogen, a precursor to a major hormone that increases blood pressure. The mice had elevated blood pressure and mean arterial pressure, and tissue analysis revealed that stiff, fibrous tissue had begun to accumulate around the vessels. And when the team tested arteries from these animals, they found that the vessels had developed a striking hypersensitivity to angiotensin II, one of the body's strongest blood pressure signals.

""We were surprised to find such drastic remodeling of adipose tissue lining the vasculature,"" Koenen says.

Further, single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that, absent beige fat, vascular cells had switched on a gene program that promotes stiff, fibrous tissue, which makes blood vessels less flexible, forces the heart to pump harder, and raises blood pressure. To pinpoint the signal responsible for these changes, the team tested secreted mediators released by fat cells deficient in beige fat, and found that transfer of this fluid onto vascular cells alone could activate the genes that promote fibrous tissue.

With the help of large gene and protein expression datasets, the researchers identified a single enzyme secreted by these adipocytes, QSOX1, which has been tied to tissue remodeling in cancer. They discovered that beige fat normally keeps QSOX1 turned off but, when beige identity is lost, the enzyme is overproduced and this kicks off a cascade of events that lead to hypertension. Finally, to confirm that QSOX1 was the culprit, the team engineered mice with neither Prdm16 nor Qsox1. These mice, as predicted, did not have beige fat or vascular dysfunction.

Together, the data reveal an obesity-independent signaling axis in which the loss of beige fat identity unleashes QSOX1, triggering harmful remodeling of blood vessels and raising blood pressure. The researchers also report that, in large clinical cohorts, people carrying mutations in PRDM16-the same gene whose loss activates QSOX1 in mice-show higher blood pressure, indicating that their observations of beige fat and hypertension in mice translate well to humans.

The study is a victory for a scientific methodology known as ""reverse translation,"" often employed by physician-scientists like Cohen. In this case, Cohen, who treats patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering, used mouse models in the lab to explain a puzzling phenomenon manifesting in his human patients. This iterative cycle between human biology and mechanistic experimentation uncovered a new molecular entry point for understanding, and potentially treating, hypertension.

The findings here advance the Cohen lab's overarching mission to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which obesity drives downstream disease, offering a new mechanistic explanation for an obesity-associated condition. These results could open broad avenues for future work, from examining how QSOX1 reshapes the scaffolding around blood vessels and pinpointing which parts of the angiotensin receptor it may alter, to exploring how differences in fat surrounding the vasculature influences where disease is most likely to develop.

The results also raise the possibility of future therapeutic approaches for hypertension, including the prospect of targeting QSOX1. ""The more we know about these molecular links, the more we can move towards conceiving of a world where we can recommend targeted therapies based on an individual's medical and molecular characteristics,"" Cohen says.

Subtle abnormalities in kidney function – even within the range considered normal – may help identify people at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. This is shown in a new study from Karolinska Institutet, published in Kidney International. The researchers have therefore developed a web-based tool that could aid in early detection and thus primary prevention.

Chronic kidney disease is a growing global health concern afflicting 10−15 per cent of adults worldwide and is projected to become one of the top five leading causes of years of life lost by 2040. In the absence of effective screening programmes, patients are often diagnosed late, when more than half of their kidney function has already been lost.

To address this gap, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have constructed population-based distributions for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) - the most widely used measure of kidney function. The aim is to help doctors identify people at risk, thus enabling early preventive action.

We were inspired by the growth and weight charts used in paediatrics, which intuitively help clinicians identify children at risk of obesity or undergrowth.""

The researchers have made their eGFR distribution charts openly available to healthcare professionals and developed a web-based calculator, developed by PhD student Antoine Creon, that can help assess how a patient's eGFR compares with population norms for their age.

The study included over 1.1 million adults in the region of Stockholm, Sweden, covering roughly 80 per cent of the population aged between 40 and 100 years. Nearly seven million eGFR tests collected between 2006 and 2021 were used to construct age- and sex-specific distributions.

The findings show that departures from the median eGFR for one's age and sex are associated with worse outcomes. Individuals with an eGFR below the 25th percentile had a markedly higher risk of developing kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. Mortality also displayed a U-shaped relationship; both low and high percentile extremes were linked to increased risk of death.

The study also illustrates this lack of awareness in healthcare, according to the researchers. Among those with a seemingly normal eGFR above 60 ml/min/1.73 m², but below the 25th percentile, only one fourth had received additional testing for urinary albumin, which is important for detecting early kidney damage.

""For example, consider a 55-year-old woman with an eGFR of 80. Most clinicians would not react to such a seemingly normal value. However, our charts show that this corresponds to the 10th percentile for women of that age, and that she has a three-fold higher risk of starting dialysis in the future. This signals an opportunity to act earlier,"" says Juan Jesús Carrero, professor at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet.

The study is part of the SCREAM project and has been funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, Region Stockholm and the Swedish Kidney Foundation, among others. The researchers report no conflicts of interest related to the content of the study.

Sickle cell anemia is the world's most common genetic disorder. It causes the red blood pigment hemoglobin to crystallize, which results in rigid, malformed red blood cells with a sickle shape. This impairs the cells' mobility and causes severe complications, including circulatory disorders, organ failure, a significantly shortened life expectancy and reduced quality of life - especially in children and adolescents.

The disease, which is hereditary, can be treated with hydroxyurea. When taken regularly, this drug can improve quality of life; however, it is not well tolerated by all patients. A bone marrow transplant is another possibility, but there is a lack of suitable donors and other treatments, such as gene therapies or therapeutic antibodies, come with extremely high costs. Now, an international team led by Max Gassmann, professor emeritus of veterinary physiology at the University of Zurich, is pursuing an alternative and significantly more cost-effective approach. More specifically, they are investigating the potential application of the Alzheimer's drug memantine in the treatment of sickle cell anemia, a use outside its approved indication. Memantine has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease for about 20 years, meaning it is no longer patentable.

In previous preclinical studies, researchers demonstrated that memantine has a stabilizing effect on red blood cells. They then investigated the drug's safety and tolerability in a phase II study. ""In the best case, memantine would be available for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, as a well-tolerated, easy-to-store, and very cost-effective drug that is no longer patent-protected,"" says Max Gassmann. This would be particularly significant for countries with a high disease burden and limited resources, for example Africa or certain places in India.

A total of 17 study participants received age-appropriate doses of memantine for 12 months. The research team took several key findings from the study: the treatment was well tolerated, and more than 25 laboratory parameters confirmed the drug's safety over a period of two to three years. At the same time, a clear clinical benefit was demonstrated: both the number and duration of hospitalizations decreased significantly. Children in particular experienced fewer painful flare-ups. No serious side effects or discontinuations of the study due to the therapy itself were observed.

All patients involved in the study continued their existing hydroxyurea therapy, as discontinuing it would have been unethical. ""The observed effects should therefore be interpreted as complementary to hydroxyurea,"" Gassmann explains. The research team is now planning a follow-up study that will, for the first time, include patients who have not received hydroxyurea treatment, in order to allow a systematic analysis of combination therapies. This approach aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of memantine in a comprehensive and evidence-based way.

Futbol W's Cristina Alexander and Ali Krieger, alongside Natalia Astrain, discuss Emily Fox as the highest-ranked USWNT player in ESPN FC Women's Rank. (1:53)

Gotham FC and United States women's national team midfielder Rose Lavelle has been voted U.S. Soccer's Female Player of the Year for 2025.

Lavelle carried 29.2% of the weighted vote, followed by Sam Coffey (23.9%) and Catarina Macario (22.3%).

Voters for the award were collected from respective U.S. national team coaches, U.S. national team players who earned a cap in 2025, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, National Women's Soccer League head coaches and select media members and administrators.

Lavelle, 30, was sidelined by an ankle injury for much of the first half of the year, but went on to make six appearances for the USWNT, scoring three goals and adding three assists.

The Cincinnati, Ohio, native had an even bigger impact at club level.

After scoring six goals and adding two assists during the regular season, she led Gotham to the 2025 NWSL Championship, scoring the game winner in the final to defeat the Washington Spirit 1-0.

That tally saw her not only earn the game's MVP award, but she became the first player to score in two NWSL Championships as well as a FIFA Women's World Cup final.

""When I look at the past year, it feels like a testament to the support system I had, with my family, the medical staff at Gotham and with the National Team, all my teammates, coaches and friends,"" Lavelle said in a statement.

""I wouldn't have been in the position to even be up for the award without all of the support I received throughout the year just to get back on the field. So, this award is definitely shared with all the people I was lucky enough to have in my corner along the way.""

Lavelle's club teammate, Lilly Reale was voted U.S. Soccer's Young Female Player of the year. Reale earned 48% of the weighted vote, followed by Jordyn Bugg (29.6%) and Micayla Johnson (16.1%).

In her rookie season, Reale had a significant impact, logging 2,217 minutes in 29 matches across all competitions.

""This year in particular has been one marked by major growth moments, joy and lots of lessons,"" Reale said. ""Through it all, I feel so lucky to have been surrounded by such charismatic teammates, coaches and fans.

""Being able to play alongside many of my role models and represent my country at the highest level is something that I'll never take for granted.""

After starting the year with the U.S. U23 team, Reale made her USWNT debut with a start on June 26 against Ireland and not only helped the team to a shutout but also recorded her first career international assist. She went on to make six appearances for the USWNT in 2025.

The U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year has been awarded since 1985 when midfielder Sharon Remer earned the first Female Player of the Year honor.

Abby Wambach won the award six times, the most of any player. Mia Hamm won it five times. Lavelle is the 22nd different player to win the award.

Reale marks the 28th player to be named the U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, an award a player can win only once.

The first time it was awarded, back in 1998, was to current U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","‘Unmatched: The Team That Changed the Beautiful Game' tells story of legendary Pilots women's soccer team","https://www.upbeacon.com/article/2026/01/unmatched-the-team-that-changed-the-beautiful-game-tells-story-of-legendary-pilots-womens-soccer-team","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:03:05 GMT","









The upcoming documentary “Unmatched: The Team That Changed the Beautiful Game” will make a bold claim: The trajectory of women's soccer and women's sports was forever altered by one University of Portland team. 

Conceived and directed by filmmaker and UP alum Joe Kuffner, the film tells the story of the 2005 women's soccer team, which won a national championship and featured sports icons Megan Rapinoe and Christine Sinclair on its roster.

The project is currently being filmed, with no firm release date set, according to Kuffner. 

Kuffner describes the film's storylines in three “buckets:” the team and its historic win, the alums it produced — including the leading goal scorer in international soccer history and a leading advocate of equal pay for the U.S. Women's National Team — and Portland, a city that has since embraced women's soccer. 

“There's greatness on the field [and] change makers off the field in the city that supports women's soccer unlike any other place in the world,” Kuffner said. “So that's kind of like the little elevator pitch.”

A central argument of the documentary is the team's impact on the state of women's sports today. Kuffner believes the 2005 team's win spurred the next nine years of NCAA average attendance records for the program, which prepared the city for the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) Portland Thorns.

“This city had been primed by decades of treating women's soccer seriously,” Kuffner said. “If [the NWSL] didn't work in Portland, it couldn't work anywhere.”

The Thorns' success then strengthened a young NWSL, turning it into the valuable enterprise it is today. 

“I think you can easily make an argument that the NWSL wouldn't have lasted if it wasn't for the Portland Thorns and the support that team had early on to carry the league,” Kuffner said. “And I think you can just as easily say that the Thorns wouldn't have had that type of success without those UP teams that came before them.” 

Kuffner's idea for the film was born out of creative necessity. After leading another documentary following cancer patients through clinical trials for his day job at Providence Health, he started searching for his next story around the time of Rapinoe and Sinclair's retirements from their respective international teams. Kuffner thought back to his college days at UP, where he sat in classrooms with the legendary players, and found a concept he couldn't let go of. 

“I don't know if there was a single moment, but it was a sort of realization that these two incredible global icons were college teammates at this tiny school, and the buzz around the city was real,” Kuffner said. “So it was just like, ‘Oh my gosh. This is a worthy story that needs to be told. It's an underdog story. It's a story about everything.'”

Kuffner is uniquely positioned to lead the project. He not only graduated from UP in 2005 but also grew up going to UP soccer games as a kid, hanging posters of legendary female Pilots on his bedroom wall, and eventually worked in the school's marketing department post-grad. 

“I was there at Merlo Field's first game when it opened,” Kuffner said. “I grew up with posters of Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan on my wall. So just having that deep connection, knowing all the people at the university, there's a lot of trust there.”

Kuffner reached out to UP's athletics department with the film idea in early 2024, and the university has since helped connect him with sources and granted him access to records and photos, though Kuffner and his team maintain full editorial control. 

Jason Brough, senior associate athletic director, received Kuffner's call and was immediately on board with the idea. 

“I loved it,” Brough said. “I think, as Joe's trying to point out in the documentary, [the success of the NWSL] kind of started here, and I think the University of Portland had a lot to do with that. We're filling Pioneer Courthouse Square with the city coming out to support [the 2005 team] in the middle of December. I don't think there's any place that had more of a community buy-in.”

The documentary will include a wide-ranging cast to tell its story. So far, the “Unmatched” crew has completed 27 interviews. Along with team members and soccer personnel, they've spoken with folks like Andrew Guest, a UP professor who's researched women's soccer, and Jenny Nguyen, founder of women's sports-only sports bar, The Sports Bra, according to Kuffner. 

Jen Tate, the film's producer, says one of her favorite aspects of the project is hearing about the team's bond and shared memories. 

“I think each individual has their own experience, but they also have something collective that they shared,” Tate said. “Getting to hear how they describe each other and how they were each other's witness to this time and this greatness, that's a really cool thing to be able to tap into and ask someone about, like, ‘Tell me what it was like to be a part of this team, this magic.'” 



One of Kuffner's stand-out memories from filming was Rapinoe's interview in September of 2024, the first conversation the crew shot. Though the team's standard is around two hours, Kuffner only had 30 minutes to interview her, as Rapinoe was in town to be inducted into the UP Athletics Hall of Fame and had a packed schedule. 

As the minutes ticked by, people trickled in to watch the soccer star on camera. Rapinoe's fiancée, legendary women's basketball player Sue Bird, joined President Robert Kelly, Vice President of Athletics Scott Leykam, and Portland Magazine Editor Jessica Murphy Moo in “crashing” the interview. The pressure was on as Kuffner navigated the moment.

“I was like, ‘Oh my God. I hope I don't sound like a total idiot,'” Kuffner said. “But it was great. Megan really is that same person that I knew when I was a student. She's obviously a high-profile person, but she's very generous.”

Though “Unmatched” is a soccer film, Tate, who is not a big soccer fan herself, feels strongly that it can impact people from all walks of life. 

“This [team] is so important to this small group of people but so relatable, almost on a global level,” Tate said. “Anyone who hears the story will be like, ‘Oh yeah, we're gonna root for these underdogs.'”

While the documentary has no release date, the “Unmatched” team is aiming to complete filming this spring and hopes for a final cut by the end of 2026, in time for the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, according to Tate. 

The crew's next step is fundraising for post-production, seeking donations, grants and investors to hasten the film's progress. They've already won an Impact Grant from Oregon Film and an Amplify Portland Grant from the Portland Events & Film Office, according to Kuffner. 

Once the film reaches the public, Tate's goals for its impact are multifaceted. She says she loves the idea of creating “Portland heroes” for kids in the area through the stories of these players, and she sees value in creating something that positively depicts Portland as the city faces nationwide scrutiny.

She also wants “Unmatched” to be a feel-good experience that feels like an “easy choice” for anyone. 

“I love the idea of the easy – ‘Oh, this is what we're watching together as family tonight' — because it's good for the soul,'” Tate said. 

Kuffner hopes “Unmatched” reminds fans of their memories on Merlo Field and encourages more turnout for the Pilots, though the college sports landscape and the team's success has changed. 

“This is kind of a cheesy answer, but I genuinely hope that women's soccer fans in Portland watch this and remember how fun it was to come to games at UP [because] the business of college sports is so different now,” Kuffner said. “Maybe they're not top-five ranked or going to the Final Four every year. But [Merlo Field] is a beautiful place to see a game. I really hope that people remember how fun it was and come back.”

Rose Lavelle has been named the U.S. Soccer Player of the Year for 2025.

The midfielder was joined by her club teammate, Lilly Reale, who earned the U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year honors. Both players feature for Gotham FC, and won the 2025 National Women's Soccer League Championship with their club.

“When I look at the past year, it feels like a testament to the support system I had, with my family, the medical staff at Gotham and with the National Team, all my teammates, coaches and friends,” Lavelle said, via a press release. “I wouldn't have been in the position to even be up for the award without all of the support I received throughout the year just to get back on the field. So, this award is definitely shared with all the people I was lucky enough to have in my corner along the way.”

For country, Lavelle made her 2025 debut for the national team on June 26, against the Republic of Ireland, after missing time due to an ankle injury. In her return back to the national team, she scored once and assisted another goal. She started five of her six USWNT appearances in 2025. She scored in two other matches: a goal 34 seconds into the match against Portugal (Oct. 26) and once against New Zealand (Oct. 29).

For Gotham FC, Lavelle started 13 of 16 regular-season appearances, scoring five goals and providing two assists. The Cincinnati, Ohio, native started all three playoff appearances and scored the game-winning goal in the NWSL Championship, in a 1-0 victory against the Washington Spirit. She earned the game's MVP honor.

Lavelle earned 29.2 percent of the ‘weighted' vote, with midfielder Sam Coffey (23.9) and forward Catarina Macario (22.3) rounding out the top three. Other nominees were defender Emily Fox and forward Alyssa Thompson.

Meanwhile, Reale easily won the U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year honor with 48 percent of the ‘weighted' vote. Jordyn Bugg compiled 29.6 percent, and Micayla Johnson finished the top three with 16.1 percent of the vote. Other nominees were defender Pearl Cecil and forward Riley Tiernan. 

“I am constantly reminded of how special this National Team program is when I reflect on all of the relationships, knowledge, laughs and opportunities that U.S. Soccer has given me over the years,” Reale said, via a press release. “It was this environment where I first learned what it truly took to reach the next level and just how different each person's journey will look. This year in particular has been one marked by major growth moments, joy and lots of lessons. Through it all, I feel so lucky to have been surrounded by such charismatic teammates, coaches and fans.”

“Being able to play alongside many of my role models and represent my country at the highest level is something that I'll never take for granted,” she continued. “Looking back on all the incredible players that have won this award in past years only serves as added motivation for me to strive to follow in their footsteps. Thank you to everyone who has guided me on this journey, your support really means the world!”

Reale also took home the NWSL's Rookie of the Year award, beating out Maddie Dahlien of the Seattle Reign and Tiernan of Angel City FC. She was also named to the league's Second Best XI.

Reale has been a mixture in both the U.S. senior national team and the U-23 national team. She scored twice for the U-23 team against Germany, to lead the visitors to a 2-1 victory in Europe. Reale made her U.S. senior debut on June 26 against the Republic of Ireland, where she earned her first senior assist. She also featured against Canada (July 2), New Zealand (Oct. 29) and Italy (November).

U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award winners receive $10,000, donated by Henkel, for a charity or organization of the winner's choosing. Real chose the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, in her native Massachusetts.

ATLANTA – U.S. Men's National Team defender Chris Richards has been voted the 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year after an outstanding year in which he started 11 of 12 matches for which he was available for the USMNT and all six matches leading to the 2025 Gold Cup Final, a tournament in which he recorded two goals and earned a spot on the Best XI.

The Birmingham native has become a staple in the English Premier League with Crystal Palace FC, starting and playing the full 90 minutes in both domestic trophy wins, the FA Cup and Community Shield.

“It means a lot to me to join a very prestigious list of players,” Richards said. “This has been a big year, and we have an even bigger year coming up. This shows how well we've done as a team and the momentum we are building towards the World Cup.”

This is Richards' first U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year award and it comes in his first year being nominated. First recognized in 1984, a total of 28 players have won the award. The 25-year-old becomes the second consecutive defender to earn this recognition after Antonee Robinson won the award in 2024, marking the first time two defenders have won the award consecutively since Marcelo Balboa and Alexi Lalas in 1994 and 1995.

Richards was surprised with the news during an interview with Pat McAfee on the eponymous The Pat McAfee Show, which aired on ESPN earlier this afternoon.

“It was sick. I see Pat all the time on College GameDay. It was cool for him to announce this on his show and to give a shoutout,” Richards added. “It just shows how much the game is growing in the U.S., how much respect there is for the sport, and how much the excitement is building for the World Cup this summer.”

In a list of nominees that included defender Max Arfsten, defender Alex Freeman, goalkeeper Matt Freese and midfielder Malik Tillman, Richards won with 48.6 percent of the weighted total, followed by Tillman (21.7%) and Freeman (13%).

In addition to fan voting, votes for U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year are collected from National Team coaches, USMNT players who earned a cap in 2025, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, professional league head coaches and sporting directors, select media members and former players and administrators.

In 2025, Richards played the most games (12) and minutes (1004) of his career in a calendar year. The 25-year-old started at the center of defense for the U.S. in every game on the way to the 2025 Gold Cup Final, a tournament that he scored twice, including a header in the final against Mexico. A combination of leadership and strong performances led to his inclusion in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Best XI.

At the club level, Richards has established himself as a key fixture within the Crystal Palace defense. Throughout the 2024-25 season with The Eagles, he made 32 total appearances in all competitions, registering a goal and assist.

Richards backstopped Crystal Palace to a trophy at the end of the season, defeating Manchester City 1-0 in the 2025 FA Cup Final to collect the first FA Cup trophy in the club's history which dates back to 1861. Later that summer, Richards and Palace opened the 2025-26 season with a victory over Liverpool in penalty kicks in the 2025 Community Shield, with Richards once again going the distance.

Shaka Hislop talks about the potential impact that travelling between World Cup group stage games could have on the USMNT. (1:17)

Last year, it wasn't great.

Now, when I first started trying to rank the prospects of America's top, um, prospects a couple years back, it was great. Two years ago, Joe Scally, Gio Reyna, Malik Tillman, Ricardo Pepi, and Yunus Musah all made the list.

Then, time passed, they all got older, and nobody rose up to take their places. With those guys in the mix, my top tier of this 21-and-under ranking was labeled ""USMNT stars -- and potentially European stars, too."" By last year, that tier was empty. My second tier was ""Fringe USMNT starters, midtier European pros"" and that one: also empty! The first name on the list, kicking off the third tier, was Kevin Paredes, and he's barely played any professional soccer since the piece was published.

A lot can change in a year -- in either direction. So, has it? Have any new top prospects emerged? Or will the top two tiers be empty for the second year in a row? Although the U.S. men's national team has ceased its January camps -- which was typically a chance for fringe players to try to break through and the inspiration for this January list -- it's time to rerank the best players aged 21 or younger in the current player pool.

- Premier League table predicted: How will all 20 teams finish?
- What U.S. Soccer can do with a $100m windfall
- January transfer grades: All the biggest moves

Most prospect evaluators are concerned with tools -- what skills do you have that project to the next level? I'm not going to tell you that ""tools"" aren't important, but rather that I think actually identifying ""tools"" is quite difficult at the youth level, where the competition and the athleticism is so different than what it becomes in one of Europe's Big Five top leagues. And then, even when you establish what a player's ""tools"" are, it's really difficult to understand how those tools will carry into the highest level.

No one has really figured out how to confidently project senior players changing leagues -- or even teams within the same league -- and the youth-to-pro jump is way, way bigger than that.

I will not be giving you a list of 16-year-old players who might be the next USMNT star, because until a player starts actually playing professional soccer games, the range of outcomes are way too wide for it to even be worth trying to figure it out. There are Americans in the youth systems of pretty much every big club in the world, and that is likely going to pay off with a couple players who eventually become USMNT regulars, but the likelihood of any one of those individual players becoming a USMNT or European star is low.

Instead, I'm focused mainly on players who do the thing that predicts future success: play professional soccer minutes at a high level, at a young age. And there is one American currently doing that: Augsburg's Noahkai Banks. The 19-year-old center back has already played 1257 Bundesliga minutes, while no other 21-and-under American has featured in even 300 minutes in a Big Five league. Among all players across the Big Five leagues, not just Americans, only eight players who were 18-or-younger at the start of this season have played more minutes than Banks.

Oh, and these are the only American players who had played more minutes in a Big Five league by the end of their age-18 season than Banks currently has:

• Christian Pulisic
• Yunus Musah
• Gio Reyna
• Joe Scally
• Weston McKennie

If he keeps up his current pace, Banks will end the year with more minutes than all but Pulisic, Musah, and Reyna. And he's doing it at a position where players tend to peak at a more advanced age.

Augsburg are just two points clear of the relegation zone in the Bundesliga, but they've played way better when Banks has been on the field. It wouldn't shock me if he made the World Cup roster, and it wouldn't shock me if he actually played at the World Cup.

At American Soccer Analysis, they have their own, more advanced version of Stats Perform's expected possession value. It credits players for what they do with the ball and how that increases their team's chances of scoring, but it also credits players for receiving passes and for doing things that decrease their team's chances of conceding.

Based on this model, called Goals Added (G+), Alex Freeman just had the best season for a fullback in MLS since 2012, which is as far back as the G+ dataset goes.

Put a different way: you could argue that Freeman is the best fullback MLS has ever seen, and he doesn't turn 22 until after the World Cup. There's a very good chance he's playing in one of Europe's Big Five leagues at this time next year.

So why wasn't he even on the list last year? He'd played 11 total professional minutes before this past season. Projecting development: it's really hard.

These players all feel less exciting than some of the players we'll get to in the next tier. But for all the improvements MLS has made, it's still a massive leap to go from playing Real Salt Lake to Real Sociedad, Real Betis, and Real Madrid. So, I'm giving the edge to the players who have made the leap to Europe even if they've since mostly stalled out.

Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)

Caleb Wiley played a ton of minutes as a teenager in MLS, but he never really came close to playing at the same level that Freeman just showed. And it's not a great sign that Chelsea had him loaned out to Watford rather than their de facto farm team, Strasbourg. It's also not a great sign that they decided to cut his loan short and bring him back to Stamford Bridge this month. It's unlikely that he plays much, or at all, for the rest of this season.

Damion Downs signed with Southampton over the summer, rarely got on the field in the Championship, and is now back on loan in the Bundesliga, with Hamburg. Wiley and Banks are the only 21-and-under Americans who have played more Big Five career minutes than Downs -- although that number is only 251. But he started his first game back with Hamburg last week, so that number should keep increasing.

Cole Campbell is fourth on that Big Five minutes list with ... 36 minutes. Granted, he's only 19 and he plays for a much better parent club than any of these other guys. We'll see if his loan move to Hoffenheim for the rest of this season leads to more minutes.

Benjamin Cremaschi won the Golden Boot at the Under-20 World Cup last fall, and he's played 19 total minutes and completed three total passes since signing with Parma over the summer.

Last year, I refused to put Cavan Sullivan on the list because there's very little correlation between being the best 15-year-old soccer player and the best 24-year-old soccer player. The research on youth development, in fact, seems pretty clear on this specific point: the athletes that specialize later in life tend to have the highest ceilings, while the kids who peak in their teens at one specific activity tend to plateau.

This isn't to say that Sullivan can't or will not become a star, but rather that a lot is going to change over the next five years, let alone the next 10 years.

Since we last did this exercise, though, Sullivan made 11 appearances for one of the better teams in MLS. Across every league in the Stats Perform database, just one player who is 16 or younger, Leicester City's Jeremy Monga, has played more professional minutes than Sullivan's 449.

Gaga Slonina's last appearance in a league match was on Oct. 22 ... of 2024. And Diego Kochen's last appearance in a league match was -- just kidding, he's still yet to play a single minute as a professional.

At the same time, goalkeepers are trickier to judge across the same timeline as outfield players since only one plays in a given match.

Slonina did play a lot in MLS before joining Chelsea at 18, and then he got a bunch of minutes while on loan for a season-and-a-half at Belgian side Eupen and later Barnsley in England's second division. He's still only 21, and most starting keepers in the Big Five leagues and beyond are way older than that.

Kochen, meanwhile, was getting lots of call-ups to Barcelona's matchday squads, which is worth something, but that hasn't happened once this season. Still, he's 19 -- a long way away from when most keepers become starters in a major European league.

There's a world where they both become starters in the Champions League; there's also a world where neither one makes any impact on the USMNT at any point. So, I'm plopping them both directly in the middle of the rankings.

Rokas Pukstas feels like he's on the verge -- of something. He's been getting good minutes for a good team with a nice youth-production track record for a couple years now. He could make the jump to a Big Five league, he could land in the Eredivisie or the Belgian Pro League, or he could end up in MLS. Nothing would surprise me.

Quinn Sullivan has the most career goals and career assists of any player eligible for this list. Unfortunately, he tore his ACL back in September.

And then Luca Bombino, Peyton Miller, Zavier Gozo, and Joshua Wynder were all members of the under-20 World Cup team.

I have Bombino highest because young players who progress the ball up the field tend to become good pros, and he ranked in the 93rd percentile for progressive passes among MLS fullbacks last season. Miller is younger, more athletic, and has played more career minutes than Bombino. Gozo played a lot as an attacker in his age-17 season in MLS, and Wynder never plays with Benfica, but would almost definitely have racked up a ton of minutes at center back in MLS had he not moved to Portugal two years ago. He played nearly 3,000 minutes in the USL before turning 19.

As always, this tier ends with a much more arbitrary cut-off than the others. There are a lot of other players who would easily fit into this group but don't because I cut the list off at 15 every year. In fact, this tier (if we expanded it out) is more likely to produce a USMNT starter than our third tier or fourth tier, but most of the players in this tier also won't even get as far as any of the players in the third or fourth tier have.

Such are the vagaries of youth development: Nothing fundamental changes about the world, but the makeup of the list still changes every year.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Javier Aguirre officially announced the Mexico national team's first roster of 2026 as World Cup preparations resume, leaning on in-form Liga MX giants Chivas who supplied eight players to the 27-man squad. 

Gabriel Milito's Chivas have won nine of their most recent 12 Liga MX games, playing an attractive brand of soccer with a squad exclusively made up of Mexican talents. With Aguirre unable to call upon players who are competing in Europe for the opening camp of the year, he's constructed a roster that includes the very best from Liga MX. 

But two Chivas players specifically were notable surprises in the squad given they have both been previously capped by the U.S. men's national team: Richard Ledezma and Brian Gutiérrez.

Both players appear to have given the green light to play for Mexico, but according to ESPN, the pair are awaiting a response from a letter Mexico's soccer federation sent U.S. Soccer, plus FIFA's approval to have any chance of representing El Tri at the 2026 World Cup. 

Club América, Cruz Azul and reigning champions Toluca each will supply three players to the roster, the joint-second most of any team. Elsewhere, the exciting Tijuana midfielder Gilberto Mora will aim to continue his rise with El Tri and he'll be joined by Iker Fimbres and Obed Várgas—the only non Liga MX player on the roster—the trio that built a prolific midfield in the 2025 U–20 World Cup.

Overall, it's a cohesive roster capable of ending El Tri's six game winless streak it entered the year carrying. The core of Mexico's recent rosters remains intact, with an influx of young exciting talents that will be eager to impress Aguirre in an effort to secure one of the final spots in the 2026 World Cup roster. 

Mexico is on a mission to win its first game since the 2025 Gold Cup final, but it'll have to do so on the road and in front of what are expected to be hostile crowds.

El Tri will first take on Panama on Jan. 22 at the Estadio Rommel Fernández, before traveling to the suffocating altitude of the Estadio Olímpico in Santa Cruz, Bolivia on Jan. 25, for a bout against a team that's preparing for the 2026 World Cup playoffs.

HOUSTON – Electrolit, fourth-ranked sports drink in the U.S, on Thursday announced a partnership with U.S. men's national team and Olympique Marseille player Timothy Weah.

The collaboration will feature Weah in a national Electrolit campaign, with an in-store POS suite. Weah also will be highlighted in a variety of activations that Electrolit has planned surrounding the most anticipated soccer tournament of the decade. The digital spot is now live across Weah and Electrolit's Instagram accounts.

“During my small break between the end of season and the world's most-watched soccer event, I'll be participating in a huge training camp where hydration will be one of the most important pieces in preparation,” Weah said in a statement. “Having Electrolit in my corner, helping me to stay hydrated, will be a crucial step to ensure a successful summer.”

The 25-year-old Weah, who played for B.W. Gottschee in Queens, made history in September as the first American to score a UEFA Champions League goal at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium (home to Real Madrid).

Weah is known for scoring the opening goal for the USA in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar against Wales. He also is a three-time Concacaf Nations League champion with the USMNT.

“The campaign is rooted in my hometown of New York City, and Electrolit has been an amazing creative partner, giving me the freedom to express myself in the partnership and show the world where I am from and what we get up to,” Weah said. “I'm looking forward to future creative collaborations with the brand.”

In addition to developing the campaign concept and serving as creative director, Weah brought in former professional players and hometown friends to appear in the digital spot, which is set to an original track by close friend and music artist, Fleetzy. The video was produced by Russell Films, led by Michael Russell.

Electrolit adds another elite name to its growing roster of world-class athletes, including top-ranked tennis star Aryna Sabalenka and IndyCar driver Pato O'Ward.

Electrolit is available at major retailers, including Kroger, Sam's Club, HEB, 7-Eleven, and Costco, as well as online through Amazon, to support active lifestyles of all shapes and sizes, from work to play to sports.

CazéTV will show Corinthians' matches at the Copa das Campeãs exclusively on YouTube. According to Meu Timao, the announcement came on Thursday.

Corinthians have at least one fixture confirmed, against Gotham FC of the United States on Wednesday, 28 January in London, the host city.

Should they advance, the Brabas would play the final on 1 February at Emirates Stadium against Arsenal or AS FAR of Morocco.

The broadcaster has not yet named a commentator for Corinthians versus Gotham, though reporters Laura Luzzi and Day Natale will cover the team in London.

This will be the competition's first edition, with Corinthians, the 2025 Libertadores Feminina winners, the only Brazilian and South American club involved.

Another Club World Cup is planned for 2028 with a format akin to the men's game, granting Conmebol two direct places and one in the opening phase.

Corinthians are scheduled to travel to London on Wednesday, the 20th, and in 2026 will also contest the Paulista and Brasileiro, the Supercopa do Brasil, the Copa do Brasil and the Libertadores.

Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy has officially secured a prestigious return to international coaching. Following his departure from Old Trafford and a recent managerial stint at Leicester City, the former prolific striker joins Ronald Koeman's Netherlands backroom staff. He aims to bolster the Oranje attack ahead of the World Cup this summer, marking his third spell with the national side as they prepare for the global stage.

Van Nistelrooy is set to make a high-profile return to the international stage, having been confirmed as the new assistant coach for the Netherlands national team. The 49-year-old will officially join the technical staff on February 1, tasked with aiding head coach Koeman in the crucial months leading up to the World Cup this coming summer. This appointment marks a significant shift for Van Nistelrooy, who has spent recent periods navigating the volatile waters of English club management.

The move comes after a turbulent period in the Premier League for the Dutchman. Having served as an assistant and interim head coach at Manchester United following Erik ten Hag's sacking and subsequently holding the reins as the manager of Leicester City, Van Nistelrooy has opted to bring his expertise back to his homeland. He had been regarded as an option to take over as United boss again following Ruben Amorim's recent sacking, but the Red Devils opted to hire Michael Carrick instead.

The former striker is being brought in to provide specific expertise that only a forward of his calibre possesses. By returning to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), Van Nistelrooy steps away from the day-to-day grind of club management to focus on tournament football, a format where intensity and preparation are paramount.

With this appointment, the technical staff of the Dutch national team has been significantly strengthened. Van Nistelrooy joins an already experienced team that includes Erwin Koeman and Wim Jonk, bringing the total number of assistants to three. However, Van Nistelrooy's remit appears to be distinct. Ronald Koeman has highlighted the specific value the former Real Madrid and PSV star brings, particularly regarding the development of the squad's attacking options.

""Ruud has shown that he can really add something to our staff with his own style and vision of football,"" Koeman stated regarding the appointment. ""He knows the laws of football at the very highest level. Because of his background as a striker, he can also assist our attackers individually. There are multiple reasons why he is a very valuable addition to us.""

Van Nistelrooy's ability to connect with players, combined with his ""personality and approach,"" as noted by Koeman, suggests he will act as a vital bridge between the squad and the senior management.



This is not Van Nistelrooy's first venture into international coaching, nor is it his first time sitting on the Dutch bench. This will be his third tenure as an assistant for Oranje following his illustrious playing career. He previously served in the role between 2014 and 2016, working under Guus Hiddink and Danny Blind, and later returned to the setup for the European Championship in 2021.

His CV as a player is undeniably world class, boasting 70 caps and 35 goals for his country, along with a club career that saw him dominate defences across Europe for PSV, United and Madrid. After hanging up his boots, Van Nistelrooy diligently worked his way up through the PSV academy as a youth coach before taking the top job in Eindhoven before later following Ten Hag to Old Trafford.

With the World Cup on the horizon, the KNVB is leaving nothing to chance. Nigel de Jong, the director of top football, explained that the expansion of the staff is a direct response to the rigours of a major tournament. ""A final tournament places high demands on both staff and players,"" De Jong remarked. ""We not only want to continue delivering quality during that period, but also guarantee sufficient individual attention for players.""

For Van Nistelrooy, the opportunity to represent his country on the world stage again is a privilege he does not take lightly. ""Returning to Oranje in this role and representing the Netherlands with this staff and talented group of players is a huge honour and a wonderful challenge for me,"" he said. ""The fact that this is also happening on the stage of a World Cup makes it extra special. With my experience in various roles, including that of assistant, I know this position is a perfect fit for me. I look forward to making a valuable contribution and contributing to a successful tournament.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

World Cup

FIFA president Gianni Infantino and the World Cup trophy Roberto Schmidt / AFP / Getty Images

“BREAKING NEWS,” Gianni Infantino crowed on Instagram, before the news release had even dropped. “UNBELIEVABLE.” He was trumpeting a number, 500 million — up from 350 million last week and 150 million late last month — the number of requests that FIFA claims it received for 2026 World Cup tickets.

“Half a billion ticket requests in just over a month is more than demand — it's a global statement,” Infantino, FIFA's president, said.

But what he didn't say, and what FIFA won't say, is the story.

Advertisement

They have given us a big, round number. But it's somewhat empty, or at least difficult to interpret, without more specific numbers — and namely, a breakdown of how those 500 million requests are distributed across the World Cup's 104 matches.

Of course, there is “unprecedented” interest in the tournament as a whole, and especially in a few dozen high-profile matches. The question is whether there's immense interest in, say, Uruguay vs. Saudi Arabia — and, more importantly, whether FIFA's prices have dampened that interest.

That there would be huge demand for 2026 World Cup games has long been obvious. With more teams and more games than ever before, in massive North American stadiums — most of them in the world's richest and most diverse country — the tournament was always going to smash records. The 1994 World Cup in the U.S. remains the attendance standard-bearer, and that was with 24 teams. The 2026 field is twice as large.

But the “statement” that Infantino and FIFA want the 500 million figure to make is more extensive. Every announcement boasting “soaring global demand” — from the 5 million ticket requests in this application window's first 24 hours to the 500 million in total — has come amid an uproar over prices. The statement, implicitly, is that despite all the criticism, people are willing to pay these prices; that demand is overwhelming supply; and that, if anything, World Cup tickets are actually underpriced.

In some cases, that statement is clearly valid. The “over 500 million” requests make it resounding. FIFA could, in fact, have charged much more for Portugal vs. Colombia or for any of Mexico's matches. It could have even charged more than its current $8,680, $5,575 and $4,185 price points for the World Cup final.

But what about $500, $400 and $180 for Egypt vs. Iran? Or $450, $380 and $140 for Curaçao vs. Ivory Coast? Or, heck, $2,735, $1,940 and $1,120 for U.S. vs. Paraguay? Are there millions of requests for those matches?

The big, round number — “a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport,” FIFA said — suggests that stadiums will be full and demand is sufficient across the board.

But it's also entirely possible that a vast majority of the 500 million requests are for, say, the 30 most attractive games, while others are undersubscribed. The Athletic has asked FIFA for match-by-match numbers; the global soccer governing body hasn't provided them.

So, it's plausible that there are 50 million requests for Colombia-Portugal alone, because, well, if you can afford to invest $265 (the Category 3 price) in that game, why wouldn't you apply — knowing that, even if you can't attend, you could almost certainly resell your ticket for well over $1,000?

And while you're at it, why wouldn't you apply for all 43 games whose get-in price (cheapest ticket) on the secondary market right now is over $600, per TicketData.com?

America's unregulated resale market — and FIFA's choice to lean into it rather than restrict it — has undoubtedly inflated these overarching ticket request numbers. Scalpers are surely among the 500 million. (How numerous? We'll never know.)

The more interesting numbers are the ones for games whose primary prices aren't dwarfed by secondary prices. The games where a successful application doesn't necessarily equal either a desirable experience or a guaranteed profit.

How many requests, for example, were there for Cape Verde vs. Saudi Arabia in Houston, or for Uzbekistan vs. a playoff winner in Atlanta?

Perhaps we're cherry-picking the least appealing fixtures, but what about the two games that sit right at the group-stage median on the secondary market, Japan vs. a playoff winner and Belgium vs. Egypt?

What about that U.S. opener vs. Paraguay, for which a fan is currently reselling a Category 3 ticket for $1,259 before fees, not all that much higher than the $1,120 price FIFA set back in October (and never raised)?

Those numbers would be telling.

In the end, it makes no difference whether there were 1 million, 10 million or 100 million requests for Portugal-Colombia tickets. Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., will be full on June 27, as will MetLife Stadium for the final on July 19, as will any stadium that hosts Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and so on.

What matters is whether Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., is full for its (underwhelming) group games; and whether the 30 least attractive matchups draw packed, passionate crowds; and whether FIFA has to lower ticket prices in a fourth sales phase this spring to attract them – thereby angering the fleeced fans who bought tickets early.

We'll find out in June.

One big, round number isn't a definitive final chapter in this ticketing saga. The games, and the atmospheres around them, will be.

Many England fans have had to commit to World Cup tickets after Fifa's deadline for initial applications passed on Tuesday, though how much they'll have to pay - whether $60 or $7,000 - is still unknown

Removed from bookmarks

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The deadline for initial World Cup ticket applications passed on Tuesday, with many England fans having no idea what they'll end up paying, despite having to commit. The difference could end up thousands of dollars, but they now can't cancel.

Some fans eligible for the limited $60 ""category 4"" tickets will still be sitting near relatives in the same section facing thousands of dollars of difference. There have been many similar stories. A number of supporters naturally rushed to book already expensive hotels and flights when the schedule was confirmed on 6 December, only to make the difficult decision to cancel once prices were actually announced a few days later. A new system, that represents an inexplicable shift from all recent tournaments, has ensured some tickets have gone to five times the price of Qatar. The initial backlash forced Fifa into a minor climbdown, where 10 percent of tickets for all qualified teams - the Participating Member Associations (PMA) - were brought into a fixed $60 “category 4”. There's an immense jump to category 3.

Discussion groups involving members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) feature comments like “obscene”, “blatant exploitation”, a “preying on loyalty and the feeling this is priceless” and ultimately: “Fifa can stick it. They've ruined the best tournament in the world.”

All of which represents a doubt and uncertainty that cuts a very different tone to Fifa's bombastic press release about “500 million ticket requests” and how this set “a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport”.

Supporter groups have nevertheless expressed cynicism at those figures, and the manner they escalated over the 33-day application period, despite Fifa stating that unique credit card data has been used for validation.

Such claims don't mesh with experience on the ground. Data from Football Supporters Europe (FSE) - who represent fan groups across the continent - suggests that the level of interest is comparable with Qatar. That tournament barely saw any major fan group travel outside Argentina, Mexico, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. That might end up a concern given that Fifa said on Tuesday the highest number of applications outside the hosts came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.

It is certainly a concern as regards how this tournament will feel, look and sound, and whether there will be enough emotionally invested fans to create the atmosphere that really amplifies a World Cup. Essentially, what Argentina brought to 2014 and 2022.

Fans who actually have confirmed orders laugh wryly at the Fifa sign-off - typically underneath figures reaching around $7,000, potentially breaching many credit limits before hotels and flights - that reads: “Thanks for being a true fan!”

Such marketing speak was echoed by president Gianni Infantino in Tuesday's statement: “I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response. Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums.”

Except, this gratitude is apparently expressed in prices that ensure only a certain tax band can actually afford to be welcomed inside the stadiums, in a system that doesn't seem to truly recognise this “meaning”.

As written in The Independent before, the entire story articulates a central tension in 2026 football, which is that between its cultural importance and the will to make it a mere entertainment commodity. Fifa, officially a not-for-profit charity, seem to very much be leaning towards the latter.

Duly, there is a deepening anger at the lack of attention to a genuine social issue within this. The Independent has already reported how the normally protected accessibility tickets are appearing on Fifa's own resale site at six times the price, amid the controversy that carers will also be charged in a decision that goes against the body's own statutes on human rights.

By Tuesday's deadline, fans requiring accessibility tickets had no idea if they were paying $60, or if their carer will be forced to pay thousands more. The extra cost was last week criticised by Level Playing Field for fostering further “exclusion”, as they also accused Fifa of a “delay and ignore” approach in so far neglecting to answer FSE questions.

Those within Fifa privately stress that the US hosting has thrown up more legal complications than any previous World Cup, especially with how legislation prevents requests for proof of disability, leading to the current system.

Fan groups counter that this is another case of “a pinch of truth being expanded to justify the whole ticketing policy”. They argue that Fifa knew all of this years in advance, so could have come up with multiple different solutions or guardrails, and that there's nothing to prevent making a companion ticket free of charge or putting accessibility in the cheapest category.

They proffer that the same applies to the ongoing debate over the US “secondary market” - in other words, legalised touting - that Fifa insiders say “throws up completely new challenges than anything we've faced before”.

Again, multiple proactive solutions were possible, including protecting PMA tickets from transfer. There's instead a feeling that Fifa are just seeking to earn resale differences themselves rather than tackle the issue.

That runs alongside ongoing frustration that the FA are not more outspoken on behalf of England fans. The body's general stance is that the idiosyncratic top-down nature of football politics means they can be most effective raising issues behind the scenes. It's understood the FA did relay concerns to Fifa amid the initial backlash, and that this played a part in the creation of category 4 tickets.

Except, the highly limited number has created a headache for the FA, as travelling fans who fall just outside the caps needed for $60 tickets face ballots to see whether they are in the much more expensive category 2 rather than 3. Such fans pay £70 every two years to be a member of the ESTC and generally go to at least 11 away games over four years, in the hope such loyalty will be rewarded, only to be faced with what they feel is “exploitation”.

That has fostered further frustration with the FA strategy, and questions like “what results can they actually point to?” Ultimately, the big nations have never even tried to properly challenge Infantino's Fifa as a bloc.

For the FA's part, they have been more proactive than many counterparts, amid a lament that the initial backlash has waned. Belgium and Denmark have instead parroted Fifa's lines about raising money for the global game and the need to conform to the US market.

Such responses also cut to the core of all this, Fifa's power structure, and how it was decided. Pricing ultimately came from those close to Infantino, with very little information dispersed - even to the Fifa Council.

When pressed, insiders ultimately resort to those same justifications: raising money for the game, and “demand”.

That's despite Fifa's immense surpluses coming from the old pricing system, and the key point that they just do not have to concern themselves with demand. What's more, no previous World Cup has conformed to the host market.

But what of the future? As one senior official said, “the sad part is that it's probably done”. In other words, the prices are set for this tournament. Just one of many further questions is what happens if it's a commercial success.

Kieron Bowie's nine goals this season have helped spark transfer speculation

Scottish Cup, fourth round: Dunfermline Athletic v Hibernian

Venue: East End Park, Dunfermline Date: Saturday, 17 January Time: 12:30 GMT

Coverage: Watch on BBC One Scotland & iPlayer, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app

When Kieron Bowie takes to the field against Dunfermline Athletic on Saturday, it will be a reminder to one of Fife's finest talents of where his blossoming football career began in the humblest of surroundings.

The 23-year-old Hibernian and Scotland striker started at Dunfermline's biggest local rivals, Raith Rovers, with whom he says he owes a great debt of gratitude to current Falkirk manager John McGlynn.

Bowie was playing public park football in his home town of Kirkcaldy before McGlynn was alerted to the teenager and instantly took him to Stark's Park when he was in charge there.

""Until I was 16, I was just playing with my mates and stuff - and then Fife League was a thing at the time,"" he recalls when anticipating the Scottish Cup fourth-round tie at East End Park. 

""I was only there for a few months and then John McGlynn and [assistant] Paul Smith went in at Raith and it sort of caught their eye a little bit.""

Bowie admits he was ""a raw 16-year-old"" when he was told ""right, you can come in twice a week from school"".

""I'd done that for the rest of the season and then, in the summer, I was like, am I going to play? Because there was no reserves or anything - and then that season I played and done all right.""

Bowie, who won his first two Scotland caps last year, was a late bloomer.

""I played for a team called Real Fife from 10 - I think I started playing quite late, nine, 10 and then, after that, I went on to Glenrothes Strollers, who a few of my mates played for, and one of their dads took the team,"" he says. 

""It was different, to be honest. At Real Fife in Kirkcaldy, we just played up the park. Literally.

""Everyone has their own pathway to make it in the game and it's different to other people. People go through pro-youth academies and stuff, people go through grassroots clubs like myself. 

""Everyone has a different way and, if everyone made it the same way, it'd be boring, wouldn't it?""

Bowie's route to the top also took a detour to London and a time on the wings before only really making the striker role his own after his move to Hibs 18 months ago.

After leaving Rovers for Fulham in 2020, he was loaned out to Northampton Town, where he was playing out of position. 

""I was never an out-and-out striker,"" Bowie explains. ""I played on the wing when I was at Northampton on loan for two seasons, which I played almost 100 games. Imagine me on the wing, this tall lad just running about.

""Then I came here and they were like, we see you as a number nine. Just to put that belief into me, to play as a number nine and obviously I'm still young, fairly young, learning my trade. So hopefully I can just do as much as I can and progress.""

A wonder goal against Partizan Belgrade in Conference League qualifying in August brought Bowie greater attention and that has continued as he has notched up nine goals in 28 appearances so far this term.

His strength and prowess has led to speculation about interest from Celtic, Rangers and top clubs in England.

However, in this World Cup year, the Hibs striker has only one goal - and that is to try to convince national head coach Steve Clarke he is worthy of a place on the plane to the Americas. 

""Anyone that's been involved with Scotland over the last year, they're lying if they don't say 'I want to be there',"" Bowie says. 

""Obviously I want to be there, but I just need to focus on now and what I'm doing here and hopefully that'll lead me to getting on that flight.

""Last summer, it was different, because it was just friendly matches. But it just sort of shows you're not that far away.

""Obviously the level of some of the players in there, you go in and you're like 'oh no, am I good enough' and you question it. You just need to tell yourself 'I'm good enough to be here and I've deserved my chance'.""

A Scotland fans' representative has described Fifa's World Cup ticket allocation for disabled supporters as ""simply not good enough"".

Stephen Reside also hit out at the pricing structure for this summer's tournament in the US, Canada and Mexico.

And he said fans' carers - who were granted free admission to the 2022 World Cup - had to pay for a match ticket without any guarantee they would be seated together.

BBC Scotland News has approached football's global governing body for comment.

Reside, 32, said that the numbers for both wheelchair users and ""ambulant"" disabled fans,  who do not normally use a wheelchair, were confirmed on Monday - 24 hours before the official ticket application window closed. 

He told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: ""It works out for each game we are getting six wheelchair spaces and six carers and three ambulant spaces and three carers.""

Reside, who is the Scottish Football Union's disability lead, said the 65,000 capacity Miami stadium - where Scotland will play Brazil - has 300 wheelchair spaces.

He added: ""It works out to be 2% of wheelchair spaces within the stadium that will be available to Scotland supporters.

""It is simply not good enough."" 

Reside, from Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, said the ticket percentage share for non-disabled Scotland fans was around 5.7% of the allocation.

He added: ""In my view Scotland supporters should be given 5.7% of wheelchair spaces available at least.""

Reside said he did not know how many disabled supporters plan to travel to the World Cup.

Scotland's men secured qualification for the first time since 1998 after a thrilling 4-2 victory over Denmark in November.

The following month Steve Clarke's side were drawn in the same group as Haiti, African Nation finalists Morocco and five-time winners Brazil.

Since then Tartan Army footsoldiers have been scrambling to book flights, accommodation and secure match tickets.

Scotland will play Haiti (14 June) and Morocco (19 June) in Boston, before taking on Brazil in Miami (24 June).

The opening match kicks off at 02:00 BST while the remaining two will get under way at 23:00.

In a further blow, Reside - who travelled to last summer's Euros in Germany - said Fifa were selling tickets on their resale platforms.

He said some category one tickets for group matches were going for $889 (£663).

Reside said: ""The Qatar World Cup group stage matches cost between $10 (£7) and $12 (£9) and you were getting a carer free.

""With the resale you are not getting a carer free because legislation in America also allows them to also charge for a carer.""

He said as well as supporter's carers having to secure a match ticket it was ""not guaranteed"" they would be seated together.

Reside had planned to attend Scotland's opening match against Haiti in Boston and the final group game against Brazil in Miami.  

But he told the programme that was ""not looking likely"" due to the small number of tickets available.

He added: ""They only have two for each category for wheelchair users and one for each category for ambulant disabled supporters.

""Fifa love to talk about how inclusive they are.

""For me their numbers simply aren't reflecting that.""

Reside said he had no issues at all with the Scottish Football Association and said it was doing everything it could to secure more tickets for disabled fans.

Scotland supporters could enter the members' association ballot or the random selection one before the 13 January deadline.

But Reside said: ""I think people were apprehensive to apply for both because, if you were successful in both you, were obligated to pay for both tickets.""

Last month Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the cost of World Cup tickets by saying they reflect the public's ""absolutely crazy"" demand for the tournament.

Group stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the last World Cup in Qatar, while the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is £3,119.

Infantino told the World Sports Summit in Dubai that the level of demand far outstrips supply.

He said: ""We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests.

""So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.""

Last week the Level Playing Field charity warned that failures to address concerns around accessibility for the World Cup risked excluding many supporters.

It also said disabled fans were set to face ""higher, unavoidable costs"" of attending than non-disabled supporters.

The charity also highlighted the uncertainty over allocation numbers and the positioning of companions.

Level Playing Field raised concerns with Fifa last month and as of last week had yet to receive a response.

Chairman Tony Taylor, said: ""This ongoing uncertainty over accessible ticketing is unacceptable.

""The current situation appears to expect disabled fans to gamble on cost and access.

""Restricting access to the lowest pricing tiers and charging for personal assistants, add unavoidable, additional, disability-related costs to attending.""

He added Fifa's failure to respond to Level Playing Field's concerns was ""deeply frustrating and wholly unacceptable"".

BBC Scotland has asked the charity for an update on its request to Fifa.

The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams and be played from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico.

David Stephen and Shaun Brown have been accused of acting as part of an organised crime group.

Callum Summers and Craig McColl attacked Stuart McGeachie near a pub in Rutherglen in October 2023.

Firearms officers were called to an address on Skye Road just after midnight on Tuesday.

Victoria Cairns died after being hit by a Mitsubishi pick-up truck in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, in November 2024.

Andrew Watt launched the missile at Viljami Sinisalo from a Rangers supporters section of Ibrox Stadium during the derby match in May.

FIFA have issued a statement on the status of the 2026 World Cup after Donald Trump placed indefinite visa processing suspensions on more nations.

Trump has issued a series of updated travel bans to certain foreign nations across his second term in the White House beginning January 2025.

These range from full travel bans, partial travel bans and immigrant visa suspensions.

There are exemptions for the vast majority of countries on the list, including the ability of a 'small subset of travellers', including athletes, to travel to 'major sporting events'.

That means that the likes of Iran and Haiti - who are both on the full ban list - can still send their players, coaches and support staff to the United States for the 2026 World Cup.

Senegal and Ivory Coast, meanwhile, are under partial travel bans.

On Wednesday, it was announced that the Trump administration would suspend immigrant visa processing for a total of 75 countries.

They include eight World Cup nations - Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Uruguay.

Those suspensions do not apply to travel visas - meaning fans from the affected countries can still travel to the US for the World Cup as things stand.

Also on Wednesday, FIFA issued a press release containing updates on ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup.

They state that fans from all 211 of its member nations submitted ticket requests between December 11 and January 13, during their Random Selection Draw ticket sales phase.

The statement adds that fans placed 'an average of 15 million ticket requests per day over the 33-day application window', and that it has succeeded in 'setting a new benchmark for demand in the history of world football'.

A paragraph towards the end of the statement, however, notes that possessing a match ticket does not necessarily guarantee entry to host nations United States, Canada or Mexico. 

Canada has a travel ban list featuring six nations, but this only relates to travel to that particular country. Out of the 48 nations competing in the World Cup, only Iran feature on the list.

""A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each country's government website today for entry requirements for Canada, Mexico and the United States,"" FIFA's press release states.

""Given the processing times involved, FIFA recommends submitting the visa application as early as possible.

""FIFA World Cup 2026 ticket holders travelling to the United States are eligible for the recently announced FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS) when it becomes available in the coming weeks.""

Everything Alexandria

Soccer fans in Alexandria are in for a treat, as the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) has announced it will be staying in Alexandria during the FIFA World Cup this summer.

The team's base camp will be in Alexandria, where players will stay at the AKA Hotel at 625 First Street in Old Town and train at Episcopal High School as they participate in the World Cup. Games will take place across Canada, Mexico and the United States from Jun. 11 through July 19.

Team representatives selected Alexandria after analyzing more than 60 locations and touring eight “potential camps” in the northeastern U.S. and Canada, after which Head Coach Zlatko Dalić and staff “unanimously agreed that Alexandria was the best choice,” HNS announced in a press release yesterday (Thursday).

“Alexandria offers us the best combination of an excellent training centre and a comfortable hotel, with immediate proximity to the airport and a good geographical position in relation to the cities where we will play our group-stage matches,” Technical Director Stipe Pletikosa said. “From a sporting perspective, which is always our top priority, we will have truly top-class conditions at Episcopal High School — from the pitches and fitness facilities to recovery areas — so there were very few doubts.”

In a social media video this morning, Mayor Alyia Gaskins said the city is planning a lineup of “amazing events” with the arrival of HNS. Visit Alexandria, the city's official tourism organization, confirmed to ALXnow that it was involved in the team's decision and will release more details at a later date.

Gaskins also celebrated, saying it was “a huge opportunity, and we're so excited to welcome such an amazing and talented team.”

“[It's] an opportunity for the team and fans to get to know our city, and for us to get to know more about their Croatian culture and to celebrate and cheer them on throughout the World Cup,” Gaskins said.

In the announcement, the team noted the AKA Hotel's positive reviews and “multiple awards for its modern design,” “excellent facilities” and close proximity to Reagan National Airport, which is a 6-minute drive away.

Nearby Episcopal High School's training center offers a “high-end fitness facility” with a running track, cardio equipment, a gym and recovery facilities including hydrotherapy, cryotherapy, electrical stimulation and ultrasound for the team's usage.

“Based on everything we heard and saw, Alexandria was the best option for us, and I am pleased that we managed to secure this location,” Dalić said. “There are many factors that make a good base camp and that we took into account—from the conditions at the training center, the quality of the hotel, geographic location, distance from the airport, privacy, and surroundings—and in all aspects, Alexandria offers the best combination of these factors.”

“Of course, the overall impression of a camp is ultimately shaped by results, so I hope Alexandria will remain in our memories just as fondly as ‘Forest Rhapsody' in Russia or the Hilton in Doha,” the coach added.

Manchester United are being backed to finally sign boyhood Red Devils fan Cole Palmer if they can lure the Chelsea star's former manager, Mauricio Pochettino, back to England. A new permanent boss is required at Old Trafford following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim. Various names have been added to that pot, including an Argentine tactician that is currently working with the USMNT.

Amid ongoing struggles for consistency on and off the field, Portuguese coach Amorim was relieved of his duties on January 5. Darren Fletcher was initially placed in caretaker charge of first-team affairs, with those reins now being passed to interim boss Michael Carrick.

Longer-term plans will be mapped out in the summer. United have already been linked with the likes of Oliver Glasner, Thomas Tuchel, Gareth Southgate and Luis Enrique. They are, however, being advised to make a play for another man that knows all about life in the Premier League from his stints in charge of Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea.

Pochettino is readying the United States for a home World Cup at present, but will see his contract there expire after a bid for global glory has been taken in. It could be that he receives an approach from Old Trafford, having registered on that radar before, and looks to bring a familiar face with him - with Wythenshawe native Palmer, who is a United supporter, having moved to Stamford Bridge while Pochettino was calling the shots in west London.

Rene Meulensteen, who once worked alongside Sir Alex Ferguson in Manchester, has told Casinostugan: “Could Mauricio Pochettino convince Cole Palmer to come to Manchester United? Only if Chelsea would be willing to let him go. Palmer is a fantastic player and I think he would suit Manchester United really well and the way they should be playing because he is a difference maker. That's always what you want.

“You'd need to think about how he's going to fit in because on that right-hand side, where Cole is playing to come into the pocket, obviously you can have Amad Diallo there too or [Bryan] Mbeumo. Bruno [Fernandes] operates in the middle.

“Palmer was a boyhood United fan and it's actually too strange for words that United never picked up on it and made sure that they sounded him out about his plans if he ever were to leave City. It's very strange that it never happened, in my opinion.”

Meulensteen has also been casting an eye over some of the other high-profile coaches to have been linked with United, with Barcelona and Real Madrid legends Xavi and Zinedine Zidane forming part of that conversation.

Dutchman Meulensteen added: “Zinedine Zidane is an interesting one because he's now out of job for quite some time. He played for Real Madrid. He knows the club. He speaks the language. I don't think he speaks English very well. That wouldn't help.

“He is used to playing with all the best players available as Real Madrid manager and that is not necessarily the case at Manchester United in all the positions so that would be a question mark.

“He would have different demands and I don't think that Manchester United at this moment in time would be able to fulfil those demands. That is one of the reasons why they probably end up picking a manager that is prepared to come in and to prepare to work with the current squad and limited resources to do much else.

“Xavi wouldn't necessarily be a risk because we've seen all the managers that have come into the Premier League and done really, really well in Glasner and [Andoni] Iraola. They didn't have any Premier League experience but they also had a very clear idea of how they wanted to play to get that message across to their players and put in the work on the training pitch.”

United are likely to favour experience of English football when making their next appointment, which would put Xavi and Zidane out of the running. There also appears to be little chance of them prising Palmer away from Chelsea any time soon - with the 2025-26 campaign seeing the Red Devils hit a 111-year low when it comes to games played in a single trophy-hunting campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Marc Guehi edges closer to Man City transfer after 'big approach' to player's camp with Crystal Palace talks to follow","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/marc-guehi-closer-man-city-transfer-big-approach-crystal-palace-talks/blt90768d1695e7c59e","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:41:14 GMT","

Marc Guehi has moved a step closer to securing a January transfer to Manchester City following a “big approach” to the player's representatives. Fabrizio Romano reports on how the England international defender, who continues to run down his contract at Crystal Palace, could make his way to the Etihad Stadium before the winter window closes.

Guehi has been the subject of intense speculation regarding his future since the summer of 2025. At that stage, defending Premier League champions Liverpool were eager to put a big-money deal in place.

Palace spurned those advances despite being aware that their club captain was heading into the final 12 months of his deal at Selhurst Park. No fresh terms have been agreed, meaning that the 25-year-old centre-half will become a free agent at the end of the season.

It may be that he never reaches that point, with interest building again with another recruitment market open for business. Liverpool have continued to monitor Guehi's situation, but City have moved to the front of the queue when it comes to discussions.

Having seen the likes of Ruben Dias, John Stones and Josko Gvardiol nurse injuries this season, Pep Guardiola is eager to reinforce the heart of his defence. Guehi would, given his age and experience, be a shrewd addition for the present and future.

City are stepping up their efforts to put an agreement in place with Palace and Guehi. Personal terms have been presented, with the next challenge being to settle on a fee with domestic rivals - with it being suggested that an offer of around £30 million ($40m) will be lodged.

Transfer guru Romano has posted on social media: “Manchester City advance on Marc Guehi deal as big approach has been made in the last 12h. Manchester City presented important proposal to Guehi in terms of contract, eventually ready to proceed also with Crystal Palace. Deal now closer with #MCFC.”

Palace are, having won the FA Cup last season to end their long wait for major silverware and graced the Conference League this term, reluctant sellers when it comes to their talismanic skipper. They would prefer to keep him around until the summer.

Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has, however, reluctantly conceded that matters may be taken out of his hands. He has said of the mounting transfer talk: “I'm not naive. If a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.”

He added, with European giants Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid having also been credited with interest in Guehi at various intervals - and he is free to speak with teams outside of England when it comes to pre-contract terms and potential free agency: “If you're just valuing sports, everyone in the club will say Marc has to stay. The chairman will tell you the same. But it's not one-dimensional. If you see the financial situation, it's very important.

“If somebody comes, there will be a moment when the club says 'now the financial issue is more important than the sports issue'. There will be a threshold where the club has to say it will happen - as long as Marc says 'I want to leave', because the final decision is always with the player.”

That mark was not hit in 2025, with Glasner going on to say: “The chairman rejected many offers in the summer because we want to play a successful season and wanted to win the Community Shield.

“Therefore, Marc is important, and then he rejected the offer. The threshold at that time, the money we got offered was not above it. Maybe it was close, but it was not above.”

Palace still have a figure in mind, which will be lower than the one six months ago as Guehi's deal dwindles, and City are seemingly prepared to meet those demands. Agreeing a contract should be straightforward, with a fee all that is left to thrash out.

City remain busy across four competitions this season - the Premier League, Champions League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup - meaning that they will want to Guehi on board and bedded into their squad as quickly as possible.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Loanee star speaks out on future after Xabi Alonso's exit","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/could-endrick-make-shock-real-madrid-return-loanee-star-speaks-future-xabi-alonso/blt77189143338ecb20","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:48:55 GMT","

Real Madrid loanee Endrick has broken his silence on his future plans following a dream start to life at Lyon. The Brazilian wonderkid, who left the Bernabéu in search of minutes after an injury nightmare, addresses the managerial turmoil in the Spanish capital following Xabi Alonso's departure and reveals whether a swift return to Los Blancos is on the cards.

Brazilian sensation Endrick has officially opened up about his departure from Real Madrid and his immediate future, just days after scoring the winning goal on his debut for Lyon. The teenage forward, who moved to the French giants on loan in the January window, finds himself watching a crisis unfold at his parent club from afar. With Xabi Alonso recently departing the Bernabeu hot seat following a Super Cup defeat to Barcelona in Saudi Arabia, speculation has been rife regarding the direction of the Spanish champions and the future of their loaned-out assets. 

However, Endrick has moved to quell any talk of a premature return to Spain, insisting his focus is entirely on reviving his career in Ligue 1 after making the difference in the recent 2-1 win against Lille in the Coupe de France.

Endrick's move to Lyon was born out of necessity rather than a desire to leave Madrid permanently. After a challenging few months sidelined by injury - a setback that cost him a place at the Club World Cup in the United States - the forward recognised the need for regular first-team football to get back to his best. The physical and mental toll of rehabilitation was significant, with the player admitting that the recovery phase was the ""hard part"" of his recent journey.

""In our careers, we have to understand that time is very valuable,"" he told AS. ""When we're starting out, we need to grow, and to grow, we need to play. Recovering from my injury and all the work for my return kept me out for months, and I knew it would be difficult to get a steady run of matches in Spain. The hard part was the recovery.""

The decision to join Lyon was heavily influenced by the club's rich history with Brazilian players and the persuasive powers of head coach Paulo Fonseca. The Portuguese manager sold a vision of a technical, attacking side supported by a ""passionate"" fanbase. For Endrick, the environment in France offers the perfect rehabilitation stage. ""I came to France to do what I love. Train and play,"" he stated. ""Chasing our dreams is always a good thing.""

With Real Madrid currently in a state of flux following the dismissal of Alonso, questions have naturally surfaced regarding whether the club might look to recall players to bolster a squad that has evidently struggled in recent weeks. However, Endrick was quick to laugh off suggestions that he is already thinking about a flight back to Madrid. Having only just arrived in Lyon and with his home debut against Brest still to come this Sunday, the youngster is determined to respect his current commitment.

""I just got here!"" Endrick laughed. ""I haven't even played my first home game yet. This is not the time to think about going back. At this moment, I don't need to worry about anything except Lyon.""

Despite the physical distance, Endrick confirmed that his relationship with the Spanish giants remains rock solid. The loan move was facilitated with the full support of the Madrid hierarchy, who understood his need for minutes. ""My relationship with Real Madrid hasn't changed at all,"" he asserted. ""Right up until the day I travelled to Lyon, the club gave me all the support I needed.""

He spoke with immense reverence for his first manager in Spain, Carlo Ancelotti, crediting the Italian veteran with teaching him lessons that extended far beyond the pitch. ""I could write a book about everything I learned from him,"" he said. ""He played at a high level for major clubs and has won everything as a coach in several countries. He taught us so much about the game, but also about the life of a soccer player.
""

In contrast, his time working under Alonso was cut short, and he was unable to watch the fateful final in Saudi Arabia that precipitated the coach's exit. Nevertheless, Endrick displayed a maturity beyond his years when discussing Alonso, wishing the Basque tactician well for the future. ""Xabi was a brilliant player, a world champion, a champion as a coach in Germany, and he'll soon be at a new club or national team,"" he said. 

It will be his old Madrid manager he will hope to impress while at Lyon, though, with Ancelotti leading the Brazilian national team into the World Cup this summer. Endrick has set his sights on consistent improvement, with the ultimate goal of forcing his way into the squad for the competition in Canada, United States and Mexico. He is acutely aware that his performances for Lyon will be the metric by which he is judged by the Selecao hierarchy. 

""I have one goal each week: to start the next week better than the last one,"" he revealed. ""I've already been with the national team, and if I improve every week, I'll be better than I was when I was first called up.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'We are finished!'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/finished-chelsea-fans-fume-linkedin-manager-liam-rosenior-gloves-players-hear-him-applaud/blt7fa7bc8cb829e185","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:07:36 GMT","

Chelsea fans have accused their club of being “finished” amid claims that Liam Rosenior, who is already being branded a “LinkedIn manager”, does not wear gloves during the Blues' training sessions so that players can hear him clapping their endeavours. The 41-year-old is only two games into his tenure at Stamford Bridge, but has already raised plenty of eyebrows.

Chelsea turned to former Derby and Hull City manager Rosenior after parting company with Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup winner Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day. The Premier League heavyweights raided one of their sister clubs, Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, for a highly-rated young coach that fits the model of their ambitious owners.

Rosenior is still waiting on his first Premier League fixture as a manager, with his reign being opened in an FA Cup win over Charlton and a Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg defeat to Arsenal.

It is still far too early to pass judgement on Rosenior, but some of his antics have puzzled those in the stands. According to the Daily Mail, Chelsea players were “ushered into a private room to participate in a Lego-building competition” following the arrival of their new boss.

Rosenior is big on “team-bonding ideas” and wants to work with a happy camp. He is said to appreciate that “footballers are not fond of long meetings, and that they can be dreadfully dull if you delve too much into tactical talk”. With that in mind, he tries to keep “group gatherings short and sweet”.

His door at Chelsea's Cobham training facility is said to be “forever open”, with players actively encouraged to drop in for individual talks. Rosenior is “not dictatorial” and “pushes players for their take before setting a tactical plan”, as they are the ones that have to execute it.

The Mail adds that the Blues' new head coach has “not shied from packing on the PDA with players as he is the arm-around-the-shoulders type – an affectionate approach which is said to have been appreciated by Chelsea's young group already”. Rosenior is of the opinion that he will earn respect by showing plenty himself.

Some supporters have, however, reacted strongly to claims that Rosenior has taken to “not wearing gloves” so that players “can hear his applause” while being put through their paces. Things are certainly a lot different in west London to what they were in days gone by.

@RiddlerRaves responded to the glove revelation by saying: “We are finished as a serious football club.” @kembungtemenung added: “The next thing, they gonna tell us Liam Rosenior is not wearing his glasses so that he sees Tosin with his real eyes…” @GodsfavourNkang chimed in with: “What the hell is this? I can no longer recognize my club.”

@LumpofCelery24 said of Rosenior's methods: “He's not beating the LinkedIn manager charges. Also my coach of our team when I was a kid. During drill he would stop it and tell us how we needed to move etc. We were 11. This isn't something that needs to be highlighted as a big win for Rosenior.”

@LaviaBallonDCFC went on to say, with Chelsea-bound former Strasbourg loanee Emmanuel Emegha having been suspended during his time in France for allegedly launching a bottle at Rosenior: “Worse than Arteta with inauthentic corniness. There's no chance any player respects him. I now understand Emegha throwing a water bottle at him, I want to do the same.”

Chelsea believe that they have found the right man for the job, and will be giving Rosenior all the support that he needs. The Mail goes on to report how that includes talks regarding business in the January transfer window.

It is claimed that “daily conversations"" are taking place, with the Blues looking “for a new central defender”, and that Rosenior “will be involved in those discussions and decisions”. The Blues will be back in action on Saturday when playing host to Brentford.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Bruno Fernandes makes decision on his Man Utd future after Michael Carrick's arrival as caretaker manager & presence of £57m release clause","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bruno-fernandes-decision-man-utd-future-michael-carrick-caretaker-manager-57m-release-clause/blta9b8a078ed34d902","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:38:01 GMT","

Bruno Fernandes has reportedly made a definitive decision on his Manchester United future with another transfer window open. It has been revealed that the Portuguese midfielder, who continues to generate talk of interest from the Saudi Pro League, has a £57 million ($76m) release clause in his contract that can be triggered by teams outside of the Premier League.

Recent reports have suggested that the 31-year-old is mulling over his options again after seeing fellow countryman Ruben Amorim relieved of his managerial duties at Old Trafford. Reins were initially passed to Darren Fletcher on a caretaker basis, while Michael Carrick is now in interim charge of the Red Devils.

United will make a permanent appointment in the summer, and BBC Sport claims it is at that point which Fernandes will decide where his long-term future lies. He is tied to terms through to 2027 and has been in Manchester for six years - taking in 310 appearances and scoring 103 goals.

Fernandes is captain at Old Trafford and a talismanic presence for a team that has struggled for consistency as a collective across recent campaigns. BBC Sport claims that the Portugal international ""remains committed to the club"".

He has stated on a regular basis that his intention is to reassess his situation once another bid for global glory has been taken in alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Co at the 2026 World Cup.

Fernandes did, however, reveal recently that United were looking to move him on during the summer of 2025 after receiving a lucrative offer from Saudi outfit Al-Hilal. He told Canal 11: ""From the club's side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a bit.

""More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player who has nothing to criticize. I'm always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then, you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much… that makes you sad.

""I could have left like many people do and said: ‘I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for 20 or 30 million, so they pay me more on the other side.' But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do it, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. 

""But it gets to a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors that, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision, because the manager wanted me. If I had said I wanted to leave, they would have let me go.""

With there a good chance that United will look to cash in on Fernandes again while still being in a position to demand a fee, the Red Devils are beginning to explore their options when it comes to midfield reinforcements - with veteran Brazilian star Casemiro also heading for the exits as his contract runs down towards free agency.

According to The Sun, ""United are growing increasingly confident of securing Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in the summer window"". The 22-year-old Cameroon international has been registering on the Red Devils' recruitment radar for some time.

Said interest appears to have become a distraction for Baleba, with his levels dipping slightly in 2025-26. That could make the Seagulls open to talks regarding a big-money sale, with another prized asset at the Amex Stadium tied to a deal through to 2028.

Baleba is not the only player that United are monitoring, though, with alternative options also being identified. The Sun goes on to report that Nottingham Forest playmaker Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace and Bournemouth star Alex Scott are all players that United are prepared to move for in the summer window.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Harry Kane compared to Toni Kroos & Kevin De Bruyne by Vincent Kompany as Bayern Munich manager explains 'freedom' given to star striker","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/harry-kane-compared-toni-kroos-kevin-de-bruyne-vincent-kompany-bayern-munich-freedom-striker/blt4234a06f867874e6","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:29:11 GMT","

Harry Kane has, as a complete forward that blends goal-scoring with ball-playing, been compared to Toni Kroos and Kevin De Bruyne by Bayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany. England captain Kane is all about hitting the net - an artform that he has mastered down the years - but his remarkable numbers in the final third also include plenty of assists.

The 32-year-old frontman has teed up four efforts for grateful team-mates this season, while finding the target on 31 occasions himself across all competitions. Records have continued to tumble around the most prolific of No.9s.

Kane has always prided himself on being a team player, with the former Tottenham striker happy to drop deep and bring others into play. He still spends enough time in the box that allows a sensational strike rate to be maintained.

He is a talismanic presence for club and country, with Bayern and England looking to him for inspiration. Kane rarely disappoints, with his historic tally of goals for the Three Lions being taken to 78 through 112 appearances. At Bayern, the target has been found on 116 occasions across 123 games.

Kompany is delighted to have a modern day legend working under him at the Allianz Arena, with there few flaws that can be spotted in Kane's game. He is a playmaker as much as goalscorer, with his skill set considered to be comparable with World Cup-winning former Real Madrid midfielder Kroos and Manchester City icon De Bruyne - who is now on the books of Serie A champions Napoli.

Kompany has said: “All of our players have a lot of freedom in their position. Harry is allowed to move freely, in the box and behind it. This isn't just about tactics, but about adapting to the respective game. He sometimes has passes in him like Toni Kroos and Kevin De Bruyne. But in the end, he always has to be in the penalty area.”

Kane has, during the 2025-26 campaign, become the quickest player to register 100 goal contributions in the Bundesliga. He reached that milestone in just 78 matches - with ex-Bayern winger Arjen Robben now second on that list having required 119 games to hit the same mark.

Kane's fabled trophy curse was lifted in 2024-25 when becoming a title winner in Germany and is now looking to chase down more major honours at home abroad - having also savoured Super Cup success. Kompany is determined to aid that quest.

He has said of the record books being rewritten: “He won two titles this year for the first time in his career. So I think he has a lot of individual records. He'll keep having a lot of individual records because he's a special player. But I think that now the most important for him is to keep winning titles. We are putting ourselves in good positions and that's important and he plays a big part of course.”

Kane said of his latest achievement: “Extremely proud, obviously. I think it's been entirely of the commitment that I put in every day and the work that I put in, also to the team-mates, to the coaching staff who keep making me better, keep making me improve. And yeah, look, I don't focus too much on these things, but when they happen, I just look forward to bringing on the next one. So let's see how quick we can get the next 100.”

Kane is considered to set the benchmark for central strikers, with former England international Fraizer Campbell having told GOAL of why the most reliable of finishers may be the best of the lot. He said: “He's right up there with the best of them. [Robert] Lewandowski is probably a similar kind of player to him. He's just as good, if not better than him.

“It's credit to him. He's gone from being on the bench at Leicester in the Championship to being the world's best No.9. His numbers and goals don't lie, and you don't do that by chance - it's by working hard, dedication and continuing to do what you do best, hitting the back of the net week in, week out. He's definitely one of the all-time greats, in my opinion.”

Bayern, who remain unbeaten in the league this season and are 11 points clear at the top of the table, will be back in Bundesliga action on Saturday when playing host to RB Leipzig. Kane will hope to be on target there, while also continuing his countdown to the 2026 World Cup finals - with the potential there for GOAT status to be earned with the Three Lions.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Six years following his final appearance at the Australian Open, Roger Federer is back on the courts of Melbourne. 

The Swiss legend returned to Rod Laver Arena on Friday for the first time since 2020 for a practice session with Casper Ruud. 

Federer, who retired from professional tennis in 2022, faced Ruud only once during his career. Their lone Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting came in the fourth round of Roland Garros in 2019, when Federer defeated the Norwegian in straight sets.

The 44-year-old clinched six of his 20 Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open. He owns a 102-15 win-loss record at the tournament, according to the ATP Infosys Win/Loss Index. He last competed in Melbourne in 2020, when he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.

Federer is set to play an exhibition match on Saturday at Rod Laver Arena as a part of the tournament's first Opening Ceremony, which will also feature three fellow ATP No. 1 Club members: Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter, and Lleyton Hewitt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Sinner's subtle changes are not all about Alcaraz","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-australian-open-2026-pre-tournament-press","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:00:41 GMT","

Might we see more of Jannik Sinner at net this Australian Open?

Seeking a three-peat at the year's first major – and the longer-term goal of wrestling back No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings from Carlos Alcaraz - Sinner said that moving forward and his serve were two areas the team worked on during the off-season.

“We worked a lot on trying to make the transition to the net,” the 24-year-old said. “The serve, we changed a couple of things. But all small details. When you are at the top level, these are the small details make the difference. 

“But I would say the first matches you try to get used to the match feeling again, and then after you try to add something. We'll see how things go. We see what conditions we play in.”





The two-time reigning Australian Open and Nitto ATP Finals champion said that the slight modifications to his game were not targeted solely at improving his chances of beating World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, whom he can't dethrone in Melbourne. The duo has split the past eight Grand Slam singles titles and contested the past three finals, with Alcaraz victorious at Roland Garros and the US Open and Sinner taking honours at Wimbledon.

“It's not only for one specific player,” Sinner said. “Look, if you add something to your game, the aim is to get better as a tennis player. It's not about beating one guy. It's more about feeling comfortable in every situation. That's what we tried to do in the off-season. 

“We worked a lot physically. Also, the physical part now is so, so important because the matches, they can get very long but also very intense. The tennis now, it's very fast. You have to be at the top physical level as long as you can. 

“The season is very long, so you have to manage your body in the best possible way. Also, the mental ability to stay there always, it's going to be very important.”

Sinner also spoke about being able to convince Darren Cahill to remain on his coaching team along with Simone Vagnozzi. Last year the Australian said that 2025 might be his final year on the team.

“He's so important for all of us, for all the team,” Sinner said. “He has this huge experience. He knows me now as not only as a player but also as a person now in a different way. 

“He is very important. He's the man who has under control kind of everything. He's our dad for the whole team (smiling). It's good to have him. You feel in a very safe place. It's good.”

Sinner will begin his title defense against Frenchman Hugo Gaston. He is seeded to meet Brazilian teen Joao Fonseca in the third round and Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Copycat Carlos? Why Alcaraz even sees Djokovic similarities in his new serve","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-australian-open-2026-pre-tournament-press","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:10:09 GMT","

Many tennis fans have done a double take watching clips of Carlos Alcaraz's new service motion on social media in recent days. ‘Where have I seen that serve before?', they've asked.

Could the Spaniard be channeling the technique of someone with even more Grand Slam titles than himself? 

When a reporter asked about the new motion in his Australian Open pre-tournament press conference Friday, Alcaraz was ready to have a little fun.

“You wanted to say it's really similar to Djokovic serve (smiling). I know you want to,” Alcaraz bantered. “I wasn't thinking about making the same serve as Djokovic. But at the end, I can even see the similarities.

“I think everyone has to make changes, small details. For me the serve is something that I really want to be better every year, in every tournament. I'm just putting constant work on the serve.”





Alcaraz is not in danger of losing his grip on the No. 1 PIF ATP Ranking this fortnight, even if rival Jannik Sinner completes an Australian Open three-peat. But that doesn't mean the 22-year-old is lacking purpose at Melbourne Park: He will attempt to become the youngest player in history to complete the career Grand Slam.

“As I said before, this is my main goal for this year,” said Alcaraz, who already has won $60m in his young career. “The first tournament is the main goal. I made a really good pre-season, just to be in good shape. I'm just hungry for the title, hungry to do a really good result here. I'm just getting ready as much as I can. I'm really excited about the tournament beginning.”

Reflecting on the departure of Juan Carlos Ferrero from his team, Alcaraz does not believe the change will impact his chances at the Open.

“I have plenty of confidence with the team that I have right now… I'm really grateful for the seven years I've been with Juan Carlos. I learned a lot. Probably thanks to him I'm the player that I am right now. 

“We closed this chapter in mutual. We are still friends, good relationship. But we just decided like this.”

Alcaraz, who last year fell in the quarter-finals to Novak Djokovic, plays his first match against Australian Adam Walton on Day 1, Sunday. He is seeded to meet another Aussie, Alex de Minaur, in the quarter-finals. With Sinner and Djokovic in the bottom half of the draw, potential semi-final opponents for Alcaraz include No. 3 Alexander Zverev, No. 7 Felix Auger-Aliassime and No. 11 Daniil Medvedev.

Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the past eight Grand Slam titles in the past two seasons and have gone head-to-head in the past three major finals, with the Spaniard winning Roland Garros and the US Open and Sinner triumphing at Wimbledon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz chases No. 1 Club history as Career Grand Slam looms at Australian Open","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-career-grand-slam-history-australian-open-2026","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:10:10 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz arrives at the 2026 Australian Open with more than just the year's first major trophy in his sights.

The World No. 1 is playing for a chance to complete the Career Grand Slam and join another exclusive list. Should Alcaraz triumph in Melbourne, he will become just the sixth man in the Open Era — and the fifth ATP No. 1 Club member — to win all four major titles at least once.

Alcaraz would join Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Rod Laver famously captured all four majors in a single season in 1969, but the PIF ATP Rankings were not introduced until 1973. Since then, only four men have completed the Career Grand Slam, each carving a unique path through tennis history.





Andre Agassi
After falling short in consecutive Roland Garros finals in 1990 and 1991, Agassi eventually got over the line at the clay-court major eight years later in 1999. The American rallied from two sets down against Andrei Medvedev in an epic final to become the first man in the PIF ATP Rankings era to complete the Career Grand Slam.

“That was a day, in between the lines of a tennis court, when I knew I wouldn't have any more regrets,” Agassi reflected to Tennis Channel last year. “It was the last one of the four for me to win. It was one I could have won 10 years earlier a couple of times.”

During his career, Agassi won eight major titles and spent 101 weeks at World No. 1 before he retired in 2006.

Roger Federer
Federer also completed his Career Grand Slam at Roland Garros, in 2009, when he finally conquered the one major that had eluded him. His straight-sets victory over Robin Soderling came after years of three consecutive final losses to great rival Rafael Nadal.

“This might be my greatest victory, or rather the one that lifts the most pressure off my shoulders,” Federer said after the match. “I think for the rest of my career I can enjoy playing and never hear that I've never won Roland Garros.”

The Swiss legend lifted 20 major trophies, including winning the other three major trophies at least five times each during his career. He reached the Roland Garros final once more in 2011, but was stopped for a fourth time by Nadal.

Rafael Nadal
Nadal secured his Career Grand Slam at the 2010 US Open, becoming the youngest man in the Open Era to do so at age 24. The victory marked one of the Spaniard's most dominant years, winning each of the final three Grand Slam tournaments to complete a rare surface sweep.

By winning the 2022 Australian Open, Nadal achieved the Career Grand Slam twice, winning each of the four majors at least two times — a testament to his adaptability beyond a record 14 Roland Garros titles. The Spaniard finished his career with 22 Grand Slam trophies and an enduring reputation for competitive intensity.

Novak Djokovic
Djokovic completed his Career Grand Slam at Roland Garros 2016, joining Federer and Nadal in a golden era defined by historic Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalries. He had fallen in three previous finals — two to Nadal (2012, ‘14) and one to Stan Wawrinka (2015) — but made no mistake with a four-set comeback win over Andy Murray.

“It's incredibly flattering to know that Rod Laver is the last one that managed to do that,” said Djokovic, who held all four major titles at the same time. “There are not many words that can describe it. It's one of the ultimate challenges that you have as a tennis player. I'm very proud, very thrilled.”

Djokovic would go on to complete the Career Grand Slam three times, becoming the only man in history to do so. He holds a record 24 major titles and has spent a record 428 weeks at No. 1 throughout his career.

Alcaraz at the Crossroads
Now, six-time major champion Alcaraz stands on the brink of joining this elite group. Over the next two weeks at Melbourne Park, history is once again in play for the 22-year-old.

“It's my first goal, to be honest,” Alcaraz said after his triumph at the 2025 US Open, referring to completing the Career Grand Slam. “When I go to the preseason to [see] what I want to improve, what I want to achieve, the Australian Open is there.

“It is always the main goal for me to complete a Career Grand Slam, Calendar Grand Slam… So it's going to be great.”

Milos Raonic's wife Camille Raonic penned an emotional tribute to her husband after he announced his retirement from tennis on Monday.

Camille took to social media to express her gratitude and love toward the Canadian, stating his ‘career meant so much to so many'. Raonic married Camille in April 2022 and paid tribute to her during his announcement on Monday.

“Your powerful serve became your signiture, your relentless work eithic set you apart and your quiet determination propelled you to the world's biggest stages,” she wrote on Friday. “You broke records, shattered expectations and redefined what was possible for Canadian tennis.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Baez upsets Shelton, pulls double duty to reach Auckland final","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/baez-auckland-2026-friday","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:57:58 GMT","

Can anyone stop Sebastian Baez in 2026? The Argentine maintained his perfect start to the new season on Friday at the ASB Classic, where he pulled double duty to reach the final in Auckland.

After rain suspended play early on Thursday, Baez returned to court against top seed Ben Shelton leading 7-5, 0-1. Upon resumption, the 25-year-old broke the World No. 8's serve again and then held his nerve to seal his third Top 10 win and second of the season, having beaten Taylor Fritz at the United Cup last week.

Baez then returned to court shortly after and dispatched Marcos Giron 6-1, 6-4 to move to 7-0 in 2026. Baez now leads the American 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and is up three spots to No. 36 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Into his 12th tour-level final, Baez will compete for his eighth title and second on a hard court when he takes on third seed Jakub Mensik in the final.



Mensik also pulled double duty on Friday at the ATP 250 to advance to his third ATP Tour title match and first since he defeated Novak Djokovic in the Miami championship showdown last March.

The 20-year-old Czech moved past big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-4, 6-2, breaking the World No. 63 five times, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Mensik then earned a semi-final win against Fabian Marozsan, who dispatched Eliot Spizzirri 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 in his delayed quarter-final earlier on Friday.

In a hard-fought clash, Mensik overcame Hungarian Marozsan 7-6(9), 4-6, 6-1, saving five set points in the first-set tie-break. The World No. 18 Mensik is aiming to become the first Czech player to lift the trophy at the event since Jiri Vesely in 2015.

The six-time champion will compete on Rod Laver Arena for the first time since his 2022 retirement.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 15, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 15, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Roger Federer will bid a proper farewell to the Australian Open ahead of the 2026 tournament on Saturday, competing alongside ATP legends Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt, and Pat Rafter for a “Battle of the world No. 1s” doubles match that kicks off the event's inaugural Opening Ceremony.The six-time champion, who famously coined the “Happy Slam” nickname for the Australian Open, will be back on Rod Laver Arena for the first time since 2020, having officially retired from the sport at the 2022 Laver Cup.“I'm nervous, I'm excited, I'm happy I'm here,” Federer said in a press conference moderated by former ATP doubles No. 1 Todd Woodbridge. “I'm happy there's a moment for the crowd, for me personally, but also being on the court with Lleyton that I shared so much with, Pat that I always loved playing against, even though I never beat him. I always loved Pat. He was one of my favorite players. Then Andre, I was fortunate enough to play against him maybe 10 times or so. Just being together with those guys is going to make me feel better, as well.“I have great memories of just being here,” he added. “It's been an incredible tournament for me and one of my favorite places to play tennis.”

“I have great memories of just being here,” he added. “It's been an incredible tournament for me and one of my favorite places to play tennis.”

At 44 years old, Federer has been inching back into the tennis spotlight, competing in a celebrity doubles match at last fall's Rolex Shanghai Masters and teasing a potential “Legends” tour involving himself and longtime rival Rafael Nadal.“It's hard to make it a priority in the schedule when you have four children and so many other things going on,” said Federer, who for now prefers competing in doubles rather than singles. “I'm happy I'm super still active, busy, doing loads of sports. Tennis is part of that.”Federer took a stroll down memory lane during the press conference, recalling a particularly iconic point that helped him win the 2017 Australian Open, but confessed that nostalgia for his playing days isn't as strong as some might assume.“If I would have won half of what I've done, I'd be equally proud sitting here because I achieved way more than I ever thought I would,” said Federer. “The run, the time that I've had, it what stands out to me. It's been so much fun.”

“I want to be surprised after every match,” insisted the former world No. 1 as she aims to complete a Career Grand Slam in Melbourne.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 16, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Iga Swiatek's Media Day press conference got off to an uncomfortable start at the 2026 Australian Open when a journalist spoiled her projected path to a Career Grand Slam.The former world No. 1 is seeded second in the women's draw and was not happy to learn that both Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina landed in her quarter, employing a fairly spectacular eye roll before shutting down the topic entirely.“I'm not looking at the draw,” said Swiatek who, like many players, prefers not to see the full bracket. “So thanks for the heads-up.”“It's not a joke,” she added firmly. “I'm literally not doing that. So please don't spoil it for me. I want to be surprised after every match. No, because I didn't know. That's it.”The six-time Grand Slam champion has no problem going head-to-head with the media, taking umbrage with the premise of a question about her energy levels last summer after a US Open defeat.

Swiatek was nonetheless able to rebound for the very next question, which was about her successful run at the One Point Slam.“It was great,” smiled Swiatek. “I think it was so much fun. Honestly, like, everybody was watching. Like also off the court, everybody said they were so, like, emotional about it, you know?”The reigning Wimbledon champion was able to score wins over ATP players Frances Tiafoe and Flavio Cobolli, outrallying the latter to reach the quarterfinals.“It's fun. It's something new, refreshing. I think this is what tennis sometimes needs, to put the events out like that. Yeah, playing against Flavio was super fun. Honestly, I like to play against guys. I already could do that in some mixed doubles. Here, I felt like I need to really push him. When he would have a chance to open the court, I would be nowhere there.“Half of the players I think took it seriously; half of them didn't. I was, like, warming up, I was ready. I really wanted to play a backhand cross-court rally with Frances, but didn't get a chance!”

At 24 years old Swiatek, who began the year with a win for Poland at the United Cup, is part of a trio that includes Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner of active players with victories at three of the four major tournaments. But that's a narrative Swiatek insists she's not thinking too much about.“I think you guys are thinking more about it,” she said through another awkward—but decidedly less tense—exchange. “Since the beginning of the year, there are many people coming to me and talking to me about it. I'm really just focusing on, like, day-by-day work. This is how it's always been for me. This is how I actually was able to achieve the success that I already have, just focusing really on grinding, match by match.Winning a Grand Slam is tough. Like a lot of things have to come together to do that. Yeah, it's a tough tournament. So, I have, like, no expectations. Obviously, it would be a dream come true. This is not, like, my clear goal that I wake up with. I'm thinking more about how I want to play, what I want to improve, like, day by day.”That day by day process will begin on Monday against Yuan Yue—an opponent about whom Swiatek will no doubt be duly informed.

Though she sought inspiration from reading last summer, the world No. 1's whirlwind off-season has kept her from making headway in her TBR list.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 16, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 16, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Aryna Sabalenka has been everywhere since the 2025 season ended in November, stacking high-profile exos and talk-show appearances that left the world No. 1 far too busy to engage in quieter pursuits on the eve of the 2026 Australian Open.Sabalenka famously sought wisdom from the world of self-help last summer, turning to James R. Doty's Into the Magic Shop and crediting the book with the mindset that helped her defend her US Open title. Asked if she's made any further headway in her to-be-read list, the top seed demurred:

Q. You talked about reading that memoir Into the Magic Shop. Have you read anything else in the off-season, anything about mindfulness?ARYNA SABALENKA: Not really. (Laughter.) I don't know, guys. I'm terrible in reading books. I always follow how I feel, you know? That time I felt like reading. I wanted to disappear from the social media, just wanted to be by myself with the book. That time it worked perfectly.Yeah, last couple of months, even more than that, been pretty busy. I didn't even have time to, like, just sit back and just like have my moment with the book. So I haven't ready anything.Why I feel so embarrassed? Especially when other players reading nonstop. Well, I have to be honest. Like studying, reading, learning never been my weapon, so maybe that's why I succeed in tennis, because this is the only spot was left for me (laughter).Q. Do you feel like you get inspiration from music, movies?ARYNA SABALENKA: I get inspired by just seeing next generation cheering for me, get inspired by me. That's my inspiration. Also I love listen music. I just brings me to another world where I can dream and think, yeah, and try to kind of like get better in a way. Also, yeah, movies as well. But also not enough time right now for movies.

Sabalenka has been too busy making stories of her own on the court in 2026, making a winning start to the season by winning a second Brisbane International title.“I felt exhausted after Atlanta and New York,” she said of her hectic December schedule, “but I had one or two days off, so I felt recovered after. I had a great preparation. Then there is really high-intensity match against Nick, which is also part of my preparation.“By the end of the pre-season, I felt really strong and ready.”Sabalenka will put that strength to the test in her first round against French wild card Tiantsoa Sarah Rakotomanga Rajaonah.

Ranked outside the Top 1000, the former US Open champion won three straight matches for the first time since 2024.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 15, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Sloane Stephens will be the first to tell you that ebbs and flows are natural parts of a tennis career.“In my career, I've had ups and downs that have been exciting, not exciting, anticlimactic, all the things,” Stephens said with a smile after booking her spot in the 2026 Australian Open main draw. “That's a part of life and a part of the journey.”But even Stephens, a 32-year-old former Grand Slam champion currently ranked No. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American.

“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American.

That journey took the 2017 US Open winner off tour for much of the last 12 months as she dealt with a persistent foot injury. Playing just six matches in 2025, Stephens watched tennis from the literal sidelines as an analyst for various networks, watching the game evolve—but remain recognizable—in her absence.“When you don't play a lot, there's a little lull. You don't feel as competitive and you don't feel as attached to the game,” she explained. “So, it was just being able to get back, train really hard, and play and have fun on court at home. Then, I was able to translate that into a match.”After starting the 2026 season with a three-set defeat at the ASB Classic, Stephens—along with her mom, aunt, and coach Kamau Murray—traveled to Melbourne early to compete in qualifying for the first time since 2011. For reference, the last time Stephens didn't gain direct acceptance into a Grand Slam main draw, the Harry Potter and Twilight film series were still in theaters.“I think I was the only Grand Slam champion to be in qualies, which was interesting,” Stephens said with a still-formidable side eye. “I was like, ‘Oh God! A lot of pressure.' I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.”

For reference, the last time Stephens didn't gain direct acceptance into a Grand Slam main draw, the Harry Potter and Twilight film series were still in theaters.“I think I was the only Grand Slam champion to be in qualies, which was interesting,” Stephens said with a still-formidable side eye. “I was like, ‘Oh God! A lot of pressure.' I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.”

I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.”

She figured it out with few issues over three rounds, rallying from a set down to defeat Australian Olivia Gadecki on Wednesday and holding off a late surge to solve No. 2 seed Lucia Bronzetti to guarantee a 14th main-draw appearance in Melbourne.“It was weird to be in qualies and wonder how it even worked,” mused Stephens. “I didn't even know we played back-to-back from yesterday to today. There were so many things I didn't know, but I was like, ‘I'm just gonna play.' It's strange but it's fun. You go out there, do the best you can. A lot of times in my career, I haven't been afraid to put myself out there, win or lose. Sometimes you get rewarded and sometimes you don't.”Where past years have been rife with stress, the 2013 semifinalist is taking a different approach on the court and behind the scenes, vlogging her trip to Melbourne in a rare peek behind the curtain into Stephens' off-court life.“I would have never shown anything like that ever in life,” Stephens laughed. “It's just another way to have fun and experience things, and not be so serious. Being on the other side and doing TV and stuff, I can see how fans would want to see those kinds of moments.“Definitely one of the goals this year is just to have more fun and to enjoy it. I want my family, friends and everyone to be able to experience it.”

As mom Sybil texted near the small interview scrum, Stephens showed off her Free People Movement tennis dress, a lacey yellow ensemble evocative of Ted Tinling's iconic designs.“This was made in my living room, and it took about four fittings,” claimed Stephens, lifting her sweatshirt to show off the intricacies. “Maria Sakkari asked me if it was even a tennis dress and I was like, ‘Yeah girl. Let me show you!' Free People Movement, they're growing and they're like the cool kids in town.”Win or lose, that's a role Stephens has inhabited flawlessly in over a decade on tour. Determined to play through this comeback with no regrets, she appears ready to take that casual confidence back to the Grand Slam stage this weekend.

How drivers will adapt in 2026

F1.com looks back at the drivers and teams whose success brought an end to the previous dominance of some of their competitors.

McLaren will enter 2026 fresh off the back of winning their second consecutive Teams' Championship, a title that they wrapped up with a whopping 364-point advantage over second-placed Mercedes.

On the Drivers' title side, meanwhile, Lando Norris toppled Max Verstappen to bring an end to the Dutchman's four-year reign as World Champion – but will another team and driver combination get in the way of McLaren's ascent in the season ahead?

Those hoping to do just that might want to take inspiration from the following cases in F1 history, where a new championship victor stopped a previous dynasty in its tracks…

Ferrari had been on a dominant run from the mid-1970s onwards; seemingly reinvigorated by the arrival of Niki Lauda in 1974, the Scuderia went on to score back-to-back Teams' Championships between 1975 and 1977. Lauda also claimed two Drivers' titles, just missing out in 1976 following his horror accident at the Nurburgring.

However, over at Lotus – a squad that had previously used innovative designs to their advantage, having collected three Teams' titles during the early 1970s with the revolutionary Lotus 72 – Colin Chapman was working on a new car that would utilise the benefits of ground effect.

This was the Lotus 78, which made its debut in 1977. While the outfit had to settle for second place in that season's championship, they hit their stride in 1978 – a year that also saw the arrival of the 78's successor, the Lotus 79 – and clinched their first Teams' crown since 1973.

They also ended a six-year wait for another Drivers' title, with Mario Andretti scoring five wins en route to what would prove to be his sole championship in Formula 1.

Should McLaren win a third consecutive Teams' Championship in 2026, it would mark the outfit's strongest run since they clinched four in a row between 1988 and 1991. Indeed, the squad had outlined their prowess going back as far as 1984, collecting a total of seven Drivers' titles and six Teams' in that eight-year period.

Williams had snatched two Teams' wins from their rivals in 1986 and 1987, as well as taking the World Championship with Nelson Piquet in the latter. But after slipping backwards in the fight towards the end of the decade, it looked like the squad's fortunes might be about to change when a certain Adrian Newey joined as Chief Designer in 1991 to working along incumbent Technical Director Patrick Head.

The combination proved to be an effective one, with the FW14 car bringing the team numerous wins in 1991. While it was not enough to take the championship away from McLaren on that occasion, the 1992-spec FW14B – which harnessed groundbreaking technology such as active suspension – proved to be a dominant force.

Nigel Mansell notched up nine victories to seal his first and only Drivers' title, and Williams ended McLaren's run of Teams' Championships, kickstarting a strong era for the Grove-based outfit that would see them collect further accolades into the 1990s.

That aforementioned run for Williams resulted in four more Teams' titles and three Drivers' Championships between 1993 and 1997. Over at McLaren, the squad were busy trying to rebuild after being knocked off their perch – and part of this attempt involved enticing Adrian Newey away from their rivals.

Joining ahead of the 1997 campaign, Newey's arrival was too late to influence that year's car – but the Briton instead focused his efforts on the 1998 challenger, preparing to adapt to new regulations that would see the cars' widths reduced and grooved tyres used.

The resultant MP4-13 looked to have aced this task, allowing Mika Hakkinen to clinch a maiden World Championship while the squad wrapped up their first Teams' crown in seven years. Williams, meanwhile, suffered a winless campaign, an unwanted milestone they had not experienced since 1988.

Hakkinen would go on to win another title in 1999, while Ferrari were triumphant in the Teams' battle – a sign of things to come, with the Scuderia subsequently embarking on a dynasty of their own alongside Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004. Until…

After a record-breaking run of five consecutive World Championships – and six Teams' titles – the task of challenging Schumacher and Ferrari seemed a lofty one. However, amid the introduction of new technical regulations, Fernando Alonso and Renault kickstarted a sea change in 2005.

Along with alterations to the rules on aerodynamics, tyre changes during pit stops were banned – and, in the era of the so-called ‘tyre war' between Bridgestone and Michelin, this favoured the teams running the latter's more durable rubber while seemingly putting the three outfits using the former – that being Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi – at a disadvantage.

The result was that the previously dominant Schumacher and Ferrari saw their fortunes change in 2005, with the German scoring just one win – at the infamous six-car United States Grand Prix – en route to third place in the Drivers' Championship.

Alonso, meanwhile, collected seven victories to beat McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen to the title by 21 points – making him the youngest-ever champion at the time – before following this up with a second World Championship in 2006.

Following the success of Alonso and Renault, a different name experienced title glory in 2007 (Kimi Raikkonen), 2008 (Lewis Hamilton) and 2009 (Jenson Button) before another dynasty took hold when Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull became a seemingly unstoppable force, scoring every Drivers' and Teams' Championship between 2010 and 2013.

However, change was again afoot amid the arrival of the turbo-hybrid era. Mercedes, like other teams, did not arrive at pre-season testing ahead of the 2014 campaign with their car where they wanted it to be – but in the days and weeks that followed, the Silver Arrows started to mark themselves out as favourites, experiencing better reliability than many of their rivals.

That promise soon translated into real pace when the campaign got underway, with Mercedes triumphant across the opening six races as an intra-team battle started to play out between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. And while Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was the only other man to take a win that season, Vettel did not appear as comfortable with the RB10 and failed to stand on the top step.

There were no such troubles for the Silver Arrows, whose dominance during that campaign – one in which Hamilton ultimately beat Rosberg to the crown – led to a run of seven back-to-back Drivers' Championships and eight consecutive Teams' titles for the Brackley-based outfit.

While the 2021 season did not signal a complete changing of the guard, it very much shone a light on the growing threat posed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen – a name that would remain at the top for the next few years.

Following his breakthrough victory at Barcelona in 2016, Verstappen had been steadily adding to that tally across the seasons that followed. But it was not until 2021 that the Dutchman became a serious title contender for the first time, going head-to-head in an epic battle with reigning champion Hamilton.

A dramatic conclusion to that campaign saw Verstappen claim his debut title – but the introduction of new ground effect regulations in 2022 meant that the pecking order was uncertain when the Red Bull man prepared to defend his crown.

As it was, the Milton Keynes-based outfit looked to have aced the new rules, resulting in them becoming the first squad other than Mercedes to win the Teams' Championship since they themselves had last been victorious in 2013. Verstappen, meanwhile, chalked up consecutive Drivers' titles through to 2024 – before another change occurred with the 2025 season…

While Verstappen had secured his fourth championship in 2024, the triumph had not come quite as easily as during his incredibly dominant 2023 campaign. This was in part due to the continued resurgence of McLaren, who returned to the top step of the podium in 2024 for the first time since their one-off Monza win with Daniel Ricciardo in 2021.

Following that victory at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix – which also marked Lando Norris' first F1 win – the papaya squad increasingly became a thorn in Red Bull's side, with both Norris and team mate Oscar Piastri adding to the wins tally and giving McLaren the Teams' Championship. Remarkably, the squad had not previously achieved this accolade since 1998.

With Verstappen largely left to lead Red Bull's charge alone, the combined force of Norris and Piastri at McLaren became even more unstoppable in 2025, helping the outfit to wrap up a second Teams' Championship with six rounds still to spare.

The Drivers' title, however, was a slightly different story, as Verstappen launched a stunning comeback during the second half of the season to take the fight down to the wire against the papaya cars. Despite the Dutchman's best efforts, it was ultimately Norris who succeeded to seal a maiden World Championship – but, amid a wave of new technical regulations in 2026, can the Briton and his team maintain their run of form into the campaign ahead? Time will tell…

The 34-track soundtrack features music from artist and composer Peter Peter. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	The Heated Rivalry soundtrack is finally here. 


	The 34-track album featuring the score of the Canadian show's composer Peter Peter dropped Friday, midnight local time. The soundtrack is Peter's debut score. He was hired by Heated Rivalry creator and showrunner Jacob Tierney after the writer spent “much of the series' preproduction immersed in Peter's previous solo work,” according to a release. 




	Released by Milan Records, the soundtrack includes both tender tracks for the moments of yearning and up-beat, techo-infused tracks for the show's more heart pounding moments. Friday's release is strictly digital, however, the label says the soundtrack is set to be released in physical forms — both on CD and vinyl — later this year.

	The music of Heated Rivalry, both the score and songs used in the show, have been a hot topic online. Tierney using T.A.T.u's 2002 anthem “All The Things She Said” as a major needle drop caused the song's Spotify streams to jump 135 percent in the U.S. in the week following the episode it was featured in. British artist Harrison's remix of the show, also featured in the same sequence, saw a 139,000 percent increase in global streams on the platform from Dec. 12 to Dec. 24.


Heated Rivalry, hailing from Canadian streamer Crave and airing on HBO Max in the U.S., centers around a fictional hockey universe based on books by Rachel Reid. The show focuses on two rival professional players — Canada-born Shane Hollander (Williams) of the fictitious Montreal Metros and Russia-born Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) of the fictitious Boston Raiders — as they navigate a near-decade-long situationship turned relationship.

	











	Crave renewed Heated Rivalry for a second season and HBO Max confirmed it will continue to air the series. Earlier this week, Reid announced that she'll be publishing her seventh book in the Game Changers series, which Heated Rivalry and its sequel The Long Game belong to. The book, Unrivaled, will be the next chapter in Shane and Ilya's story.

The change in leadership may mean a new hope for the storied franchise or it could be an attack of the clones by giving fans more of the same. 



		By Aaron Couch, Borys Kit 

	January 15, 2026 2:30pm	




	After 14 years guiding Star Wars into the modern era through all its ups and downs, Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down as the president of Lucasfilm. Her departure from the company, which is effective this week, has long been expected, but still marks a seismic shift for one of the biggest brands in Hollywood.


	Kennedy had already spent decades producing movies such as Indiana Jones and E.T. when she joined Lucasfilm in 2012, taking on the role of co-chair alongside Star Wars creator George Lucas. She was elevated to sole head of the company just a few months later, after Disney paid $4 billion for the brand and Lucas exited.

	Kennedy is not departing the galaxy far, far away immediately. As part of her exit, she will continue on as a producer on the next two Lucasfilm movies, The Mandalorian and Grogu, coming May 22, and 2027's Star Wars: Starfighter. She will pursue other projects outside Lucasfilm as an independent producer.




			Popular on THR		







	In her wake, executive vp and chief creative officer Dave Filoni has been promoted to oversee the creative direction of the company as president and chief creative officer, Lucasfilm. President & GM of Lucasfilm business Lynwen Brennan will handle the business side of things as co-president, Lucasfilm. Splitting creative and the business duties is a common Disney strategy, with Pixar run by Pete Docter and Jim Morris, and Walt Disney Animation overseen by Jared Bush and Clark Spencer.

	











	Filoni and Brennan will report to Alan Bergman, co-chairman, Disney Entertainment.


	“It has been a true privilege to spend more than a decade working alongside the extraordinary talent at Lucasfilm,”  Kennedy in a statement. “Their creativity and dedication have been an inspiration, and I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished together. I'm excited to continue developing films and television with both longtime collaborators and fresh voices who represent the future of storytelling.”


	Kennedy's exit closes out one Star Wars era and launches a new one, with the elevation of Filoni and Brennan posing many questions with few answers yet revealed. One thing is certain: After a period of relative inactivity as the Kennedy succession was settled, Lucasfilm could see development go into hyperdrive under the new leadership.


	Filoni was mentored by Lucas and came up through the world of animation, overseeing beloved series such as The Clone Wars before teaming with Jon Favreau on live-action shows such as The Mandalorian and Ahsoka. Brennan joined Lucasfilm in 1999 and rose to president of Industrial Light & Magic before assuming her current role in 2015, overseeing all of business for the company.


	Kennedy was a veteran producer boasting eight best picture Oscar nominations on titles such as The Sixth Sense and Lincoln when she took over Lucasfilm and worked quickly to move into the new era of Star Wars movies. She courted J.J. Abrams to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the $2 billion grossing feature that launched a new trilogy in 2015. It was the first Star Wars feature since 2005's Revenge of the Sith and met the moment of pent-up demand with a mix of nostalgia and new characters. It stands as the top grossing movie of all time at the domestic box office with $936.6 million. More movies followed annually, including the $1 billion grossing Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, The Last Jedi ($1.33 billion), Solo: A Star Wars Story ($392.9 million) and The Rise of Skywalker ($1 billion).

	











	It was not always smooth sailing. Kennedy fired filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller as directors of Solo, replacing them with Ron Howard mid-production. The film became the first Star Wars movie to lose money in its theatrical run. During the production of Rogue One, she sidelined director Gareth Edwards, with Tony Gilroy brought in to overhaul the movie. And while that move engendered plenty of sky-is-falling narratives, it proved to be savvy as the movie became a major critical and financial hit, and later led to Gilroy's critically adored and Emmy-winning Disney+ prequel series Andor.


	Following Rise of Skywalker, which received a mixed response, Disney put Star Wars movies on pause, with CEO Bob Iger acknowledging it produced too many movies too quickly. Over the past decade, Lucasfilm went through stops and starts as it promised movies that failed to materialize, including projects from Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Last Jedi filmmaker Rian Johnson and Taika Waititi. A movie starring Daisy Ridley has been stuck in development since it was announced in 2023.


	It now has two films on the way, with Mandalorian and Grogu arriving May 22 and Shawn Levy's Star Wars: Starfighter dated for May 28, 2027.


	While the movie side of Star Wars faltered after Rise of Skywalker, Kennedy's decision to bring in Favreau to create and launch the first live-action Star Wars TV series proved to be a win beyond anyone's expectation. The Mandalorian shot Baby Yoda into popular culture and the initial seasons not only restored Star Wars' golden stature but also became the flagship show for Disney+ when it launched in late 2019.

	











	The series that followed, however, had mixed results, with one, the 2024 show The Acolyte, being outright rejected by a certain faction of the sometimes intemperate fan base. Andor, on the opposite end of the spectrum, showed Star Wars could be used to tell stories with political themes. It became a showcase for its actors and ended its run with five Emmys and 22 nominations. Overall, Star Wars series under Kennedy have landed 85 Emmy noms. Coming up will be a second season of Ahsoka and the animated Maul: Shadow Lord series.


	Lucasfilm in recent years also undertook reviving Ron Howard's Willow series on Disney+, as well as a fifth and final Indiana Jones movie, but neither found the hoped-for audience.


	The new leadership arrives with its own set of questions. Filoni is known for his intimate and arcane franchise knowledge, which served him well in animation, but less so in live-action. Season three of The Mandalorian and season one of Ahsoka dealt with intricate facets of interclan rivalry and Jedi witches that were perhaps too in the weeds for casual viewers. He was also set to make his live-action feature directorial debut with a movie that combined characters from these the series, but that movie was put on the back burner and Favreau's The Mandalorian and Grogu is now opening this spring.


	Observers point out that under Filoni and Brennan, the franchise could see a continuation of many of the practices and priorities set forth under Kennedy. After all, both have been at Lucasfilm for years and are part of the institution.

	











	Others point out that the company stepped back from announcing projects, both feature and TV, last year, as Kennedy negotiated her exit and a search for successors took place. For all intents and purposes, the company was spinning its wheels. Now, these sources say, Lucasfilm can move ahead with full force as it seeks to recapture the excitement and creativity of a more civilized age.


	On Thursday, Disney's top brass gave Kennedy a sendoff, with CEO Bob Iger recalling: “When we acquired Lucasfilm more than a decade ago, we knew we were bringing into the Disney family not only one of the most beloved and enduring storytelling universes ever created, but also a team of extraordinary talent led by a visionary filmmaker — someone who had been handpicked by George Lucas himself, no less.”


	Added Bergman: “Kathleen Kennedy has been a tremendous force in the industry for 50 years, and it's been our privilege to have her here at Disney leading Lucasfilm for nearly 14 of them.”


	The journey to reawaken the Force won't be straightforward. The franchise has always struggled to appease those nostalgic for the classic stories and characters, a fanbase with strict ideas on what Star Wars means, and those who believe that evolving is the only way the brand doesn't get stuck in amber.


	This week, in a prophetic movie, Disneyland announced a pivot at Star Warsland. It will phase out characters and storylines created during the Kennedy-run sequels such as Kylo Ren and bringing back Darth Vader and other Lucas creations.

The 'Last Week Tonight' host made the comments on Trevor Noah's podcast Thursday.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


HBO Last Week Tonight host John Oliver is not a big a fan of the non-stop barrage of media mergers, but he and his team have no plans to change what they are doing, regardless of whether Netflix or Paramount ends up with the prize.


	“I think mergers are generally bad. I think you're always hoping for the least bad option,” Oliver told former Daily Show host Trevor Noah on his podcast Thursday (Noah will host the Grammy Awards for Paramount next month). “I think that the key thing for us is to act with enough aggression or confidence… I will act assuming nothing is going to happen. We're not going to change, right?”

	“We've been behaving the way we've been behaving for long enough that you can't really reason with us,” he continued. “So there's no point doing that.”

	Oliver noted that HBO has been sold twice already since he started hosting his show, once in Time Warner's sale to AT&T, and again in WarnerMedia's spinout into Warner Bros. Discovery.


	“You know, these things come with cuts,” Oliver said.


	And he expressed skepticism about the state of media generally, questioning whether all of the deals are really warranted.


	“There are going to be question marks on all of this, right? Because it's very hard to justify this legally,” Oliver said. “Now, whether that makes it impossible for it to happen, that's an open question.”

	











	Netflix of course has a signed deal for Warner Bros., but Paramount is threatening a hostile bid. Both could face tough regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, though Paramount has argued that it has an easier path.

	When she first sees him, she shouts out his name and runs over to give him a hug, eager to welcome back the fellow physician with whom she appeared to develop a fast friendship on her own first day in the emergency department in season one.


	But while she seems excited to see him, it's not until the second episode of the season when viewers learn if she knew about his drug problem and where he'd been while he was away.


	Langdon tells her about his addiction and stint in rehab while he's examining her after a patient on the run from the cops knocks her over, causing her to hit her head on the hospital floor.


	She seems to take in the news thoughtfully and indicates that she was trying not to listen to rumors, as Langdon says he “let a lot of people down” and apologizes to her.


	“You never let me down,” Mel says, acting as if he didn't need to apologize.

	











	Explaining Mel's reaction, Dearden says it's in keeping with her optimistic, kind-hearted character but also reflects how far Mel has come as a doctor.


	“Mel sees the best in everyone, and pretty much only sees the best in everyone, and even if there's a dark spot, she's like the first to forgive, and I don't think the news affects her at all,” Dearden tells The Hollywood Reporter of learning the truth about Langdon. “I think the only thing that is different is that she's a different doctor now. She's not someone who desperately needs someone to to be there for her. And she's more independent and trying, and she's excited to reincorporate Dr. Langdon back into her professional life and as a friend and a mentor.”


	As for Langdon, Ball says he's returning far less confident than he was in season one.


	“You meet a Langdon in season one that was really sure of himself and knew what his role was and knew that if there was a problem, he was the one to fix it and liked to move fast and work hard and was always pretty sure that he was doing the right thing,” he tells THR. “I think in season two, you meet a Langdon who maybe isn't so sure.”


	And as with other elements of The Pitt that strive for an accurate representation of health care workers, addiction is something that the medical community is grappling with, Ball explains.


	“This is something that affects my life and the lives of many people that I love, and so to be asked to be part of telling this story was an honor and a responsibility, and something that I wanted to make sure that we did with the utmost respect and realism,” he says. “I didn't want anybody to feel like this was a suffering Olympics or anything like that. And I wanted to make sure that we understand that addiction is a disease. It's been very important to me that we believe that rehabilitation is possible and change is possible, and that nobody out there who may be suffering from addiction feels like they are too far gone or that they're going to be stigmatized and laughed at by this show. And I think [showrunner R.] Scott [Gemmill] and [executive producer] John [Wells] and [star-writer-producer] Noah [Wyle], they've done a really good job of treating that with respect.”

	











	New episodes of The Pitt drop Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT on HBO Max ahead of the season finale on April 16.

The 'Sinners' star is back on the big screen and ready to unleash his blinged-out satanist Sir Jimmy Crystal on the world in Nia DaCosta's sequel '28 Years Later: The Bone Temple': ""People are going to lose their minds.""


							By 

	Lily Ford



	From the penultimate floor of London's luxe 45 Park Lane hotel, the capital's skyline is betrayed by dreary, grayish clouds.


	This is not only extremely typical weather for the sun-starved population here in the U.K., but provides us Brits with a much-needed small talk starter (it's either that or the selection of fruit and pastries up for grabs on the coffee table).




	So, the publicists, makeup team and fellow members of the press — all of us peering out of the floor-to-ceiling windows with a grimace — begin doing just that. We lament our seasonal woes and reminisce on brighter days, and while I'm led into a larger room with even grander windows, Jack O'Connell throws in his two cents: “I love winter.” He looks the part of a man having to get on with movie press in a dull January, wearing a cream, knitted sweater and black trousers. He picks up an apple and bites into it.

	“I love winter,” he says again, eyes fixed on the rainy horizon. An innocuous comment to most, but for a detail-obsessed entertainment journalist with a soft spot for flamboyant writing, it's something else entirely. The actor's statement is a telltale glimpse into the unpredictability of Jack O'Connell, a hint of the contrarians we're accustomed to seeing him play onscreen, and a fabulous example of the off-the-wall energy with which our conversations are immediately fired up by.

	The 35-year-old is having one hell of a year, catching his breath after starring in Ryan J. Coogler's slick vampire film Sinners, which has gone on to dominate awards season. On Sunday, Coogler, Michael B. Jordan and crew took to the stage at the Golden Globes to accept the award for best box office achievement, having accrued a cool $368 million.


	When The Hollywood Reporter last caught up with O'Connell, his charming, bloodsucking Remmick was just about to hit theaters. “It would have been audacious,” the Brit laughs about anticipating the kind of success Sinners would go on to chalk up. “It sort of fills me with the promise about cinema-going. I think we're in quite a frightened era,” he says, “especially people involved in film [who] are really desperate to know what the future is going to hold. So for people to go and watch Sinners, it's really, really reassuring. There's a resilience there. And long may that continue.”


	The actor's signature roguishness dates back to the '00s, when a Bristol-set teen drama called Skins was airing and, it would turn out, producing a young talent pool of superstars. A 17-year-old O'Connell played Cook — a boisterous Jack the Lad character, you won't be surprised to find out — alongside Kaya Scodelario and Luke Pasqualino. They took over from the first generation led by Nicholas Hoult, Daniel Kaluuya, Dev Patel, Joe Dempsie, and Hannah Murray.


	“It was university to us, do you know what I mean?” says O'Connell when asked about how formative his time on Skins was. “It taught us to turn up on time and deliver. At the age where everyone else was at university, we got to spend that period of our lives in Bristol making the coolest program ever.”

	











	Since then, he's constructed a résumé marked by variety. This includes David Mackenzie's 2013 prison crime drama Starred Up, seductive 2022 historical romance Lady Chatterly's Lover with Emma Corrin, Michael Mann's racing drama Ferrari (2023) and Sam Taylor-Johnson's Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black (2024). If you're more partial to watching us Englishmen on TV, maybe O'Connell's most recognizable as British Army officer Paddy Mayne in Steven Knight's ongoing BBC drama SAS: Rogue Heroes.


	But we're at the hotel to discuss what might be O'Connell's most outrageous role to date. He's about to blow minds as the bleach-blond cult leader Sir Jimmy Crystal in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, out Jan. 16 and again penned by Alex Garland. Nia DaCosta‘s wild ride of a zombie sequel picks up right where Danny Boyle left off in last year's installment, spinning the hit horror franchise on its head and putting the psycho-social ramifications of the infection under a microscope.


	Our teen protagonist Spike (Alfie Williams) has ditched the self-sufficient survivor community on an island off the coast of Northumberland, England, only to find himself at the behest of Sir Jimmy's satanic appetite for torture. Ralph Fiennes returns as bone collector Dr. Kelson, who eventually crosses paths with Sir Jimmy's twisted ideology and his “fingers” — the wig-wearing minions weaponized by their charismatic kingpin.


	“I got sent a script, so I was left to kind of make up my own mind,” begins O'Connell about his introduction to the blinged-out Scot. “I was reading all of these characters on the page, and I think part of me was drawn the most to Sir Jimmy. Then it was a case of going to Danny's house — Nia was there — and just discussing it. [I] gave my view on who the guy is and left and waited to hear. It was that infamous period just after an audition where you're sort of on edge.” So he knew he wanted the part? “Oh, really badly.”

	











	When asked about how he'd tease Sir Jimmy to audiences coming into this film, it's a case of finding as many synonyms as possible for the word evil. “He is a vehicle through the uttermost darkest, depraved parts of us,” O'Connell says. “He exists in this post-apocalyptic landscape and he's therefore allowed to be completely no-holds-barred. He survived, so we have to give him some credit. But in Alfie, in Spike, he sees a new recruit — and listen, these guys are lavishing in it. They're having a really good fucking time.”


	“We see what happens to him as a kid, how dreadful and corrupting that has been for him,” he adds, referencing the beginning of Boyle's film. “And this is how he's exercising it. This is the reality, according to Sir Jimmy, which is a very warped one.”


	Upon the release of 28 Years Later, fans went bananas for the theory that O'Connell's tracksuit-donning ringleader is inspired by British media personality and DJ Jimmy Savile, who, after his 2011 death, was accused of wielding his popularity to sexually abuse hundreds of people, including young children and the elderly. Does the hypothesis have legs? “Yeah,” says the actor. “I think he sort of models himself on the memory of this figure that was always on TV.”


	In the 28 Years universe, the virus outbreak occurred in 2002, and thus Savile's crimes ultimately remain buried. “I think what Alex [Garland] means behind that, and I can't speak for him, but my take was unchecked power. I think it totally exists in the story to unsettle,” says O'Connell. “I love that it's showing how popular culture just went kaput. And you see these people who were, in some way or another, just trying to latch on to what the messaging was in that era… And because me and Nia are the same age, we would constantly go back to that well: ‘What were people up to back in the day?'” he says about the infection's freezing of time. “He uses lingo like ‘peeps.' We don't say peeps anymore!” Something about the delivery suggests O'Connell would love to still be throwing ‘peeps' around.

	











	Tiptoeing around spoilers, he talks about being encouraged by The Marvels helmer DaCosta to chip away at Sir Jimmy's sensitivity in one particularly memorable scene. “Getting to bounce off Ralph Fiennes alone is a wonderful opportunity,” he tells THR. “But I think I remember Nia nudging me to be more vulnerable and not be sure-footed. It was very easy to just assume Jimmy's in command all of the time, but I'm not sure how interesting that would be.”


	O'Connell calls sharing a screen with Conclave star Fiennes “a career highlight.” He explains: “You're never done learning, and when you're working with someone like Ralph, it's gonna come at you in buckets.” He recalls trying to be as attentive as possible, but much of what Fiennes taught him was in the tirelessness of his approach. “It doesn't matter if it's the start of the day or the end, there's an investigation going on. Interrogating the work, the scene, and trying to find newness and more inroads, which is really reassuring to see — to work with an actor at the level Ralph is at and still finding that desire to find more.”


	On the contrasting directorial styles of Boyle and DaCosta, O'Connell is only full of praise for the pair. “What they both have in common is [they're] unflappable,” he says. “They never relent. They're just in it with you, which is massively fucking rewarding.” Stylistically, he says, the camera was a lot more static on DaCosta's shoot — Boyle's frantic filmmaking process is slightly less traditional — but he's confident The Bone Temple has its own voice. “Nia's using her insights as a fan, but she's completely put her own mark on it.” It's clear O'Connell's also just pretty damn chuffed for his friend.

	











	And while a method approach wasn't necessary for Sir Jimmy — “there was no requirement to be like, ‘Well, I'm a fucking satanist. Stay out of my way!'” — he does admit to having to remain a little intense. It's not quite how the 15-year-old Williams remembers it, who told THR earlier this week that O'Connell would march into the tent on set and begin to serenade his cast and crew with a guitar. He smirks. “Night shoots can be long.”


	Does O'Connell like playing the bad guy? “It's been a lot of fun. There's not been any conscious effort made,” he says. “I've been rolling with the punches a little bit.” Though he is trying “not to concentrate” on the fact that he keeps nailing these sinister roles. “Listen, I love my job. I'm excited for what might be next. The long and short of it is just to try and treat every role the same way I always do, with the same sort of curiosity.”


	Thankfully, we do know what's next. O'Connell has already shot Boyle's upcoming biographical drama Ink, written by James Graham. This time around, he's playing Larry Lamb: editor of The Sun and an early accomplice of Rupert Murdoch, who transformed the outlet into the notorious tabloid we know today. Guy Pearce co-stars as the Aussie media mogul.


	“It's great writing, James Graham, like fucking phenomenal writing, and a really fascinating period of British history and our culture. A lot has changed since then — an awful lot,” says O'Connell about portraying the mastermind behind page three glamor models. “Back then, [there was] an emphasis on newspapers to keep people up to speed, to keep people informed enough to be able to vote responsibly. Have we lost that? Does that exist now?” His questions hang in the air. “I'm not sure. It's kind of niche now, isn't it, to have responsible, non-biased information.”

	











	For the next few months, though, O'Connell's riding the high of Sir Jimmy Crystal's disconcerting magnetism. “There's the apprehension of never knowing,” he says about hoping for turnout from cinemagoers. “But there's fun to be had in that. I really love this film. I'm so proud of what Nia has done, Ralph, having worked with him and my gang. I'm enormously proud. So, yes, I am biased. But I think people are going to lose their minds over it.”


	There's only one question left to answer. Remmick vs Sir Jimmy. Who comes out on top? “Are they alone or does Jimmy have his posse?” asks O'Connell. He's taking this seriously.


	“One on one?” No hesitation. “One winner. Remmick.”


	Make of that what you will.

BTS‘ fifth full-length album will arrive on March 20. That much ARMY already knew.


	The collection will be titled Arirang. “Arirang” is a traditional Korean folk song renowned around the world, according to a statement from BigHit Music, which delivered an update on the album Friday, Jan. 16. “Transcending time and generations, the song has long been associated with emotions of connection, distance, and reunion,” the press release notes.


	The collection is said to be 14-tracks deep and “a deeply reflective body of work” that explores the K-pop superstars' “identity and roots,” the statement reads.

	The album's red and white artwork can be seen on BigHit's Instagram.


	Furthermore, the band will “draw on the emotional depth of ‘Arirang,' its sense of yearning, longing, and the ebb and flow of life,” added the release, noting the seven-piece group ultimately choosing the title for its “strong resonance with their current journey.”


	The new album marks the group's reunion following a nearly four-year hiatus, during which members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook completed South Korea's mandatory military service.


	BTS' big title reveal closely follows the announcement of another world tour, the band's first large-scale jaunt in nearly four years, since BTS Permission to Dance on Stage, which concluded in April 2022.


	The forthcoming trek will get underway April 9 in Goyang, South Korea, then makes a stop in Tokyo before arriving in the United States in late April. The first stateside concerts will take place April 25-26 in Tampa, Fla., and closes its North American run with four shows in Los Angeles in September. All told, 79 shows are booked across the globe including Asia, North and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and more. 

	











	“The new release explores universal emotions of longing and love,” the statement continues, “and will resonate with the worldwide audience as a timeless legacy across generations and cultures.”

ENHYPEN promised THE SIN : VANISH, and ENHYPEN delivered.


	The K-pop outfit's seventh mini-album arrives at the stroke of midnight, one full month after its announcement, as the followup to June 2025's sixth mini album DESIRE : UNLEASH.


	According to a statement, the new release marks the group's “most immersive and narratively driven chapter to date,” a concept album that specifically takes a big bite into vampire mythology.

	“The album follows an unprecedented escape of vampire lovers, tracing the fragile balance between desire and consequence in a world bound by unbreakable rules,” reads the release.

	This is no ordinary collection of works from JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO and NI-KI.

	











	From start to finish, the 11-track collection blends music, narration, and cinematic storytelling, with songs meshed with narration and skits.


	It's presented in the style of a reporter discussing a vampire escape case, and presented in four languages: Korean (voiced by actor Park Jeong Min), English, Japanese (voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda), and Chinese (voiced by singer Lars Huang).




	The experimental album gathers lead single “Knife,” which traces the beginning of the lovers' escape as they face pursuit without hesitation; charges through “No Way Back (featuring So!YoON!)” (Alternative R&B), “Stealer” (Alternative Dance Pop), “Big Girls Don't Cry” (Pop), and “Lost Island” (Pop) and closes with the introspective “Sleep Tight” (R&B), JAKE's first self-written track, with additional lyric contributions from HEESEUNG.


	Earlier, the group teased on YouTube excerpts from four narration tracks –“The Beginning,” “The Fugitives,” “The Voice,” and “The Beyond.”


	The latest effort arrives after DESIRE : UNLEASH debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, just months after ENHYPEN made their historic Coachella Festival debut on the Sahara Stage. In addition to new music, the band will stay busy on the road this year with a stop at the inaugural edition of the Hello, Melbourne K-pop festival at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia on March 14 alongside TREASURE and Taemin.

The British superstar's 13th LP has arrived earlier than planned.


													By
												

	Sophie Williams



	It's been a quiet start to the year in British pop music, but that's about to change. In an unexpected move, Robbie Williams has surprise-released his new album, Britpop, three weeks earlier than originally planned.

	The road to the superstar's 13th studio album has already been full of twists and turns. First announced last May, the record was slated for release Oct. 10, though was then pushed back to Feb. 6 due to “scheduling issues.”

	At an intimate show at London's Dingwalls venue Oct. 9, Williams admitted that this was actually due to avoid the arrival of Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl (Oct. 3) and its subsequent chart domination. “We're all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it f–king is — you can't compete with that,” Williams said on stage. “I was worried about making [fans] all wait for the record. But then I was like, ‘F–k it.' I'm sorry, but I'm f–king being selfish. How many times in your life do you get to have the most No. 1 albums the U.K. has f–king ever had?”


	It was a shrewd decision: Swift's record remained atop the summit of the U.K.'s Official Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks upon release. If Britpop hits the top spot on the chart dated Jan. 23, Williams will secure his 16th U.K. No. 1 on the Official Albums Chart, breaking a tie with The Beatles in the all-time rankings.

	











	Now, the album has arrived overnight on streaming services with no prior warning from Williams. The 11-track collection is largely inspired by the genre it's named after, centered around huge, guitar-driven hooks. Its artwork, meanwhile, nods to one of Williams' most iconic looks: the red tracksuit worn to Glastonbury Festival in 1995 when he partied with Oasis at the height of the Britpop era. 


	“I've worked with some of my heroes on this album; it's raw, there are more guitars and it's an album that's even more upbeat and anthemic than usual,” Williams previously said in a statement. “There's some ‘Brit' in there and there's certainly some ‘pop' too – I'm immensely proud of this as a body of work.”


Britpop spans a multitude of lyrical themes, with musings on AI (“Human”) and fame (“All My Life”), plus “Morrissey,” a Pet Shop Boys-esque ode to The Smiths frontman, which Williams penned with his former Take That bandmate Gary Barlow. There's also “Rocket”, a collaboration with Black Sabbath legend Tony Iommi and the psychedelic “Spies,” which houses a chord progression similar to the Oasis classic “Champagne Supernova.”


	The album marks Williams' first set of non-festive original songs since 2016's The Heavy Entertainment Show. He will support the release with a run of underplay shows across the U.K. Feb. 4-9, where he will play both 1997 debut Life Thru a Lens and Britpop in their entirety, hitting up venues in Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Wolverhampton.

The 2,793-day wait is over.

	Michael Saponara



	The wait is over. It's been 2,793 days to be exact, between A$AP Rocky's Testing album in 2018 to Don't Be Dumb‘s arrival on Friday (Jan. 16).


	Rocky's fourth studio album finally hit streaming services to give rap its first blockbuster release of 2026. While there's no Rihanna appearance, it's still a star-studded affair with features from Tyler, The Creator, Doechii, Bossman Dlow, Brent Faiyaz, Gorillaz, Jon Batiste, Slay Squad, Thundercat, Westside Gunn and Will.i.am.


	The project boasts 15 tracks in total, including previously released singles “Punk Rocky,” which saw Winona Ryder star in the music video, and “Helicopter.” He allegedly displays six different alter egos across the project.

	According to a press release, the Harlem native has already sold more than 130,000 units ahead of the album landing on DSPs.


	Legendary filmmaker Tim Burton also played a role in the album's creation, with Rocky previously thanking him for his assistance. “SORRY 4 THE WAIT DON'T BE DUMB FINALLY HERE! THANKS TIM BURTON FOR HELPING ME MAKE THIS MOVIE,” Rocky wrote to IG in December when revealing the album's cover art, which Burton created.


Don't Be Dumb serves as Rocky's first album since 2018's Testing, which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. It's unclear if he has plans to tour the album across the globe, but Rocky is booked to headline Governors Ball 2026 on June 7 in NYC.


	Life is much different for Rocky these days compared to 2018, when his last album arrived. The New York rapper and partner Rihanna welcomed their third child together — daughter Rocki — in September.

	











	The hip-hop star performs cuts from the new collection for Amazon Music's “Songline” special, which was filmed in locations across New York City and premieres on Yams Day, Sunday Jan. 18 at 9 p.m. ET. The latest “Songline” episode will stream exclusively on Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Twitch.

The 34-track set features original music by artist and composer Peter Peter.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Heated Rivalry, the smash TV series and pop culture phenomenon, has brought its music to the masses with its original series soundtrack out Friday (Jan. 16).


	Released via Milan Records, the 34-track project features original music by artist and composer Peter Peter written for the Crave Original Series. The set marks Peter Peter's debut scoring effort and is available via all streaming services and as a digital download for purchase. CD and vinyl editions of the album are in the works and will be released later this year.

	











	The buzzed-about series premiered on the Canadian streamer on Nov. 28 and bowed on the same day in the United States on HBO Max. The romantic drama is adapted from Rachel Reid's hit Game Changers book series and stars Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams as hockey rivals Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander, who navigate a secret romance out of the public eye.


Heated Rivalry's creator, Jacob Tierney, personally selected Peter Peter to compose the show's music. Tierney earlier told Billboard: “From the first day I started writing the show, I knew music would be as integral to the series as the actors themselves, and Peter's work was what I had on repeat. His original score doesn't just sit underneath the story; it carries the emotion, the rhythm and the pulse of the show. I honestly can't imagine this series without it. Peter's music is completely woven into what the show is and how the story comes alive on the screen.”

	











	 “The music I composed for Heated Rivalry uncovered a side of me I wasn't certain I possessed, yet one I had always quietly wished was there,” Peter Peter shared with Billboard. “I'd never allowed myself such latitude in composition before. Jacob and Rachel deserved the very best of me, so I gave them every ray of light I had.”


	Previous to Heated Rivalry, Peter Peter had released five solo albums, most recently with 2024's Éther.

Taylor Sheridan's latest series, family drama The Madison starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell, will premiere March 14 on Paramount+, with the streamer also releasing first-look images. The first season of the series, which follows New York City's the Clyburns in the Madison River valley of central Montana, consists of six episodes.


	That is the smallest order to date for a Taylor Sheridan series whose seasons typically run for 10 episodes (Yellowstone, Landman, Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown) or 8 episodes (Lioness, 1923). But that comes with a nice bonus — a second season, I hear.

	











The Madison, a love story channeled through a family drama, is produced by Paramount Television Studios, David C. Glasser's 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As Deadline reported in August, Glasser revealed at the time that The Madison Season 2 was slated to begin filming in September at the new 450,000 sf production campus in Fort Worth, Texas that is backed by him, Sheridan, Paramount and Perot. The second installment has now been completed, I hear. It is envisioned as a second season, with a small possibility for it running as Part 2 of Season 1, sources said. 


	Described as Sheridan's most intimate work to date and a study of grief and human connection, The Madison unfolds across Montana and Manhattan as it examines family ties.


	In addition to Pfeiffer and Russell, the series stars Beau Garrett, Elle Chapman, Patrick J. Adams, Amiah Miller, Alaina Pollack, Ben Schnetzer, Kevin Zegers, Rebecca Spence, Danielle Vasinova and Matthew Fox.

	











The Madison is executive produced by Sheridan, Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Christina Voros, Michael Friedman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kurt Russell and Keith Cox.


	You can see first-look images above and below.

	A court case has today revealed that Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power star Peter Mullan was attacked by a man outside a concert venue as he tried to prevent a woman from getting assaulted.


	Dylan Bennet has been jailed for 18 months for the assault on Mullan and the unnamed woman, according to a report in BBC News from Glasgow Sheriff Court in Scotland.


	According to BBC News, Mullan tried to come to a woman's aid after he saw her crying outside of the O2 Academy venue in Glasgow in September last year. 


	He attempted to intervene before being headbutted by Bennet and obtaining a head wound, according to quotes from the court. Bennet was also reported to have brandished a glass bottle at both Mullan and the woman during the incident. Bennet's lawyer said he had been drinking alcohol and taking drugs throughout the night and that he deeply regrets the incident.

	











	Mullan's credits include Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, I Swear and Top of the Lake, the latter of which scored him an Emmy nomination.

	In a revealing and amusing keynote at Series Mania in 2024, he called Kevin Spacey an “a**hole” and criticized the “‘Ring' mob” of Lord of the Rings stans.

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: Eddie Vedder, lead singer of veteran rockers Pearl Jam, has been helping to fund a cure for Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) and Netflix has picked up his documentary on the subject.


Matter of Time follows Vedder as he hosts a fundraising concert in Seattle to draw attention to the childhood disease, which is a rare genetic skin condition, and aid in the discovery of a cure.


	The documentary will premiere on the streamer on February 9.


	Eddie Vedder and his wife Jill founded the EB Research Partnership (EBRP) in 2010, a nonprofit dedicated to funding research to treat and cure the life-threatening disease, one that afflicted the child of Jill's childhood friend.

	In October 2023, Vedder performed two sold out solo shows at Seattle's Benaroya Hall with all proceeds going towards funding critical research. The doc will weave together this performance with personal stories from researchers, doctors, funders, parents and young people living with EB




			Watch on Deadline		







Matter of Time is directed by Matt Finlin, who previously helmed The Movie Man, which Deadline's Pete Hammond called a “Canadian Cinema Paradiso” and it is produced by Door Knocker Media, which Finlin founded with Karen Barzilay, in association with EB Research Partnership and the Vitalogy Foundation.


	It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last year and has played festivals including the Nashville Film Festival, where it won Best Feature Music Documentary, and the San Diego International Film Festival, where it won Best Picture.

	











	“This film captures all angles of the EB Community experience,” said Eddie Vedder. “From families and researchers, to volunteers and donors all coming together for an event that includes a big dose of music for good measure. Please join in and meet these incredible people. Their stories will remain with you.”


	“This isn't a concert film in the traditional sense. It's a portrait of a community that isn't crying out to be saved; they're saving themselves,” said Finlin. “In a time when so many problems feel unsolvable, that kind of determination was deeply inspiring to capture as a filmmaker. What EB patients, families, researchers, and EB Research Partnership are doing isn't just making progress for their own disease — it's reshaping how we think about curing rare diseases worldwide.”


	Jill Vedder, co-founder and chairwoman of EBRP, said, “It has been a profound honor to work in service of the EB community for more than a decade. Matter of Time is a film that shows the power of a community all focused on the same dream.”


	Michael Hund, CEO of EB Research Partnership, added, “This film is more than a movie, it is a movement, showing the world how accelerating treatments and cures is possible when courageous patients and families, the brilliant medical and scientific community, inspired artists, and innovative business models come together. We are pioneering the path for how rare diseases like EB can be cured, scaling our model beyond EB, and inviting the world to join us.”

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


	The BBC is set to produce content for YouTube under a landmark deal with the Google-owned platform, which is increasingly challenging the dominance of traditional television networks.


	The BBC is preparing to make original shows for YouTube, which could then later switch to iPlayer or BBC Sounds. The hope is that this will ensure the BBC meets young audiences where they consume content, helping the corporation maintain its relevance for a future generation of licence fee payers.


	The YouTube deal was first reported by the Financial Times, but was confirmed to Deadline by a person briefed on the plans, which could be announced as early as next week. The BBC declined to comment.

	The British broadcaster does not currently produce bespoke series for YouTube, but has maintained a presence on the platform for more than 20 years. The BBC's main account, which has 15.3M subscribers and 11.9B views, mainly hosts trailers and clips from shows such as The Traitors.


			Watch on Deadline		







	BBC News has existed on YouTube since 2006 and can often post longer videos. The channel has 19M subscribers and 6.6B views.


	It is not clear how the BBC will manage any commercial arrangement with YouTube for original series, or how the content will be funded. The BBC does not carry advertising in the UK, but the Financial Times reported that it could monetize YouTube originals overseas, bolstering licence fee income in the process.


	Channel 4 has experimented with originals on YouTube, including greenlighting films for its Channel 4 Documentaries channel. The network also commissioned digital drama Beth last year.


	There are skeptics internally at the BBC. Some believe that the corporation will not be able to profit from any investment on YouTube. “Ultimately, they've done this because the youth audience is there — not because it will make any money,” said one person familiar with the BBC's thinking.


	The potential deal comes after Deadline revealed earlier this week that YouTube had overtaken the BBC on a key measurement of audience reach. In an unprecedented moment, YouTube reached 51.9M viewers in December, more than a million ahead of the BBC's equivalent figure of 50.8M, according to UK ratings body Barb.

	











	It is a nuanced picture, however, and Barb's figures offer just one measure of reach. On others, the BBC remains comfortably ahead of YouTube, but for the broadcaster to be supplanted on even a single metric is notable, given its decades-long dominance in Britain.


	The BBC's potential partnership with YouTube also comes at a time when UK lawmakers are exploring an intervention to address the Google-owned platform's startling growth.


	In a keynote speech at the Royal Television Society's Cambridge Convention last September, culture secretary Lisa Nandy said the government is prepared to change legislation to ensure that YouTube carries public service content prominently. YouTube said this would be “premature” at a time when it is talking to public service broadcasters about partnerships.

Prince William and Kate Middleton's decision to hire a crisis management expert was reportedly done to get ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's potential return to the UK.

The Prince and Princess of Wales recently hired Liza Ravenscroft, who has a background in crisis management, the Mail on Sunday reported last week.

Although the royal couple hardly has bad press, Ravenscroft's hiring has to do with Harry and Markle, a Daily Mail report published Thursday claims.

“William and Catherine know that there may be trouble ahead, and it's likely to come from a familiar source – Prince Harry and Meghan,” the outlet reported.

“The Establishment ‘plot' to bring the Duke and Duchess of Sussex back to Britain is gathering pace, with a decision expected within the next couple of weeks on the reinstatement of the couple's automatic armed police protection – paid for by British taxpayers – when they make return visits to this country,” the report continued.

The outlet claimed recent stories of Markle potentially returning to the UK this summer and Harry reportedly inviting his father, King Charles, to the 2026 Invictus Games, was a way to put pressure on the royal family to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Sussex back.

“The plot is known as ‘Project Thaw' because the aim is to ‘warm up' the duke's and duchess's frosty relationships with the rest of the Royal Family and with the British people,” the outlet claimed.

“Harry and Meghan returning to set up their ‘rival' royal court at the same time as trying to make a fortune for themselves has the makings of a future crisis for the monarchy,” the outlet continued.

Harry could soon reunite with the royal family after he scored a victory in his long-running battle for security when visiting the UK.

Ravec, the Royal and VIP Executive Committee, launched a new risk assessment at Harry's request and determined that he met the threshold for official protection.

Meanwhile, royal author Christopher Andersen recently told Us Weekly that Harry is “somewhat uneasy” with living under the spotlight, while his wife “embraces that life more.”

“He has suffered from crippling social anxiety,” Andersen alleged.

“Does it pain Harry to be pointedly excluded from times when the royal family gets together, like Christmas at Sandringham? Of course it does,” he also quipped.

William and Harry notably did not reunite when Harry returned to Britain in September 2025 as their relationship continues to be strained.

François Arnaud has unfollowed the “Heated Rivalry” cast and others involved in the hit drama — including co-stars Hudson Williams, Robbie G.K. and Connor Storrie.

The actor, 40, also unfollowed series creator Jacob Tierney in the social media purge, which saw him trim his “following” list from over 1,000 to 213 in the past week, per Just Jared.

Arnaud is said to be weathering online threats after being seen jetting out from JFK airport with Storrie, 25, following their press week in the Big Apple, sparking dating rumors — and some fans think Storrie would be better paired with Williams, 24.

Fans flocked to X to comment on the escalating social media drama.

“François Arnaud has unfollowed everyone involved with Heated Rivalry on Instagram including the whole cast and creator Jacob Tierney Nasty comments and online harassment seem to have caused François to limit his online presence,” one person remarked, while another chimed in, “They need to leave this gentle king alone.” 

“The comments and harassment is horrible and unjustified, but I don't get unfollowing his cast members?” questioned a third. 

Others were concerned the apparent drama could affect Arnaud's participation in Season 2 of the hit series. 

“If because of toxic fans we don't get François Arnaud in season 2 of HEATED Rivalry I'm gonna lose my f–king mind believe me,” an X user wrote.

“THE QUEER MAN ON THIS SHOW IS GETTING DEATH THREATS. & you think he's just being ‘messy' and ‘asking for attention' this fandom is full of people who belong in padded rooms.”

Storrie and Hudson star in the steamy show as rival hockey players — and secret lovers — Shane Hollander and lya Rozanov, while Arnaud plays Scott Hunter.

Reps for Storrie and Arnaud did not immediately return Page Six's requests for comment.

Arnaud admitted he's been overwhelmed by his social media following amid the success of “Heated Rivalry,” even suggesting he should shut down the whole account.

“Oh, Helen Hunt… who not only followed me and other guys from the show, also commented on an old post of me, an old post,” he said during an appearance on the Sirius XM podcast “The Morning Mashup.”

“And she said, ‘You're so good in this and everything else,'” the actor claimed.

“I was like, ‘Is she going through my whole filmography?' Yeah, I had to, I'm like, ‘Oh delete Instagram now. I don't need to see anything else.' Shut the whole thing down.”

“This is how it should end,” he added. “This is my happy ending.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","I tested this long-wearing foundation for 14 hours — and it's a total game changer","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/16/style/hourglass-illusion-luminous-glow-foundation-is-a-game-changer/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:38:00 GMT","

Celebrity makeup artist Emily Cheng recently glammed up Gracie Abrams using Hourglass Illusion Luminous Glow Foundation, but you needn't be a star to get the same glow.

As a longtime Hourglass fan, testing out its new extended foundation shades was a must for me. (Since the colder seasons have my skin tone leaning on the cooler/neutral side of the color wheel, I found my best match to be shade 15: Medium Cool Rosy.)

It's not every day you find a foundation that caters to undertones ranging from cool (winter) to warm peach (summer), and I'm hooked for life on this game changer of a formula.

Advertisement

Read on for my full review of the star-worthy base — and the accompanying brush.

Pros:

Cons:

I wore a full Hourglass foundation beat to the office, and have have never received so many compliments at work. Colleagues I barely speak to — and even regular nearby coworkers — remarked that I looked absolutely radiant. All that positive feedback completely changed how I think about my daily makeup routine.

After starting the day at 6:30 a.m. and leaving the office around 8:30 p.m., my makeup still looked and felt intact (apart from my lipstick) — perfect for my after-work social plans.

 

Pros:

Cons:

To properly test Hourglass' foundation brush, I applied the product on two separate days (in the office bathroom, under the same lighting) — one day using the brush, and the other using my hands. The difference in coverage was immediate and noticeable, highlighting just how much application method can impact the performance of a foundation.

Throughout my month of testing, I found the formula applied more evenly with the Hourglass-branded tool, and even cut my application time in half.

Designed to mimic the delicate and precise control of the fingertips, the cruelty-free brush features a unique vegan fiber technology and custom bristles for effortless blending and intuitive, even application.

Overall, I preferred using the brush, since it yielded the best results and lasted longer (and kept my makeup looking fresher) throughout the day.

On the cusp of 34, I've learned that fine lines don't want to be covered — they want to be negotiated with. After a 14-hour wear test, the Hourglass foundation was still delivering luscious hydration and coverage that smoothed out texture without settling into my lines. The tone match was so perfect, I did triple takes in the mirror.

Buildable coverage is a standout feature, but application method also makes a huge difference. The formula is extremely smooth and glides on like a gloss — and since it's so hydrating, you don't need to moisturize beforehand. Given Hourglass' commitment to clean makeup, it came as no surprise that the foundation covered my rosacea with zero irritation.

Valentine's Day is here early for Emily Ratajkowski.

The 34-year-old model shared a scantily clad video on Instagram Friday morning, wearing nothing but a sheer red lingerie set.

The three-piece look was from Lounge's Laced with Love Valentine's Collection, which is rife with red and black embroidered pieces sure to send temperatures soaring.

In the steamy Instagram video, she kneels on the floor of her apartment in front of a duo of full-length mirrors. Ratajkowski plays with her hair and adjusts the band of her G-string while in the impressive pose.

Fans, of course, went wild in the comment section. “Lord have mercy 🔥🥵🔥 i can't put it into words. My God Emily,” one person said. Another wrote, “Absolutely out of this world 🔥🔥🔥.”

The “Gone Girl” actress previously starred in a campaign for the same brand this past fall, modeling a hot pink and floral garter set as well as a brown bra and panty combo.

And the model is well-known for slipping into her undies; Last year, she was the face of Italian brand Intimissimi's Valentine's Day campaign, getting vampy in a bright red set.

One thing's for sure, the Victoria's Secret model looks good in the fiery shade.

It's been a long, hard road for Bam Margera, the skater-turned-stuntman from MTV's Jackass. Aside from the injuries that build up from working on the pain-forward series, Margera also survived serious drug addiction, the death of his best friend and fellow Jackass star Ryan Dunn, and the prolonged legal battle with Jackass co-creators Jeff Tremaine and Johnny Knoxville. Though there have been attempts at reconciliation, things only seemed to get worse between Margera and Tremaine and Knoxville, who attempted to include Margera in 2022's Jackass Forever. However, Margera's participation was contingent on his sobriety, and when he admitted to breaking that part of the contract, he was fired. Things got uglier from there, with Tremaine filing a restraining order against Margera, who began harassing Tremaine and Johnny Knoxville online. Considering all that went down, it's a bit surprising that Knoxville and Tremaine would want to include Margera, via archival footage, in the upcoming Jackass movie. What's unsurprising, given the last decade of his relationship with the franchise, is that Bam Margera wants “nothing to do with” Jackass these days.

Accosted by TMZ on the street, Margera does not seem, in any way, at peace with his former castmates. “If you had a laundry list of the chain of horrible events of the two years of COVID that they put me through, spending my own money at an alarming rate for therapists, doctors, and treatment, and all this, only to sit me down and tell me, ‘You're not in the movie, and you're not getting $5 million,'” Margera said. “I watch Dateline, and people kill other people for a whole lot less.”

“People kill other people for less” is not a phrase you want to hear from a co-worker. Still, Margera says that he has “a lot of PTSD” from the experience and that wearing the badge of ‌”ex-Jackass star” is hard enough to live with. “The humiliation, the abandonment, and just embarrassment of it all, I had to let it go[…]I'm just too hurt by it, and I already accepted the fact that I don't want anything to do with it anymore. I was very angry, and now I'm not angry, I'm just hurt. And as of now, I don't even want to think about reuniting with anybody.”

As for the archival footage, Margera says the Jackass crew asked him about including some old clips, and he gave them a “hell yeah.” “I remember filming so much funny shit that never made it to the movie, simply because it would be too long or it was just too gnarly,” he continued. “I said have at it, so as far as I know, I don't have to film anything new and don't want to.”

Margera says that he's just happy to be skating again. His wife is a “stretch coach” who helped him get his “legs back to being 20.” The Jackass life is indeed a painful one. Hopefully, one day, all the boys can get together and shove fireworks up their asses again.

Look: We're going to try like hell to write this story without putting any Star Wars jokes in it. No “bad feelings,” no “disturbances in the Force,” no “so-and-so becomes more powerful than you can possibly imagine.” We're grown-ups, a huge shake-up just happened in the world of one of the planet's biggest entertainment brands, and we can do this in a calm, measured, professional way.

Anyway: A huge “Who da man? Yo da man!” to long-time Star Wars writer and producer Dave Filoni, who has just been named Chief Creative Officer and Co-President of Lucasfilm, filling the latter job alongside long-time Lucasfilm Business head Lynwen Brennan. The pair will co-fill the chair now vacated by decade-plus Star Wars head honcho Kathleen Kennedy, who took the job at Lucasfilm shortly before George Lucas sold the company to Disney back in 2012, serving as Lucas' hand-picked steward and chief decision maker for the brand throughout the conglomerate's ownership of the franchise.

Kennedy's departure from the role isn't exactly a big surprise: She's been talking about stepping back from the high-pressure, high-getting-yelled-at-by-randos job for at least a few years at this point. (An exit interview she gave to Deadline today suggests she stayed on longer than intended in part to help Filoni bulk out his resumé; he came to the franchise as a writer and animator, but has spent the last few years getting experience as a live-action director on shows like Ahsoka in order to round out his “running a movie studio” skillset.) The news, not coincidentally, was timed to the reveal that filming has wrapped on Shawn Levy and Ryan Gosling's Star Wars: Starfighter, the second Star Wars movie to wrap since the franchise took its little seven-year theater nap after the release of The Rise Of Skywalker in 2019. (The other, the Filoni-penned The Mandalorian And Grogu, arrives in theaters this May.)

The division of labor in the new Lucasfilm isn't difficult to parse: Brennan's a stalwart of the company's business side, having spent 26 years rising up through the ranks at Industrial Light & Magic, and will presumably handle the technical and money portions of the equation, as she has done for years. Filoni, meanwhile, has carved out a name for himself mostly through his work in TV, first in the Clone Wars animated series, and then by essentially asserting himself as the only person who seemed to have an actual narrative plan for this universe in the aftermath of the sequel trilogy's various highs and lows. (One of the chief architects of The Mandalorian, he's noted for being an inveterate lore guy, and has never been shy about jabbing Star Wars fans' nostalgia buttons as needed to give his various productions a boost.) Given that you were never going to find any human being alive who all Star Wars fans were going to instantly rally behind, it's not hard to see why he was the easy pick for CCO: Give or take a Book Of Boba Fett here or there, he's made it clear that he knows how to generate steady, crowd-pleasing adventure stories that trot out all the right signs and signifiers without rocking the spaceship. He's never been the guy to make something bold and groundbreaking like, say, Tony Gilroy's Andor. But, as Kennedy's exit interview notes, there are a lot of directors (James Mangold, Taika Waititi, Donald Glover, Steven Soderbergh, and more) who show up wanting to do something bold and groundbreaking with Star Wars, and sometimes you probably need a guy who just knows what color the lightsabers are supposed to be, and who just wants to see the Hero's Journey play out in a slightly different form. Again.

As for Kennedy, she's reportedly excited to focus on her passions in life: Making movies with her husband, veteran filmmaker Frank Marshall; producing more Star Wars movies (in a non-running-the-company role); and, obviously, getting seriously into making films with AI. (“In responsible ways,” of course, which nobody, no matter how hard they're tempted to make the obvious joke, could suggest they have a bad feeling about.)

Although the world has mostly moved on from 2022's FX miniseries Pam & Tommy—in which Lily James and Sebastian Stan played Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, reckoning with the release and widespread dissemination of their infamous sex tape—Pamela Anderson certainly has not. Anderson (who's been working steadily since giving a revelatory and heartbreaking turn in 2024's The Last Showgirl) was vocal at the time of the show's release about being unhappy to have her life turned into true-crime-as-cultural-examination fodder, and she hasn't gotten any happier since. That includes telling Andy Cohen (per TMZ) this week that she felt “yucky” to be seated near star and executive producer Seth Rogen at the recent Golden Globes, and made it clear that she believes Rogen owes her an apology.

“I just felt like ugh,” Anderson said of the series. “How can someone make a TV series out of difficult times in your life? And I am a living, breathing human being over here.” Anderson added that, after being seated near Rogen at the Globes last week, she felt an urge to confront him about the series, which was created by Robert Siegel, but developed under Rogen and Evan Goldberg's production banner. “Sometimes it hits you and you feel kind of down. It felt a little yucky. Eventually, hopefully, he will reach out to me to apologize, not that it matters. When you are a public person, they say you have no right to privacy. But your darkest, deepest secrets or tragedies should not be fair game for a TV series. That pissed me off a little bit.”

Pam & Tommy was a modest critical success at the time of its release, earning 10 Emmy nominations. (It won one, for makeup.) But while the series is ostensibly on Anderson's side—with much focus put on how exploited she was by basically every other person active in the sex tape scandal—it also couldn't escape the fact that it was itself telling a lurid story about her for its own benefit, and without her permission. (The series got around rights issues by licensing a Rolling Stone article about the incident.) This isn't the first or even the second time Anderson has spoken about the topic—it comes up in her 2023 Netflix documentary Pamela, A Love Story, where she called the show's producers “assholes”—but it's also clear that it's a wound that isn't in any danger of healing any time soon.

Hallmark star Melissa Gilbert is receiving love from a friend and fellow former child star as she faces one of the most difficult times in her life.

On January 16, the “Little House on the Prairie” and “When Calls the Heart” star received a supportive message from “One Day at a Time” actor Glenn Scarpelli on social media, as he sent “love” without commentary on her personal life.

The loving message was shared days after Gilbert's husband, actor and producer Timothy Busfield, turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police Department following a warrant for his arrest. Busfield is facing charges of sexual abuse involving a minor when he was a director for the Fox TV series “The Cleaning Lady,” according to court documents obtained by local news station KOAT.  The actor has denied the allegations against him and vowed to fight to clear his name, he said in a video message posted by TMZ.

Scarpelli, 59, is best known for his role as Alex Handris on the CBS sitcom “One Day at a Time,” from 1980 to 1983. The series aired at the same time as Gilbert's final seasons playing Laura Ingalls Wilder on NBC's “Little House on the Prairie.”

In the aftermath of Gilbert's personal crisis, Scarpelli posted a throwback photo of the two posing with fellow ‘80s child star Lisa Whelchel (“The Facts of Life”). He captioned the post with a simple show of support for Gilbert.

“Loving my Ol' Friend Melissa Gilbert right now. No commentary, just love… That is all,” Scarpelli wrote. 

He added the hashtags #love #support #friendship #melissagilbert.

Fans reacted in the comments section to note that Scarpelli has a kind heart.

“Melissa has always been one of my favorite child actresses and I that you and she are still close friends, Glenn,” one fan wrote.

“Well said, such a tough time for her❤️,” another fan agreed.

Gilbert, 61, has not directly spoken about the allegations against her husband of 12 years. She deactivated her Instagram account, and her rep, Ame Van Iden, told People magazine that Gilbert is “not making public statements at this time” as she honors the request of her husband's lawyers.

“During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment,” Van Iden added. “Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.”

Gilbert's longtime “Little House on the Prairie” co-stars have also not publicly addressed the legal situation involving Busfield.

On the Jan. 15 episode of “The Little House on the Prairie 50th Anniversary“ podcast, host Pamela Bob appeared to reference the topic as co-hosts and “LHOP” alum Alison Arngrim and Dean Butler looked on. Bob noted that it had been a “tough week,” and said she was happy to have old episodes of “Little House” as a “safe space.

It is unclear when the podcast episode was taped.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SEE INSIDE: Bob Dylan's Former Harlem Townhouse Is on the Market for $2.75 Million","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/bob-dylan-harlem-townhouse-for-sale/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:57:21 GMT","

It's well-known that Bob Dylan spent plenty of time in Greenwich Village during his early years in New York. However, he also called Harlem home for a significant amount of time. Now, the townhouse that the iconic musician lived in is up for sale.

Currently on the market for $2.75 million, that's a quarter of a million dollars less than it was six months ago when it hit the market for $3 million, according to the New York Post.

Dylan first bought the Harlem townhouse in 1986 and lived there for 14 years until he sold it in 2000. At that time, the new owners purchased the home for $560,000.

In 2018, the property was snapped up by lawyer Isam Salah and Elaina Richardson, “the former editor-in-chief of Elle magazine, who just stepped down after running Yaddo, the famed Sarasota Springs artists' colony, which she headed for the past 25 years,” according to the Post. The couple paid $3.17 million for the property.

Dylan's former townhouse is located at 265 W. 139th St., and “was designed by legendary Gilded Age architect Stanford White,” the Post notes. Built in 1893, “[t]he 4,500-square-foot home is part of Strivers' Row, in the St. Nicholas Historic District,” and is “part of a row of houses designed in 1891 to 1893 by White's firm, McKim, Mead & White.” Despite it's age, the home “is remarkably preserved and modern.”

The townhouse that is 19-foot-wide “opens to a striking wood-paneled vestibule that leads to a 19-foot salon.” Beyond that, the home features a “large, eat-in chef's kitchen, which includes a full-height wine fridge” and “spills onto a terrace.”

Offering residents four to five bedrooms, the primary suite is found on the third floor of the home and boasts a radiant floor and a marble bath. The remaining bedrooms are located on the fourth floor.

“Other perks include plenty of outdoor space, including a gated carport and a rear alleyway, which offers unusual privacy in the city,” as well as additional enviable details, such as the “original moldings, pocket doors, crown molding, wainscoting, inlaid hardwood floors and high ceilings.” Beyond that there are “six original decorative fireplaces, built-in bookcases, an original range stove and a 4-foot-tall safe — now used as a bar — plus a rooftop skylight.”

The potential new owners will also surely appreciate the cellar with laundry, workshop bench and a good amount of storage.

“The Masked Singer” season 14 features 18 new contestants performing, and tonight we get to see five more of those new masks take the stage during week 2 of “The Masked Singer” 2026. One of those contestants is Owl.

After all five of the contestants perform, we are given their first clues of the season, and the panel makes their first guesses, we will see another contestant unmasked. Here's what we know about Owl so far, and who might be singing behind the mask:

BEWARE OF “THE MASKED SINGER” SEASON 14 WEEK 2 SPOILERS BELOW

The Owl comes out dancing with some moves. Then, for the clues, the Owl is out in nature. We see a bonfire. He said you couldn't go anywhere without hearing his name. People even started following his look, as you see a telescope on a kite. We see movie popcorn, and he said his biggest fear was people laughing at him and not with him. He said he focused on him and his family. We then see a reindeer, so maybe a Christmas movie. Instead of them poking fun at you behind your back, he said, give them the bird and do your thing.

For his performance, he performs “Wild Thing” by The Troggs. This is a weird one, again. The voice is very deep, but no actual singing seems to be happening. It's very slow-paced. While the performance is fun with the dancers, the singing is just kind of meh.

Johnny Knoxville is back with another clue box, and it's time for Ken to help. Inside the box, we see the clue and poisonous centipedes. For the clue, we see a picture of a goat.

Ken said he was known for the rom-coms and the good-looking guy. He thinks the spyglass was for “True Detective,” so he thinks it's Matthew McConaughey. Jenny said the reindeer could be linked to a Christmas movie, so she is thinking “Bad Santa.” For the goat, she ties it to Billy. Because of that, she thinks it's Billy Bob Thornton.

Both great guesses, but who are you thinking it could be? This one was a hard one, but I like Jenny's thought process on this one.

New episodes of “The Masked Singer” season 14 air on Wednesday nights at 8/7c on FOX. They are available to stream the next day on Hulu.

After HGTV star Leslie Davis dropped the bombshell on January 14, 2026, that she was engaged to a man she met while filming “Rock the Block,” fans have been eager for more details. 

Davis and her twin sister, Lyndsay Lamb, won season five of HGTV's popular competition series, but it turns out Davis also won the heart of carpenter Don Reidy — a shock to “Unsellable Houses” fans who thought she was still married to her first husband, Jacob, with whom she shares three sons — Kyler, Cash, and Cole. 

Reidy had worked on multiple HGTV shows before being called to Treasure Island, Florida in late 2023. That's where four teams of HGTV duos were competing on the fifth season of “Rock the Block,” tasked with completely renovating identical, luxury waterfront condos in six short weeks. 

Lamb and Davis, who starred for five seasons on “Unsellable Houses,” were up against Bryan and Sarah Baeumler from “Battle on the Beach,” Keith Bynum and Evan Thomas of “Bargain Block,” and Page Turner and Mitch Glew from “Fix My Flip.” (Notably, after some serious drama at the end of the competition, all of those shows have gone by the wayside) 

On January 15, Davis told People that Reidy was assigned to her and Lamb as their “specialty carpenter,” explaining, “He worked on mine and Lyndsay's home exclusively for the entire project, helping us make all of our custom woodwork items.” 

As he constructed a wood ceiling, pergola, and custom shelves in their beach home's loft, Davis told the outlet that they also “built a great friendship.” 

But the entrepreneur, who co-owns a real estate and renovation company in Washington state with her sister — Lamb & Co. — told People that falling in love was “completely unexpected,” insisting she had “zero clue it would happen.” 

Though Davis and Reidy remained friends on the set of “Rock the Block,” she told People, “Somehow as the months passed after the show ended, we became closer and closer, talking non-stop on the phone and then fell in love.” 

As EntertainmentNow previously reported, Reidy lived in Colorado at the time. Davis confirmed to People that he moved to Snohomish, Washington, “about a year later.” 

Reidy's Facebook profile shows that he left Colorado in August 2024, telling friends, “God has given me so many big opportunities and I am jumping in … Life here has been amazing but I am ready for my next adventure.” 

Reidy, who has worked behind the scenes on HGTV shows including “100 Day Hotel Challenge,” is now listed as the Renovation Project Lead for Lamb & Co. He proposed to Davis over holiday break with all three of her sons there to help pull of the surprise, she shared on Instagram. Her rep told People a wedding date has not been set. 

It couldn't happen to a sweeter gal. I met Leslie and Lyndsay at the Home and Patio Show in Jacksonville, FL when I waived at the two of them while they were filming a commercial for the show. They came right over to me and we had a nice chat. I'm sorry I never gave them my name.

A shouty and self-serious action thriller about a team of ambiguously corrupt Miami cops who threaten to turn on each other after they discover a fortune of very stealable cartel money hidden in an unassuming safe house, Joe Carnahan's “The Rip” would be easy to dismiss as run-of-the-mill streaming fare if not for the casting wrinkle that juices up its drama at every juncture. 

To put it simply: Ben Affleck plays one cop. Matt Damon plays another. They love each other, albeit only in a pathologically straight let's bark hyper-steroidal sub-“Heat” jargon at each other while swallowing our feelings sort of way. But over the course of a dark and deadly night in the suburbs of Hialeah, the relationship between these ride-or-die bros will fray apart as those giant buckets full of benjamins — the titular “rip” — start to cloud the latter's judgment. Tense as the situation is on its own, the whole thing is kicked up a notch by the sick meta spectacle of watching Hollywood's bestest friends begin to sour into mortal enemies. It just hits different when Ben and Matt are trying to bring each other down, and “The Rip” takes full advantage of the palpable history between them from its first proper scene all the way through the last and most ridiculous of its (way too many) different endings.

The suspicions kick off with a murder-mystery that will hover over the rest of Carnahan's script, as the captain of a Tactical Narcotics Team is gunned down by two masked shooters for reasons unknown. Her team doesn't take it well. Quoth Detective Numa Baptiste (Teyana Taylor in a small, functional role that she unsurprisingly imbues with life): “She was my friend. And my bitch.” 

 










She was also Detective Sergeant JD Byrne's fuck buddy, so he's extra steamed about the murder as well, and hellbent on figuring out whether his captain was killed by one of their own (Affleck is great at playing aggro with a conscience, and, as we learn in the most gratuitous one-shot male shirtless scene this side of “Ant-Man,” also shredded to the bone). It's the only thing JD cares still about, and we believe him when he says that Damon's increasingly disaffected Lieutenant Dane Dumars deserved the recent promotion that both men were vying for. Dane has a dead son, he needs something to live for, and JD is the kind of guy who cares about balancing the scales of justice to whatever degree he can. 

“The Rip” doesn't offer any particularly sharp insights about the moral dilemmas faced by Miami's finest (Carnahan's lean and hardy screenplay is less interested in big picture ideas than in getting a weary Damon to say things like “That guy just got his dick knocked in by the grind”), but the movie's plot hinges on the notion that police don't get paid enough, and that weeding out the “bad ones” — with bullets to the head — would make a material difference to the world at large. 

So when Dane's team discovers that the six-figure Hialeah rip is actually worth closer to $20 million, the situation turns into something of a purity test, as each member of the TNT has to suss out how far across the line their partners are willing to go (Steven Yeun and Catalina Sandino Moreno capably round out the overqualified team, the latter armed with a money-sniffing dog named Wilbur). Is it possible for an American cop in 2026 to resist the temptation to abuse their power? That's a good question. Is it dramatically plausible? That might be an even better one.

 










The intergroup suspicions are plenty tense enough, but Carnahan packs this powder keg even tighter by placing Dane's team under a ticking clock; after some other interested parties catch wind of the fortune, it's only a matter of time before our characters find themselves under siege. Imagine a crazy aggro cross between the claustrophobic back-stabbing of a classic French heist movie and the walls are caving in implosiveness of “Assault on Precinct 13” and you'll have a decent idea of how “The Rip” unfolds, which it does in sufficiently entertaining fashion. 

Juan Miguel Azpiroz's gritty cinematography manages to sidestep most of the Netflix gloss, Sasha Calle adds a curious wrinkle to the story as the current — and ambiguously culpable — resident of the Hialeah house, and the eventual fireworks are concussive enough to blow a hole right through your tablet or TV. It's also worth nothing that the movie was produced by Affleck and Damon's Artists Equity, and promises all 1,200 members of the cast and crew a one-time bonus if it manages to surpass certain viewership benchmarks; not only does that share the wealth mentality dovetail with the story at hand, but, for viewers aware of the arrangement, it also helps to chip away at the inherent disposability of straight-to-streaming content. 

 










Is “The Rip” a better film because its third AD might actually be able to afford their rent next month? Not necessarily, but knowing that its performance matters to more than Netflix's shareholders does restore an ounce of material weight to a project that might otherwise have felt like vaporware.

But the most important reason why “The Rip” is a slight cut above the average streaming fare is the lived-in history that Affleck and Damon bring to their characters' dynamic. I can only speak as someone who's associated these actors with each other for more than 30 years, but it's raw to see JD and Dane start to second-guess each other — it engenders a state of disbelief that echoes the uncertainty felt by the rest of their team. This movie gets way too high on its own supply by the end, but for the better part of its runtime even the film's silliest expressions of pathos (i.e. Dane's “The Night of the Hunter”-esque hand tattoos, which I would hate to ruin for you here) are grounded by the emotional credibility of the relationship between its two leading men. “Fuck, it'd be so much easier if we just stole this money,” Dane half-jokes at one point early on. Easier to steal from a stranger's house maybe, but there's nothing easy about taking something that valuable away from your friends.

 










“The Rip” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, January 16.

Justin Long has quietly become one of indie horror's most reliable trust indicators. From “Tusk” to “Barbarian,” he's a familiar face whose presence on screen typically signals genre storytellers with something truly worthwhile to say. But in Ryan Prows' “Night Patrol,” arriving in theaters from RLJE Films and Shudder, the actor barely registers.

That's an ironic testament to Prows' clear creative vision and strong narrative control. It's also proof the director was mostly successful in steering his film‘s sprawling ensemble cast through a hazy, imperfect vampire saga — about corrupt, blood-sucking police targeting vulnerable citizens in Southern California.

Grounded in a gritty and ethereal Los Angeles that, true to life, puts “vibes” first, “Night Patrol” is a gangland dramedy that casually bounces between caustic one-liners and gun shots. Co-written by Prows, Shaye Ogbonna, Tim Cairo, and Jake Gibson, the film packs a shaggy script about power and brutality that combines beats of a satirical creature feature with the drama of a street war erupting between Bloods and Crips. When LAPD officer Ethan Hawkins (Long) gets promoted to the elite “night squad,” he and his ex-partner, Xavier Carr (Jermaine Fowler), find something even more hellish within the task force. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Wazi (RJ Cyler) and Ayanda (Nicki Micheaux), Xavier's brother and mom, encounter that demonic force in their circles, too. They've got their own magic to bring to the battle at hand, and Prows doesn't hesitate to unleash the bright, neon green glow of a supernatural artifact into the cross-fire police action of the modern thriller's first act. More mystically minded than you might guess, gang members Bornelius (rapper Freddie Gibbs), Three Deuce (filmmaker Flying Lotus), and Tripp (hip-hop artist YG) buy into the fantasy and meet the genre shift with expletive-laced humor that doesn't relieve tension but increases it. 

Meanwhile, the (extra?) evil police are presented as broadly horrific and outwardly racist. Fitting! The casting matches the meathead characters visually, but the disproportionate number of objectively bad thespians on Team Thin Blue Line results in an acting performance disparity that's sometimes brutal to watch as the fighting progresses. Pro-wrestler CM Punk appears as a deputy who can't figure out even one of his scenes — while co-stars Fowler and Long get the smartest jokes of the movie. (You need the context, but keep your ears perked for the truly hilarious, “I remember MY first sandwich!“) 

There's enough blood-and-guts fun to be had thanks to the vampire setup, but Prows and his cast shine brightest when they're toying with savage melodrama. Dermot Mulroney appears in a surprise role that doubles as a predictable but enjoyable soap opera reveal, and the opening scene deftly introduces Cyler's Wazi as a lovable underdog. He witnesses the state murder his situationship, mere minutes before learning not only that magic is real but that it also runs in the family.

 










Romantic, spiritual, or criminal, the textured relationships of “Night Patrol” make for enough rich connective tissue between characters across this unreal L.A. to make Prows' universe feels almost capable of supporting a TV show. But even saving many of cinematographer Benjamin Kitchens' most beautiful shots for the end of the film, Prows seems to run out of plot as the finale fades into ambience. 

Pacing proves an impossible obstacle for “Night Patrol,” with its routine lulls suggesting the theatrical release could eventually do better as “second screen” programming enjoyed at home. Astonishingly slow at times, Prows' heavy-handed style — complete with three, semi-gothic title cards it really didn't need — builds to a sense of boredom that blankets even the most essential and emotional scenes. 

It's a low-budget affair that feels less like wading around in a cinematic mood and more like languishing in underwhelming production values as the monotony of the last 45 minutes grinds on. But Prows takes big, decisive swings when the plot does manage to pick up, and ultimately, the audience is rewarded with a tonally chunky experience that isn't for everyone but impresses as both otherworldly and authentic. 

Caught somewhere between “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “The Wire,” this dark genre hybrid has a lot of flaws, but none of them are fatal. With “Night Patrol,” Prows drives a stake through the hearts of two familiar landscapes to try a unique idea with ever-prescient themes and a gamely frantic pulse.

 










From RLJE Films and Shudder, “Night Patrol” is in theaters on Friday, January 16.

Mitski is back. Her new album, Nothing's About to Happen to Me, is out February 27 via Dead Oceans. Directed by Noel Paul, the music video for lead single “Where's My Phone?” draws inspiration from Shirley Jackson's novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle. Mitski plays a recluse whose gothic manor is set upon by intruders from the outside world. Watch it below.

Last year, Mitski released a concert film and accompanying live album, both of which were recorded during the tour for her 2023 album, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We. Members of her touring band also contributed to Nothing's About to Happen to Me. Mitski is still working on a stage musical adaptation of The Queen's Gambit, according to a press release.

Julianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore have enough in common that it'd be weird if they hadn't worked together. Both grew up in the South and found early inspiration in spiritually rooted musical forms that they could transform with technology. For Lattimore, that meant intensive training on the harp, the instrument of gods and angels, which her mother introduced to her at home in the hills of western North Carolina. Barwick's path led from a fascination with voices reverberating in a church's sanctuary to the discovery of loop pedals and then on to lo-fi records crafted after a move to Brooklyn. Since 2019, they've collaborated on various songs and occasionally shared the stage. In 2025, France's Musée de la Musique, which houses thousands of historically significant artifacts, invited them to Paris to record an album using some of the museum's instruments. Tragic Magic, assembled from recordings made over a period of nine days, is the culmination of the project.

The opening “Perpetual Adoration” sounds almost exactly like you'd expect it to when imagining Barwick's voice and Lattimore's harp in the same space—which makes it enjoyable but never quite transcendent. It's unhurried and dreamy, with slow, ringing notes and the singer carefully articulating a single reverb-drenched syllable at a time. For all its obvious beauty, it's just a little dull, because it never surprises. Each of us has an internal meter that quivers when excessive sweetness tips over into something we'd describe as “saccharine”; for some, “Perpetual Adoration” may inch up to the line of too-muchness.

But this issue, if you hear it as one, doesn't crop up again, and Tragic Magic grows more involving with each track. When two artists this distinctive and identifiable come together, you want to hear them make a third thing that wouldn't exist without the collaboration, and the progression of the record finds them steadily feeling out that place. “The Four Sleeping Princesses” starts with a minimalistic pattern from Lattimore before Barwick adds synth and multi-tracked voice. Unlike “Perpetual Adoration,” there's movement and evolution—it's about accretion, a clear, defined and orderly structure gradually acquiring density, and in its final section a mass of voices is sloshing around unpredictably. On “Temple of the Winds,” a brief piece sketched for the pair by composer Roger Eno, Lattimore's tone is sharp and pointillist, each carefully articulated note a pinprick, while Barwick works against the edges, her eerie melody assuming a drifting and gaseous form.

A cover of Vangelis' “Rachel's Song,” from Blade Runner, is an inspired choice (they've previously performed it live). The original is a clear precursor to Barwick's style, and she uses her voice in a way that's unusual for her, with a rounded tone that evokes the place where Vangelis' Far East exoticism meets the dusty plain of Ennio Morricone. Just as thrilling is “Stardust,” which leaves the baroque trappings behind so the duo can indulge in time-tripping kosmische. It combines a buzzing analog synth fit for a planetarium laser show with Lattimore playing triple-time phrases, all while Barwick's voice is rendered alien through processing. “Stardust” lasts for seven minutes, and I wish it went on for another 10.

Both Barwick and Lattimore are based in Los Angeles, and this project was commissioned shortly after the January 2025 wildfires. While a sampled downpour in “Rachel's Song” conjures the dreary world of the film, it was also added to commemorate the first rain after the disaster, which they heard about while in Paris via a text from a friend. Reading about this distant transmission, and the synchronicity of what's happening in the world informing the action inside the walls of a studio across an ocean, suggests that this is a record above all about connection. One of the virtues of the set is how simple it is, and how it conveys the feeling of two minds in harmony making sound together in a room.

The closing “Melted Moon” is the most song-like piece here and its lyrics—most of the vocals on the album are wordless—connect directly to the catastrophe. Barwick sings about searching for hope amid the ruins and the feeling that you may never go home again as Lattimore spins out a Reich-like repeating figure, and the combined effect is emotionally overwhelming. It's powerful and vulnerable in equal measure, holding the possibility of life and the finality of death simultaneously; they needed each other to make it real.

The title of Gylt's new EP is lifted from a line in Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. My familiarity with Fyodor begins and ends with a high school reading of Crime and Punishment some 20 years ago, but this 11-minute onslaught of thorny, emotionally raw music provides all of the context necessary to understand those nearly 150-year-old words. The prevailing sentiment of In 1,000 Agonies, I Exist is not “celebratory,” per se, but its pummeling desperation offers more than fleeting escape.

Gylt's previous releases, all compiled on last June's I Will Commit a Holy Crime: Tandem, had the lean, driving hallmarks of classic SoCal hardcore. 1,000 Agonies maintains those essential qualities of pissed-off attitudes and economical composition while also fleshing out Gylt's idiosyncrasies into something starting to resemble a signature sound. Despite a heavier reliance on spartan d-beat templates, the band's early material often spiraled into brief moments of noodly abstraction, courtesy of wild guitar spasms that owe more to Dr. Know than Greg Ginn or Pat Smear. That approach added character, but it also tended to disrupt and muddy up their sound at its most breakneck speeds. The sludgier, more adventurous 1,000 Agonies plays to the band's strengths.

Working primarily in a 90-seconds-or-less format, Gylt maximize their impact by barreling through one volatile movement after another—who can say if anything actually constitutes a verse or chorus. The EP peaks in its middle with two songs, “Pentiment” and “Wrought/Rot,” which both begin with fast-paced fakeouts that serve as pulse-quickeners and confirm that, no matter what comes next, Gylt are still a hardcore band. After 10 or 15 seconds, though, they sound more like a punk-adjacent sludge metal band, or at least like one of the many crust-punk bands that ended up pivoting to slower tempos. The back half of “Wrought/Rot,” in particular, embodies the “when they bring back the nasty riff but slower” meme in a way that's refreshingly divorced from the bro-iest strains of hardcore built on that reliable formula. Gylt don't do breakdowns in the traditional sense. 1,000 Agonies' near-constant pace-shifts never feel pre-ordained; the songs flow as they need to, in service of catharsis rather than a drooling anticipation of mosh pit moments.

Vocalist and lyricist Iphigenia is the core of this unpredictable maelstrom with a guttural delivery that never dips below 11, save for a perfectly timed bratty aside on opener “Bone Rake.” The lyrics throughout the EP juggle ferocity and vulnerability in a way that mirrors the music's seamless transitions. She invokes the personal (“Watch me wither away/While you get undressed” on “Pentiment”) as much as the political (“Masked men don't comply” on “Intimidated”), but there's no separation between the two. When Iphigenia bellows, “War: It does not change/Screwing, dying” on the closing track, the overarching theme snaps into focus. Minimal research informs me that The Brothers Karamazov's Dmitri, while wrongfully imprisoned for murdering his father, finally finds peace of mind after years of tumult, declaring: “In thousands of agonies—I exist!” On this EP, Gylt harness the weird strain of freedom that defiantly blooms during desperate times.

Last year, curators at the French museum Musée de la Musique invited Julianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore to use some of their historically significant artifacts to record an album. The musicians—both of whom make airy, whimsical, near-ambient compositions—took them up on the offer without hesitation. Although they spent nine days testing out pieces and taping compositions, the duo whittled down their recordings into an album's worth of material. Musically, Tragic Magic is almost exactly what you might expect: songs with ethereal vocal harmonies and gentle harp plucks, complete with titles like “Perpetual Adoration” and “Melted Moon.”

Between the launch of his surprisingly viable acting career and the birth of three children, A$AP Rocky has found plenty of time since 2018's Testing to pretend his follow-up, Don't Be Dumb, was just around the corner. The campaign kicked up a gear last month when he unveiled the record's visual universe, with Tim Burton behind the album art and the director's close collaborator Winona Ryder in the “Punk Rocky” video—plus another fellow Burtonite Danny Elfman on string arrangements. “Highjack,” the rapper's 2024 track with Jessica Pratt, does not make the cut, but a new one called “The End” does. And Rocky helicoptered in a squadron of other guests too, including Doechii, Gorillaz, Thundercat, Westside Gunn, Will.i.am, and Tyler, the Creator.

What began as a slowcore outlet for Peter Katz a decade ago has since become a slightly poppier and mathier trio over the years, eventually evolving into the present-day iteration of Peaer. Doppelgänger, their first new album in nearly seven years, wastes no time explaining just how happy they are to be back with the jubilant opener “End of the World.” From there, though, Peaer find themselves caught in bristly knots like “Button” and “Bad News,” suggesting they returned to a thornier world that needs some untangling after all.

In the midst of a tour with his Surf Gang cadre, evilgiane has surprise-released this follow-up to his 2022 instrumental LP Giane. Clams Casino and Rue Jacobs are the only guests, the former co-composing the piano-and-sub-bass elegy “Poker” and the latter riding the vaporwave of “Aerial Passing.” The rest of the record is a showcase for evilgiane's ambient finesse, full of muffled earworms and lulling tones, with the odd technical beat racing in to wake you from its daydream.

Newcomers to Xiu Xiu could do worse than starting with their hauntingly intense version of Robyn's “Dancing on My Own,” one of 12 covers that make Xiu Mutha Fuckin' Xiu: Vol. 1 a perfect introduction to the influential art-rockers' dark allure. About half of the tracklist checks out—takes on direct antecedents like Throbbing Gristle, This Heat, and Coil—leaving a half-dozen curveballs, from a dubbed-out take on Talking Heads' “Psycho Killer” to an industrial revamp of GloRilla's “Lick or Sum” and a disarmingly gorgeous interpretation of Daniel Johnston's “Some Things Last a Long Time.”

Sleaford Mods foretold The Demise of Planet X with an increasingly surprising string of collaborations with British darlings, from Life Without Buildings' Sue Tompkins (on the joyous single “No Touch”) to Andrea Arnold (director of Fish Tank and, now, the “No Touch” video) to Game of Thrones and Star Wars star Gwendolyn Christie, who blazes through an unlikely rap verse on “The Good Life.” That collaborative spirit extends to the commonwealth on “Elitist G.O.A.T.”—which features New Zealander Aldous Harding—but not to the likes of compatriots Rishi Sunak or the old English fascist Henry Williamson, who get a lyrical kicking in Jason Williamson's latest batch of reliably caustic bars.

Once a hired hand for the likes of Jimmy Eat World and Damien Jurado, Courtney Marie Andrews has beaten down a country-folk path of her own in the past decade. The poet and singer-songwriter recorded Valentine, her follow-up to 2022's Loose Future, in Los Angeles, with Jerry Bernhardt co-producing and Grizzly Bear's Chris Bear on drums. “Love, it turns out, is a lot more than I gave it credit for,” Andrews says of the source material. “I was in one of the darkest periods of my life, and songs were the only way I could reckon with it.”

Moby has tiptoed into the studio for a new, mostly ambient album, Future Quiet. Out February 20, the follow-up to his similarly minimalist Ambient 23 takes cues from Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil, the producer says. Leading the record is a rework of his 1995 song “When It's Cold I'd Like to Die” featuring Gabriels' Jacob Lusk. Listen to that below, and scroll down for the album art and tracklist.

That song, originally sung by Mimi Goese on Moby's Everything Is Wrong, has had a streaming resurgence since its sync in the first season of Stranger Things (and reprisal in season 4). Of its new vocalist, Moby says, “Like anyone who's heard Jacob sing, I immediately fell in love with his voice. After hearing him sing on the radio, I spent weeks tracking him down and begging him to work with me. And, lucky me, he agreed. The results speak for themselves, as his vocals on ‘When It's Cold I'd Like to Die' are, I say with something approaching objectivity, transcendent.”

Moby elaborates on the album's influences in a press release:

When I was growing up I played in hardcore punk rock bands, and I DJed VERY LOUD hip hop and house music and industrial music, but I also needed the refuge of quiet records like This Mortal Coil, the Cocteau Twins, Eno & Bowie's ambient music, Gorecki, Arvo Part, etc. Future Quiet is definitely the product of my influences, as I can't count the number of times I've listened to ‘Song to the Siren' or Joy Division's ‘Atmosphere.'

The mostly instrumental LP features a handful more guest vocalists, namely Serpentwithfeet, Elise Serenelle, and India Carney. BMG is releasing the record, which Moby will back with a major tour, soon to be announced.

Jimmy Kimmel has a tempting opportunity for Donald Trump. After Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado gave her Nobel Peace Prize to the president yesterday, Kimmel attempted to bribe Trump with his choice of any of the awards Kimmel has won over the years.


	“Trump loves awards,” Kimmel said. “Giving him an award seems like the only way to get him to do anything. And with that said, Mr. President, I have an offer I think you'll find difficult to refuse. If you, and only if, you agree to pull ICE out of Minneapolis and put them back at the borders where they belong, I am prepared to offer you one of the following trophies that I have been honored with over the years.”


	Kimmel showcased a red velour stand lined with numerous awards, including a Daytime Emmy, a Clio, a Webby, and a Writers Guild Award. “Or,” Kimmel added, “best of all, I'm willing to hand over my 2015 Soul Train Award for White Person of the Year.”


	“The choice is yours,” Kimmel said. “I will personally deliver any or even all of these to the Oval Office in exchange for leaving the people of Minneapolis alone.”

	











	Kimmel recounted Machado's visit to Washington, D.C. “Trump said Machado was coming to the White House to pay her regards to our country,” Kimmel said. “Whether she made that payment in cash or check, we don't know. But after disappearing their president, Trump refused to support Machado as the new leader of Venezuela. And some in his circle believe it's because she didn't give him her Nobel Prize.”

	











	After visiting Trump, Machado told reporters she had given the president her medal. “Rarely does a president yank a Nobel Prize off of someone's neck,” Kimmel noted. “You know he's back in the Oval Office sucking on it like a pacifier right now.”


	Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October, a blow to Trump, who had been heavily campaigning to receive the honor. The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Machado was given the prize for “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”


	In the months since, Trump has invaded Venezuela, removed its leader Nicolás Maduro, and taken over the country's oil reserves. The president has repeatedly told reporters that the South American nation — home to some of the largest oil reserves on the planet — “stole our oil.”

	“We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” Trump said. “We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground.”


	Although Trump missed out on the Nobel Peace Prize, he did receive the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize in December, a completely made-up award given to him by FIFA President Gianni Infantino. Infantino said Trump earned the prize thanks to his “exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world.”

Lizzie McGuire turned 25 years old this week, but there's no need to live in the past. After some teasing, Hilary Duff has dropped another single, off her upcoming album Luck …or Something. 


	Co-written by Duff, her husband, musician Matthew Koma, and Brian Phillips, “Roommates” is a pop stunner about losing the spark in a relationship. With razor-sharp lyrics and bright, synth-heavy production reminiscent of Taylor Swift's “Cruel Summer,” it's easily one of her best songs in years. “I only want the beginning, I don't want the end/I want the part where you say goddamn,” she sings. “Back of a dive bar/Giving you head/Then sneak home late/Wake up your roommates.”


	The video above, directed by Matty Peacock, features Duff alongside a partner she's drifting apart from. It begins to rain as she makes a run for it, reminding us of her “Come Clean” days. How did we make it 10 years without any new music?

	“'Roommates' is a song about when life is life-ing, babe,” says Hilary. “It's that ache for a wilder, freer time — before the days were swallowed by carpools, budget talks, grocery runs and letting old or new insecurities slip in. It's the restless hum of wanting to find your way back — to your rhythm, to your person, to yourself.”

	











Luck …or Something, out Feb. 20 via Atlantic, marks Duff's first new album since 2015's Breathe In. Breathe Out. “Roommates” follows her return single “Mature,” which arrived back in November. Shortly after, she announced the Small Rooms, Big Nerves tour, which sold-out immediately (if you missed out on scoring tickets to those, don't worry: she's already teased more shows). In May, she'll head to Las Vegas for a residency. As a young Hilary once said, we can't wait.

Mickey Rourke once again took to Instagram to address the GoFundMe fiasco launched by his manager after news that The Wrestler actor was facing eviction after being sued by his landlord.


	“Vicious cruel godamm lie to hustle money using my fuckin name so motherfuckin enbarassing,” Rourke wrote on a social media post. “There will b severe repercussions to individual who did this very bad thing to me and anyone who knows me knows payback k will be goddamm severe!!!!!!”


	The post was one in several the actor shared on Thursday, Jan. 15, including one wishing his friend, fellow actor Eric Dane, who revealed his ALS diagnosis last year, well. In another, Rourke wrote in the caption alongside a black-and-white photo of himself, that over $100,000 had been raised by ” CONCERNED STRANGERS” and that his attorney was working on getting the money returned to donors. He added that there is still $90,000 that needs to refunded and urged people to get their money back. “THE PERSON WHO PULLED THIS CRAP SHOULDNT GET ONE FUCEN DOLLAR,” the actor wrote and said that his main concern at the moment was the wellbeing of Dane.

	











	Earlier this month, Rourke said that he was not involved with the GoFundMe campaign launched under the premise of helping the actor to stay in his home, saying it was “humiliating” and that he would “never ask strangers or fans or anybody for a nickel.”

	Kimberly Hines, who's been Rourke's manager for over a decade and launched the GoFundMe with her assistant, told The Hollywood Reporter that the fundraiser was not a “grift.” Hines said that the actor was aware of who was behind the effort, while also acknowledging that it was possible Rourke didn't fully understand what a GoFundMe was when she presented the idea to him. 

	











	Following Rourke's denouncement of the GoFundMe, Hines told fans that if Rourke didn't want the money, donors would be reimbursed. “He's calling me for money. He's calling friends for money,” claimed Hines. “A GoFund is set up for him, and now he's rejecting it? ‘OK, Mick, no problem.' But nobody here has done anything wrong.”

A$AP Rocky has released Don't Be Dumb, his fourth studio album and his first LP in eight years, via A$AP Worldwide/RCA Records. It encompasses 15 tracks total and includes previously released singles “Punk Rocky” and “Helicopter,” which both rolled out with wildly surreal music videos — the first featuring Winona Ryder, Thundercat, and Danny Elfman.


	The album features a serious amount of collaborators, including BossMan Dlow, Brent Faiyaz, Danny Elfman, Doechii, Gorillaz, Jon Batiste, Jessica Pratt, Slay Squad, Thundercat, Tyler, the Creator, Westside Gunn, and Will.i.am. Rocky also partnered filmmaker Tim Burton for the cover art, which features six of Rocky's signature personas. 


	The rapper debuted “Punk Rocky” earlier this month, followed by “Helicopter,” which was accompanied by an animated video that Rocky confirmed was “not AI generated.”

	When speaking to Perfect about what's taken him nearly eight years to follow up 2018's Testing, Rocky said he's seeking perfection and honed in on building a legacy. “That's why I'm not so eager to just drop, drop, drop,” he said. “I don't do things to just try and stay relevant, or keep my name in the conversation. I try to do natural things, creative, ambitious things that really satisfy me.”

	In an interview with Variety, he teased the album's subject matter and a bit of insecurity: “This fucking album, it represents who I am right now. It's just I hope that it's digestible,” he noted, adding, “It's odd because as I get older, I'm more conscious about how I view myself. Describing my life sounds very braggadocious, and I want to figure out how to say it to where it feels more humble, relatable, and sincere, as opposed to just shitting on the next person or making the next person feel down, or just evoking negative shit out of people.”

	











Don't Be Dumb sold over 130,000 copies on vinyl ahead of its release date and became the No. 1 pre-saved hip-hop album on Spotify with over one million saves.

	Ahead of her 80th birthday, Dolly Parton revisited her twangy 1977 ballad, “Light of a Clear Blue Morning,” with an impressive group of friends in a new video. The clip features Lainey Wilson, Miley Cyrus, Queen Latifah, and Reba McEntire singing their parts in a recording studio.


	The clip begins with Parton narrating, “You know, we're living in troubled and uncertain times.” Latifah responds, “Yeah, we sure are.” Parton rejoins, “But we can't let the darkness win.” Each artist takes turns, round-robin style, singing the verses, while David Foster plays piano. The new version includes a gospel choir, the Christ Church Choir, giving the song a peppy finish as the women all harmonize the chorus along with them. “Everything's gonna be all right,” Parton says at the end, looking into the camera. “It's gonna be OK.”


	The artist teased the new clip with an Instagram reel, explaining she wrote the tune, on which she sings, “I can see the light of a clear blue morning” and “everything's gonna be all right,” in 1976 when she “needed a little hope.” At the time, she was coming to terms with separating from her musical and business partner, Porter Wagoner. “This time around, I've invited some very special women, some real ‘shining lights' to help me bring that hope to life again.”

	











	“As I celebrate my 80th birthday, this new version is my way of using what I've been blessed with to shine a little light forward, especially by sharing it with some truly incredible women,” Parton echoed in another statement when the song came out. Net proceeds from the recording will benefit pediatric cancer research at Nashville's Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt.

	The song, which combined country, pop, and even gospel into one uplifting song, originally featured on Parton's 18th solo studio album, New Harvest…First Gathering. Parton wrote the tune herself, but, like the new version, the album featured several notable guests including Roy Acuff, Chet Atkins, Minnie Pearl, Kitty Wells, and Ernest Tubb as backing vocalists. She re-recorded the song as a more upbeat, modern-sounding pop song for the Straight Talk movie soundtrack in 1992, and again in 2003 as a lush piano ballad for her post-9/11 patriotic album, For God and Country.


	Cyrus, too, has a history with “Light of a Clear Blue Morning,” since she covered the song during a Saturday Night Live appearance in 2021. “Tomorrow is Mother's Day, and this is for all the moms out there,” Cyrus said before the performance, which was a cold open.

Dan Farah's ""The Age of Disclosure"" explores the hidden war for New Mexico's skies.

When filmmaker Dan Farah began work on his documentary The Age of Disclosure, he sought to crack open what the film terms “an 80-year global cover-up.”

The film was released last November and presents a stark narrative, featuring interviews with 34 high-level U.S. government, military, and intelligence insiders, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former director of National Intelligence (2010-2017) James Clapper, and U.S. Sen. André Carson, a Democrat from Indiana. Since at least 1947, the United States has been engaged in a secret war to capture and reverse-engineer technology of non-human origin. The film's plot is a modern detective story, tracing how this monumental secret was built and guarded.

Yet, this contemporary story of state secrecy is rooted in a specific geographical shift within New Mexico. A move from the public spectacle of Roswell to the classified confines of Holloman Air Force Base west of Alamogordo. It is a story about how the UFO phenomenon disappeared behind the fence, and the cultural and philosophical conflict that emerged in its wake.

The Age of Disclosure frames the alleged alien crash retrieval at Roswell in 1947 not as a singular mystery but as the original template for public engagement. The military's subsequent retrieval from a rancher's land played out in a landscape of public roads among curious locals. Roswell became folklore not because it was solved, but because it was a story the public could access, debate, and own from its inception. Farah underscores this point: “The crash at Roswell happened off the base and in the public eye.” What the film emphasizes is not the mystery itself, but the fact that Roswell began as a civilian story, one the public felt entitled to argue over and piece together, seeding decades of cultural fascination, amateur investigation, and populist belief that stood in opposition to official silence.

The documentary then identifies a pivotal and deliberate turn. It details a purported controlled UFO landing and meeting in 1964 at Holloman Air Force Base, an event meticulously obscured from public view. Unlike Roswell, this was not a crash on a rancher's field. It was, according to the film's sources, a scheduled event on a secure military tarmac. This, The Age of Disclosure argues, became the new operating model.

In an interview in the documentary, former Department of Defense official Lue Elizondo notes that this era saw the genesis of a deeply hidden and much larger UAP program (the term Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena replaced Unidentified Flying Objects around 2020), a bureaucracy so compartmentalized it was withheld from the Secretary of Defense, Congress, and even the president. Thus the “Holloman model” — on-base, controlled, and entirely secret — supplanted the “Roswell model.”

Disclosure, when it happened accidentally, was replaced by a regime of those in the absolute need-to-know. The phenomenon was no longer a public mystery to be solved, but a state secret to be weaponized. This shift from private ranch to secure tarmac allowed the program described in The Age of Disclosure to grow exponentially in the shadows, evolving into a sustained, institutionalized effort that officials in the film call the “legacy program.”

Through testimony from figures including former UAP Task Force Director Jay Stratton, a thesis emerges about bureaucracy stopping disclosure. “There's this legacy program that has at least 80 years of information that could help us better understand this problem and protect national security, and they refused to give it to us,” Stratton says. The program had become a state within a state, hoarding knowledge even from other government entities tasked with national defense.

Former UAP Task Force Director Jay Stratton calls out the U.S. government's  “legacy program,” which he says hoards UAP knowledge in order to weaponize it.

The motivation for this secrecy, the film posits, is no longer merely containment of a shocking truth but dominance in a technological arms race. “We're in a technology race, for better or worse,” Farah tells Pasatiempo. “It's compared to the Manhattan Project on steroids. It's in our best interest that the United States win instead of an adversarial nation like China or Russia, who could use it for nefarious purposes.”

The ultimate goal, as framed by the documentary, is to weaponize a cosmic discovery. The stakes are portrayed as existential. “This technology, as it's explained in the film, has the ability to revolutionize the way we live,” Farah says. “At the same time, a bad actor could use UAP technology to instantaneously deliver a nuclear weapon. That's a terrifying thought.”

With such high-stakes technology at play, a legal barrier to truth emerges in The Age of Disclosure: the “amnesty dilemma.” The sources in the film argue that the secrecy has been protected not just by classification, but by a culture of implied threat and actual legal jeopardy for whistleblowers. Without legal protection, insiders with firsthand knowledge will not talk.

”My film makes it clear there's still a lot of information that cannot legally be disclosed,” Farah says. “Officials are now exploring whether giving people amnesty is possible.” Without it, as U.S. Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee warns in the documentary, “I think people who come forward with this are taking their life into their own hands.”

This legal lockbox protects a system U.S. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota describes as “so secret that very few people in our entire government have been allowed and provided access to it.” The secrecy has become self-perpetuating, an institutional inertia defended by law and fear.

Even for the documentary's purposes, lines were starkly drawn. None of Farah's 34 sources could or would discuss the government's alleged biological evidence of non-human beings. “I wish they did, but they didn't,” Farah admits. “I certainly would like to know more about that myself. There were a number of areas of inquiry that they just weren't comfortable getting into. There were certain lines they didn't want to cross.”

The Age of Disclosure ultimately chronicles the tension between the two stories born in New Mexico: The Roswell story of public discovery and folklore, and the Holloman story of state secrecy and a technology race. With official channels locked by the “amnesty dilemma,” popular culture has filled the void, shaping public perception and keeping the question alive.

This cultural thread is personal for Farah, who was inspired by Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Spielberg, in fact, returns to the topic this summer with his forthcoming release of the film Disclosure Day.

“I think movies have a unique ability to open people's minds to new ideas and to make people curious about new things,” Farah says. “I hope that my film makes more people curious about this topic. I'm sure Steven's will, and that's a great thing in my opinion.”

When asked if the filmmakers were aware of each other's projects, given their thematic overlap (and that Farah was a producer on Spielberg's 2018 film Ready Player One), Farah says rather succinctly, “I was aware of his project, and he's aware of mine.”

This ongoing cultural conversation circles a question Farah's film poses indirectly, and that is of the tension between the two models that it outlines. Will “disclosure,” if it ever comes, merely be a technological briefing from the “legacy program”? A Holloman-style revelation controlled by the state about physics and engineering? Or can it engage the deeper, older, more philosophical question implied by the public's enduring Roswell fascination, a question echoed by such traditions as Navajo astronomy: 

What is our relationship to the cosmos and potential lifeforms in it?

The distinction is critical. The first ends with a new arsenal and a new cold war. The second begins a conversation about our place in a cosmos that may be far more populated and stranger than we imagined.

The answer will determine whether humanity finally reclaims the sense of wonder and collective ownership over the extraterrestrial mystery that was born in the Roswell dust or whether we remain forever outside the fence that was built at Holloman. 



The Age of Disclosure is available for purchase ($19.99) and rental ($14.99) on Amazon Prime Video.

For over two decades, millions of people volunteered the computational capacity of their computers to help UC Berkeley scientists in their search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

The goal of the project, called SETI@home, was to trawl through data collected by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico for signs of unusual radio signals from the cosmos. It was a powerful example of “distributed computing,” which relies on a huge network of individual computers — but whether the search has borne any fruit remains unclear as scientists continue to analyze the wealth of data.

SETI@home concluded after 21 years in 2020, producing a whopping 12 billion detections, according to a UC Berkeley press release, making it “one of the most popular crowd-sourced research projects ever.”

Over the years, researchers whittled down the data to just 100 signals that were “worth a second look” by eliminating radio frequency interference and noise with the help of a supercomputer. Since July, they've been using China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), in the hopes of catching another glimpse of the identified targets.

Unfortunately, the Arecibo Observatory — once the world's largest radio telescope — collapsed during a storm in 2020, and is being decommissioned.

Even if the project never leads to first contact with an intelligent extraterrestrial species, it doesn't mean SETI@home was a waste of time. Researchers are still trawling through the FAST data, but early conclusions of the project and its effectiveness have already resulted in two papers that were published last year in The Astronomical Journal.

“If we don't find ET, what we can say is that we established a new sensitivity level,” said project cofounder David Anderson in a statement. “If there were a signal above a certain power, we would have found it.”

The team is hoping to inspire a successor to the crowdsourced research project, while applying what they've learned.

“Some of our conclusions are that the project didn't completely work the way we thought it was going to,” Anderson said. “And we have a long list of things that we would have done differently and that future sky survey projects should do differently.”

Astronomer and project director Eric Korpela also pointed out that the considerable amount of radio interference, which can emanate from other sources, including radio and TV broadcasts and even microwave ovens, could seriously mess with the data.

“We have to do a better job of measuring what we're excluding,” he said. “Are we throwing out the baby with the bath water? I don't think we know for most SETI searches, and that is really a lesson for SETI searches everywhere.”

Given the lack of a smoking gun after trawling “billions and billions” of stars in the Milky Way, the project left the alien-hunting organizers somewhat deflated.

“We are, without doubt, the most sensitive narrow-band search of large portions of the sky, so we had the best chance of finding something,” Korpela explained. “So yeah, there's a little disappointment that we didn't see anything.”

However, the researcher hasn't given up on the idea, particularly given the immense advancements in computer power and improved internet connections.

“I think that you could still get significantly more processing power than we used for SETI@home and process more data because of a wider internet bandwidth,” Korpela said. However, “the biggest issue with such a project is that it requires personnel, and personnel means salaries. It's not the cheapest way to do SETI.”

And plenty of what-ifs remain, especially considering the limitations of the SETI@home project.

“There's still the potential that ET is in that data and we missed it just by a hair,” he pondered.

For 15 seasons, Supernatural balanced dark fantasy, a Dom Toretto level of “family” quotes, and a surprising amount of humor. But at its core, the CW series was built on horror. While not every monster-of-the-week episode was focused on genuine terror, there are some installments that still haunt viewers long after the credits rolled. Even star Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) has admitted there's one episode that got under his skin more than the rest.

So, with that in mind, here are the five episodes we think prove Supernatural could be just as scary as anything on late-night cable. I mean, if Dean Winchester can get spooked, what chance do we have?

Do they? Does everyone love a clown? Sam Winchester certainly doesn't. And considering clowns have long been a staple of the horror genre, it's unlikely many others like them, either. From the very real, very terrifying John Wayne Gacey to Stephen King's It, the sinister creep-factor of clowns makes this episode a given on this list.

The episode builds up the scary through the innocence of children (another key element in scary plotlines). The demon can only be seen by children, and for some reason, the kids aren't remotely concerned seeing it at the carnival, then by the side of the road on their way home. By the time the clown turns up at the family home, the children are more than happy to let it in to kill their parents. It's a terrifying detail that makes the adults powerless until it's too late.

For many fans, this one hit close to home. Anyone who grew up uneasy around clowns found new reasons to keep their distance after watching. The eerie carnival setting, the sense of danger lurking just outside the tent, and even the sinister feeling of chaos within the fun house makes it one of the show's most underrated horror outings. It effectively weaponizes a common phobia while still delivering a monster-of-the-week mystery.

What makes it more interesting is that this episode came 9 years before the bizarre and very real nightmare-fuel phenomena of the 2016 clown sightings. People were dressing up as creepy clowns and being extremely menacing in the middle of the night. From standing in the middle of abandoned roads, blocking rivers, to creeping up to people's ring doorbells and staring into the cameras. So, if anything, Supernatural was way ahead of the trend, and with hindsight, “Everybody Loves a Clown” certainly deserves to be on this list.

Season 2's “No Exit” is a chilling reminder that some of the darkest monsters come from real history. The episode centers on the ghost of infamous serial killer H.H. Holmes, known as America's first serial killer. His spirit captures and torments women living in an apartment building. So, Sam and Dean team up with Jo Harvelle (played by Alona Tal) to put an end to the hauntings.

The true-crime angle adds an extra layer of dread. Holmes' crimes were very real, and extremely heinous. His “Murder Castle” which Sam briefly mentions in the episode, is disturbing not only because of what he did there, but also that a living, breathing human being had the capacity to think of it and act on those thoughts. Seeing his presence bleed into Supernatural's world gives the episode disturbing authenticity.

Its claustrophobic setting certainly adds extra terror. The victims are trapped in the walls and crawlspaces of the building, echoing Holmes' real-life torture designs. But it's the fact that Sam and Dean can't actually kill Holmes' ghost. Sure, they manage to incapacitate him and pour a city-sized amount of concrete on top of him, but he's still there. It's the fact that any time in the future, some developer could come along, dig up the ground, and start the whole thing over again.

And while Holmes was a spirit in Supernatural, he was no less horrific than his living, breathing version, showing that sometimes the scariest monsters are the human ones. That's exactly why Jensen Ackles singled out “The Benders” as the scariest episode of the entire series.

In the episode, Sam is kidnapped by a backwoods family who hunt people for sport — literally nothing supernatural here! Ackles has explained in numerous interviews that what made this episode stand out was its realism. He told ScreenRant “It's not the supernatural element, it's humans doing very bad things”.

The episode plays like a classic survival horror film, reminiscent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or The Hills Have Eyes. But, like “No Exit”, “The Benders” is based on very real people. In Kansas between 1871 and 1872, a family known as “The Bloody Benders” were accused of killing up to 20 travelers after letting them stay in their cabin.

Even after facing down countless demons and angels across 15 seasons, Ackles still points to “The Benders” as the one that made him shiver. That endorsement alone makes it a must-watch for anyone curious about Supernatural's scarier side.

Few episodes of Supernatural have been as effective at pure horror as “Bloody Mary”. Early in the show's run, the writers utilized familiar urban legends for their monster-of-the-week stories, and none is more notorious than the story of chanting “Bloody Mary” into a mirror.

The Winchester brothers investigate mysterious deaths tied to mirrors, leading to eerie sequences where Bloody Mary herself crawls out of reflective surfaces. Even today, fans point to this episode as the one that made them afraid to look in a mirror at night. The episode's atmosphere and commitment to the legend make it one of the most terrifying in the series.

In a quite literal game of “Truth or Dare”, the episode also succeeds by turning the legend personal. It punishes those hiding guilty secrets, forcing characters — and by proxy, the viewer — to confront uncomfortable truths. It's horror with psychological teeth.

Though not officially cited as the scariest episode for Jared Padalecki (aka Sam Winchester), this is one he has definitely acknowledged as causing the creeps.Children in horror often walk the line between innocent and sinister, and Supernatural takes full advantage of that uncanny energy in “The Kids Are Alright.” Dean reconnects with old flame, Lisa, only to discover that the children in her neighborhood are acting in an odd Invasion of the Body Snatchers kind of way. Eventually, he realizes the kids are most certainly not alright, and they've been replaced by changelings — creatures who feed on their human mothers while posing as their children.

It's one of the show's creepiest creature designs, with changelings revealed as pale, leech-faced monsters when you see their reflections in mirrors. The juxtaposition of childhood innocence with suddenly aggressive neediness and predatory malice creates some of the series' most unsettling visuals.

The episode hits hard because it takes something as familiar, comfortable, and wholesome as suburban family life, and corrupts it with horror. For parents watching at home, “The Kids Are Alright” may be the one that lingers long after bedtime.

Home » Movies





Night Patrol, set to hit theaters January 16, plunges audiences into a Los Angeles neighborhood where the line between crime and the supernatural is razor thin. When an LAPD officer uncovers a secret task force and a shadow war involving gangs and vampires, alliances are tested, loyalties are questioned, and survival comes at a deadly cost. Blending street-level grit with supernatural suspense, the film delivers a tense, adrenaline-charged story about power, revenge, and the price of trust.

When asked what the one non‑negotiable would be if a truce were called between the gangs and the vampires, RJ Cyler explained, “Between the Bloods and the Cribs, if we had to make a truce or non‑negotiable, I think Bornelius might say that I can't be with his sister.”

The actors emphasized that this rule is more than a simple boundary—it defines trust within the dangerous alliance and underscores the personal stakes involved in their interactions.

While alliances may form to combat supernatural threats or seek revenge, individual choices remain untouchable. Bornelius's sister makes her own decisions, and the characters must navigate the tension between loyalty, family respect, and survival. In a world filled with blood, chaos, and creatures that defy explanation, even the simplest rules carry weight, making the truce both fragile and essential.

RJ Cyler, Freddie Gibbs, and YG bring electrifying performances to the screen, capturing the intensity and danger of a world where loyalty, revenge, and supernatural threats collide. This isn't just a cop thriller—it's a survival noir experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Alien+Abductions","Here are your chances in SC of being ‘abducted' by space aliens, based on UFO reports","https://www.thestate.com/news/state/south-carolina/article314338506.html","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

Here's how a report on alien abductions in the United States begins: “Most alien abduction stories begin quietly — a strange light, a missing moment, something that feels off.”

Sounds like something from the “Twilight Zone” or worse.

It's the Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026 and it looks at where abductions are reported and shows the pattern. They're not necessarily making a prediction.

“The odds are low everywhere. But the takeaway is simple: these reports don't appear everywhere — they appear somewhere,” the report says.

Well, sort of.

As many know, South Carolina was the site of the UFO Welcome Center in Bowman for years, a saucer-shaped wooden structure built over a period of years by Jody Pendarvis. The ramshackle 48-foot-wide, 16-foot-tall structure was written up by any number of publications and heralded as a roadside attraction.

It was never reported whether any UFOs actually checked it out over the decades it existed, but Pendarvis was quoted as saying “Maybe another UFO came by and set the fire” when the place burned down in 2024 after a 30-year run.

The study said South Carolina has a 1.03% chance with odds of 1 in 97.

South Carolina ranked 29th in the country — not too high, not too low.

New Hampshire - 2% or 1 in 50 odds.

“New Hampshire ranks #1 in the U.S. because people there report UFO sightings more often than anywhere else — about 24 sightings per 100,000 residents,” the report said.

Idaho - 1.9% or 1 in 53

Vermont - 1.79% or 1 in 56

Maine - 1.78% or 1 in 56

Oregon - 1.68% or 1 in 60

“In several top states, a large share of sightings involve close encounters. In Idaho, Vermont, Oregon, and Wyoming, roughly 1 in 5 reports includes claims like missing time or direct contact,” the report said.

Florida - 1 in 80 odds

Alabama - 1 in 99

Mississippi - 1 in 127

Tennessee - 1 in 96

Wyoming residents are more often reported abduction-style experiences.

California, meanwhile, recorded nearly 17,000 sightings since 2019, but the state's large population leaves it outside the top 15.

New Mexico with 1 in 431 odds. This despite the state being the site of the renowned Roswell, New Mexico, which launched UFO conspiracy theories about the United States military finding a crashed UFO.

The United States Army Air Forces said it had recovered a flying disc, headlines screamed around the world and the announcement was retracted within a day.

They said instead it was a weather balloon, but the UFO rumor never died, prompting books, movies and TV shows.

Maybe that's why the aliens never came back.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk was 'time traveller'","https://www.jpost.com/omg/viral-news-from-the-web/article-883608","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:26:21 GMT","

Controversial US political commentator Candace Owens claimed in a recent episode of her podcast that the late activist Charlie Kirk told her that he was a “time traveler,” and knew that he would die young.

“It is an absolute fact that Charlie Kirk thought that he was a time traveler. He told me he was a time traveler. Repeatedly,” she claimed.

Owens told listeners that “awareness is the threat,” asserting that unnamed agencies were “in some sort of a panic” as she recounted alleged private conversations with Kirk about his fears and unusual experiences.

Owens also claimed that “the agents that surrounded him throughout his entire life” knew he would die young as well. The alleged agents also, according to Owens, sent Kirk to an “X-Men school” because his mother wouldn't allow them to drug him.

She added that even before reaching substantial levels of fame, Kirk “was required to have security on him at all times,” which she claimed was because he had been “marked since he was a child.”

Owens did not provide evidence for the assertions, which she framed within broader conspiracy themes, including an accusation that the “deep state” removed the cornucopia from the Fruit of the Loom brand logo.

Owens's claims about both Kirk's assasination and the missing cornucopia are references to the CIA's “Project Looking Glass,” a conspiracy theory about a secret US military time-viewing project linked to the Mandela Effect - a phenomenon where large groups of people share the same false memory.

While Owens cast Kirk's private remarks as signs of foreknowledge and government interest, she offered no documents, dates, or witnesses to substantiate the claims. Authorities have released case materials related to proceedings surrounding Kirk's killing, but public records do not support the specific assertions aired on the podcast.

President Donald Trump on Friday said he'd prefer to keep National Economic Council Director Hassett in his position as top economic advisor, a statement that could change the dynamic in the race to see who will replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.

During an appearance in the White House, Trump said, ""I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today.""

""I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth, he added.

Hassett has been considered a leading contender to take the central bank reigns, competing closely with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and has indicated he will replace Powell when his term as chair ends in May. Hassett and Warsh are two of five finalists for the position, a group that also includes current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.

Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.

Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Powell's term as chair ends in May.

Turning to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, ""We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out.""

After Trump spoke, traders on predictions market site Kalshi raised their bets to a 60% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared to just 16% for Hassett and 14% for Waller. 

As recently as Wednesday, Warsh and Hassett were in a near dead heat.

""It is not certain this is a definitive signal – the President has given various signals at various times and appears to enjoy the drama of this Celebrity Apprentice season – but it does look as if the former Fed governor is for the first time the clear front-runner,"" wrote Krishna Guha, head global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.

Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh leading Hassett 60% to 15% and Waller at 13%. Traders are giving little odds to BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, the other two candidates considered finalists. 

Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday as investors monitored the economic outlook and geopolitical concerns.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield gained more than 3 basis points to 4.197%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury advanced more than 2 basis points to 3.588%. The 30-year Treasury yield was also more than 2 basis points higher at 4.808%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors have been concerned about geopolitical uncertainty through the week, with President Donald Trump insistent on taking ownership of Greenland — a self-governing Danish territory — saying it's critical to U.S. national security. On Friday, the president floated imposing tariffs on countries ""if they don't go along with Greenland.""

A high-stakes meeting on Wednesday between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland over the Arctic island's future ended without a diplomatic solution, but talks are expected to continue. 

Meanwhile, U.S.-Iran tensions have eased after Trump signaled he was holding off on military strikes, citing reports that Iran had reduced its violent crackdown on protesters. 

Also this week, a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has created worries about the Fed's independence, and whether it might be politically influenced. Trump said Friday that he'd like to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his position, a statement that boosted prediction market bets of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh becoming the next Fed chair.

It's quiet on the economic data front, but investors are looking to the week ahead when the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will be released and offer fresh insights on the economy. 

The bond market will be closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day.

As hospitals scramble and country reaches record-breaking rates of illness, officials cast doubt on flu shot's necessity

As the US reaches record-breaking rates of illness and hospitals scramble to care for flu patients, officials have stopped fully recommending the flu shot, casting doubt on the necessity and effectiveness of the vaccine.

“We are in the midst of a very severe flu season,” said Seema Lakdawala, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory School of Medicine. Despite this, the US is dismantling many of its vaccine recommendations. Flu vaccine recommendations for children changed in early January to “shared clinical decision-making”, which has typically meant a provider recommends the shot.

When asked whether the new restrictions would lead to fewer children getting vaccinated against the flu, “maybe that's a better thing”, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime vaccine critic, told CBS News last week. “There is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalizations or death in children,” Kennedy claimed, despite extensive studies, including from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), showing the effectiveness of the flu shot.

His comments come after Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, cast doubt on how well flu vaccines work.

“Every year, there's a flu vaccine. It doesn't always work very well. That's why it's been controversial of late,” Oz said on Newsmax. He instead recommended that Americans “take care” of themselves, so they can “overwhelm” the flu when they encounter it.

CDC press statements have said “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one”, urging people to consult with their doctors to understand “the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines”. Unlike in previous years, there have been no health advisory notices from the CDC on the new variant, top health officials haven't publicly received vaccines and a successful campaign called “Wild to Mild” was halted and not resumed.

The dominant flu strain in the US is H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness, and this particular variant, subclade K, has mutated to get around immune defenses, which means more people may be susceptible to the flu than usual. The last time H3N2 spread through the US, in 2017-18, about 51,000 people died, making it the most severe flu season in recent years.

So far this year, there have been about 15m illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths from the flu, the CDC estimated in its weekly update on 9 January – with deaths including at least 17 children . “There is still time to get vaccinated against flu this season,” the CDC concluded in the report, in sharp relief to public statements by health officials and new restrictions on the shots.

In an earlier CDC report, about 8.2% of visits to the doctor were for flu-like respiratory illnesses – the highest rate for this point in the season since the 1997-98 season. That rate fell slightly to 7.2% last week, but the CDC cautioned that the drop could be due to delays in reporting or seeking care because of the holidays. Some health systems are requiring providers to wear face masks amid surging cases. New York, for instance, logged the most hospitalizations it has ever seen in the week ending 27 December.

“The flu can be extremely, extremely severe. It can be really scary,” said Megan Berman, professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and faculty with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.

Berman has seen an influx of patients who need to be hospitalized, and “what they all had in common is actually they had not been vaccinated”. Even patients who have already gotten cases of flu A would still benefit from vaccines, she said, because there was often a double peak in flu season with flu B, which the vaccine also protects against.

Early data from the UK, where flu season started early and now seems to be abating, shows that the vaccine is still effective at preventing hospitalizations: 70-75% effective in children and 30-40% effective in adults, a rate similar to previous flu shots.

While the flu shot may not stop transmission, it is still very effective at preventing severe illness, Lakdawala said. But only 42.5% of children and 43.5% of adults have received the shot this year, according to the CDC. Vaccination rates have fallen in recent years after reaching a high of 63.7% of children and 48.4% of adults in 2019-20 – more than half of the US population.

Covid rates are also high, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasing, putting more pressure on hospitals. Both of those childhood shots also saw recent restrictions.

The changes in the recommendations will probably further dampen vaccination rates because it “gives the message that it's not important”, Berman said. Yet “nothing has changed from the science, and I know that physicians are still strongly recommending it to everyone six months and older … Children should not be dying from a preventable illness.”

Antiviral treatments for flu have also fallen in recent years. About 79% of hospitalized flu patients in 2022-23 received antivirals, compared with 90% in 2018-19. The drop was especially pronounced in children; three out of five children hospitalized for the flu in 2022-23 received the medications, compared with four out of five in 2018-19. Only 28% of children under age five who are sick enough with the flu to see a doctor are prescribed antivirals, and only 32% of children who seek care for flu in emergency departments receive the treatments, the CDC says.

At the same time, mortality among children is rising, with nearly 300 children dying from the flu last season – the most deaths from the flu outside of a pandemic since the CDC started keeping track.

If a patient is sick enough to seek care from a doctor, they should receive antivirals, Berman said, and so should patients with underlying medical conditions, pregnant people and older people. There are four antiviral medications for the flu, and they all work well against this variant. It's best to start them as soon as possible after testing positive.

There's also a risk, as H5N1 bird flu continues to devastate flocks across the US, of two flu variants mixing to create another, deadlier variant, a process called reassortment.

“What I worry about most with bird flu is, in five years, it will have reassorted to something else,” Lakdawala said.

There are effective ways to control the spread of the flu, Lakdawala said, noting “we have every tool in our arsenal” and “we should use them when anyone's sick”. In addition to getting vaccinated and taking antivirals, people can wear face masks, improve ventilation, wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when they are sick to keep the flu in check.

“We learned something really important about flu transmission during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that is that we can control it. We actually have the capacity to control flu disease burden,” Lakdawala said.

Berman noted that “people are not helpless”, adding: “We can do something.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Between the 1930s and the 1970s, German ethnologist Hans Himmelheber journeyed across the Ivory Coast, amassing a collection of ritual objects.

Today, about 100 pieces he bought from local artists — along with 15,000 photographs and a dozen films — have been handed back to their country of origin.

Masterpieces from the Senufo, Dan, Baoule and Guro peoples, as well as everyday objects, are now on show in the cities of Abidjan and Man.

Ivorian schoolchildren crowd around masks, finely carved turtles and ceremonial spoons once admired by visitors of Zurich's Rietberg Museum.

They have flocked to the Himmelheber archive at the Adama Toungara museum in Abidjan.

Running until March 8, the exhibit retraces the journeys made by the researcher, who died in 2003.

It also features 24 of the 107 returned objects, alongside thousands of digitized photos and films shot by Himmelheber.

Among the highlights: a striking “wabele” hood mask and a Dan runner's mask with delicate feminine features.

The return of cultural artifacts taken from former colonies in Africa and elsewhere has become a sensitive issue, with museums, institutions and collectors in Europe and the US facing pressure to give them back.

Although Himmelheber “always bought his pieces... we cannot ignore the colonial context that sometimes forced people to sell,” Rietberg Museum Africa and Oceania collections head Michaela Oberhofer said.

Although returns of African cultural heritage are increasing, experts said such gestures remain rare.

“This donation is key to diversifying our collections,” said Francis Tagro, director of Abidjan's Museum of Civilizations, set to reopen this year after renovations.

Switzerland and Ivory Coast last year signed a deal on cultural asset returns.

Alongside the restitution, research projects and workshops were funded.

Himmelheber's photos and films were screened in 16 Dan villages he often visited, shown to younger generations.

“Some people recognized their ancestors — it was very moving,” Oberhofer said.

A meticulous researcher, Himmelheber documented artists' techniques and styles during his travels.

“African art is anonymized,” said his son, Eberhard Fischer. “But my father treated artists as seriously as Picasso or Paul Klee.”

Oberhofer said Himmelheber's trips also revealed ornate loom pulleys and pottery, challenging stereotypes that African art is “limited to masks and figures.”

Ivory Coast now awaits the return of the Djidji Ayokwe “talking drum,” which French colonial troops took in 1916.

Its return was approved by the French parliament in July last year.

Seoul quickly denied the accusation, but the development is likely to further dim prospects for its efforts to restore ties with Pyongyang.
North Korean forces used special electronic warfare assets on Sunday to bring down a South Korean drone flying over North Korea's border town. 
The drone was equipped with two cameras that filmed unspecified areas, the General Staff of the North Korean People's Army said in a statement.

The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk's social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.

U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Jan. 16 that he may impose tariffs on countries that do not back his claim on Greenland.

""I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,"" Trump said in the White House while mentioning his past threats about tariffs on European pharmaceuticals.

Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly laid claim to Greenland, Denmark's semiautonomous island that plays a strategic role in access to the Arctic region. Trump has also often wielded tariffs as a tool of geopolitical coercion.

As Danish and Greenlandic authorities reject Washington's offer to buy the island, the White House has not ruled out the use of military force, despite Denmark being a NATO ally.

Earlier this week, top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, met Danish and Greenlandic officials, but the talks failed to achieve a breakthrough.

In the meantime, small groups of European soldiers began arriving in Greenland as European allies voiced support for the territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland.

Trump has previously accused Copenhagen of not investing enough in the island's security and claimed that, unless the U.S. takes control of Greenland, Russia and China will.

European allies, in turn, warned that any U.S. attempt to seize the island by force could lead to the breakdown in transatlantic relations and the end of NATO.

Greenland's strategic importance has grown as Arctic ice melts, opening new shipping routes and increasing access to mineral resources. The island, home to about 56,000 people, already hosts a U.S. military base.

This London greenhouse needs renovations. How can its tropical tenants move without dying in the process?

Even on an overcast day, it is hot in the all-glass Palm House at London's Kew Gardens. The clammy heat intensifies as you climb the spiral staircase in the graceful Victorian conservatory, up to the second-storey balcony, where you can overlook its jam-packed collection of tropical plants. You experience a different world up there, a pretechnological version of the now commonplace drone view, as your gaze rides over the tops of the arcing green palms. You're looking down on a thicket of plants and history. 

Just for the harrowing thrill of it, even if you're not a gardener, imagine that you are in charge of renovating this, the most famous tropical greenhouse in the world – the 177-year-old glass and wrought-iron Palm House, the greenly glowing centrepiece of London's Kew Gardens, one of the largest and most popular curated collections of tropical plants anywhere in the world (1,300 plants and 935 species in the glass house alone, a third of which are threatened), not to mention the living botanical record of the British Empire's rise and fall. 

To renovate the building, you first have to move all the vegetation out of the building. But very few of the rare and valuable tropical plants in the glass house can survive outside, even in England's mild-but-getting-hotter climate. 

The Palm House at Kew Gardens, opened in 1848, is a wrought-iron and glass contraption for simulating a tropical climate, insulated from the cold of London's winters.

You have to manoeuvre the exotics out of the Palm House – some of them are more than eight metres tall – and into warm, moist temporary quarters known as “decant houses.” 

Then you have to strip and clean and repaint and refurbish and rethink the national treasure sometimes known as “the stove of Kew,” replacing its complicated heating and watering colonics and its 16,000 panes of glass. 

In the course of doing that – and this is really important – you have to transform the Victorian relic into the prototype of the world's first carbon-neutral glass conservatory, all without destroying its heritage as a symbol of Britain's world domination. Then you have to move the plants back in. 

All that will take five years. Oh, and you need to grow backups, in case the transplants don't take. 

This is why Will Spoelstra, the Palm House's supervisor, has the wary look of a man trying to avoid being run over by a vehicle speeding in from an unforeseen direction. In addition to the usual sweaty overheating and hydration concerns of gardeners and botanists who specialize in “working under glass,” he has a lot on his mind. 

Mr. Spoelstra has worked at Kew for more than a decade, and has been planning the logistics of the renovation for several years. But the physical transfer of the plants began only last fall. 

So far, his team has identified plants whose roots can be containerized and moved by hand. That includes some specimens up to five metres in height. Larger plants will require a small gantry crane, but even then, the selection will be dictated by the height (eight metres) and space available in the temporary decant conservatories. As a result, many species will instead be propagated or regrown from seed, from cuttings or using “air layers,” where the stem of a tree is wounded and wrapped in damp moss to encourage new roots to form. 

Supervisor Will Spoelstra and his team must prioritize which plants to move and which to regrow so the collection can be reassembled in the renovated space.

The building's most famous residents are 175 species of palm that inspired centuries of exploitation as well as the Western world's obsession with everything warm, exotic, fecund and forbidden. They present particular problems to Mr. Spoelstra because “palms you can only really propagate from seed. No one's ever worked out how to do it otherwise.” 

A visitor asks, with a tinge of panic in his voice, whether that means regrowing them. 

“We've known this is likely to happen for a while, so we've been propagating for a while,” the ever-sanguine Mr. Spoelstra replies.

Several species are impossible to move because they are upholstered in piercing spines – such as Aiphanes eggersii, a pinnate palm that produced fruit at Kew for the first time this year. The conservatory's pine-like cycads – the most common plant on the planet back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth – are a whole other category of concern. 

The oldest cycad in the Palm Palace at Kew is Encephalartos altensteinii, first collected from South Africa in 1775. That's not a plant you want to accidentally kill. 

It looks like a giant earthworm (the trunk) in a spritzy party hat (the foliage). Its 30-centimetre-thick, 5.5 metre-long trunk is growing horizontally and is held up off the ground by metal braces. Mr. Spoelstra will have to clear an avenue in the Palm House to get it out and into temporary storage via wheeled scaffolding. The decant houses are already one-third full, and the physical renovation doesn't begin until 2027. Experts who specialize in moving large works of art have been advising Mr. Spoelstra.

Or there's the diabolical case of the ivory nut palm. Ivory nut palms can grow 25 metres tall, and are nearly impossible to move. A new one will have to be regrown for the renovated Palm House. But for that to happen, Kew's female ivory nut palm − nut palms are dioecious, that is, they come in male and female plants – has to produce some seed. For the palm to produce some seeds, you have to fertilize its flowers with some pollen from a male ivory nut palm. Kew, alas, does not have a male ivory nut palm.

“Can't you find a male?” the visitor asks. 

“They're not that easy to find,” Mr. Spoelstra mutters. Kew has, however, managed to cadge some male ivory-nut-palm pollen from a botanical centre in Singapore, with which Kew's gardeners will then manually pollinate their female. Please sigh contentedly here. 

Once the plants are relocated, the physical renovation of the storied edifice can begin. The Palm House, a shimmering example of the kind of Victorian architecture that later inspired the modernists, was almost demolished after the Second World War (the government didn't want to pay for its upkeep), and has endured two major renovations. The last one was in 1987, and shut the Palm House for three years. 

Rust and algae are nuisances around the complex, but unavoidable in an environment this moist and hot.

The building's famous swanny two-storey wrought-iron structure is still structurally sound. (It was one of the first prefabricated edifices ever built.) But rust and algae and peeling, and especially its energy inefficiency, require constant attention. Its aforementioned 16,000 panes of glass (which revitalized the British glass industry when they were first designed specifically for Kew in the 1840s) have to be replaced with infinitely more energy-efficient glass that nevertheless doesn't interfere with the tropical plants' lust for light and heat. The glass is cleaned every two years on the outside by professional window washers and two to three times more a year on the inside by staff. Palms that have burst through the glass roof have had to be felled. Some of the trees that have to be cut down for the renovation will be saved for scientific research; most will be composted.

The conservatory's soil will have to be tested and repacked; a new humidifying system, new rainwater tanks and a costly reverse-osmosis system will be installed. (The plants are watered every day.) The greenhouse's famous heating system – staunch hot-water pipes that run under its iron grille floors and keep the all-glass Palm House no cooler than 19 degrees at night and preferably under 30 during the day – will be replaced. (Temperatures in London reached 40 C in 2022.) So will its notorious gas-fired boilers (which replaced their coal-fired cousins) located roughly 180 metres away, via underground tunnel, under a chimney and water tank disguised as a Romanesque campanile. The refurbished Palm House will henceforth stay hot via complicated new air-source heat pumps. 

The goal of the renovations is to lighten the energy load enough that it is a net consumer of carbon dioxide.

When Queen Victoria declared the Palm House open in 1848, it was touted all over the world as a pinnacle of British engineering: the glass, the wrought iron, the lightweight construction, to say nothing of what it housed and kept alive, and how. The hope is that, postrenovation, the Palm House will be revered once again – not just carbon-neutral but carbon-negative, and therefore climate positive, by 2030. 

“If we can make a huge glass house in London net zero at 28 degrees constant year round, anyone can,” Rebecca Munro, Kew's executive director of development, told me on one of my visits to the garden last October. Ms. Munro is fundraising the £60-million that the Palm House redesign is projected to cost, as well as the third of Kew's £130-million annual budget that derives from philanthropic donations. 

If it all works as planned, the Palm House will have been transformed from a monument to the glory of imperialism and empire, into an admonishment of the same – a practical, working example of what we can do to reverse the effects of our careless ambition. 

Raoul Curtis-Machin, Kew's new executive director of gardens, points out that discussions about the Palm House's future have been wide-ranging. “Is it sustainable to be taking these tropical palms, putting them in a heated greenhouse, paying a fortune for piping and hot water?” He has a Scottish accent as thick as a Pringle sweater. 

“It's kind of crazy. But the flip side is that a big percentage of our population would never get the chance to see these plants. And when you want to talk about conservation, if people can see them, they make a direct link, and build a relationship and understand the need to conserve them. So if we can heat a palm house and still make that structure sustainable, it's win-win.” 

Ms. Munro and Mr. Curtis-Machin are now building a global network of glass conservatories awaiting the results of the experiment at Kew. (It's too late for downtown Toronto: The interior of the gorgeous tropical conservatory at Allan Gardens was cleared of plants in 2022 and is now rented out as an empty space for weddings.) 

The Palm House was recently listed as a World Heritage site. No wonder: Kew and its vast seed bank at its sister site at Wakehurst comprise 2.5 billion living seeds and 40,000 species of wild plant. A glass house is a surprisingly serious place, especially in London, where nothing happens without the past having something to say about it.

Dutch House, built as a silk merchant's mansion in 1631, was here long before the Hanoverian Royal Family took a liking to this area and made it into Kew Palace.

The Palm House protects palms and tropical plants, but its most lasting stock has been fantasy. What became Kew Gardens – 130 hectares in the borough of Richmond in London's west end, directly under the steadily roaring landing path of Heathrow airport – was first cobbled together from a string of royal properties in 1789. Capability Brown's landscape garden movement was taking root nearby. 

The acreage was further developed by Princess Augusta, the mother of George III, the so-called mad king. George used the royal pleasure grounds and what is now known as Kew Palace to recover from his bouts of illness, which may have been porphyria or bipolar disorder, or some combination thereof. 

(How mad was George III? He certainly had bouts of mania. On the other hand, while I was visiting Kew, Donald Trump retweeted a meme of himself wearing a crown and piloting a jet that dumped tons of excrement on American protesters, so you be the judge.)

George built up Kew's exotic plant collection with the help of his pal Sir Joseph Banks, the doyen of natural science in Great Britain: By 1768, Kew had collected 3,400 species. (It boasts 27,000 today – not bad, given that Brazil, the most biodiverse country on Earth, today supports 46,000 known plant species.)

But the gardens fell into disrepair after George's death in 1820, and especially after the brutally cold winter of 1838, one of the rare years the Thames froze over. Kew's future was also in peril as political factions fought for its dissolution. The issue, then as now, was money: Was it reasonable that the government should spend £35,000 on palm trees when impoverished and hungry Irish were flocking to London? Was preserving nature for future generations as important as the present?

It wasn't until after young Queen Victoria took the throne in 1837 that Kew was spared. She was initially of a mind to dismantle the garden, until she was persuaded it would be a big hit with the public, thanks in part to the endless politicking and finagling of its first director, Sir Joseph Hooker. Hooker was one of a string of Scots who have run Kew since its earliest days. A perfect storm of influences made Kew a success – not least the fact that, while Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris and Berlin had glass-housed botanical gardens, London didn't, even though it was the hub of the British Empire, whose far-flung tropical colonies produced everything from rubber and ginger to pepper and the palm oil used to lubricate British railways. 

Plus – as Kate Teltscher, the author of Palace of Palms, an exceptionally readable history of Kew, explained to me recently – “particularly in the 1850s, there is the development of suburbs and middle classes who want nice villas with gardens.” The new middle class's longings were inflamed by a huge boom in gardening magazines, which in turn advertised Britain's nascent plant nurseries. 

The first visitors to the Palm House showed up in 1848. By 1851, half a million of them flocked through the gates every year, at a penny a person: A half day at Kew was considered a taste of the exotic and a healthful jaunt into the country, away from the filth and soot and tuberculosis of industrializing London. These days, 2.5 million people a year pay as much as £25 each to visit Kew and Wakehurst. Many of them swing by the Palm House.

The 2030s will also be the bicentennial of Victoria's coronation, a turning point in Kew's history. She had planned to dismantle it, until courtiers convinced her otherwise.Charles Robert Leslie, c. 1897/Library of Congress

The hot and humid second-storey balcony walk inside the Palm House was Queen Victoria's favourite way to see it. 

Unexpected details present themselves. For instance, looking down, you suddenly understand that most bald men in England shave their heads. Everything else you can see above and below and in front of you is a wall of variegated green leaves in a full catalogue of shapes and pointiness and widths. Some are pinnate spears, and some are fat palmate fingers. Some are like peninsulas, and some are like wild haircuts. They have exotic, difficult names, such as Heliconia bihai x spathocircinata “Cinnamon Twist.” 

Voices float up as visitors below react to what they are seeing: “Banana,” someone will say, and then your mind reels through what the Palm House has taught you about bananas. They were unknown in Britain when the Palm House was built; today, Brits eat five billion bananas a year (about two a week, each), making them Britain's favourite “healthy snack.” 

Those, of course are Cavendish bananas, the only kind most of us eat; they have no seeds and can only be propagated from cuttings, which means they all have the same immune systems, which is why they are all vulnerable to the vein-throttling TR4 fungus, and why, last February, a new resistant strain, the QCAV-4, became the world's first genetically modified banana approved for cultivation. 

Specimens at Kew are not purely for show – studying them gives researchers new insights into plant biodiversity, flood mitigation and climate change.

You look down upon Arabica coffee plants and gorgeous, thick barkless bamboos – actually a grass that Kew researchers are studying for its flood-prevention attributes – that grow 2.5 metres every 16 days in the Palm House and reach 25 metres in the wild. And, of course, there are the palms, the princes of the plant kingdom as they were once called, ever beseeching and reaching toward you. No wonder the Christians considered them the tree of life and Jesus. 

Everything is wet and dripping and moist and pinging. Sound is amplified. Every once in a while, you hear the song of a bird that has sneaked under the glass. Oh, look, a tamarind tree: Its fruit is the basis of Worcestershire sauce. It's so hot and humid I am drenched after 35 minutes. My notebooks are disintegrating in my hands. In any event, the upper storey of Kew's Palm House is where you feel the fantasy of the place, as it transports you instantly, and physically, beyond your culture, beyond where you are and who you are, beyond commerce, even, into the strange botanical Other.

The experience is unchanged since Victoria's time, but its meaning is now more urgent. The Palm House was a monument to British national pride. These days, it's an international call to climate-change action. (In the Amazon alone in 2024, fires attributed to climate change consumed an area larger than California.) 

“Because the scale of climate change and biodiversity loss cut across national boundaries,” Kate Teltscher will tell you, “botanic gardens these days tend to be about saving the world from itself, from mankind.”

Up above it all, on the glassed-in walkway of the second storey of the world-famous building that first showed white Europeans what robust riches were waiting to be exploited in the steamy equatorial belly of the Earth, you can be both the villain and the hero, colonizer and victim. Up there, it is very easy to feel as if you are standing on the demarcation line between the two sides of the global debate over climate change and how seriously it threatens us. 

Wherever you are in Kew Gardens, the stately Palm House draws you toward it, and makes you want to get inside, to feel the heat and experience the exotic and often endangered botanical otherness of the rest of the Earth. Half an hour later, you are just as eager to leave. You step outside, shuck your jacket off your shoulders to feel the cool outdoor air on your neck, and listen as the steady roar of overhead jets landing at nearby Heathrow rises in your ears. But as soon as you step outside, you ask yourself when you'll be able to go back in again.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the title of Kate Teltscher's book Palace of Palms.

Coyotes, bats and pigeons, oh my: Canadian cities are full of wildlife. How can we better accommodate these species? City Space asked environmental studies professor Peter Alagona and ecologist Erica Spotswood for their ideas.

Canada had a China strategy, and it was aligned with that of our main ally and partner. 

Then U.S. President Donald Trump arrived and blew up everything.

That's the background to Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit to Beijing. 

Like Canadians cutting back on trips to the United States, Mr. Carney is making alternative travel plans because of an abrupt change in the weather in Canada's preferred destination. 

Opinion: How Canada can use China to deliver a counterpunch to Trump

A winter sojourn in Beijing has been forced on Canada because our favourite all-season resort down south has undergone an abrupt change in management. 

Mr. Trump has spent the past year telling his best customer that he regards us with something between indifference and hostility. He keeps saying that doesn't want our cars, he doesn't want our steel, he doesn't need a free-trade agreement with us and he'd like us as the 51st state.

He's taken in the welcome mat and wants us to be the doormat. Other American allies have received similar rhetoric, and higher tariffs.

All of which is destroying the possibility of a common front against the Chinese dumping machine. 

Beijing's economic aim is similar to MAGA's – but its strategy has been far more thoughtful and patient. 

Its goal is making China the world's pre-eminent manufacturing power, through an industrial policy of subsidies, trade barriers and currency suppression. It is dumping what are effectively subsidized goods on every other country, which eliminates producers elsewhere. Once an assembly plant in Europe, or Canada, or Michigan is put out of business by a Chinese competitor, it's gone forever. 

Campbell Clark: Carney needs to be wary of the same old China ‘reset' mirage

The strategy takes advantage of free-market rules in the rest of world to deindustrialize the rest of the world. Economists have described it as the China Shock. Other formerly closed economies entered the global free trading system without ill effects, but China's impact has been different – because it set out to be different.

Last year, China ran a US$1.2-trillion trade surplus. If Beijing has its way, this year's figure will be higher, with meagre imports tilting even more to raw materials, and even more exports of manufactured goods.

China is now the dominant maker of almost everything, except for a shrinking list of high tech and specialized goods. To take one example, a quarter-century ago, Canada produced more cars than China. In 2024, China made more motor vehicles than the U.S., Japan, Germany, South Korea and Canada – combined.

One possible response to the Chinese strategy is let it happen. And that has mostly been the response until now. If the Chinese want to export below-cost goods, putting our factories out of business in the process, why not let them? Artificially suppressed Chinese prices are, at least in the short term, subsidizing Western living standards.

But in the long run, we'll end up with Beijing's autocratic regime dominating the world, militarily and economically, through a stranglehold on manufacturing.

Lawrence Martin: Rebuilding relations with China is a gamble Mark Carney has to take

In response, the free-market democracies had begun to band together to push back – building walls against Chinese industrial strategy and trying to put some limits on the abuse of free trade. That's why Canada brought in a 100-per-cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, matching a similar U.S. tariff. The European Union also imposed tariffs of up to 35 per cent on Chinese EVs in 2024.

The U.S. is the logical leader of this movement, and not just in cars. Canada, Australia, the EU, Britain, Japan, South Korea and others are all concerned about China's impact on their industries, and the implications for their long-term security.

Mr. Carney's trip to China has to be understood in this context. What had been a solidifying common front against Beijing has turned into something close to the opposite. 

The reason for the turn is that Mr. Trump is far more interested in attacking erstwhile allies than in making common cause. He's destroying the military and economic alliance system and making the common front strategy untenable. 

Opinion: Instead of a China pivot, how about we start building at home?

He appears to not grasp that U.S. manufacturers are more viable and competitive with China if they have larger markets for sales and production, which can only come through mutually beneficial co-operation with countries that are not China. 

The auto industry, with cars jointly made and sold on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border, is a classic example. Ditto for steel, aluminum, wood products, aircraft – the list is long.

But Mr. Trump, by pursuing a predatory divide-and-conquer strategy against alleged allies, is empowering Beijing's own moves to divide and conquer those same countries. 

That leaves Canada out in the cold. 

Hence Mr. Carney's winter trip to frigid Beijing, in a bid to thaw relations with a country that, in a warmer North American climate, we'd be distancing ourselves from.

A federal appeals court on Thursday delivered the Trump administration a victory in its efforts to deport Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, opening the door for his rearrest. Khalil was a graduate student at Columbia University when he was arrested in March and detained for months. He missed the birth of his son, Deen, while in detention. “The Trump administration is trying everything in its power to come after me, to put the full weight of the government to actually make an example out of me,” Khalil tells Democracy Now! “The U.S. government has not brought a shred of evidence that I broke any laws.”

The appeals court did not weigh in on the constitutional merits, instead saying Khalil should have appealed his removal order in immigration court before going to a federal judge. “What people need to understand is the immigration courts are not real courts,” says Baher Azmy, a member of Khalil's legal team. “They're part of the executive branch.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We want to turn to another issue. A federal appeals court has reversed a ruling that freed the Palestinian activist, the Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from a Louisiana ICE jail in June. Advocates fear the move could pave the way for the Trump administration to rearrest and deport him.

Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and jailed in March for taking part in campus protests at Columbia University as a graduate student. He was the first noncitizen student targeted and arrested by the Trump administration for pro-Palestine speech, detained for months, first in New Jersey, then in Louisiana, before a federal district judge in New Jersey granted a habeas petition in his case, saying his constitutional rights had likely been violated. Now in a split two-to-one decision, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned that ruling on jurisdictional grounds, saying Khalil should have first appealed his removal in immigration court.

For more, we're still joined by Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as well as Mahmoud Khalil himself, who's joining us via Zoom.

Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Mahmoud. Can you talk about your response to the judge's decision, and what this means for you and your family, your wife and your baby, Deen, who was born while you were imprisoned in Louisiana?

MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, this ruling is absolutely disappointing. This administration, the Trump administration, is trying everything in its power to come after me, to put the full weight of the government to actually make an example out of me. And this means that I will be separated from my U.S. wife and son, who both were born in this country. And just, like, it underscores how this administration is weaponizing the legal system, how fragile due process can be when our rights are treated as conditional rather than guaranteed. And I must be clear: Like, it's absolutely — I have an amazing team. You have Baher with you in the studio. We're going to explore every avenue until we feel vindicated.

Yet this administration will continue to go to these ideological judges to get rulings in their favor. And basically, as you said, what they want me to do is to wait for an immigration process that's fully completed — fully controlled by the Trump administration to get justice from this, from this process, which, as we know, this wouldn't happen, that this “immigration judge,” quote-unquote, will not let us develop our case to bring it on appeal. So, imagine that I have to wait to do that. And 10 months now after my detention, the U.S. government has not brought a shred of evidence that I broke any laws, that I spoke anything in support of terrorist organizations, yet they continue to weaponize the legal system.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Mahmoud, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has claimed that your very presence spreads antisemitism, your very presence in this country. How do you — how do you respond to this Trump administration narrative that they've created about you?

MAHMOUD KHALIL: No, I mean, this is an administration that spreads hate. This is an administration that actually embraces the actual antisemites, that supports the neo-Nazi parties across Europe, to come and claim that my presence here is about antisemitism. It's not. You know, I'm here to support Palestinian rights, the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people for their self-determination and liberation.

And again, we told them we want to see them in court, and that's what they don't want to do. They want to take this case into immigration court, which they fully control, so we don't have to present — or, they don't have to present any evidence. And as Judge Young yesterday, in another case in Massachusetts, said, that what happened in this case is essentially an unconstitutional conspiracy between Rubio himself and Noem, the secretary of homeland security, to pick up certain people, to twist the laws and to go after people they don't like. This is a judge, a Reagan appointee judge, who said that, that they are conspiring to do that, to make an example out of me, so they chill the speech of everyone in this country, regardless of their — regardless of their status.

AMY GOODMAN: So, you were the first of the students to be arrested. Then there was Mohsen Mahdawi, who's now a Columbia graduate student. There was Rümeysa Öztürk, who was a Tufts graduate student — all released. You have filed a $20 million lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming you were falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted, deliberately smeared. And in a case, Judge William Young called Mr. Trump an authoritarian and said the administration's actions targeting noncitizen student protesters violated the First Amendment. That decision only applies to members of two academic organizations in the case. If you can respond to that, Baher? And, Mahmoud, if you can respond to this lawsuit that you have filed against the Trump administration? Start with Mahmoud.

MAHMOUD KHALIL: Absolutely. I mean, we're seeking accountability for all the injustices that happened against me and against other students. And this administration needs to pay for all these lawless actions that they are committing. So, this is just like one action towards that end. And this is why they are retaliating against me, because I'm also standing up against their actions, and they don't like that. They want people to just submit to their authoritarian practices and to their lawlessness, which I will not. I will not make that happen. I will continue my advocacy until Palestine is free.

AMY GOODMAN: How do you keep Mahmoud Khalil free, Baher?

BAHER AZMY: Well, just to reassure everyone, this decision, taking away jurisdiction from the district court, is not — doesn't immediately go into effect. So, the order releasing him is still in effect and will be in effect until the appeals process is exhausted. And we have a number of legal options to continue to seek to revise or reverse this split two-to-one decision, which comes over a very persuasive dissent and which is contrary to decisions in other courts of appeals.

But, ultimately, Judge Young is right. This is an authoritarian action by this government. He also talked about how Rubio and others have a fear of freedom. Imagine being so cowardly and ashamed of the First Amendment that rather take on the speech that you disagree with, you try and imprison those who dissent from U.S. foreign policy. That's the classic kind of extrajudicial detention or arbitrary detention that's the hallmark of autocratic regimes.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But, Baher, this whole issue of Judge Young's decision on the free speech rights of noncitizens, the appeals panel claiming that he lacked subject matter jurisdiction, could you explain the logic of that?

BAHER AZMY: Yeah. So, to be clear, the appeals court in — headquartered in Philadelphia did not take on the illegality of the detention, which basically every court that has reviewed this policy has found unconstitutional. It cited a technical jurisdictional provision of the immigration laws to say that the federal court, which is a constitutional court, cannot hear these claims; it has to be put through the immigration process and the immigration courts. But what people need to understand is the immigration courts are not real courts. They're part of the executive branch. That's why we wanted our constitutional claims to be heard in a real court, a real constitutional court. And, you know, that's where these kind of constitutional claims can be, not in a court that rubber stamps the executive branch's policies.

AMY GOODMAN: Just going to end this segment with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani posting on social media, quote, “Last year's arrest of Mahmoud Khalil was more than just a chilling act of political repression, it was an attack on all of our constitutional rights. Now, as the crackdown on pro-Palestinian free speech continues, Mahmoud is being threatened with rearrest. Mahmoud is free — and must remain free,” the mayor of New York City said. That's Zohran Mamdani. Your final response, Mahmoud Khalil, as you sit here in New York City now free man?

MAHMOUD KHALIL: You know, I would say, like, this is — all these attempts are just to really distract us from what's really happening, which is Israel's genocide in Gaza and Israel's action against Palestinians in whole of Palestine, and also to distract from the fact that this administration, just two days ago, sent $3.3 billion to Israel, from our money, from our tax money. And this is why I was protesting, and this is why I will continue to protest.

AMY GOODMAN: Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, Mahmoud Khalil, and Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.

Coming up, we speak to the Palestinian American director and actress Cherien Dabis. Stay with us.

A Liberian man arrested after armed immigration agents used a battering ram to enter his Minneapolis home had checked in with federal authorities for years, his attorney said Tuesday.

A federal officer shot a man in the leg in Minneapolis after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle while trying to make an arrest Wednesday, officials said. The shooting is further heightening the sense of fear and anger radiating across the city a week after an immigration agent fatally shot a woman.

Demonstrators gathered outside of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis on Thursday night to protest the federal immigration crackdown there. President Donald Trump threatened to invoke an 1807 law and deploy troops to quell persistent protests. AP Video by David Martin.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Liberian man who has been shuttled in and out of custody since immigration agents in Minnesota broke down his door with a battering ram was released again Friday, hours after a routine check-in with authorities led to his second arrest.

The dramatic initial arrest of Garrison Gibson last weekend was captured on video. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled the arrest unlawful Thursday and freed him, but Gibson was detained again Friday when he appeared at an immigration office.

A few hours later, Gibson was free again, attorney Marc Prokosch said. 

“In the words of my client, he said that somebody at ICE said they bleeped up and so they re-released him this afternoon and so he's out of custody,” Prokosch said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Gibson's arrest is one of more than 2,500 made during a weekslong immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and St. Paul, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The operation has intensified and become more confrontational since the fatal shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7.

Gibson, 37, who fled the civil war in his West African home country as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what's known as an order of supervision, Prokosch said, and complied with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities. =

In his Thursday order, the judge agreed that officials violated regulations by not giving Gibson enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked. Prokosch said he was told by ICE that they are “now going through their proper channels” to revoke the order.

Meanwhile, tribal leaders and Native American rights organizations are advising anyone with a tribal ID to carry it with them when out in public in case they are approached by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

Native Americans across the U.S. have reported being stopped or detained by ICE, and tribal leaders are asking members to report these contacts.

Ben Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe in Oklahoma and chair of the United Indian Nations of Oklahoma, called the reports “deeply concerning”.

Organizers in Minneapolis have set up application booths in the city to assist people needing a tribal ID.

Democratic members of Congress held a local meeting Friday to hear from people who say they've had aggressive encounters with immigration agents. St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who is Hmong American, said people are walking around with their passports in case they are challenged, and she has received reports of ICE agents going from door to door “asking where the Asian people live.” Thousands of Hmong people, largely from the Southeast Asian nation of Laos, have settled in the United States since the 1970s.

Minneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls, all related to the fatal shooting of Good. Firefighters found what appeared to be two gunshot wounds in her right chest, one in her left forearm and a possible gunshot wound on the left side of her head, records show.

“They shot her, like, cause she wouldn't open her car door,” a caller said. “Point blank range in her car.”

Good, 37, was at the wheel of her Honda Pilot, which was partially blocking a street. Video showed an officer approached the SUV, demanded that she open the door and grabbed the handle.

Good began to pull forward and turned the vehicle's wheel to the right. Another ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, pulled his gun and fired at close range, jumping back as the SUV moved past him. DHS claims the agent shot Good in self-defense.

FBI Director Kash Patel said at least one person has been arrested for stealing property from an FBI vehicle in Minneapolis. The SUV was among government vehicles whose windows were broken Wednesday evening. Attorney General Pam Bondi said body armor and weapons were stolen.

President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, to send troops to suppress protests during immigration sweeps. Minnesota's attorney general said he would sue if the president acts.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don't back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital. 

Trump for months has insisted that the U.S. should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.” 

During an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals. 

“I may do that for Greenland too,” Trump said. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” he said.

He had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.

Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 

That encounter didn't resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views. 

European leaders have insisted that is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.

In Copenhagen, a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives met Friday with Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers, and with leaders including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

Delegation leader Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thanked the group's hosts for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said that “we had a strong and robust dialogue about how we extend that into the future.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said after meeting lawmakers that the visit reflected a strong relationship over decades and “it is one that we need to nurture.” She told reporters that “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset, and I think that's what you're hearing with this delegation.”

The tone contrasted with that emanating from the White House. Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. The White House hasn't ruled out taking the territory by force.

“We have heard so many lies, to be honest and so much exaggeration on the threats towards Greenland,” said Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic politician and member of the Danish parliament who took part in Friday's meetings. “And mostly, I would say the threats that we're seeing right now is from the U.S. side.”

Murkowski emphasized the role of Congress in spending and in conveying messages from constituents.

“I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, we do not think that that is a good idea,” she said.

Along with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Murkowski has introduced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit the use of U.S. Defense or State department funds to annex or take control of Greenland or the sovereign territory of any NATO member state without that ally's consent or authorization from the North Atlantic Council.

The dispute is looming large in the lives of Greenlanders. Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Tuesday that “if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.””

The chair of the Nuuk, Greenland-based Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents around 180,000 Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia's Chukotka region on international issues, said persistent statements from the White House that the U.S. must own Greenland offer “a clear picture of how the US administration views the people of Greenland, how the U.S. administration views Indigenous peoples, and peoples that are few in numbers.”

Sara Olsvig told The Associated Press in Nuuk that the issue is “how one of the biggest powers in the world views other peoples that are less powerful than them. And that really is concerning.” 

Indigenous Inuit in Greenland do not want to be colonized again, she said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to pardon former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez, a White House official said Friday.

Vázquez pleaded guilty last August to a campaign finance violation in a federal case that authorities say also involved a former FBI agent and a Venezuelan banker. Her sentencing was set for later this month.

Federal prosecutors had been seeking one year behind bars, something that Vázquez's attorneys opposed as they accused prosecutors of violating a guilty plea deal reached last year that saw previous charges including bribery and fraud dropped.

They noted that Vázquez had agreed to plead guilty to accepting a promise of a campaign contribution that was never received.

Attorneys for Vázquez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The official who confirmed the planned pardon indicated Trump saw the case as political prosecution and said the investigation into Vázquez, a Republican aligned with the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had begun 10 days after she endorsed Trump in 2020. The official wasn't authorized to reveal the news by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Vázquez, an attorney, was the U.S. territory's first former governor to plead guilty to a crime, specifically accepting a donation from a foreigner for her 2020 political campaign. 

She was arrested in August 2022 and accused of engaging in a bribery scheme from December 2019 through June 2020 while governor. At the time, she told reporters that she was innocent.




Authorities said that Puerto Rico's Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions was investigating an international bank owned by Venezuelan Julio Martín Herrera Velutini because of alleged suspicious transactions that had not been reported by the bank.

Authorities said Herrera and Mark Rossini, a former FBI agent who provided consulting services to Herrera, allegedly promised to support Vázquez's campaign if she dismissed the commissioner and appointing a new one of Herrera's choosing.

Authorities said Vázquez demanded the commissioner's resignation in February 2020 after allegedly accepting the bribery offer. She also was accused of appointing a new commissioner in May 2020: a former consultant for Herrera's bank. 

Vázquez was the second woman to serve as Puerto Rico's governor and the first former governor to face federal charges.

She was sworn in as governor in August 2019 after former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned following massive protests. Vázquez served until 2021, after losing the primaries of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party to former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi.

NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly a year into his second term, President Donald Trump's work on the economy hasn't lived up to the expectations of many people in his own party, according to a new AP-NORC survey.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds a significant gap between the economic leadership Americans remembered from Trump's first term and what they've gotten so far as he creates a stunning level of turmoil at home and abroad. 

Just 16% of Republicans say Trump has helped “a lot” in addressing the cost of living, down from 49% in April 2024, when an AP-NORC poll asked Americans the same question about his first term. 

At the same time, Republicans are overwhelmingly supportive of the president's leadership on immigration — even if some don't like his tactics.

John Candela, 64, who lives in New Rochelle, New York, said the cost of living hasn't improved for his family — his salary and bills remain the same as before. 

“Still paying $5 for Oreos,” he said. But he's willing to be patient: “I would expect it to be different by the time his four years are up.”

The poll reveals signs of weakness among consumers on the economy, especially Trump's core campaign promise to reduce costs. Inflation has cooled somewhat, but prices on many goods are higher than they were when the Republican president took office last January.

There is little sign overall, though, that the Republican base is abandoning Trump. The vast majority of Republicans, about 8 in 10, approve of his job performance, compared with 4 in 10 for adults overall. 

“I don't like the man as a human being. I don't like his brashness. I don't like his roughness. I don't like how he types out his texts all capital as if he's yelling at everybody. But what I approve of is what he is doing to try and get the country on track,” Candela said.

On various economic factors, Trump has yet to convince many of his supporters that he's changing things for the better.

Only about 4 in 10 Republicans overall say Trump has helped address the cost of living at least “a little” in his second term, while 79% said he helped address the issue that much in his first term, based on the 2024 poll. Just over half of Republicans in the new poll say Trump has helped create jobs in his second term; 85% said the same about his first term, including 62% who said he helped “a lot.” 

Only 26% of Republicans in the January survey say he's helped “a lot” on job creation in his second term.

And on health care, about one-third of Republicans say Trump has helped address costs at least “a little,” while 53% in the April 2024 poll said he helped reduce health care costs that much during his first term. Federal health care subsidies for more than 20 million Americans expired on Jan. 1, resulting in health care costs doubling or even tripling for many families. 

In the town of Waxahachie, Texas, south of Dallas, 28-year-old three-time Trump voter Ryan James Hughes, a children's pastor, doesn't see an improvement in his family's financial situation. He said the medical bills haven't declined.

But, he said, “I'm not looking to the government to secure my financial future.”

The new poll underscores that Republicans are largely getting what they want on immigration, even as some report concerns about the federal immigration agents who have flooded U.S. cities at Trump's direction. 

About 8 in 10 Republicans say Trump has helped at least “a little” on immigration and border security in his second term. That's similar to the share in the April 2024 poll that saw a positive effect from Trump's leadership on immigration and border security during his first term. 

Most Republicans say Trump has struck the right balance when it comes to deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, and about one-third think he hasn't gone far enough.

But Trump's approval on immigration has also slipped among Republicans over the past year, falling from 88% in March to 76% in the new poll.

Kevin Kellenbarger, 69, a three-time Trump voter who retired from a printing company, said his Christian faith led him to the Republican Party. The Lancaster, Ohio, resident thinks the president's immigration crackdown is necessary, though he expressed dissatisfaction at the recent killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis. 

“I don't like anybody getting killed, but it wasn't Trump's fault,” Kellenbarger said, adding that President Joe Biden, a Democrat, “let millions of people in. They have to be taken out.”

Several Republicans said in interviews they thought the aggressive tactics seen recently in Minneapolis went too far, suggesting that Trump should focus more on immigrants with criminal backgrounds as he promised during the campaign.

Overall, just 38% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's leadership on immigration, while 61% disapprove.

“These families that are being separated and they're just here to try to live the American dream,” said Republican Liz Gonzalez, 40, the daughter of Mexican immigrants and a self-employed rancher and farmer from Palestine, Texas. 

At the same time, Gonzalez said, she doesn't think people opposed to the crackdown should be interfering at all. “I think if they just let (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), you know, like the patrol people, do their jobs, then they would see it's not — it doesn't have to be chaos,” she said.

About two-thirds of Republicans say the country as a whole is “much” or “somewhat” better off than before Trump took office, but only about half say this about themselves and their family.

The broad sense that the country is moving in the right direction may be counteracting Republican dissatisfaction with the state of the economy. 

Phyllis Gilpin, a 62-year-old Republican from Booneville, Missouri, praised Trump's ability to “really listen to people.” But she doesn't love his personality. 

“He is very arrogant,” she said, expressing frustration about his name-calling. But she said the divisive politics go both ways: “I really, honestly, just wish that we could all just not be Democrat or Republican — just come together.”

Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's push for the GOP to win midterms or risk impeachment.

FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Eric Swalwell's gubernatorial campaign recently received almost $10,000 from the California-based office of a top Beijing law firm that has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, a Fox News Digital investigation found.

A filing that was released this week reveals that Swalwell's campaign received $9,999 from the DeHeng Law Offices PC on Dec. 30 and said that the office is based in Pleasanton, Calif. The law firm's website reveals that this office is their ""Silicon Valley Office"" and appears to only have one lawyer who works there.

Keliang ""Clay"" Zhu, who donated $5,000 to Swalwell's gubernatorial campaign this past November and previously donated over $10,000 to his House campaigns, is a partner at the law firm and is the only name listed for the ""Silicon Valley Office,"" according to their website.

A Fox News Digital review revealed that the law firm was founded as the China Law Office, which was a subsidiary firm established by the CCP's Ministry of Justice in the early 1990s before being renamed the DeHeng Law Offices in 1995. While the firm, which has over two dozen offices in China, portrays themselves as independent, the firm and its lawyers continue to have longstanding cooperation with the Chinese government's departments and major state-owned enterprises.

NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SOUND ALARM OVER CCP-LINKED LAND OWNERSHIP NEAR US MILITARY BASES: 'UNTHINKABLE'

Zhu, who is originally from China, touts several examples of how he has helped Chinese state-owned enterprises and other Chinese companies get a foothold in the United States, according to his bio. For example, he touts representing an ""investment fund of a major state-owned enterprise in acquiring majority shares in one data analytics software company in the Silicon Valley,"" which he valued at $100M. 

Another bio touts how he ""has assisted Chinese companies and funds to complete more than $9 billion investments in the fields of chips, unmanned vehicles, new energy, artificial intelligence, industrial automation, and biopharmaceuticals in the United States.""

""On behalf of Chinese enterprises, he has negotiated with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Treasury and other organizations for many times and achieved compliance plans, which greatly reduced the compliance risks for Chinese clients in the United States,"" the bio continued.

His bio also says he helped advise ""a governmental investment fund from Shenzhen for its compliance with CFIUS regulations in the U.S."" and represented ""WeChat users in a historic lawsuit that sued President Trump and successfully stopped his WeChat ban in 2020.""

At the time, Trump's first administration sounded the alarm over WeChat and said the ""data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information"" and was concerned that the CCP would use data to stalk dissenters or control messaging inside the United States, such as launching disinformation campaigns. Similar efforts to restrict WeChat have occurred in countries like Australia and India, according to the White House.

Zhu also has a history of fighting against state-level legislation aimed at preventing China's foreign land grab in the United States. 

After a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit intended to stop a Texas law banning Chinese nationals from owning or leasing land in the state, Zhu described the legislation as ""unfair, unconstitutional and un-American,"" according to AsAmNews, a daily news site focused on Asian-American and Pacific-Islander communities. Zhu similarly expressed disfavor with a Florida law meant to prevent individuals from countries that are foreign adversaries to the United States, such as China, from buying up land.

National security experts have sounded the alarm about China increasingly buying up farmland, property near military bases and other land near places of strategic value, which has been matched with state-level legislation in places like Texas, Florida, Arizona and more.   

Chinese land grabs in the United States have been an ongoing concern for lawmakers. Currently, Congress is considering multiple bills related to the matter, while almost two dozen states have already passed legislation to implement changes around foreign land purchases in their states.

""All Asian Americans will feel the stigma and the chilling effect created by this Florida law, just like the discriminatory laws did to our ancestors more than a hundred years ago,"" Zhu said in 2023 about an anti-land grab bill, according to a press release from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. ""We shall not go back."" 

Michael Lucci, a top China expert and the State Armor Action founder and CEO, sounded the alarm over the donations and called for Congress to reform the ""campaign finance laws to define donations made on behalf of foreign adversaries to be bribes.""

""Congressman Swalwell must finally stop playing footsie with America's foremost adversary: Communist China. First was his fiery romance with Fang Fang, a CCP spy, and now he's caught taking campaign checks from Communist China's favorite big law firm,"" Lucci told Fox News Digital. ""Congress must fix this problem by reforming campaign finance laws to define donations made on behalf of foreign adversaries to be bribes, and to impose criminal penalties upon those who make such donations. And Congress should go further by altogether prohibiting the acceptance of payment for any lobbying or other influence work on behalf of an American adversary, as the State of Texas did last year.""

Meanwhile, several of the firm's China-based partners have a history of working in Chinese politics, largely through the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is a ""key mechanism for multi-party cooperation and political consultation"" under the leadership of the CCP, according to the CPPCC website, and is a crucial tool of the United Front strategy to influence U.S. policy.

For example, Zhixu Wu, who is a ""Director and Senior Partner"" of the Kunming, China-based office of DeHeng Law Offices, is a member of the ""Standing Committee of the 13th Kunming Committee of the CPPCC"" and a member ""of the 12th Yunnan Committee of the CPPCC."" His bio also says he was previously awarded in 2017 with ""the title of ‘Excellent League Member' for the second assistance event of the National Lawyers Service Group,"" which was approved by the ""Eight Bureau of United Front Work Department of CPC Central Committee, Guidance Department of Lawyer's Notarization Work of the Ministry of Justice.""

Degang Zheng, a senior partner in the Shenzhen office, also touts his ties to the CPPCC, saying in his bio that he is a ""Member of the Executive Committee"" of the CPPCC's Shenzhen chapter. Hongli MA, a senior partner in the Hangzhou office, says he was recognized for ""Three consecutive years of outstanding CPPCC members in Binjiang District, Hangzhou in 2014, 2015, 2016.""

Li Wang, another top attorney and the chief global partner of the Beijing office, touts how she ""has served as general legal counsel for scores of Ministries of the PRC, state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises and institutions."" Her bio also says she is the ""Commissary of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Beijing Committee"" and the ""Chairman of Belt & Road Service Connections.""

Swalwell's ties to China have come under scrutiny before, particularly after Chinese national, Christine Fang also known as ""Fang Fang,"" gained special access to him and his campaign. She was deemed by U.S. officials to be part of a counterintelligence effort linked to China meant to influence and get close to U.S. political figures.

Swalwell has repeatedly claimed he cut off ties as soon as U.S. intelligence officials warned him of the threat and a congressional ethics investigation into the matter eventually found no wrongdoing on Swalwell's behalf. However, he was ultimately removed by Republicans from his post on the House Intelligence Committee, with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy citing Swalwell's past run-in with a suspected Chinese spy.

Lucci told Fox News Digital that Swalwell should commit to halting any further dalliances with America's foreign adversaries, and re-donate the funds he received from DeHeng Law Offices and Zhu ""to an organization that fights the evils of communism.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Swalwell and Zhu for comment on this story, but did not hear back by publication.

President Donald Trump will pardon former Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced and her co-defendants, Fox News has learned.

""This entire case is an example of political prosecution. In August of 2022, Wanda Vazquez faced bribery charges related to the financing of her 2020 gubernatorial campaign. Ms. Vazquez' pardon materials state that there was never any element of a quid pro quo deal and that her prosecution was politically motivated. The investigation into Ms. Vazquez began 10 days after she endorsed President Trump in 2020,"" a White House official told Fox News.

The White House official also told Fox News that Trump will pardon Vázquez's co-defendants, Julio Martin Herrera-Velutini and Mark Rossini, a former FBI agent.

""The investigation, she contends, not only monitored her campaign, but also included a monitoring of the Trump campaign. Additionally, Ms. Vazquez believes that there was no bribery at all because the discussions with the banker concerned a matter of agreeing on policy with a potential donor, and not taking action in exchange for a material gain. This case bears similarities to that of Alexander Sittenfeld, who received a pardon in May of 2025,"" the official added.

In 2022, Vázquez was arrested on bribery charges linked to her 2020 campaign. She was accused of engaging in a bribery scheme from December 2019 through June 2020, according to The Associated Press. The outlet noted at the time that Vázquez was serving as governor when the alleged scheme unfolded.

""I am innocent. I have not committed any crime,"" she told reporters at the time, according to the AP. ""I assure you that they have committed a great injustice against me.""

In 2019, Herrera's bank was under scrutiny by Puerto Rico's Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, which reportedly believed there were suspicious transactions not reported by the bank, according to the AP. Herrera and Rossini reportedly promised to support Vázquez's 2020 campaign in exchange for her dismissing the commissioner and appointing a new one, the AP reported at the time, citing unspecified authorities. 

The then-Puerto Rico governor reportedly accepted the bribery offer in February 2020 and allegedly appointed a former consultant from Herrera's bank to fill the role, the AP reported. The outlet said that officials claimed Herrera and Rossini paid more than $300,000 to political consultants to support Vázquez's campaign.

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss a potential government shutdown, the impact of protests on the midterm elections and the reaction to a former 'SNL' star's criticisms about Rep. Jasmine Crockett.

Democrats in the House of Representatives are claiming a posthumous victory from their 43-day government shutdown in October that left them empty-handed.

Now that enough House Republicans broke ranks with their party last week to advance the Obamacare tax credit extension at the heart of the standoff, several members told Fox News Digital the shutdown has since appreciated in value.

""I think it looked good at both points, but certainly after we passed the bill on the House floor,"" Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., said.

Despite a disappointing conclusion to the shutdown itself, Democrats like Ivey believe they're winning a messaging war over demands for expanded federal assistance as Congress eyes healthcare legislation.

""Mission accomplished,"" Ivey said of the effort.

The country first plunged into a shutdown on Oct. 1 when Democrats refused to advance spending legislation unless Congress renewed expiring COVID-19-era Obamacare subsidies. However, after weeks of stalled talks, a handful of Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government without securing any extension to the enhanced assistance.

Those subsidies phased out at the close of 2025, returning millions of Obamacare policyholders to pre-COVID levels of federal assistance.

The shutdown's end brought bitter frustration to members like Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — so much so that he joined several Democrats in calling for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to step aside, citing a failure of leadership.

Two months later, his outlook on the shutdown has softened. In his view, Democrats successfully turned the country's gaze.

""He forced Republicans to bend to our proposal to extend healthcare tax credits,"" Khanna said, referring to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

""He's been one of the most effective leaders in Congress on this issue,"" Khanna added. ""I believe Hakeem has shown extraordinary leadership in making healthcare the issue.""

Khanna did not address Schumer's role.

CONGRESS FAILS TO SAVE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES AFTER SHUTDOWN FIGHT, PREMIUMS SET TO SURGE

Rep. John Olszewski, D-Md., said, ""I think the fight was absolutely worth it. It really elevated the [healthcare] issue, and I think it forced the conversation,"" Olszewski said.

He added that the shutdown, in hindsight, has given him confidence Democrats have a winning hand going forward.

""I think it was not an issue. It wasn't — until Democrats stood firm and said, ‘We have to address this healthcare crisis.' I'm really always forward-focused. I think some sort of extension, even if it includes reasonable guardrails about limits on income or provisions to help prevent fraud — we can do those things,"" Olszewski said.

The forward-looking component of the shutdown's value is especially important for Abdul El-Sayed, a candidate for Senate in Michigan who had vented frustration with congressional Democrats over the shutdown's result. El-Sayed has built his campaign on advocating for universal healthcare and an increased government role in social services.

To him, there's still nothing gained from winning a messaging war unless Democrats capitalize on it.

""I think Democrats did a good thing by fighting the fight. We just haven't won it yet,"" El-Sayed said.

""If you're boxing, you say, you know, I threw a really good punch in the third round — that's not enough, we gotta keep fighting, right? This match is not over. It's unclear what Senate Republicans are going to do in the end.""

Nine House Republicans voted with Democrats last week to pass a three-year extension to the Obamacare subsidies. The measure now awaits consideration in the Senate, where it will also require bipartisan support to succeed.

The measure must receive 60 votes to clear the threat of a filibuster. Democrats hold 47 seats in the chamber.

The Baltimore Ravens and HC John Harbaugh have split after 18 seasons. Colin Cowherd discusses the news and asks if this was the right decision for both parties. 

Baltimore Ravens star edge rusher Kyle Van Noy wants to see the NFL make a change to the intentional grounding rule.

Van Noy, 34, wants intentional grounding calls to count as a sack for the defender who forces the quarterback to throw the ball away, saying that it takes money out of the defender's pocket.

""One thing the @NFL needs to change back is intentional grounding from a QB should be a sack again! You work so hard as a defender and a QB can just get to throw it away to avoid the sack, taking away money from a defender! Change my mind…."" Van Noy posted on X.

As currently written, intentional grounding is when a quarterback is under duress within the tackle box, facing an imminent loss of yardage, and throws a forward pass that is not in the direction and vicinity of an on originally eligible receiver. The pass does not have to be incomplete for intentional grounding to apply.

The penalty for intentional grounding is a loss of down and 10 yards from the previous spot. If the spot of the pass is further than 10 yards from the previous spot of the ball, the ball will be placed there with the loss of down.

If intentional grounding occurs in the end zone, it is a safety.

Van Noy wants the edge rushers to receive credit for a sack on an intentional grounding, as plenty of edge rushers in the NFL have incentive bonuses for sacks recorded, and they are the ones who cause the penalty.

Six-time Pro Bowler Eric Weddle responded to Van Noy's post, agreeing with him. Van Noy was asked how the NFL should award the sack if there are multiple defenders that cause the intentional grounding.

""Great question Mike…. 3 guys should be a team sack if it's hard to tell but most of the time you can establish half sacks and full sacks. If not … guys can turn the call in so they can take a deeper let look at it. If 2 guys are hitting him should get a half. 1 guy should get full. I also think they take out half sacks and give full sacks for both but that's just me, that might be a little greedy,"" Van Noy posted on X.

Van Noy concluded the 12th season of his career, and his second with the Ravens. In 15 games, he had two sacks, 20 tackles and one interception. Last season, Van Noy recorded 12.5 sacks and made the Pro Bowl. He will be a free agent this offseason.

HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania — When word reached the dairy farmers gathered at the Pennsylvania Farm Show that President Donald Trump had signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, cheers echoed through the cavernous 24-acre complex packed with farmers, thousands of attendees, and even a few goats, cows, and horses.

No one was more exuberant at the news than Dave Smith, executive director of the Pennsylvania Dairymen's Association, a trade group founded in the late 19th century that supports and advocates the state's largest agricultural sector: dairy farming.

Less than 10 minutes before the announcement, Smith had been telling me that getting whole milk back into schools was dairy farmers' biggest challenge and worry. That calm composure vanished as soon as word began to spread.

“This is incredible news,” Smith said. “I, and many others, have been working on the whole milk thing for many, many years, and this is meaningful for us in the dairy industry.” 

It is a fight that has been going on since 2015, explained Rep. GT Thompson (R-PA), chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and a tireless advocate for the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act since the United States Department of Agriculture mandated that milk offered in schools be fat-free or low-fat. 

“Those guidelines eliminated whole milk from schools,” Thompson said.

“The impact on the American dairy farm was devastating,” he explained, noting that overall U.S. milk consumption has declined dramatically.

“It's important for the nutrition of our youth. It's important for a huge commodity, the largest agriculture commodity in Pennsylvania, still is dairy, and it's all across the nation. And it's important for rural communities who lost so many businesses when dairy farms left and went out of business because we've lost since 2012 two generations of milk drinkers,” said Thompson, who is widely credited with rallying lawmakers on both the left and right to pass the bill on a bipartisan basis.

Thompson said we were basically feeding children chalk water, “which had very little nutritional benefits, if any. And so I'm just thrilled. Thrilled to have the president's signature was the final stop, and really honored to have his support.”

At the 110th Pennsylvania Farm Show, the Pennsylvania Dairymen's Association reigns supreme, even among visitors who know little about agriculture but never miss its famous, creamy milkshakes. To mark the 250th this year, the group is offering a red, white, and blue milkshake flight.

Smith said the iconic milkshakes have been a Farm Show staple for 72 years, made possible by hundreds of young volunteers. The proceeds go back into the industry's future, funding scholarships, youth programs, hunger prevention, and Future Farmers of America career development.

Trump signed the bipartisan legislation in the Oval Office surrounded by children and dairy farmers, including a Butler, Pennsylvania, farmer who enables schools to offer whole milk again under the federal nutrition programs.

The measure dovetails with newly released dietary guidelines that once again recognize full-fat dairy as part of a healthy dietary pattern, according to Dr. Mehmet Oz.

Oz, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was in the Oval Office for the signing with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and a bipartisan group of lawmakers headed by Thompson. Oz said the change supports both American families and the dairy producers who supply them.

“This has been an event 15 years in the making. There has been generally agreed-upon science that whole-fat milk is actually a relatively healthy thing to drink, especially compared to skim milk,” said Oz.

Oz said science had been distorted in a way that convinced Americans that whole milk was unhealthy. He said the shift may have been well-intentioned, but it ended up driving policy to strip fat out of milk as if fat itself were toxic.

Oz said children don't like watered-down milk. “Plus, it's like all sugar because you've taken all the fat out. So, then they add chocolate syrup to it to make it palatable, and it is even worse, and calorically, it's the same as whole-fat milk, so you don't even get a benefit,” he said.

“I bring this up to say that once the dietary guidelines came out and we took on the big fat lie, it became easier for the Congress to say, well, now that we know that whole fat's good for you, taken obviously in moderation, then we can actually let kids drink whole fat milk again,” he explained.

The speed of this, Oz said, is a reflection of how the administration tackles problems aggressively and gets to the finish line. “So many times these things start, but they sputter; no one's got passion behind it.”

Trump, for his part, appeared to enjoy the moment at the signing, surrounded by the members of Congress who pushed the bill over the finish line, along with families and children.

“Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, whole milk is a great thing,” Trump said at the signing.

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel confronts the growing crisis around AI-generated sexual abuse and the culture of impunity enabling it. He examines how Elon Musk's chatbot Grok is being used to create and circulate nonconsensual sexualized images often targeting women. Warzel lays out why this moment represents a red line for the internet: It is a test of whether society will tolerate tools that silence women through humiliation and intimidation under the guise of free speech.

Warzel is then joined by The Atlantic's Sophie Gilbert, the author of Girl on Girl, for a conversation about how misogyny has been a constant throughline in the history of internet innovation, from Facebook to YouTube. Warzel and Gilbert discuss today's AI-powered exploitation and explore how new technologies repeatedly repackage old abuses at greater scale and speed. They discuss why this wave of hostility feels so intense right now, how backlash politics and platform design reinforce one another, and what is at stake if lawmakers, companies, and the public fail to draw a red line with Elon Musk's Grok.

A note from Charlie Warzel: On Wednesday—after this episode was recorded and after The Atlantic published its article on the Grok undressing scandal—X's Safety account posted an update noting that the company had “implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” It also noted: “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally.”

I reached out to X to ask if this update was different from the changes it had made to the feature that were rolled out last week. I asked if Grok was now unable to generate bikini images for any user. X's media strategy lead, Rosemarie Esposito, did not respond to our request for comment.

As of this writing, it is unclear if the safeguards are always working. In some cases, Grok seems to be unable to generate bikini images. However, some users are still posting images on X that suggest they can still prompt the chatbot to do so.



The following is a transcript of the episode:

Sophie Gilbert: It is about power. It's about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Any time they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be

essentially silenced, they'll be driven out of certain platforms, they'll be made to feel unwelcome, they'll be shamed in lots of ways and humiliated.

Charlie Warzel: Welcome back to Galaxy Brain. I am your host, Charlie Warzel. Last week, I offered up a little bit of a rant at the top about Elon Musk and Grok and the chatbots' undressing spree. And it turns out, I'm not done talking about that one. Today's episode is going to be about the ways in which technology has shaped a culture that's been increasingly hostile to women online and elsewhere.

I'm going to be joined by my colleague Sophie Gilbert, who writes extensively about culture and the ways that it talks about and influences and shapes women and our perceptions of women. She's the author of a fantastic book called Girl on Girl, which traces how pop culture has turned a generation of women against themselves. We're going to be talking about the Grok stuff, but also the ways that these tech platforms have this rich history of exposing women and why it's become so popular to think about women as these nonhuman objects online, how AI is encouraging this, and what women are supposed to do in response. But before we get to Sophie, I wanted to address the Grok issue head on again. I remain truly, incandescently mad about this, about all of it.

Here is a sentence that is true. For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool—owned and promoted by the world's richest man—to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, especially women, and undress them.

At the moment, Elon Musk seems to be not only getting away with this, but reveling in it.

Here's where I need to note that xAI says it's prohibited the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy. A post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and it works with law enforcement as needed. The company said late last week that it limited image generation with Grok and editing to paying subscribers. Now, this is disturbing in its own right, because Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around even this very low bar of moderation using the “edit image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by going to Grok's stand-alone app and creating images that way.

To be clear, the deluge of people online, anonymous trolls saying @Grok put her into a bikini, et cetera—that's subsided slightly. But on subreddits and on these backwater message boards, I can tell you, personally, that I've seen creeps strategizing and sharing tactics for the best ways to get around these safeguards and to create realistic pornographic images of women.

The problem continues. Musk himself has said that he is quote, “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” He's talking about images of children. Now, he might not be aware of it, but as my colleague Matteo Wong has shared with me, there are investigators who look at this stuff, who have found Grok-generated images on the dark web that clear the bar for child-sexual-abuse material. It is out there. To say nothing of the harassment that's gone on in broad daylight on X with people undressing women and public figures.

And so I can't stop thinking about this. Now there's starting to be a little bit of pressure from governments around the world. Government bodies in the U.K., India, and the European Union have said that they're trying to investigate X. Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok. In the U.S., though, the response has been a lot different. This week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth touted a partnership publicly between the military and xAI to use Grok in war-fighting capabilities.

Meanwhile, the United States State Department has appeared to threaten the United Kingdom over their probe into Elon Musk's app. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the Take It Down Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual, intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last week that Grok-generated images that were “unacceptable and a clear violation of the law.” On Monday, Cruz posted a photo on X of him with his arm around Elon Musk. The caption said, “Always great seeing this guy!” Rocket emoji.

Make no mistake: This is a part of a crisis of impunity that goes well beyond X or Elon Musk. This is the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs just bowing and capitulating to Donald Trump. A financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors like cryptocurrency and meme stocks. A braggadocious, get-the-bag ethos that has no room for shame or greed. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences of all kinds. It's cynical. It's cowardly. It is cancerous to the social fabric.

I can't know what is in the heart of these CEOs or these politicians or the employees of the companies that are refusing to comment on the fact that they've invested in a company that has weaponized and viralized abusive, suggestive, sexual material. But I feel confident in saying that their silence on this issue is due to a hope that if they're quiet, everyone will just move on. It's a strategy on today's internet among people with power to just bank on a culture in which people have given up demanding consequences.

And we just cannot allow that to happen. Because this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet—but also for us culturally. This is not, as I said last week, a partisan issue. This is not, as Elon Musk would have you think, a free-speech-maximalist issue. It is, however, a free-speech issue in that this tool is being used to silence women through intimidation.

The Grok scandal it is just so awful, so egregious, that it offers a direct opportunity to address this crisis of impunity, head on. This is a moment in which people with power, or people who can exert pressure—the Apples and Googles of the world, our politicians, other people in Silicon Valley—this is a moment when they should demand accountability for this. Elon Musk should wear this.

The stakes could not be any higher. Because if there is no red line around AI-generated sexual-abuse material, there's no red line.

And so joining me now is Sophie Gilbert, who can speak to, in many ways, the other side of this. The consequences and what all of this horrible culture of misogyny is doing to women online. Here's Sophie.

Warzel: Sophie, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Gilbert: Charlie, hi. Thank you so much for having me.

Warzel: I'm sorry to talk to you under these circumstances, but it's a delight regardless of what we're about to get into. And on that note, I did want to start with the news. Which, it's been a pretty horrific few months, even by internet and 2020s standards, in terms of the blatant, flagrant misogyny that is out there.

We have the Grok-undressing stuff; I just talked about in the beginning, here, of the episode. We have the Epstein files coming to light. The vilification on the right of Renee Good in Minneapolis. There's a lot more, which you've been writing about—including the president calling a reporter “Piggy.” What has been your reaction to the volume of this really ugly misogyny manifesting right now?

Gilbert: God. I just think, like—I used to be a TV critic, not to be glib. I used to write about culture. I mean, through a very, you know, lens of gender. I mean, I still write about culture, but because I think and write so much about gender dynamics and misogyny, of course, and women. God, there's been a lot. There's really been a lot. There's been a lot of kind of stories to cover, of things to respond to. It feels like everything is peaking. I don't know if this is actually the peak, or if we have a way to go. But I mean, one thing, I think, is that so much of our culture has sort of learned from, and is responding to, the example of the president. Who is not, I would say, the most decent person when it comes to talking, thinking about, talking to, treating women.

Warzel: I think that's well documented. Yes.

Gilbert: Well documented; yeah. I'm wondering, will I always check in? But obviously, his example, I think, has had a real profound effect on the culture. I feel like it's enabled a lot of people to be much more honest about how they feel about women. I wrote this in one of my pieces last year, but it did feel like, for a while, that sexism and misogyny were not generally acceptable in public discourse. They were frowned upon. I mean, you would get fired as someone in the workplace if you said something misogynistic or sexist. You would, you know, have an outcry, public outcry, if you tweeted something or said something publicly to that, in that line. And now, it's just open season. I don't know if it's, like, the Overton window being broadened. Or it just feels like there is so much license now for people to say the most outrageous, the most indecent, the most horrific things.

Warzel: Do you feel like a lot of that is a direct backlash? Some people frame the Trump years, the Trump election in 2016, as a backlash to the historic election of a Black president. This idea that we are constantly ping-ponging back and forth in this very extreme way to the thing that happened before. Do you see this as—I know you just referenced Trump now—do you see it as also a reflexive reaction in the culture to the #MeToo stuff?

Gilbert: Yeah, definitely. I wrote about this a little bit in my book. I wrote a book about the pop culture basically of the 1990s and the 2000s, and the ways in which it presented women and the big influence of porn on popular culture. And so much of the pattern of that period of time is: progress backlash, progress backlash, progress backlash. I mean, Susan Faludi, I think, wrote this in Backlash that any time women are perceived to be making strides—in terms of status, in terms of equality—there is a profound backlash to that in the culture. And I think certainly, Trump himself was manifesting as a reaction to a lot. And then obviously after #MeToo, you had this real pushback. And then after what happened in 2020—with the George Floyd protests and sort of sustained efforts on the part of lots of people to build a more equitable culture—there was obviously a backlash to that too.

So it just feels like everything constantly is kind of reverberating back and forth, back and forth.

Warzel: Is that why … there was a line that struck me in the piece you wrote after Trump called a reporter “Piggy.” It said, “Over the last few weeks, it feels like we're revisiting the same characters over and over, with no consequences and no forward momentum.” Is that part of it, or is that a different dynamic?

Gilbert: No. I mean, there are definitely the main characters, right? Like, there's Trump; there's Elon Musk; there's [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. I mean, so many of these people just keep coming up in the news with reference to these kinds of stories. And I think in part that's because of who they are, and how they behave, and what they're doing. And the example that they set, as well.

Warzel: Your book, which you just mentioned, is fabulous. And it picks at the ways in which so much of this is baked into our culture. Like, for example, sexual objectification is normalized and kind of branded in the fashion industry, and they profit off of all that. And then it emanates also, you know, into every other corner of popular culture there. I'd love to—in part because of what's happening with Musk and Grok—love to trace the role that technology is playing in all of this. Do you feel it's a similar kind of dynamic to what you were writing about in the book? Because you and I were talking a little bit before this, and you told me that you're thinking about how this is coded in from the beginning on the tech platforms. And I wanted you to expand on that. How can we start to just trace this through some of these big tech platforms?

Gilbert: Yeah. I mean, this was one of the things that really surprised me the most in my research. So many of our major tech platforms that are really incorporated into our daily lives were built on the exposure of women; on the desire to look at sexualized pictures of women. I mean, I can talk about this a bit more in a minute, but if you go way back to the '90s, when the internet was really first becoming a force of presence in people's lives, the first real viral video was Pamela Anderson's sex tape, which was obviously stolen. It was a private video made with her and her husband on her honeymoon. It was stolen from their home. It was released without her consent. Was broadcast on the internet, sold as VHS. It became just such a moment of mass-media consumption in a time when I think no one really understood what was happening.

So it's just—it's in the history of our technology. I mean, before we had Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg created Facemash, which was a site where people could compare the relative hotness of women at Harvard. I mean, Google Images was created because Jennifer Lopez wore a very low-cut Versace dress to the Grammys, and there was so much unprecedented traffic. And there was no way to easily provide people with images. So that was created as a response.

Warzel: I did not know that.

Gilbert: Yeah. So it's basically like—name a tech platform in there. It has been created because someone, somewhere, wanted to ogle women. And it's not that that's a bad thing, per se. It's just that it's part of the coding. It's part of the texture of why the internet was made, and what people have always wanted to use it for. I think what you see, and what we're seeing now with Grok, is that whenever there's a leap forward in terms of technology, the first thing people use it for seems to be sex. And often sexual exploitation as well.

Warzel: Well, I've done previously, in past decades, stories about technology and the porn industry, right? And the porn industry has the similar part—or maybe slightly the flip side of that dynamic is that the porn industry is also very good at seeking out. Whether it's VHS, or whether it is some of the internet stuff, some of the even just like the switch posts. You know, the Pamela Anderson sex tape, to this idea of amateur porn. Then artificial intelligence and VR goggles, and things like that. Like the industry itself—not the nonconsensual part of it, but the bought-and-paid-for part of the industry has always been excellent at leveraging that and figuring out new, novel ways of distribution.

Gilbert: Yeah, one of the facts that really blew my mind was learning that in the mid-'70s, when VHS technology was first introduced, up to 75 percent of the tapes being made, really the first day of VHS being available, were pornographic. The early adopters were just that fast to see what VHS would be used for.

Warzel: One thing that I was looking at, reading in your book, that was just so striking—post all of this Grok stuff, and this idea of the internet just being flooded at the moment with all this AI-generated nonconsensual sexualized imagery. Is the description from, and you're just describing, a scene from the '90s teenage-sex comedy American Pie in which one of the characters has an exchange student over and sets up a webcam. And then, you know, like runs over to his friend's house to basically watch her, surveil her in his room, and then broadcast that to the whole school or whatever. This idea that—you know, she's basically shamed. She's an exchange student, shamed to go back to her own country. Where the main character who did this is just, you know, kind of “boys will be boys'ed” out of it.

And I was just so struck by the way in which, I mean, American Pie was just like a canonical film of the late '90s, early 2000s. Just so popular in our culture. And yet right there is this idea of, I don't know if it's exactly revenge porn, but really horrible, nonconsensual broadcasted imagery. Over the internet. The fact that these tools, like, should be used for this type of spying—or even if not, it's kind of funny. And that there really are no consequences for doing so. Can you just tell me a little bit about how you feel popular culture has dealt with this rise of the broadcasting of women, the ogling of women, in this? And sort of made it acceptable for people to treat women in this way?

Gilbert: Yeah; I mean, I think one of the things that happens is that technology is so fast that we don't, as a society—even in terms of thinking about our laws or our structures or our ethical frameworks—we don't have ways to respond as quickly as technology arrives. So when things like webcams, and the ability to stream video, or the ability to furtively take pictures of people without their knowledge … when things like that arrive, it takes us a while to sort of build ethical frameworks in terms of usage. So I think that example in American Pie is so interesting because you see this new technology. You see it as a story in a film, but we didn't have the language, right, to say nonconsensual porn. Or, I mean—we don't have the words necessarily to accurately describe what's going on. And I think that it always takes a while for us to catch up.

So with something like—another thing I write about in my book is the way that photographers, paparazzi photographers in the 2000s, would lie down on the ground to take pictures of women's skirts. Basically to try and capture, catch them, photograph them without underwear. And now I would call that nonconsensual porn, of course. But back then, it was called upskirt. Like, upskirt photography; upskirting. Because we didn't yet … we hadn't figured out the right way of thinking about what it actually was, what it actually meant. And that's why I think language is so important. And it's why something like what's happening on Grok right now is so dispiriting to me. Because it's like: We've already done it. We've already learned the lesson. We've already decided as a culture that this is not something that we want to participate in. That it's wrong; that it profoundly hurts and traumatizes women. And yet new technology comes along, a new way of doing it. And everyone kind of forgets everything that we've set forward.

Warzel: Do you think it's that, or do you think it is a backlash, again, in this way? Or people trying to reclaim it, right? Something that I have noticed in the dynamic—and other people have noticed, of course—of what's happening with the Grok stuff is it's so clearly all about power, right? Like, it's this idea of immediate ritualized, viralized shame and humiliation. And it feels to me almost less like we haven't learned those lessons, and more like a bunch of people saying like, “You know, we want to go back.”

Gilbert: Yeah, I think you're 100 percent right. It is about power. It's about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Anytime they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be essentially silenced. They'll be driven out of certain platforms; they'll be made to feel unwelcome; they'll be shamed in lots of ways, and humiliated. And it's very much about underscoring the idea that, again—I mean, it's sort of taking away our full humanity, in a way that I find, again, horrifying in so many ways. It's not even about making sexual material. It's about making sexual material of women in a way that is trying to dehumanize them and objectify them, but also to sort of push them out of public life.

Warzel: This may seem like an obvious question, given that we're talking about Grok right now, but how are you thinking about how AI is supercharging this, or how it's changing the dynamics? Obviously, it's allowing it to happen so much more quickly. It's allowing there to be, I guess, a level of crude and awful imagination in the scenarios that one can be put in. But yeah, how do you see AI changing and pushing this dynamic forward?

Gilbert: There are so many different elements of AI that I find disconcerting. I think one is the way that it just affirms whatever the user wants to do. It's sort of, it's very sycophantic. It's very obsequious. It will try and keep users engaged by really making them feel good about themselves and what they're doing. There's not a lot of pushback. And in terms of a lot of the relationships that are being set up, in terms of people's emotional and intimate relationships with chatbots … it's not normal to have that kind of relationship. You don't have that kind of relationship with a human being. With any kind of human being, there's friction, there's pushback. There's a two-way power dynamic. It's not the person in the relationships, let's say the man in the relationship, being constantly affirmed, constantly catered to, constantly gratified in any way that he might want. And so I think setting up that dynamic in terms of: What are people's expectations? How are they being set up to have real human relationships, in real life? That's one thing that I find troubling.

But there's also, I mean, you could look at the way that I think when ChatGPT, a version of ChatGPT, was launched in 2024, and it had this female voice that was modeled after Scarlett Johansson because she declined to let them use her. Yeah, allegedly. I'm sorry. Yeah.

Warzel: Allegedly, sounded exactly like Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett Johansson thought that it sounded like Scarlett Johansson. She was very pissed off. Allegedly, allegedly.

Gilbert: But it's very feminine coded, right? And so you have these assistants. I think this comes back to the Siri discourse, when Siri was first launched. And she, of course, had a female voice. When, you know, Alexa obviously has a woman's name. Are we affirming these dynamics where women take care of men, by coding that into the platforms that we use? It certainly seems so.

Warzel: Something I wanted to ask you about was the rise of OnlyFans. Obviously, porn—we've talked about it. And through your work, there is this kind of … it always is coming back to porn. In terms of roles and expectations for women, and the way that it's infusing in culture.

OnlyFans has been a really interesting revolution in adult content in that, you know, when I was reporting on the adult industry a little bit in the '00s, or the 2010s rather, it felt like nothing was ever going to take down those tube sites. Those free tube sites that were, you know, squeezing production companies; also, you know, uploading a lot of stuff that hadn't been verified, from performers that was quote unquote “amateur” content.

A lot of big issues. And also sort of a strange leviathan monopoly on the industry that was driving, you know, the money that they—that performers—could make way down. OnlyFans comes along; there's a sort of democratization element and influencing element therein. And a lot of people have made great amounts of money on that. There's been a feeling from certain people of, you know, an empowerment in terms of this type of sex work.

And yet, it also feels to me like it has added this influencer culture onto it, right? There are so many elements of influencer interaction with fans that the platform has set up. That I think, as you said, also set up these relationships. How have you been watching the rise of OnlyFans and thinking about it in terms of all this culture?

Gilbert: I find it so fascinating. In so many ways, I think the first way is thinking culturally. I'm always thinking about, like, how does culture inform desire? How does culture teach us things that we're attracted to, or things that are acceptable, or things that we fantasize about? And when you look at a lot of porn from the '90s and the 2000s, the women in those movies were a very narrow range of beauty. They were sort of mostly young, mostly thin, mostly blonde. Like, I'm not gonna go any more descriptive than that. But it was quite a narrow, I would say, physicality. And then OnlyFans comes along, and it really broadens, I think, the scope of just the kinds of desire that people felt licensed in having. I'm thinking about age. Like, a lot of the celebrities who have made names for themselves on OnlyFans, and who have really made significant amounts of money, are in their 50s. Which seems interesting to me, because in mainstream culture, those kinds of women are not typically portrayed as desirable, right? Like you're in your 20s and your 30s, or in your 40s if you've had a good facelift.

But women in their 50s are not typically sex symbols in Hollywood. So suddenly you have this platform that is really … I don't know, it's sort of allowing a much broader definition of what is desirable in mainstream culture. And so that, to me, is fascinating and positive in lots of ways. I think OnlyFans has certainly made things a lot safer for sex workers in many ways. But again, I mean, in terms of what I was talking about with AI and chatbots, it's the same kind of one-sided dynamic. Where you have men having these very intimate, and often parasocial, but very, very intimate and emotional relationships with women who are performing for them for money. It's not coming from an honest place of connection. It's coming from a place of sort of a one-sided power dynamic, where women perform and cater to men. And so while it's fascinating in so many ways, I do think it's affirming the same kinds of patterns that we see more and more in technology.

Warzel: I've had to go and look in some of these backwater areas for the reporting on the Grok stuff, but also just in general with AI-driven sexualized images, or what have you. And something that I've seen in some of these communities—I mean, apart from the awfulness—is these confessional posts from men who are saying, Guys, I'm kind of ruined by this. Right? This is like, I can generate my fantasy and my dream on demand now, and then tweak it in all these different ways and do it again and again and again. And I don't feel anything when I look at women. Or something like that. Like, I've seen numerous confessional posts in that regard. And I think about that with the culture. And I don't know how much you know about this—but there was a very long Harper's story about this, but this culture of “gooning” and this idea of sensory overload. Marathon sessions of self-pleasuring and being bombarded by porn of all kinds. Where do you think this is all headed? You mentioned peaking in terms of, like, misogynist behavior. This is obviously a different category, but where do you feel like all this is headed?

Gilbert: Yeah. It seems so much like it's an addiction. I was also looking at the Reddit page for Grok today, just to briefly see what people were talking about.

Warzel: My apologies.

Gilbert: I saw—no, no, no, it's okay. But you know, there are posts by women saying, “I've discovered that my boyfriend has created undressed images of people who we know. Women who we know in real life.” Like, “He says he can't help it; it's a compulsion.” But you know, that's one real-world consequence.

I have talked a lot over the past year about how the manosphere is setting men up for profound failure. Like, if you cannot see women as equal human beings, you cannot relate to them on a level of basic equality. No one is going to want to be in your life. No one is going to want to have an intimate, personal relationship with you. And we know that men need marriage and meaningful relationships as a health matter. Like, men live longer when they're married. They're happier when they're married; they get less diseases when they're married. That kind of emotional stability has a profound public-health impact. And so things like this, they are setting men up for these lives of profound loneliness. And, you know, not to sort of be like, What about the men? But it is an interesting aspect of it that I think can get lost sometimes when we're talking about, rightfully, how awful and humiliating this is for the women involved. But like, it works both ways.

Warzel: To that point, I don't want to focus on the men in all of this, but do you think that that's a way, like a crack, in which somebody—like some of this can just be begun to be pulled a bit apart? I think so much about what the manosphere and a lot of these, you know, hypermasculine influencers are trying to sell, right? Which is this idea that someone's putting something over on you, right? Like, you're either being exploited by feminism, or whatever, you're being subjected to something by some outside force, right? And this is a way to, like, push against it. Get a little bit of autonomy; be a man; do whatever. I feel like there's a reverse version of that with this, right? Which is like, All of these people are setting you up. Like a reverse Alex Jones, right? Like, All these people are setting you up for this failure. They're exploiting you to sell creatine powder, or whatever it is. And that is a way in which you can actually break free on this. Like, people are trying to subjugate you for profit, because they're influencers, because there's a reason to, or an intentional thing to gain. Do you feel like that is a possible way to switch the dynamic?

Gilbert: Yeah. I think it's a way to frame it that gets people to pay attention. Certainly, maybe a different kind of person than someone who might read our stories at The Atlantic and be profoundly influenced.

Warzel: I'm always trying to figure out how to talk to the manosphere. Always, you know, direct to camera.

Gilbert: I think it is an argument that is both valid and may have more of an impact. I think the thing that I really am caught on, right now, is the thing that you and our colleague Matteo Wong wrote about. Which is that this is our red-line moment. Like, if we cannot agree that this is something that we will not do as a culture, there is no coming back from it. And particularly, I was thinking lot about Elon Musk's comments when my great home country of Great Britain threatened—not even threatened—but there was the specter of possibly X being taken offline. And he responded that it would be the suppression of free speech.

And I was thinking about how we've always, as a culture, agreed—we've been unanimous on this—that there are certain kinds of speech that we will suppress. And that speech is, you know, child-sexual-abuse material. That is the kind of speech that we will not tolerate in society. We do not allow it. We legislate very strongly against it. There are so many taboos against it. It is something that is really profoundly frowned upon, and we've always agreed on that. So why now has it become something that suddenly people—politicians in my country—are saying might be protected free speech? Like, what has changed? I really just am so much in alignment with your argument that there's sort of no coming back if we can't draw this line now, and set up our boundaries.

Warzel: What has changed, at the risk of sounding extremely dumb and obvious. But, you know… a healthy society stops this. We are not stopping this. So what has changed? Is it just simply, we're just not a healthy society? Or … what's changed that this is a red line that people seem okay crossing, as long as they're not, you know, they don't have to wear it? You know, just as long as it just passes.

Gilbert: Yeah. There's such cognitive dissonance in being alive right now in this moment of like, Epstein freakout, but also post–kind of QAnon, “save the children.” And suddenly people ... it's really hard to make sense of. I think the thing that has changed is Elon Musk. And the money that he has, and the power that he has, and the position that he has. And the way that he has taken over X—in a way where it still operates just about enough like the traditional social-media site that it once was, that people feel like it might be, but it's not anymore. It's really 4chan with a couple of normies. Like, it's been so profoundly radicalized. It's just become a cesspool in a way that I think people who have stayed on it have become inured to. And it's sort of harder to shock them, I think. And that has profoundly affected the people who are still on the platform, and the ramifications are going to affect all of us.

Warzel: I just did, at the front of this, a bit of a monologue about this moment. The red-line moment; the line in the sand. I think the hope always, with our work, when we're talking about the culture or the technologies, and how they push people to a certain, they force cultural change in some way.

If a lawmaker—if someone in power—is listening to this, what's your message for them on all this right now?

Gilbert: I would say: This is such an easy one for you. It's so straightforward. Morally, it's so simple. Ethically, it's so simple. It's so straightforward. If you can be the person who will take a stand, you will have so many people behind you. I know it's hard, because Musk has money, and Musk has power, and money buys you more power. But this is very straightforward, and it's not something that the public at large are divided on. And if you think that the public are divided, it's possibly because you've spent too much time on X.

Warzel: I couldn't have said it better myself. Sophie Gilbert, thank you for coming on to talk about the world's most depressing stuff. I think the only way though to go forward is to just address it head on. So the only way out is through. And thank you for helping me get through.

Gilbert: Thank you for your piece. I know; I'm sorry that you've already spoken about it, but I wanted to bring it up, because it's such a good piece and everyone should read it. And I think this kind of moral clarity right now is hard to come by and very important.

Warzel: Wonderful. Sophie, thanks so much.

Gilbert: Pleasure.

Brandon LaRoque kept his life savings in a cryptocurrency account. One morning, as he went to check his balance, he discovered that it was all missing. LaRoque is one of many victims of the unregulated crypto industry, and soon there may be more. President Donald Trump has rolled back regulation of the industry. At the same time, he and his family have earned untold billions of dollars from new crypto ventures. Molly White, a writer focused on the intersections of tech and finance, describes the crypto industry, and explains how this new financial industry is shaping our politics and facilitating corruption within our government.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Brandon LaRoque: Things tend to happen to me first 'cause I'm usually the one willing to try something new first. And I hope I'm not the canary in the coal mine.

[Music] 

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I'm Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I am asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result.

Today's episode: cryptocurrency, and the crypto oligarchs whose campaign to prevent any regulation of their industry is corrupting the American economy as well as American politics.

Donald Trump was once skeptical of the crypto industry; bitcoin, he once said, “seems like a scam.” But since his inauguration, Donald Trump and his family have turned 180 degrees and made hundreds of millions of dollars from their own crypto company, World Liberty Financial. At the same time, Trump has deregulated the crypto industry, making life easier for the oligarchs who run it, and potentially allowing them to harm thousands of ordinary consumers.

Brandon LaRoque is one those people, a victim of what he says was a hack involving a crypto coin called XRP.

LaRoque: My name is Brandon Laroque. I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina. I'm an Eagle Scout. I'm a veteran, and for the past 21 years, I ran a bar. We, my wife and I, ran it together. It's called the Goat Bar, in Raleigh. The bar was our baby.

[Music] 

Every day when I used to leave my bar, if I had any extra cash with me, I would go to the ATM machine and I would buy XRP, and send it to my wallet. That was my savings.  I just kind of wanted to stay out of the banks as much as possible.

Each month what I would do is, since we had retired from our bar, I would sell off a little bit of XRP. So if we needed, you know, $5,000 to pay the mortgage or pay our car payment, or whatever it was, I would actually just sell off whatever I needed. And that's what we've been living off for the past year.

On October 15, which was a Wednesday, I, being in the bar business, I'm a night owl. I'm up all night long. I'm usually going to bed when most people are getting up, going to work.

And I just happened to click on my wallet. I don't check it every day. I clicked on the app, and I noticed that my XRP had all been just disappeared. It was 4 o'clock in the morning. I woke my wife up, literally in tears. Somehow I was hacked. I don't know. And I still don't even know how to this day.

1,210,000 XRP. It was worth approximately $3 million. It was our life savings.

The first week was a haze. I was so lost. I lost 12 pounds in seven days. It's just so crazy that I've gone this long and now I'm right here at the finish line, and it's gone.

I mean, I hate to say that money caused me the worst day of my life, but it caused me the worst day of my life, unfortunately, to be honest. 'Cause it wasn't about the money as it was about, you know, I could just see all our dreams kind of disappearing when that happened.

We didn't know what we were gonna do. I contacted my local sheriff. They did not have a cybercrimes unit. I contacted my local police department. They don't have a cybercrimes unit. I also contacted the FBI. With the FBI, it was like, Just fill out a report. And I think there's, like, less than a 1 percent chance of getting any of our crypto back. I mean, I hope there's more, but I just really doubt it.

[Music] 

I think a lot of people are making a lot of money off the backs of a lot of people.

And, I mean, I'll say, I am a Trump supporter, but I don't agree with the Trump coin. I don't agree with these meme coins. I don't agree with the whole thing going on. I think it's called World Liberty or World Finance, whatever it is. I think they're all terrible.

If I had President Trump's ear, I would ask him to please work with Congress and make crypto safer and easier for everyone. Even though I don't like the banks, at least I can walk into a branch and speak to a human being, and they will sit down there and help me with my bank account. Why can't you do the same thing with crypto?

I think that they all need to get off their butts and pass legislation to make it safer for everybody. Let's get something done.

[Music]

Molly White: I think there's a lot of damage that can potentially happen to everyday people through crypto.

Applebaum: Molly White is a software engineer and researcher. She writes the newsletter Citation Needed, which focuses on the crypto industry and the intersections between finance and tech.

Molly, for listeners who aren't steeped in finance or who are just unfamiliar, how do you describe what crypto is, and how do you explain how it's different from traditional banking?

White: Well, crypto is really a form of a digital asset, so there's no paper currency. Broadly speaking, people are not using crypto for buying their groceries or paying their rent or those types of things. Most people buy and sell them for speculative purposes.

Applebaum: Speculative purposes, meaning they invest in it, and they hope the price will go up.

White: Correct.

Applebaum: And how can unregulated crypto hurt ordinary consumers?

White: So there is the risk when it comes to the asset itself in the sense that these assets are highly volatile. Many of them, you don't know who has created the asset. You don't know who is running the business. You don't know their credibility or their background. They aren't required to disclose it under the current regulatory regime. There have been many, many cryptocurrencies that are known as “rug pulls,” where, essentially, the creators of these assets inflate the price artificially and then sell all their tokens, profiting immensely themselves but at the expense of everyone they convinced to purchase the tokens.

You know, there's very little regulation preventing that type of activity, whereas you would expect that activity to be quickly shut down in more regulated ends of the financial system. So there's the sort of asset-level risk, but then there's also the broader risk, which is that if you buy a stock today through your brokerage account, the price of the stock might go up and down, but you know, fairly confidently, that that stock is still gonna belong to you when you open up your brokerage in a month.

When it comes to the cryptocurrency industry, we've seen repeated examples of crypto firms that have gone bankrupt, that have run off with all the money, that have just vanished into thin air practically. We saw the collapse of FTX, in 2022—

Applebaum: Right, Sam Bankman-Fried's company—

White: Correct, where it turned out that people were trusting this company that was actually taking their money and then using them to trade or to make investments in other companies or to purchase real estate for the executives of that company. And people ended up losing a lot of money when FTX went bankrupt. And now its CEO is spending a long time in jail.

And I think a lot of people don't understand that there is very little protection against that type of activity. Especially in the United States, I think we've all become very comfortable with banks or regulated financial institutions, where there is some degree of oversight, where you expect that a company is not gonna just run off with all your money without any recourse. Or, you know, if your bank fails, you expect that you don't have to worry about your deposits, because they are insured up to a fairly large amount. And I think a lot of people who are being sucked in by the marketing and the promises of getting rich overnight, frankly, don't understand that there is that amount of risk that they're getting into.

Applebaum: So it's a little bit like the banking industry before deposit insurance, before banks were regulated. It's as if you could have had your money in a bank, and then the bank could go bankrupt or disappear overnight, and then you would just lose everything.

White: Right, exactly. I mean, that is, when we saw crypto collapses throughout the past handful of years, there were many instances where people lost their funds and they said, I thought I had the same protections as a bank. I thought the FDIC would step in and reimburse me. And now we are actually seeing the regulators being pulled back and told to step away from the crypto industry. And we're seeing legislation being passed that would essentially enable the crypto industry to expand its business activities without any additional consumer protections.

Applebaum: You keep a running tally of money that's been lost in schemes and scams since 2021. Where are we now approximately?

White: Let me take a quick look. So the running total on my website for the money that's been lost is almost $80 billion, and that's actually a very conservative estimate. So that's really the lower bound, I would say.

Applebaum: So to be clear, this is $80 billion lost by ordinary consumers.

White: Yeah, it's a mix of everyday people and institutions.

Applebaum: Let me shift now to the current administration. Maybe we could start with World Liberty Financial. Can you explain what it is and how it works and how it could be used, in effect, to bribe the president?

White: So World Liberty Financial is a cryptocurrency platform that was created by Trump, some of his sons, and a handful of external partners in August 2024.

Applebaum: And one of those external partners is Zach Witkoff, who is the son of Trump's Middle East and Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff.

White: Right, and this has been a very lucrative project for the Trump family. They've earned hundreds of millions of dollars just from selling WLFI tokens that currently don't really do much, but allow people to buy favor with the president, essentially.

Applebaum: Can we just focus on that for a second? So people are buying tokens, but then there's nothing they can use those tokens for, right? I mean, they can't be used to buy anything else, and they can't be traded easily, and they can't be sold easily. So the only reason to buy them is to be able to show the president that you spent money on his company.

White: I agree that it really is just a way to buy favor with the president. And we've seen that being done through people like Justin Sun, for example, who is a foreign national, is not permitted to contribute to Trump's campaign, but was making a $75 million purchase of these WLFI tokens. And Trump and his family take a 75 percent cut of that.

Applebaum: So Justin Sun invested in World Liberty Financial, and what did he get in exchange?

White: He ended up being rewarded with an advisory position at the World Liberty project, which gives him close access to the Trump family.

Applebaum: And at the time, he was under an investigation as well, no?

White: Correct. Justin Sun was actively fighting a civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged fraud in addition to the usual unregistered sales of securities.

Applebaum: And since then, those charges have been removed? Or we're not investigating him anymore?

White: The Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit has been paused, pending resolution. So essentially dropped. And so, yes, I mean he essentially has nothing to worry about anymore in terms of both criminal and civil litigation.

Applebaum: I mean, obviously, we can't prove the connection, but there is a series of strange events. So, Justin Sun made an investment in World Liberty Financial. Subsequent to that, the investigation into him was lifted, although his investment was locked and frozen, later on, by World Liberty Financial. So obviously, there is more to this story. [Sun has denied any wrongdoing.]

White: Correct. You know, we've seen other examples where companies have partnered with Trump's companies in ways that are very lucrative for the Trump family, and then they've seemed to suddenly enjoy relief from legal concerns. We've seen, for example, Coinbase spending millions of dollars on political contributions, whether it was to crypto-focused super PACs that were supporting pro-crypto congressional candidates, or if it was sponsorship of the Trump military parade or a million dollars to Trump's inauguration fund. And then shortly after Trump took office, the SEC enforcement case against them was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled. I mean, the list really goes on.

Applebaum: Some of this doesn't sound that new; it just sounds like classic lobbying. The difference, it seems to me, though, is both in the scale, in the amounts of money being thrown around, in the fact that people seem to be paying to get rid of their legal problems. And of course, the huge difference is the personal involvement of the president and his family.

White: They are involved in almost every aspect of the crypto industry at this point. The Trump family is profiting from cryptocurrency businesses and crypto investments, and President Trump is essentially directing the regulation and legislation around the crypto industry.

Applebaum: Can you estimate how much money the president and his family have made through this line of business?

White: We're talking billions of dollars at this point.

Applebaum: This seems to me the genuinely unusual and new piece of this, actually, which is that you have an industry that is directly benefiting the president. So he is directly, personally, and immediately benefiting from his own regulatory decisions. I mean, what stopped that before? Was it just our norms—presidents just didn't do that.

White: It's probably fair to say that some presidents have profited to some extent from the office, but this is certainly a dramatic escalation of directly profiting, and in quite enormous amounts. I think some of it comes down to norms. I think some of it comes down to an unwillingness or inability to investigate and prosecute corruption.

There have been multiple lawmakers calling for investigations into these clear conflicts of interest, and those have largely not gone anywhere, due to the unwillingness of the rest of Congress to step up and look into this type of activity.

Applebaum: Yeah. It seems to me the other big difference is: Other presidents profited after leaving the presidency. They made money from speeches, but I can't think of, in modern times at least, of a president who has earned this kind of money, this fast, while in office.

White: That's absolutely correct.

[Music]

Applebaum: We've been talking about the tangled web of the crypto world and how Trump and his family have personally benefited. But it feels like hardly anyone is talking about how this new source of money—billions of dollars—is also giving the presidency new levels of autonomy and power.

White: It's sort of a chicken-and-an-egg question. To what extent has the authoritarianism enabled the policies that have allowed him to acquire so much cryptocurrency? And then the other way around.

Applebaum: That's after the break.

[Break]

Applebaum: Molly, there is one country that has made crypto a central part of its financial system, and that is El Salvador. It's led by Nayib Bukele, a democratically elected president who has, like Trump, also sought to centralize power and eliminate checks and balances. We know the Trump family admires him. Donald Trump Jr., together with Tucker Carlson, went to Bukele's inauguration in 2024. How has El Salvador's experiment with crypto worked out?

White: Yeah, so El Salvador took a very similar approach, frankly, to bitcoin a number of years ago, where the president essentially unilaterally determined that they were going to create this national fund of bitcoin. They were gonna take money belonging to the country and put it into purchasing bitcoin.

This was not something that was particularly popular among the populace, but it was sort of a unilateral decision by Bukele to sort of foist bitcoin upon the everyday people in El Salvador, who were told to download crypto wallets. Businesses were instructed to begin accepting bitcoin in their day-to-day operations.

And it was ultimately not very beneficial to Salvadoran people. This was government money that could have been used in much more socially beneficial ways that was instead being stockpiled away in crypto investments. There were technical problems with the bitcoin wallet, and the [government] rollout that resulted in people's assets being stolen from them. It was, frankly, fairly disastrous. And so it was a very challenging time for El Salvador.

Applebaum: So it's not as if El Salvador has created this beautiful model that we can just follow.

White: Well, I mean, it sort of seems like Trump and his family have been emulating El Salvador in many ways. But El Salvador is not a great example of, I think, where this country should be going. But it, unfortunately, has strong parallels to Trump, where the president has consolidated power in very alarming ways. He runs the government in a fairly authoritarian way. And he has gone all in on crypto.

Applebaum: Moving back to the United States, how would you describe the Trump administration's regulatory approach in this second term?

White: Well, the strategy so far has been to completely defang financial regulators. You know, there have been executive orders instructing the SEC and [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to essentially back off from the cryptocurrency industry, and the Department of Justice as well. And the people that the Trump administration has been installing at regulators and in these other agencies have largely been coming from the cryptocurrency industry. I mean, we've seen, essentially, this revolving door happening, where many of the people now in charge of regulating the cryptocurrency industry have very direct ties to that industry.

Applebaum: Let me shift now to ask you about the idea of a cryptocurrency reserve, a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve"", or having crypto be part of the deeper bones of the U.S. financial system. Walk us through what that proposal is and how it would work, and then I'll ask you about how it could go wrong.

White: So the “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” and the “Digital Asset Stockpile” were created with sort of an executive order that takes a pile of crypto assets that were already being held by the U.S. government and pledges to continue to hold them rather than sell them. And so the U.S. government actually holds a fairly substantial amount of cryptocurrencies, largely that were seized as a result of law-enforcement activity.

So, for example, if there's, you know, a criminal case against an online drug marketplace or something like that, and they shut that down, they seize the crypto assets, once that case is finished in court, those assets are forfeited to the government. That means that the government essentially has them in their government crypto wallet, and historically they have sold them off. But now the idea is that the government will actually hold those assets in kind and essentially hope to profit from increases in, for example, bitcoin price.

Applebaum: And how could this be damaging? What's wrong with doing that?

White: Well, it's essentially the U.S. government engaging in crypto speculation. These are assets that historically would've gone towards funding various treasury activities. Now they're being held in reserve, and it's unclear under what circumstances that those assets will be used for normal government purposes. It also, you know, we're seeing various members of the government, including people who are very active in defining crypto policy, talking about trying to find ways to add to those holdings by purchasing crypto assets.

You know, we saw this sort of mad scramble when Trump was talking about creating this executive order from various crypto companies that wanted their crypto assets included in this stockpile as well, because they understood that this would be both an endorsement of their crypto assets and would drive demand.

Applebaum: And would this also not give the president access to funds or to money that he could spend as he wants? Money that hasn't been allocated by Congress?

White: I think that's a very serious question. You know, there is not the type of congressional oversight when it comes to spending these types of alternative funds, and it seems to me that this is a way for Trump to essentially create this stockpile of funds that he could then use without much oversight.

Applebaum: So he would have sort of his own slush fund.

White: That's how it seems to me. Yes.

Applebaum: Can you describe the involvement of the crypto industry in the 2024 elections? Was that different from the industry's previous involvement, and what exactly were they trying to achieve?

White: Yeah. So the crypto industry became very heavily involved in the 2024 elections in ways that they had really not been previously. We saw the involvement of these massive, single-issue pro-cryptocurrency super PACs that were getting heavily involved in congressional elections. The industry contributed over $150 million to those super PACs. They spent around $130 million influencing congressional races, where they were hoping to either install pro-crypto candidates or remove people who were viewed to be enemies of the crypto industry. At one point it was almost half of all corporate spending was coming out of the cryptocurrency industry.

Applebaum: Wow. So that's even beyond the scale of spending of the oil-and-gas industry, for example.

White: Yeah, I mean, you look at the size of the crypto industry, which is very small comparatively, and they were spending like the pharma industry, like the oil industry.

And it was very, very overt around the messaging. Basically, the industry saying, If you don't support us, we are going to crush you with millions and millions of dollars in these elections where—these are often states where these crypto companies don't have any real presence, but they are funneling money to control these elections in ways that the actual residents of those states often have very little say in as a result. And so you end up with these corporations contributing huge amounts of money to essentially raise their interests above those of everyday constituents.

Applebaum: So crypto companies are making enormous contributions to state, Senate, and House campaigns, even where they don't even have a physical presence, just to be able to have influence in Congress later on. Tell me about the possibility of using crypto for illegal campaign funding. Money is moved around anonymously so easily in that world. For example, if a foreign national wanted to influence a campaign, could they do it via the crypto industry?

White: Potentially. I mean, we're already seeing these various sort of indirect ways in which foreign nationals and U.S. people are directing funds towards the Trump family, for example. And those are not campaign contributions, but they certainly appear to be influencing policy. You know, essentially, crypto could be a conduit for bribery that is challenging to trace. I mean, one of the goals of crypto is to be fairly anonymous, to make it challenging for people to know where funds are coming from.

Applebaum: Do you expect the industry to be involved in the midterms? Do you expect big investments in campaigns once again?

White: Absolutely. We've already seen these same crypto PACs from 2024 raising money for the 2026 elections. We're actually seeing new super PACs being established. One of them has already committed to spending $100 million in the midterms. And we're seeing politicians and candidates speaking very frankly about wanting to install pro-crypto candidates. I mean, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Tim Scott, recently said the No. 1 thing that the crypto industry can do is fire the legislators that are in your way. So we're seeing very aggressive incitement for these crypto PACs to get very involved in the midterms.

Applebaum: So legislators who support consumer protection, who care about ordinary people not being ripped off—they're the ones who will be the target of the crypto funding in the 2026 elections?

White: Absolutely. I mean, we saw Sherrod Brown, for example, in Ohio. The crypto industry spent $40 million to support his competitor to get him out of office. And Sherrod Brown is going to be running again. And we're already hearing people talking about opposing him because he is such a strong advocate for consumer protections or for actions against big banks, Big Finance. We've seen calls for the industry to come out in force against him.

[Music] 

White: And I think we'll see very similar strategies against other proconsumer protection candidates that run in 2026.

Applebaum: Molly White, thank you.

White: Thank you for having me.

Applebaum: In 2025, unexpected freezes to federal funding created chaos for thousands of labs, research projects, and experimental teams. What does this assault on science have to do with the health of our democracy?

Hospitals, law firms, and tech companies are getting a preview of how AI is likely to reshape work: by automating tasks without eliminating the underlying jobs.

That's the core message Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized in a recent appearance on the No Priors podcast.

In a wide-ranging interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the ""tasks"" involved in a job with the broader ""purpose"" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.

Huang's framing is straightforward: Most jobs contain repeatable tasks that technology can compress, and a broader purpose that remains human-led. He highlighted radiology as a real-world example.

Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would eradicate many radiology jobs and advised students to avoid the field. The opposite happened. While AI is automating many radiology tasks, there are actually more radiologists employed now than when Hinton made his prediction in 2016.

Here are the killer stats, shared in this 2025 blog post that describes why radiologists are still in huge demand: In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions, a 4% increase from 2024, and the field's vacancy rates are at all-time highs. Also, in 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48% percent higher than the average radiologist salary in 2015 (the year before Hinton's prediction).

How did this happen? Huang argued that the job's purpose isn't ""reading scans."" Those are tasks that AI has automated. The true purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, guide treatment, and support those efforts with research. When AI helps clinicians evaluate more images with higher confidence, hospitals can serve more patients, generate more revenue, and justify hiring more specialists.

The same logic, he said, applies across the economy.

""I spend most of my day typing,"" Huang noted, describing typing as a task, not his job's purpose. Tools that automate writing don't eliminate the need for executives; they often expand the amount of work leaders and other employees can take on, he said.

""The fact that somebody could use AI to automate a lot of my typing — I really appreciate that, and it helps a lot,"" he said. ""It hasn't really made me, if you will, less busy. In a lot of ways, I become more busy because I'm able to do more work.""

This ""task versus purpose"" framework is increasingly visible in knowledge work, where AI tools are speeding up and automating tasks such as drafting, summarizing, and generating code.

Huang pointed to software engineering as a case where AI can reduce time spent on a core task (writing code) while raising demand for the job's purpose: solving problems and identifying new ones worth solving.

Nvidia, he said, is hiring aggressively even as AI coding tools such as Cursor spread through the company's engineering teams, because productivity gains allow companies to pursue more ideas. That can boost revenue, leaving more money to hire new staff.

Law is another example he cited. Reading and drafting contracts are tasks, while the purpose of a lawyer is to protect clients and resolve disputes. AI can accelerate document-heavy work, but the role's true value relies on judgment, strategy, and accountability — and you need experienced, trustworthy human attorneys for that.

This even applies to waiters working in a restaurant. Their task is taking food orders, but their purpose is to ensure guests have a great time, Huang said.

""If some AI is taking the order or even delivering the food, their job is still helping us have a great experience,"" the CEO added. ""They would reshape their jobs accordingly.""

Huang's argument isn't that AI won't disrupt roles — it will. But he contends the early evidence points less toward a wholesale collapse of employment and more toward job redesign.

For workers, the implication is pragmatic: if your role is defined primarily by a repeatable task, AI is a direct threat. If it's anchored in outcomes — diagnosis, customer experience, problem-solving, conflict resolution — AI may be less a replacement than a lever, changing what you spend time on while keeping your job's purpose intact.

OpenAI on Friday announced it will begin testing ads within ChatGPT in the coming weeks, a highly anticipated decision that could kickstart a lucrative new revenue stream for the artificial intelligence startup. 

OpenAI said its Plus, Pro and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads, but it plans to start testing them with adult free users in the U.S. The company also made its low-cost Go offering available in the U.S. on Friday, and it said users who opt for that plan will also begin to see ads. 

The company inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in November that the startup was on track to generate $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate last year. 

Introducing ads to ChatGPT could help OpenAI meet its ambitious spending commitments, as digital advertising has long been the cash cow for other big tech companies like Google and Meta. 

Ads within ChatGPT will appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers, and they will be clearly labeled, OpenAI said. 

ChatGPT's responses will not be influenced by ads, and OpenAI said it will ""never"" sell users' data to advertisers, according to a release. 

Users under the age of 18 will not see ads, and ads will not appear near certain topics, including politics, health and mental health, OpenAI said. 

Altman has publicly expressed reservations about introducing ads to ChatGPT in recent years, stating in interviews that doing so could erode users' trust in OpenAI's products. But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads ""at some point,"" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity. 

""We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,"" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.

As OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.

President Donald Trump on Friday said he'd prefer to keep National Economic Council Director Hassett in his position as top economic advisor, a statement that could change the dynamic in the race to see who will replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.

During an appearance in the White House, Trump said, ""I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today.""

""I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,"" he added.

Hassett has been considered a leading contender to take the central bank reigns, competing closely with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and has indicated he will replace Powell when his term as chair ends in May. Hassett and Warsh are two of five finalists for the position, a group that also includes current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.

Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.

Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Powell's term as chair ends in May.

Turning to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, ""We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out.""

After Trump spoke, traders on predictions market site Kalshi raised their bets to a 60% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared to just 16% for Hassett and 14% for Waller. 

As recently as Wednesday, Warsh and Hassett were in a near dead heat.

""It is not certain this is a definitive signal – the President has given various signals at various times and appears to enjoy the drama of this Celebrity Apprentice season – but it does look as if the former Fed governor is for the first time the clear front-runner,"" wrote Krishna Guha, head global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.

Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh leading Hassett 60% to 15% and Waller at 13%. Traders are giving little odds to BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, the other two candidates considered finalists. 

Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.

The Town of Rosetown is reminding residents of its Civic Addressing Bylaw, which requires all houses and buildings to display assigned street numbers that are clearly visible from the roadway.

Bylaw #709-15 provides for the numbering of houses and buildings throughout the community. Each house or building must bear the number assigned to the frontage where the main entrance is located.

Town officials say visible civic addressing plays an important role in public safety, helping emergency services quickly locate properties when responding to calls.

Residents are encouraged to ensure their address numbers are properly displayed and easily seen from the street to avoid delays in emergency response.

The town notes that maintaining visible address numbers is a simple step that can save valuable time when it matters most.

What Is Beige Fat, and Is It Healthy?

This mysterious type of fat cell may play an important role in heart health, new research shows

When we think about fat, we most often think about white fat cells, which store excess calories like so many batteries, providing insulation and cushioning for our muscles, bones and organs. But not all fat is white: mammals also have brown fat—so named for its rusty color, thanks to a high concentration of iron-rich mitochondria—which does the opposite, burning energy to keep the body warm. And then there is beige fat.

First proposed to exist in 2008, beige fat is located in white fat tissue, but it functions like brown fat, burning energy efficiently when exposed to cold temperatures. In recent years a growing body of evidence has suggested that beige fat may play an important role in heart health.

“There's enough data out there to say that beige fat is good for human health,” says Bruce Spiegelman, a researcher at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and a professor of cell biology and medicine at Harvard Medical School, who proposed the existence of beige fat and was first to isolate beige fat cells in 2012. “For me, it's settled science now.”

A new study published in Science on Thursday adds to that evidence: it shows that beige fat helps lower blood pressure in mice. High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The study, led by researchers at Rockefeller University, builds on previous work in humans showing a correlation between brown fat and lower blood pressure.

In humans, brown fat is most prevalent in infants and primarily located in stores between our shoulder blades. Scientists believe this fat, as in other mammals, is meant to keep us warm in cold temperatures. But as we age, most of this brown fat recedes. What researchers call beige fat, meanwhile, is found above our diaphragms and along our necks and upper spine. Like brown fat, it burns energy to release heat when exposed to cold.

In 2021 Paul Cohen, an associate professor at Rockefeller University who studies obesity, published a paper showing that people with more brown fat were less likely to have type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and high blood pressure. That prompted new questions, Cohen says.

“Is this link between brown fat and hypertension [high blood pressure] just an association?” says Cohen, who is also an author on the new Science paper. “Or is there a causal relationship?”

Cohen and his colleagues found that mice bred without beige fat had higher blood pressure than mice with that kind of fat—evidence for a causal relationship.

“If we just change the identity of the adipose tissue, we do see that these mice have an increase in blood pressure,” says Mascha Koenen, a postdoctoral researcher in Cohen's lab and a co-author on the new study.

The team also found that removing beige fat influenced the production of an enzyme called QSOX1 that can alter blood vessels and drive up blood pressure.

This finding is particularly interesting, says Biao Wang, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies the development of fat tissue. By identifying a mechanism through which beige fat cells may regulate blood pressure, it opens the door to further human studies.

And, Wang says, it raises a new question: “What else can beige fat secrete?”

Cohen and his colleagues hope the new study will help elucidate how beige and brown fat affect human health. “Hopefully this kind of work will lead to newer therapies and more personalized therapies based on a patient's specific characteristics that might be better suited to control blood pressure,” Cohen says. Obesity is also correlated with lower levels of brown fat and higher levels of white fat, Spiegelman says, but more research is needed to fully understand why.

As to how to increase beige and brown fat levels, researchers are not entirely sure, but they have a few theories. In rodents, at least, factors such as a healthy diet, exercise and exposure to cold can help “move the needle,” Spiegelman says.

“Here, it turns out there are other quantum knobs we can play with to manipulate states of matter.”

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists from Florida State University are highlighting a weird state of matter in research that appears now in the peer reviewed journal Nature Partner Journals Quantum Materials. As it turns out, under the right conditions, carefully patterned electrons enter what the researchers are calling a “pinball state,” where their charge attraction switches on and off. The team was able to achieve this state by creating a very specific version of what's known as a Wigner crystal—a substance made entirely and exclusively of densely packed electrons—using a super high-tech “stencil.” 

This “stencil” took the form of a specially prepared surface called moiré. In daily life, we see moiré patterns regularly—if you've seen a striped shirt appear to “vibrate” on TV, that's one example of moiré. In science, the idea of moiré is fundamentally pretty similar, but instead of those trippy-looking patterns being artifacts of video resolution, they are the results of layers of incredibly thin, carefully patterned films being stacked on top of each other and slightly offset. 

And ‘incredibly thin' is no overstatement—more and more, scientists engineer nanomaterials that are just one molecule, atom, or particle thick. The thickness itself isn't new—electroplating dates back to 1805, and produces layers that qualify as technical “thin films” that are mere micrometers thick. But these films can still take on novel forms, being designed with patterns or shaped into carbon nanotubes, for example.

When the “stencil” (made of two layers of moiré film) was placed on a material called a substrate, and electrons were introduced into the system, those electrons organized themselves in accordance with the “stencil” into a Wigner crystal. And from there, the scientists were able to tweak variables like density and temperature to create something never seen before.

“In our study, we determined which ‘quantum knobs' to turn to trigger this phase transition and achieve a generalized Wigner crystal,” Hitesh J. Changlani, a coauthor of the study, said in a Florida State statement, “which uses a 2D moiré system and allows different crystalline shapes to form, like stripes or honeycomb crystals, unlike traditional Wigner crystals that only show a triangular lattice crystal.”

In other words, the ‘typical' triangular Wigner crystal seen in a two-layer system can be twisted and tuned until its potential, and the potential energy in its system, is maximized. And under the right, weird conditions (and in the right, weird shapes), the system can “bounce” between states of matter like a pinball. This behavior was previously theorized, the researchers explain, but their more-realized computer model shows that the pinball state is plausible in real life... but maybe only inside a near-absolute-zero freezer.

“Our work addresses currently unresolved aspects of these experiments, contributing to the theoretical understanding of the moiré TMD [twisted metal dichalcogenide] systems and presenting both zero-temperature and finite-temperature studies in a unified framework,” the team wrote. “[One] objective,” they continued, “is to understand the finite temperature melting of these [generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs)],” and another was to probe the stability of the layered model that fosters the GWCs.

The “partially melted” or “pinball liquid” phase, they found, is unexpectedly stable (though, with quantum states at near absolute zero temperatures, stability is relative). In this phase, some electrons “want to freeze and others want to float around, which means that some are insulating and some are conducting electricity,” Cyprian Lewandowski, one of the authors of this study, said in a press release. “This is the first time this unique quantum mechanical effect has been observed and reported for the electron density we studied in our work.”

And while it's less glamorous than the pinball state, in this paper, the researchers also found some ways that physicists studying GWCs can liken parts of their systems to other models in order to clarify their work. These imperfect or partial analogies could help shake loose further insights and paths of inquiry and are essential to science.

The team behind this work knows that this line of research is far from over.“[W]hen you think of turning a liquid into gas, you picture turning up a heat knob to get water to boil into steam,” Lewandowski said in the statement. “Here, it turns out there are other quantum knobs we can play with to manipulate states of matter, which can lead to impressive advances in experimental research.”

The digested meat from the wolf pup's last meal, which took place a staggering 14,400 years ago, contained enough DNA from the woolly rhino to sequence its entire genome.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

After 14,400 years, the final meal of a Siberian wolf pup has contributed massively to science and our understanding of the now-extinct woolly rhinoceros. For the first time ever, researchers have sequenced an entire genome of an Ice Age animal thanks to what was found inside the stomach of another animal.  

Over a decade ago, a pair of Siberian wolf pups were pulled from the permafrost near the village of Tumat in northeast Siberia. One pup had its final meal still preserved inside its stomach, a piece of flesh from the now-extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis).

Radiocarbon dating placed the pup's last meal at roughly 14,400 years ago, about 400 years before the extinction of the woolly rhinoceros, an animal that was similar in size to the modern white rhino. The woolly rhino was a cold-adapted herbivore with a robust coat of hair that allowed it to better survive the harsh temperatures, though they still evidently fall prey to a hungry wolf pup (more likely an entire hungry wolf pack).

In a new study published in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution, scientists explained how they sequenced a high-coverage genome from the muscle tissues of the woolly rhino found inside the wolf, one of the youngest specimens of the animal ever discovered. 

“Sequencing the entire genome of an Ice Age animal found in the stomach of another animal has never been done before,” said Camilo Chacon-Duque, study author and formerly a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, in a statement. “Recovering genomes from individuals that lived right before extinction is challenging, but it can provide important clues on what caused the species to disappear, which may also be relevant for the conservation of endangered species today.” 

The team compared genome-wide diversity, inbreeding, genetic load, and population size changes in the new sample with two other Late Pleistocene Siberian woolly rhinos, one sample from around 18,000 years ago and the other from about 49,000 years ago. 

“It was really exciting, but also very challenging, to extract a complete genome from such an unusual sample,” said student Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir, the study's lead author who worked on the project while doing her master's thesis at Stockholm University.

“Our analyses showed a surprisingly stable genetic pattern with no change in inbreeding levels through tens of thousands of years prior to the extinction of woolly rhinos,” said Edna Lord, formerly a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics. 

The results imply the woolly rhinos had a viable population for 15,000 years after the first humans were thought to have arrived in northeastern Siberia, which suggests that climate warming rather than human hunting caused the extinction, according to the study authors. 

“We found no evidence of population size decline, nor any genomic erosion, shortly prior to the species' demise,” the study authors wrote. “Given the few long homozygous segments, typically indicative of recent inbreeding, we infer a stable population size only a few centuries before extinction.” 

The authors concluded that the woolly rhinoceros' extinction likely occurred rapidly. The wolves likely didn't help, either.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Ads Are Coming to ChatGPT. Here's How They'll Work","https://www.wired.com/story/openai-testing-ads-us/","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:00:00 GMT","

OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside ChatGPT in the coming weeks, marking a significant shift for one of the world's most widely used AI products. The company announced Friday that initial ad tests will roll out in the United States before expanding globally.

OpenAI says ads will not influence ChatGPT's responses, and that all ads will appear in separate, clearly labeled boxes directly below the chatbot's answer. For instance, if a user asks ChatGPT for help planning a trip to New York City, they will still get a standard answer from the chatbot, and then they also might see an ad for a hotel in the area.

“People trust ChatGPT for many important and personal tasks, so as we introduce ads, it's crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” wrote OpenAI CEO of applications Fidji Simo in a blog post announcing the ad trial. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT's responses are driven by what's objectively useful, never by advertising.”

The first ads will appear for logged-in users on ChatGPT's free tier, as well as its $8-a-month Go tier, which will begin to roll out to users in the United States on Friday. The Go tier—which is already available in India, France, and other countries—lets users send more messages and generate more images than the free version. OpenAI says users on its Plus, Pro, and Enterprise subscriptions will not see ads.

OpenAI also outlined the principles guiding its approach to advertising.

The company says it will not sell user data or expose conversations with ChatGPT to advertisers. That means advertisers won't be able to see information about a user's age, location, or interests; this is often the case when users are targeted with ads across much of the internet.

Instead, an OpenAI spokesperson told WIRED the company will let advertisers see aggregate ad performance metrics, such as how many times an ad was shown in ChatGPT or how many users clicked on it.

To determine which ads it shows people, OpenAI says it will match conversation topics to relevant advertisements. Some of a user's personalization data may be used in that process, the spokesperson said, but the company says users can turn off the data used for advertising without turning off ChatGPT's other personalization features.

The spokesperson declined to detail exactly what data OpenAI will collect on users to serve relevant ads, but ChatGPT already collects lots of other data to improve the chatbot's responses. Users can ask the chatbot to remember personal traits—such as hobbies, dietary restrictions, and other preferences—to tailor responses, and OpenAI has expanded the product's memory features over the past year so that ChatGPT can reference prior chats in its responses. The company says in its blog post that “users can clear the data used for ads at any time.”

OpenAI says there are circumstances in which ads should never appear in ChatGPT, such as conversations on sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health, or politics. OpenAI also says it will not serve ads to users it believes are under 18, either because the user told them so, or an age-prediction model the company plans to roll out soon determined them to be a minor.

OpenAI says it plans to share more about how businesses can advertise within ChatGPT in the coming weeks. Simo suggests in her blog post that the company is exploring more interactive ad experiences within ChatGPT.

“Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,” said Simo. “For example, soon you might see an ad and be able to directly ask the questions you need to make a purchase decision.”

The introduction of ads into ChatGPT has long seemed inevitable. The chatbot has quickly grown into one of the largest consumer products on the internet, with more than 800 million weekly active users, the majority of whom never pay OpenAI a dollar. Massive consumer platforms typically have already started building out massive advertising businesses by the time they reach this scale.

OpenAI could use a business like that right about now. The decade-old company has raised roughly $64 billion from investors over its lifetime, and it generated only a fraction of that in revenue last year. Competition from rivals like Google Gemini has only amped up the pressure for OpenAI to monetize ChatGPT's massive audience.

It seems clear that ads will be a major part of OpenAI's business moving forward, and Simo will be a key decisionmaker in how they're rolled out. The key question is how the company can do so without degrading the user experience. Simo acknowledges that tension in her blog post, even suggesting that ads will help the company offer more powerful AI systems to more people. She also says OpenAI does not optimize for time spent in ChatGPT, like many social media apps do, and the company prioritizes “user trust and user experience over revenue.”

While ChatGPT ads are just a trial for now, internet users are all too familiar with the platforms they love speeding down the long winding road to enshittification as business incentives take priority over user experience. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously acknowledged the failures of the social media era, including the negative effects that addictive algorithms have had on society. As ads evolve in ChatGPT over the coming years, the challenge for OpenAI will be to not repeat those mistakes.

Satish Thomas, a 20-year veteran of Microsoft who spent two decades at the Redmond tech giant, is taking a new job at Google.

“I'm joining during what feels like one of the most consequential moments in tech history — right in the heart of the AI era,” Thomas wrote on LinkedIn. He did not specify what role he's taking at Google. 

Thomas said Microsoft “shaped me in ways I never imaged.” He began his two-decade run at the company as an intern. “I'm deeply grateful to the amazing people and teams I've had the privilege to work with,” he said. “Leaving isn't easy — but some opportunities are so special and unique that you just have to go for them.”

Thomas spent the past six years as a corporate vice president at Microsoft, where he led strategy, product management, and engineering execution for Microsoft Cloud for Industry. He previously held leadership roles in Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. 

— Raji Rajagopalan has a new role at Microsoft: GitHub's vice president of engineering.

Rajagopalan has been with the tech giant for more than 20 years, joining the company as a software engineer. She's leaving the Microsoft Foundry Team for the new role.

“My goal is to help GitHub continue to be the place loved by devs, where innovation happens and human-agent workflows thrive, as we move into this new era of AI-driven development,” Rajagopalan said on LinkedIn.

— Katie Bardaro is senior VP of customer experience at Avante, a Seattle startup building software to help companies decrease HR administration workload and reduce overall benefits program costs. It also offers an AI assistant designed to provide benefits guidance to employees.

“What drew me here is the opportunity to work at the intersection of data, AI, and total rewards, all while helping companies and employees navigate one of the most complex (and impactful) parts of the employee experience: benefits,” Bardaro said on LinkedIn. 

Bardaro was previously chief customer officer at Syndio, a company that analyzes workplace pay equity issues and provides strategies for fixing disparities. Prior to that she was at Payscale for more than a decade. 

— Vivek Sharma is leaving Stripe for a cryptic new venture focused on “AI's potential to fundamentally change how people work.”

Sharma, who has held executive roles at Microsoft and Meta, didn't provide further details about the stealthy startup in a LinkedIn post, but did name his collaborators:

“More details coming soon,” Sharma said of the startup. “But if you want to be an early adopter or just want to chat, please reach out!”

— Jeff Carr is now CEO of Atana, a startup building workplace training content that incorporates behavior-based learning and development. Carr joined the Bellevue company in August as president. He succeeds Atana co-founder and former CEO John Hansen, who will remain as executive chair.

In announcing the news, Hansen said that Carr “aligned with Atana's vision immediately and has been instrumental in bringing us into new opportunities and new strategic relationships in a very short period of time.”

Carr has held multiple CEO roles in the past, including leadership of workforce training company Inkling and at the HR company PeopleFluent.

Atana originally launched in 1993. Hansen, a startup veteran and longtime lecturer at the University of Washington, acquired the business in 2016 and oversaw the expansion of new learning content.  

— Longtime Microsoft gaming leader Larry Hyrb shared on LinkedIn that he was laid off from Unity after 18 months on the job.

Hyrb, known by his longtime handle “Major Nelson,” left Microsoft in 2023 after more than two decades in corporate communications, promoting the launches of games and other products. He was the host of one of the company's earliest podcasts, Major Nelson Radio, which later became Xbox Podcast.

At Unity, a San Francisco-based gaming company, Hyrb worked with the Community and Advocacy Team, supporting connections among creators, developers and gamers.

— Serial tech entrepreneur Jay Bartot is now a technical advisor and chief technologist for TheFounderVC, a Seattle-based venture capital firm that launched in 2024. 

Bartot is also co-founder and CTO of the software startup AirSignal, an affiliate professor at the UW, and a startup mentor at Creative Destruction Lab. 

Bartot said on LinkedIn that he looks forward to working with the TheFounderVC team “to help exceptional early-stage founders build the next generation of great Vertical AI companies and products.”

— Auger, a startup building logistics and supply chain software, named Tucker Reimer as principal of supply chain innovation. Reimer joins the Bellevue startup from the Johnsonville sausage company where he served as vice president of global planning and analytics.

Dave Clark, the former Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO and Flexport CEO, launched Auger in 2024 with $100 million in Series A funding.

— Lucas Dickey joined Stripe as a product builder focused on Stripe Atlas, a tool that helps entrepreneurs incorporate their business.

Dickey said on LinkedIn that he has used Atlas four times to start his own companies and aligns with Stripe's goal of “making the administrative layer a breeze — and helping new companies start strong from day one.” 

His startups include Deepcast, a podcast platform, and Fernish, a decor-focused business that was acquired.

On Tuesday, U.K.-based Iranian activist Nariman Gharib tweeted redacted screenshots of a phishing link sent to him via a WhatsApp message.

“Do not click on suspicious links,” Gharib warned. The activist, who is following the digital side of the Iranian protests from afar, said the campaign targeted people involved in Iran-related activities, such as himself.

This hacking campaign comes as Iran grapples with the longest nationwide internet shutdown in its history, as anti-government protests — and violent crackdowns — rage across the country. Given that Iran and its closest adversaries are highly active in the offensive cyberspace (read: hacking people), we wanted to learn more. 

Gharib shared the full phishing link with TechCrunch soon after his post, allowing us to capture a copy of the source code of the phishing web page used in the attack. He also shared a write-up of his findings.

TechCrunch analyzed the source code of the phishing page, and with added input from security researchers, we believe the campaign aimed to steal Gmail and other online credentials, compromise WhatsApp accounts, and conduct surveillance by stealing location data, photos, and audio recordings. 

It is unclear, however, if the hackers were government-linked agents, spies, or cybercriminals — or all three. 

TechCrunch also identified a way to view a real-time copy of all the victims' responses saved on the attacker's server, which was left exposed and accessible without a password. This data revealed dozens of victims who had unwittingly entered their credentials into the phishing site and were subsequently likely hacked.

The list includes a Middle Eastern academic working in national security studies; the boss of an Israeli drone maker; a senior Lebanese cabinet minister; at least one journalist; and people in the United States or with U.S. phone numbers. 

TechCrunch is publishing our findings after validating much of Gharib's report. The phishing site is now down.

According to Gharib, the WhatsApp message he received contained a suspicious link, which loaded a phishing site in the victim's browser.

The link shows that the attackers relied on a dynamic DNS provider called DuckDNS for their phishing campaign. Dynamic DNS providers allow people to connect easy-to-remember web addresses — in this case, a duckdns.org subdomain — to a server where its IP address might frequently change. 

It's not clear whether the attackers shut down the phishing site of their own accord or were caught and cut off by DuckDNS. We reached out to DuckDNS with inquiries, but its owner Richard Harper requested that we send an abuse report instead.

From what we understand, the attackers used DuckDNS to mask the real location of the phishing page, presumably to make it look like a genuine WhatsApp link. 

The phishing page was actually hosted at alex-fabow.online, a domain that was first registered in early November 2025. This domain has several other, related domains hosted on the same dedicated server, and these domain names follow a pattern that suggests the campaign also targeted other providers of virtual meeting rooms, like meet-safe.online and whats-login.online.

We're not sure what happens while the DuckDNS link loads in the victim's browser, or how the link determines which specific phishing page to load. It may be that the DuckDNS link redirects the target to a specific phishing page based on information it gleans from the user's device.

The phishing page would not load in our web browser, preventing us from directly interacting with it. Reading the source code of the page, however, allowed us to better understand how the attack worked.

Depending on the target, tapping on a phishing link would open a fake Gmail login page, or ask for their phone number, and begin an attack flow aimed at stealing their password and two-factor authentication code. 

But the source code of the phishing page code had at least one flaw: TechCrunch found that by modifying the phishing page's URL in our web browser, we could view a file on the attacker's servers that was storing records of every victim who had entered their credentials. 

The file contained over 850 records of information submitted by victims during the attack flow. These records detailed each part of the phishing flow that the victim was in. This included copies of the usernames and passwords that victims had entered on the phishing page, as well as incorrect entries and their two-factor codes, effectively serving as a keylogger. 

The records also contained each victim's user agent, a string of text that identifies the operating system and browser versions used to view websites. This data shows that the campaign was designed to target Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Android users.

The exposed file allowed us to follow the attack flow step-by-step for each victim. In one case, the exposed file shows a victim clicking on a malicious link, which opened a page that looked like a Gmail sign-in window. The log shows the victim entering their email credentials several times until they enter the correct password. 

The records show the same victim entering their two-factor authentication code sent to them by text message. We can tell this because Google sends two-factor codes in a specific format (usually G-xxxxxx, featuring a six-digit numerical code).

Beyond credential theft, this campaign also seemed to enable surveillance by tricking victims into sharing their location, audio, and pictures from their device.

In Gharib's case, tapping on the link in the phishing message opened a fake WhatsApp-themed page in his browser, which displayed a QR code. The lure aims to trick the target into scanning the code on their device, purportedly to access a virtual meeting room.

Gharib said the QR code was generated by the attacker, and scanning or tapping it would instantly link the victim's WhatsApp account to a device controlled by the attacker, granting them access to the victim's data. This is a long-known attack technique that abuses the WhatsApp device linking feature and has been similarly abused to target users of messaging app Signal.

We asked Granitt founder Runa Sandvik, a security researcher who works to help secure at-risk individuals, to examine a copy of the phishing page code and see how it functions. 

Sandvik found that when the page loaded, the code would trigger a browser notification asking the user for permission to access their location (via navigator.geolocation), as well as photos and audio (navigator.getUserMedia). 

If accepted, the browser would immediately send the person's coordinates to the attacker, capable of identifying the location of the victim. The page would then continue to share the victim's location data every few seconds, for as long as the page remained open. 

The code also allowed the attackers to record bursts of audio and snap photos every three to five seconds using the device camera. However, we did not see any location data, audio, or images that had been collected on the server.

We do not know who is behind this campaign. What is clear is that the campaign was successful in stealing credentials from victims, and it is possible that the phishing campaign could resurface. 

Despite knowing the identities of some of the people in this cluster of victims who were targeted, we don't have enough information to understand the nature of the campaign. The number of victims hacked by this campaign (that we know of) is fairly low — fewer than 50 individuals — and affects seemingly ordinary people across the Kurdish community, as well as academics, government officials, business leaders, and other senior figures across the broader Iranian diaspora and Middle East.

It may be that there are far more victims than we are aware of, which could help us understand who was targeted and potentially why.

It is unclear what motivated the hackers to steal people's credentials and hijack their WhatsApp accounts, which could also help identify who is behind this hacking campaign.

A government-backed group, for example, might want to steal the email password and two-factor codes of a high-value target, like a politician or journalist, so they can download private and confidential information.

That could make sense since Iran is currently almost entirely cut off from the outside world, and getting information in or out of the country presents a challenge. Both the Iranian government, or a foreign government with interests in Iran's affairs, could plausibly want to know who influential Iranian-linked individuals are communicating with, and what about.

As such, the timing of this phishing campaign and who it appears to be targeting could point to an espionage campaign aimed at trying to collect information about a narrow list of people.

We asked Gary Miller, a security researcher at Citizen Lab and mobile espionage expert, to also review the phishing code and some of the exposed data from the attacker's server. 

Miller said the attack “certainly [had] the hallmarks of an IRGC-linked spearphishing campaign,” referring to highly targeted email hacks carried out by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a faction of Iran's military known for carrying out cyberattacks. Miller pointed to a mix of indications, including the international scope of victim targeting, credential theft, the abuse of popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp, and social engineering techniques used in the phishing link.

On the other hand, a financially motivated hacker could use the same stolen Gmail password and two-factor code of another high-value target, such as a company executive, to steal proprietary and sensitive business information from their inbox. The hacker could also forcibly reset passwords of their victim's cryptocurrency and bank accounts to empty their wallets.

The campaign's focus on accessing a victim's location and device media, however, is unusual for a financially motivated actor, who might have little use for pictures and audio recordings.

We asked Ian Campbell, a threat researcher at DomainTools, which helps analyze public internet records, to look at the domain names used in the campaign to help understand when they were first set up, and if these domains were connected to any other previously known or identified infrastructure. 

Campbell found that while the campaign targeted victims in the midst of Iran's ongoing nationwide protests, its infrastructure had been set up weeks ago. He added that most of the domains connected to this campaign were registered in early November 2025, and one related domain was created months back in August 2025. Campbell described the domains as medium to high risk and said they appear to be linked to a cybercrime operation driven by financial motivations.

An additional wrinkle is that Iran's government has been known to outsource cyberattacks to criminal hacking groups, presumably to shield its involvement in hacking operations against its citizens. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned Iranian companies in the past for acting as fronts for Iran's IRGC and conducting cyberattacks, such as launching targeted phishing and social engineering attacks. 

As Miller notes, “This drives home the point that clicking on unsolicited WhatsApp links, no matter how convincing, is a high-risk, unsafe practice.”

But what I'd like to understand is why there are so many of the same thing. I know I've seen this exact idea multiple times on HN. It's funny the first time, but once it's done once and the novelty is gone (which is almost immediately), what's the point of another and another and another?

reply

I have home made url shorteners in go, rust, java, python, php, elixir, typescript, etc. why? because I'm trying the language and this kind of project touches on many things: web, databases, custom logic, how and what design patterns can I apply using as much of the language as I can to build the thing.

reply

I'm not criticising the author or anyone who came before. I'm trying to understand the impetus between redoing a joke that isn't yours. You don't learn anything new by redoing the exact same gag that you wouldn't learn by being even slightly original or making the project truly useful.Ideas are a dime a dozen. You could make e.g. a Fonzie URL shortener (different lengths of “ayyyyy”), or an interstellar one (each is the name of a space object), or a binary one (all ones and zeroes)… Each of those would take about the same effort and teach you the same, but they're also different enough they would make some people remember them, maybe even look at the author and their other projects, instead of just “oh, another one of these, close”.

Giving the author the benefit of the doubt, they may have not seen it before, or was bored and just wanted to make a toy.And it seems like many in HN are in enough a similar boat to me to have up voted it to trending, so at least some people found it entertaining, so it fulfilled its purpose I suppose.It's a good question though, and I don't think anyone really knows the answer.

For example, the healthcare.gov emails. For links to that domain, they would still transform them with lnks.gd, even though:1) The emails would be very long and flashy, so they're clearly not economizing on space.2) The ""shortened"" URL was usually longer!3) That domain doesn't let you go straight to the root and check where the transformed URL is going.It's training users to do the very things that expose them to scammers!

While this seems like it would make it harder for them I wouldn't be surprised if scammers eventually try to abuse this service too and I have no doubt that people would happily click these if they found in them in a phishing email, that said I give the folks behind this a lot of credit for having a way to contact them and report links if that happens.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

We were never going to work in virtual reality. Anybody who ever plugged their noggin into a headset and tried to complete their daily grind knew it was never going to happen. Now Meta—the company that forced us to consider a future where all office drones are stuck inside VR headsets—is ready to pull the plug on VR and force us to accept the next inevitable step—working behind the screens of AR glasses.

Meta is finally excising Horizon Workrooms because, as the company put it in an updated help page describing the change, Horizon “has since developed into a social platform that supports a wide range of productivity apps and tools.” Workrooms will be kaput effective Feb. 16. If you were one of the few people making use of the augmented reality avatar-filled workspace, Meta suggests you instead use apps like Remote Desktop, Microsoft Teams Immersive, or Zoom Workspace.

Meta first introduced Workrooms back in 2021 when the pandemic had effectively shuttered most white-collar workers inside their home offices. Back before Facebook changed its name to Meta, and Oculus was still the name the company used for its VR headsets, Workrooms offered users the option to take a few blocky, lifeless avatars and sit them around boardroom meeting tables to collaborate, just as if their physical bodies occupied the same meatspace. Users could also customize their workroom with a remote desktop and keyboard, so they didn't need to take off the headset to keep their productivity flowing.

Beyond the dystopian nature of being forced to work in virtual or augmented reality, the main problem with Workrooms is the same issue that plagues most all-in-one headsets: they're uncomfortable to wear for more than a few hours at a time. These headsets inevitably lead to eye strain and fatigue, requiring constant breaks. If your meeting drags on for more than 30 minutes, the novelty of seeing an avatar instead of a flat Zoom window quickly wears off.

Workrooms was inherently limited. You can't easily multitask when your field of view is limited to 104 degrees horizontally. If you need to check your phone, you either have to take off the headset, switch to a mirroring app, or cast your screen to the headset. While a power user who loves VR/AR may not that bothered, the average user whose boss forced them into a headset would find the experience excruciating. The Apple Vision Pro offers similar features to host group meetings using more lifelike Personas. However, you'll still find that you'll eventually need to take off the heavy headset for the sake of your face and neck muscles.

The end of Workrooms is likely tied to the cuts Meta made to its Reality Labs division. The company reportedly cut roughly 1,500 jobs from the Reality Labs division responsible for its AR and VR projects. The Mark Zuckerberg-led tech giant also axed numerous game studios responsible for some of the most lauded video game titles in VR. Aftermath reported on Wednesday that the layoffs also impacted Camoflaj, the studio behind Batman: Arkham Shadow. That game was one of the big launch titles for the Meta Quest 3S back at the tail end of 2024.

If business in VR or VR gaming is not the right call, then what's left? It's clear now that Zuck and co. don't see virtual reality as a winning gamble anymore. Instead, the company's latest obsessions are AR glasses and AI.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display offers the first hint of a future where we'll never be able to avoid our screens. The device's app offerings are currently limited, but they do support some POV video call features. However, I can already imagine glasses that use a Vision Pro-like persona plus POV footage for hosting work meetings. There are also glasses showing us how they could be used for livestreaming as well. Judging by the progress of face-based wearables, the promise of everlasting Zoom meetings forced in front of our eyes isn't quite dead yet.

Just like RAM, expect them to be made of unobtainium in short order

A keen-eyed Reddit user caught a brainwave while browsing for high-capacity SSDs and was struck with the following thought: with the AI-infused silicon shortages, we've reached the point where NVMe gumstick-style SSDs are more expensive than gold by weight. The thread generated discussion aplenty, so we figured we'd dig into this and look up pricing and weight across a range of models. Spoiler alert: It's very much true for 8 TB drives and quickly heading there for 4 TB models.

We compiled multiple searches from Newegg, Microcenter, Best Buy, and Walmart, collecting over a hundred sample points. The requirements were: NVMe SSDs on a PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 interface, with four terabytes of capacity, sold by the store itself, and in stock. The selection excluded enterprise drives, as those would quickly throw off the math, plus everyone knows they are priced like antimatter anyway.

Collecting the average weight for these SSDs yields an average of 8.2 g for 8 TB SSDs and 8 g for 4 TB models. An eyeball look says that dual-sided, higher-capacity drives don't appreciably increase their weight. Needless to say, only models without heatsinks were considered.

 




Gold is currently sitting at a shiny $148 per gram, so even picking the lower boundary of SSD weight at 8 grams, that makes your average SSD worth around $1,148. And guess what? The average price for an 8 TB consumer drive is around $1,476, and far higher than that if you want a performance unit instead of just a mass-storage model. So yes, at 8 TB, solid-state drives are indeed pricier than gold. But the story doesn't stop there.

Even 4 TB drives aren't immune to high pricing, with a portion of models now also hitting prices close to the equivalent in gold grams. Interestingly, there's definitely a strong divide between higher-priced units. Bar some exceptions, the majority of the sub-$800 space is made of mass-storage models, indicating that if you want both performance and capacity, be ready to loosen the purse strings.

There's also a divide by manufacturer, too. The upper echelons of the price ranks are filled almost exclusively by Western Digital (Sandisk) models, with relatively few offerings from competitors.

It's hard to read the tea leaves here. A cursory observation would state that WD is pricing itself out of the market, but it may be that WD drives are in high demand, and new stock is coming in at much higher prices. Anyone who's been shopping for SSDs recently certainly has noticed a rising trend overall, and PCPartPicker's price tracker illustrates this.

The graph above for 4 TB drives illustrates the trend very clearly, with an exceedingly sharp rise in the past two months. Also note the much wider distribution in prices (the gray area), potentially illustrating the wave of old-price stock going away.

For now, it's still easy to obtain speedy 4 TB drives around the $600-$800 mark, like the Corsair MP700 Elite or Samsung 9100 Pro. However, our guess is that those offerings are all but guaranteed to dry up really quickly, so if you're on the fence for buying one of them, it's best to pull the trigger right away on one of the best SSDs. And even mass-storage units around $500 like won't last long, either.

Knee pain is one of the most frequent musculoskeletal problems encountered in clinical practice, affecting individuals across all age groups and activity levels. It can occur from overuse injuries, degenerative conditions, biomechanical imbalances, and systemic factors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and treatment strategies is essential for effective patient care.

Exercise and risk for knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis has been a controversial topic, but current research decisively indicates that for most patients, it should be part of mainstay treatment.

In a randomized controlled trial, researchers found that women with grade II knee osteoarthritis who received a combination of polyvagal exercise and knee-strengthening training experienced significantly greater reductions in joint pain, stiffness, and functional limitations compared with the group that received knee reinforcement alone.

In a prospective cohort study of marathon runners, cumulative number of years running, mean running pace, number of marathons completed, and weekly mileage did not significantly predict risk for arthritis.

In an updated review, researchers found that running was not associated with risk for worsened patient outcomes or radiologic signs of knee osteoarthritis, and the sport might also have protective benefits against generalized knee pain in both male and female patients.

A review found that patients with elevated alpha-gal allergen-specific immunoglobulin E levels reported higher rates of aching, knee pain, or stiffness compared to patients with other tick-borne illnesses.

In a prospective cohort study, higher sagittal knee moment was associated with a lower risk of developing knee pain within 24 months of baseline assessment compared with a control group. A literature review indicated that low muscle mass index and sarcopenic obesity, not increased skeletal muscle mass, were associated with higher odds of developing knee osteoarthritis. In another literature review, bilateral knee pain, rather than unilateral, was associated with persistent knee pain.

Radiography is recommended as part of the workup to exclude other causes of knee pain. Arthroscopy is the criterion standard for diagnosing internal derangements of the knee and cartilage defects.

Histologic findings in patients with plica syndrome can vary. MRI has limited value in detecting plicae, whether normal or pathologic, around the knee. Evidence supports clinical assessment together with MRI to diagnose chondral defects and other internal knee derangements. It was also found that clinical tests were less reliable in grading anterior cruciate ligament tears, chondral injuries, and meniscal tears.

Learn more about knee joint anatomy.

A review published in JAMA indicated that bucket-handle tears are likely to require surgical repair. In addition, the investigators found that surgical referral for knee joint replacement might be appropriate for patients with end-stage osteoarthritis after all appropriate conservative options have been tried (eg, in patients who cannot cope with pain or who have no or minimal joint space).

For degenerative meniscal tears, exercise therapy is the preferred initial treatment. Surgical intervention is not recommended, even when mechanical symptoms such as locking or catching are present. Bursitis is generally managed conservatively; surgery is reserved only for recurrent or refractory cases after nonoperative treatment. Surgery is rarely indicated for iliotibial band syndrome.

Learn more about meniscal injury.

In patients with patellofemoral pain, strengthening the hip muscles, particularly the abductors and external rotators, should be prioritized. Research indicates that weak hip muscles can cause excessive femoral internal rotation and adduction during movement, disrupting normal patellar tracking and contributing to knee pain. Strengthening these muscle groups helps restore proper alignment and reduces stress on the patellofemoral joint.

Although strengthening the knee can be part of a comprehensive program, it does not substantially increase knee extensor strength or improve outcomes compared with hip-focused training. Calf raises target the lower leg and have minimal impact on the factors contributing to patellofemoral pain, such as faulty hip and knee mechanics. Although quadriceps exercises were traditionally emphasized, isolated quadriceps strengthening does not correct proximal biomechanical deficits and is less effective as a primary intervention.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved a higher-dose regimen of semaglutide (Wegovy, Novo Nordisk) for use in a weight-management programme. It follows trial data showing that more than 20% weight loss is achievable at the increased dose. 

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was made available on the NHS in 2023 for adults with obesity and at least one weight-related complication, including dysglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, or cardiovascular disease. However, weight loss at this dose is suboptimal in some patients.

Researchers therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of a higher dose, 7.2 mg, in people with obesity.

The 72-week STEP UP trial, conducted at 95 centres in 11 countries, enrolled 1407 participants. They were randomised in a 5:1:1 ratio to receive semaglutide 7.2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201).

At baseline, 73.7% of participants were women. The mean age was 47 years, mean body weight was 113.0 kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 39.9.

Results, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology in November 2025, showed an average weight loss of 18.7% with semaglutide 7.2 mg, compared with 15.6% with the 2.4-mg dose and 3.9% with placebo. Among participants fully adherent to treatment, including diet and exercise, average weight loss with the higher dose reached 20.7%.

Participants receiving 7.2 mg were far more likely than those on placebo to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. They were about 12 times as likely to lose at least 5% of body weight, more than 25 times as likely to lose 20% or more, and over 100 times as likely to lose at least 25%.

Compared with the 2.4-mg dose, the 7.2-mg regimen increased the likelihood of achieving 20% weight loss by 1.8-fold and 25% weight loss by 2.4-fold.

Overall, 33.2% of participants receiving 7.2 mg lost at least 25% of their body weight, compared with 16.7% in the 2.4-mg group and none in the placebo group.

Gastrointestinal adverse effects were more common with the 7.2-mg dose, affecting 70.8% of participants, compared with 61.2% with 2.4 mg and 42.8% with placebo. Dysaesthesia was also more frequent, reported in 22.9%, 6.0%, and 0.5%, respectively.

The MHRA said the 7.2-mg dose is approved for adults with obesity with a BMI of 30 or higher, when used alongside a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

Treatment must follow an escalating dose regimen, with patients required to complete at least 4 weeks at 2.4 mg before progressing to the higher dose.

At present, the 7.2-mg dose is administered as three 2.4-mg injections. A single-dose 7.2-mg formulation is expected to become available later this year.

Obesity affects about 15 million people in the UK, and 71% of adults are projected to be overweight or obese by 2040.

A study from University College London, published in BMC Medicine this month, found that 2.9% of 5893 survey respondents reported using a GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP drug for weight loss in the past year, with 1.7% using them exclusively for this purpose.

Extrapolated nationally, this equates to about 1.6 million adults, most commonly using semaglutide or tirzepatide, the researchers said.

 January 16, 2026  



A dedicated session at the 2025 Dermatology Days of Paris conference, held from December 2 to 6, 2025, in Paris, France, focused on contact allergens that clinicians should recognize in everyday practice. A series of speakers reviewed newly identified allergens and explained their relevance to routine dermatological care.

“I have prepared a selection of practical points to know about recently identified allergens,” said Emmanuelle Amsler, MD,  dermatologist and allergologist at Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hôpital Tenon, Paris, France, in her introduction.

Two allergens were highlighted: octylisothiazolinone and dimethyl fumarate. Octylisothiazolinone is a biocide used in leather, synthetic leather, and headphone foams. Although prohibited in cosmetics, it is known to cause severe reactions, such as edema and eczema. In several reported cases, it caused inflammatory eczema around the ears.

Dimethyl fumarate, an antifungal agent previously used in sofas, was recently identified in a case related to the use of headphones. “For earphones such as AirPods, cases of allergic eczema have been reported, often linked to silicone tips or plastic components. Apple acknowledges the possible presence of nickel and acrylates in its products, which are two well-known allergens,” Amsler said.

In addition to headphones, octylisothiazolinone is found in leather chairs and car seats and has been associated with eczema at sites of direct skin contact, particularly on the back of the body. A more recently recognized substance, 2-(thiocyanomethylthio)benzothiazole, an antibacterial and antifungal agent used in leather, was identified as the cause of several cases reported in Belgium between 2019 and 2022.

In smartwatches, nickel remains a well-recognized contact allergen and is found in clasps or beneath the silicone components of the devices. Protective screens containing acrylates such as isobornyl acrylate and 4-acryloylmorpholine have also been associated with eczema.

Annick Barbaud , MD, PhD, professor of dermatology and head of the Department of Dermatology and Allergology at AP-HP, Hôpital Tenon, Sorbonne Université, presented findings from a multicenter study conducted by the Dermato-Allergology Group of the French Society of Dermatology on metal hypersensitivity in orthopedic implants, particularly knee prostheses.

Orthopedic surgeons sometimes encounter unexplained postimplantation pain, particularly in knee prostheses. When no other cause is identified, delayed metal hypersensitivity is suspected in approximately 5% of cases, often in the context of an aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesion, as noted by Barbaud.

The study included 253 patients with prosthesis intolerance, mostly older women with knee implants. Nearly half of the patients were sensitized to at least one metal, including 31% who were sensitized to nickel. Sensitization to cobalt was also more frequent in 10% of patients than in the general population. Allergic reactions to cement components, including acrylates and methyl methacrylate, are rare and far less frequent than those reported in previous studies. Sensitization to titanium and manganese was observed in 4% and 2% of patients, respectively.

Barbaud recommended the following approach:

Camille Leleu, MD, Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Dijon, Dijon, France, focused on allergic risks associated with nail products, particularly artificial nails and permanent nail polish. Her presentation was based on an analysis of 214 TikTok videos of nail product allergies.

“Among the clinical cases was a 16-year-old girl with severe eczema triggered by repeated use of semipermanent nail polish at home. Testing revealed multiple sensitizations to acrylates, particularly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylates,” Leleu said.

A retrospective study from Amsterdam involving 2927 individuals showed that 1.5% were sensitized to HEMA, predominantly women, with either occupational or nonoccupational exposure. Cosmetic nail products were the most common cause. This is despite EU legislation restricting the use of HEMA and other acrylates in nail cosmetics to professional use only, with mandatory labeling since November 2020.

“A new HEMA-free label has been introduced, but it does not address the problem because individuals sensitized to other acrylates can still experience severe reactions. For example, a 22-year-old woman developed severe edema despite using HEMA-free labelednail polish,” Leleu added. She concluded by emphasizing the importance of informing patients about the risks associated with the use of nail products.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 12 of Aging-US on December 29, 2025, titled ""Age-specific DNA methylation alterations in sperm at imprint control regions may contribute to the risk of autism spectrum disorder in offspring.""

The study – selected as our Editors' Choice for January, 2026 – was led by first authors Eugenia Casella and Jana Depovere, with corresponding author Adelheid Soubry from the University of Leuven. The research shows that a man's age is linked to specific changes in sperm DNA that may influence early development in children. These findings are relevant as autism diagnoses have increased while many men are becoming fathers later in life.

Autism spectrum disorder is a growing public health concern affecting millions of families worldwide. The study focused on DNA methylation, a natural process that helps regulate how genes function without changing the DNA sequence itself. DNA methylation plays a key role during early development and can be sensitive to age-related biological changes.

Researchers analyzed sperm samples from 63 healthy, non-smoking men between the ages of 18 and 35. DNA methylation was measured at hundreds of thousands of locations across the genome. The analysis identified more than 14,000 DNA sites where methylation levels changed with age, with most showing a gradual decrease as men got older.

""To identify sperm-specific marks, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study in sperm from 63 men, using the Illumina 450K array.""

While individual changes were small, their location within the genome was important. Many age-related changes occurred near imprint control regions, which help ensure that certain genes are active only from one parent. These regions are established during sperm development and are usually maintained after fertilization. Disruptions in these regions may affect how genes are regulated in offspring.

Researchers found that several genes affected by age-related DNA changes have previously been linked to autism. These genes are involved in brain development, nerve communication, and early growth. Changes in their regulation may increase vulnerability to neurodevelopmental differences.

Overall, the findings provide new biological insight into earlier evidence linking paternal age to child health. However, the authors note that autism is a complex condition shaped by many genetic and non-genetic factors, and no single cause has been identified. The study results suggest that age-related changes in sperm DNA may be one contributing factor. By clarifying how paternal age influences sperm biology, this research supports future studies in reproductive health as family planning increasingly shifts toward later parenthood.

A comprehensive review reveals how biofilms and poor maintenance can undermine filtration systems, challenging the assumption that water dispensers are always a safer choice than tap water.

Study: Microbiological quality of drinking water from water dispensers. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

Despite their claim, water dispensers (WDs) are not always free from microbial contamination and, in many cases, may harbor microbial loads comparable to those found in tap water, raising concerns about public health and the need for better maintenance. Recently, researchers conducted a comprehensive review to evaluate microbial contamination in water dispenser machines and examine their potential health implications. This review has been published in AIMS Microbiology.

This review analyzed published literature to assess microbial contamination in WDs, water quality, common contaminants, and health implications. The authors obtained all relevant documents from PubMed, EBSCO, and Google Scholar, synthesizing evidence from approximately 70 studies conducted across multiple countries and settings.

Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human right and essential for public health. Despite rigorous treatment of public water systems, including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection, consumers increasingly turn to alternatives like bottled water and WD machines, seeking perceived health benefits, convenience, and better taste.

WDs, commonly known as water coolers, dispense drinking water and are classified as point-of-use (POU) systems and bottled WDs. POU systems are directly connected to tap water, and bottled WDs use replaceable bottles. Typically, WD machines incorporate filtration technologies like reverse osmosis, carbon filtration, and UV sterilization to purify water and remove unwanted tastes or odors.

Despite these filtration efforts, many studies reviewed have reported sporadic contamination within WD systems, raising concerns about microbial contamination originating from the dispensers themselves. Such contamination may increase the risk of waterborne disease, particularly for vulnerable populations. Across comparative studies, WDs were frequently found to be more contaminated than the tap water supplying them, and water quality often deteriorates over time with regular use.

Compared with tap water samples, scientists have detected approximately 1,2 times more bacterial contamination in carbon filters in POU devices. These bacterial contaminants tended to regrow in WDs even after treatment and flushing. Although most research recommends regular maintenance and cleaning, microbes frequently recur within days, challenging the assumption that well-maintained WDs are consistently microbe-free.

Researchers identified biofilms as the primary contamination source, defined as structured microbial communities that build up in machines and continuously release planktonic cells and by-products into the water. Multiple international studies conducted in Turkey, Thailand, Iran, Canada, Italy, and Malaysia found that WDs were, in many cases, more contaminated than their tap water sources. These studies observed that heterotrophic plate counts and aerobic bacteria were higher in dispensers than in tap water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has also been detected in WD systems.

Taken together, WDs are not necessarily safer than tap water, and their safety depends strongly on system design, maintenance practices, and frequency of use, with regular maintenance remaining essential to reduce microbial colonization and regrowth.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses microbial indicators, including Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) and coliforms, to assess drinking water quality and regulatory compliance. Total coliforms are used as indicator organisms that may signal fecal contamination or system integrity failures, and their presence can suggest the possible presence of pathogens, such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio cholerae. Municipal water districts use coliforms to measure treatment efficiency and distribution system integrity.

Approximately 20 % of U.S. water samples and 80 % of Malaysian water vending machines (WVMs) were reported to be contaminated with coliforms due to filtration failures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was included as a water quality indicator due to its serious health implications, particularly for immunocompromised individuals.

Heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria, classified as oligotrophic or opportunistic microorganisms, indicate the overall microbiological quality of drinking water. The EPA recommended that HPC bacteria not exceed 500 CFU/mL, primarily to limit interference with coliform detection, though the World Health Organization (WHO) stated coliform testing was a better indicator. Despite ongoing debate over their reliability as direct health-risk indicators, the EPA and water regulatory bodies worldwide continue to use HPCs as supplementary indicators of microbial water quality.

Studies conducted in Sweden and other Nordic countries have linked drinking water contamination to gastrointestinal illnesses and waterborne outbreaks. Research on soda fountain machines estimated that 17 % of bacteria, including Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Stenotrophomonas, Candida, and Serratia, were opportunists that may cause gastrointestinal infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

Colonized biofilms in plumbing fixtures can serve as reservoirs for microorganisms associated with endocarditis, folliculitis, keratitis, cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. Opportunistic pathogens generally cause infection when host immunity is compromised.

Waterborne bacteria pose elevated health risks to children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals. Previous research indicated that 23 % of Malaysian WVMs harbor Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which colonizes WDs persistently via biofilm formation. Contaminated drinking water dispensers have also been implicated as potential sources of Pseudomonas fluorescens in hospital settings.

Multiple studies have indicated that HPC bacteria may be more harmful than previously thought under certain exposure conditions. Researchers have reported elevated HPCs in WDs, including 62 % of Iranian samples, 100 % of U.S. samples, with 73 % above 500 CFU/mL, 32 % of U.S. WVMs, 84 % of UK WVMs, and 87 % of Brazilian samples exceeding the 500 CFU/mL threshold.

HPCs above the recommended thresholds indicate that WDs can serve as potential breeding grounds for bacteria, including pathogenic microorganisms that may severely impact public health, particularly when monitoring and maintenance are inadequate.

To improve water quality and mitigate microbial contamination, the authors recommend implementing measures that inhibit biofilm formation, such as internal system lines made from biofilm-resistant materials or coatings containing nanoparticles that discourage bacterial attachment and growth.

Adoption of novel technologies should be accompanied by compliance with regulatory safety standards, long-term stability testing, and certification to confirm that no harmful nanoparticle migration occurs during operation. Additionally, periodic disinfection protocols, such as hydrogen peroxide application, could enable short-term but effective reduction in microbial populations in microfiltered dispensers.

Regular maintenance, routine cleaning, and user hygiene practices are critical in maintaining water quality. Without consistent upkeep, even systems equipped with advanced filtration technologies are prone to contamination, highlighting the authors' conclusion that technological upgrades alone are insufficient without sustained oversight and maintenance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Rose Lavelle named U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year for first time","https://www.wlwt.com/article/rose-lavelle-2025-us-soccer-female-player-of-the-year-honor/70024333","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:56:00 GMT","

In 2025, there was one women's soccer player that stood above all the rest for the United States, and she's a Cincinnati native.

U.S. Soccer announced Friday that Rose Lavelle has been voted the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year. It's the first time she's earned the honor.

“I'm really happy for Rose, who is thriving. She's an extremely selfless person who has been through a lot of adversity,” said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes in a press release. “I think we all know that Rose is not only one of the best players in the world, but also one of the most fun to watch, and to coach, so it's very satisfying to see her recognized in this way.""

Rose totaled 29.2% of the weighted vote for the honor. She was followed by Sam Coffey (23.9%) and Catarina Macario (22.3%).

Last year was a busy one for Lavelle: She played for the Stars and Stripes in her hometown for the first time since 2022 and scored two goals during the October international window. In total, Lavelle was included on the scoresheet in each match that she started.

""When I look at the past year, it feels like a testament to the support system I had, with my family, the medical staff at Gotham and with the National Team, all my teammates, coaches and friends,” said Lavelle in a press release. ""I wouldn't have been in the position to even be up for the award without all of the support I received throughout the year just to get back on the field. So, this award is definitely shared with all the people I was lucky enough to have in my corner along the way.” 

In November, Lavelle was named the National Women's Soccer League Championship MVP after netting the winning goal in the NWSL title game for Gotham FC.

All of that happened in a shortened campaign, after recovering from ankle surgery. She didn't play in an international match until June 26 and played in 16 of Gotham's 26 regular games, making 13 starts.

Votes for U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year are taken form coaches, players who earned a cap that year, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, National Women's Soccer League head coaches and select media members and administrators. 

2026 will be Rose's 10th year as part of the USWNT. She's appeared in 116 matches for the United States over that time, and has an Olympic gold medal and World Cup title to her name.

The USWNT will play their first match of 2026 on Jan. 24, against Paraguay, in Carson, California. Lavelle and the U.S. will return to the Buckeye State as part of the SheBelieves Cup in March, when they take on Canada in Columbus on March 4.

The U.S. Women's National Team's match next week against Paraguay will mark more than just the beginning of the 2026 campaign. Former USWNT forward and Los Angeles native Christen Press, who announced her retirement from professional soccer last October, will be honored ahead of the match in front of her hometown fans at Dignity Health Sports Park (DHSP) in Carson, Calif, celebrating the end of her historic international career.

Press finished her legendary USWNT career with 155 caps and ranks ninth all-time in goals (64) and 12th all-time in assists (43). She is a two-time FIFA World Cup champion (2015, 2019) and earned a bronze medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.

These are five of the best moments from Press' eight-year career with the USWNT:

Press made her USWNT debut on Feb. 9, 2013, in a 4-1 win against Scotland in front of 18,656 fans at EverBank Field in Jacksonville, Fla. The forward made an immediate impact, giving the U.S. a 1-0 lead in the 13th minute off a left-footed strike from the top of the box. Press doubled the lead in the 32nd minute after getting on the end of a cross from USWNT forward Tobin Heath, heading the ball into the bottom left corner. Press became just the third player in U.S. history to score two goals in her first match.

A post shared by U.S. Soccer WNT (@uswnt)

Press was named to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup roster for the U.S. and started in the team's opening group stage match against Australia on June 8. In the 61st minute, forward Sydney Leroux made a run down the left wing, beating her defender inside the box before cutting it back to an unmarked Press, who sent in a first-time shot towards the far post to give the U.S. a 2-1 lead. It was the first of Press' two World Cup goals.

On June 12, 2018, Press became the 37th player to hit triple-digit appearances for the USWNT. In her first start of the year, she assisted both goals in the 2-1 win against China PR in a friendly at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. The U.S. opened the scoring in the 35th minute when Press delivered a perfect cross from the right flank to forward Megan Rapinoe, who finished with a well-placed header. After China equalized in the second half, the U.S. responded three minutes later. Press played a give-and-go with Heath at the top of the penalty area. The pass bounced off Press back to Heath, who arced her volley over the goalkeeper for the game-winner.

Press' second World Cup goal came in 2019, 10 minutes into the semifinal against England. Heath played a through ball down the right flank for fullback Kelley O'Hara, who whipped in a cross toward the far post. The ball floated over four defenders inside the box before Press powered her header into the back of the net past England's goalkeeper. The U.S. went on to win 2-1, advancing to its third consecutive World Cup Final.

That @kelleymohara, @ChristenPress connection was *chef's kiss* pic.twitter.com/LkzyGkvSwi

Capping off an incredible year, Press became the 12th player in U.S. history to record 50 international goals after scoring in the 3-2 win against Sweden on Nov. 7, 2019. After Heath intercepted a pass, forward Carli Lloyd jumped on the loose ball and played Press into space. Press made a move past two defenders before sending a low shot off the outstretched leg of Sweden's goalkeeper and into the back of the net for the second goal of the match.

Alexi Lalas has outlined his selections to start for the U.S. men's national team at the 2026 World Cup.

The longtime USMNT defender did not make many surprise selections in his team, which he revealed on his ""State of the Union"" show.

Lalas started with Matt Freese at goalkeeper. The New York City FC shot-stopper took over as USMNT starter last year and has started the past 12 games for the national team.

Continuing head coach Mauricio Pochettino's recent trend of using three defenders, Lalas picked Tim Ream, Chris Richards and Miles Robinson to make up a back three.

Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest are wingbacks in the formation, with both able to move back to make up a five-man defense if needed.

Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Malik Tillman make up a three-man central midfield. Adams would operate as a shield for the back line, McKennie would be in a box-to-box role and Tillman would able to move forward and create goals.

Up top, Christian Pulisic is in a playmaking winger role and Folarin Balogun is deployed as a lone No. 9.

The USMNT would have several quality options off the bench including Brenden Aaronson, Tanner Tessmann, Tim Weah and Alex Freeman among others.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT Weekend Spotlight: Musah Looks to Continue Positive Turn in Serie A","https://www.si.com/soccer/usmnt-weekend-spotlight-musah-positive-turn-serie-a","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:40:00 GMT","

Already midway through the first month of 2026, the soccer world is fully up and running for the World Cup year, with teams in Europe hitting midseason and MLS clubs kicking off preseasons this week. 

While  key U.S. men's national team players like Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic are enjoying strong seasons and aiming for new deals at their current clubs, others are still looking to earn their spot on this summer's World Cup squad under manager Mauricio Pochettino. 

Here's Sports Illustrated's look at who will look to turn heads in this weekend's action.

George Campbell will have a familiar face around West Brom for the foreseeable future, as the former Atlanta United and CF Montréal center back prepares for his debut under new manager Eric Ramsay, who arrives from Minnesota United. 

The central defender has played consistently for West Brom this season under Ryan Mason, amassing 1,766 minutes across 22 matches and netting a goal and two assists. Yet, the Baggies have struggled and enter this weekend's action sitting 18th in the Championship.

Taking on second place, Middlesbrough, Campbell will have to adapt to Ramsay's system. With Minnesota, that meant significant time without the ball and more reliance on the backline to spark quick transitions, a shift from what Campbell has traditionally thrived at. 

He'll take on fellow USMNT World Cup hopeful Aidan Morris.

After struggling to play a significant number of minutes for Atalanta in 2025 after joining on loan from AC Milan, Yunus Musah's role has been elevated since the calendar flipped. The 23-year-old American has played in each of the last six matches, bringing him to 12 appearances and 379 minutes across Serie A action this season. 

While he has struggled at times over the last two years, he is finally starting to reap the rewards of making the shift away from one of Italy's biggest clubs and has been versatile in his usage, before a recent spell in his natural defensive midfield position. 

This week sees a massive opportunity for Musah, as seventh-place Atalanta takes on 19th-place Pisa, with one club eyeing potential European qualification spots and the other in the thick of a relegation battle. 

Musah has just two starts this year. Could he get another? If so, his consistency will determine if he is able to crack the USMNT's March roster. 

Brenden Aaronson is one of the most in-form attackers in Europe at the moment, with two goals and two assists in his last four Premier League appearances with Leeds United. Yet, given his form comes in a months-long spell without an international camp, it's difficult to know where he genuinely stands in Pochettino's pecking order. 

As such, it's critical he maintains form enough to earn a call into the March camp, which will give him an opportunity to showcase himself as a potential World Cup player and, depending on how he continues, a potential starter. 

This weekend sees Aaronson's Leeds United take on Fulham in Premier League action, pitting the in-form American attacker against USMNT fullback Antonee Robinson, who has returned to an elite-level after months dealing with significant injuries. 

The striker pool for the USMNT is highly competitive, but 21-year-old Damion Downs is making every effort to crack the squad in the early stages of his career. After struggling for minutes and form with Southampton, he made a loan move to the Bundesliga's Hamburger S.V. to start the year, returning to a league he previously found success in with FC Köln. 

Manager Merlin Polzin threw Downs right into the starting lineup in his debut, a 2–1 loss to SC Freiburg, giving the American a level of trust and confidence rarely seen by midseason loan-player arrivals. 

While he has not scored since April 2025, when he found the back of the net for Köln in a 3–1 win over Preussen Münster, he was noticeable on his debut, winning 11 duels and taking a single shot. 

This weekend, Downs will look to snap his goalscoring drought as Hamburger takes on American-heavy Borussia Mönchengladbach, featuring Gio Reyna and Joe Scally.

FIFA has issued a statement about the upcoming World Cup as Donald Trump's travel ban continues to throw things into chaos.

It was always likely to be an unforgettable summer of football as soon as the US were confirmed as joint hosts with Mexico and Canada, and last summer's Club World Cup only added fuel to that fire.

Trump even famously crashed Chelsea's medal proceedings after they won the tournament. The US president also left members of the Juventus squad baffled during a trip to the White House, discussing bombing Iran with the Italian side.

The 79-year-old has made it clear that he doesn't want people from certain countries visiting to the US, taking the total tally to 75 this week, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously explained the slightly crazy reasoning behind the bans.

In a strong-worded post on X, she wrote: ""I just met with the President. I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.

“Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom — not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS. WE DON'T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.”

The travel ban comes into place just a few months before the tournament is set to begin, with fans of Iran, who boycotted the draw and Haiti, for whom this is a first ever World Cup, already told that they won't be able to attend.

And after Trump added a hefty amount more of countries to his list, the fans of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Uruguay may just have had their plans thrown into doubt.

Senegal and the Ivory Coast are under partial travel bans while the other eight countries on that list have had their immigrant visa processing suspended.

Meanwhile, Iraq, Jamaica and the Democratic Republic of the Congo also feature on the list, and they could still qualify for the tournament through playoff fixtures.

As things stand, this doesn't apply to travel visas, meaning that they can currently still visit for the summer's tournament but they will no doubt have to be extremely stringent when flying over if they don't want to find themselves in serious trouble.

FIFA has now issued a press release with an update on ticket sales, warning fans that a match ticket doesn't guarantee you entry to the country.

""A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each country's government website today for entry requirements for Canada, Mexico and the United States,"" FIFA's press release states.

""Given the processing times involved, FIFA recommends submitting the visa application as early as possible.

""FIFA World Cup 2026 ticket holders travelling to the United States are eligible for the recently announced FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS) when it becomes available in the coming weeks.""

Iranian fans will also be prohibited from visiting Canada, although that is currently the only World Cup nation on the countries travel ban list.

Even with how chaotic the World Cup draw was, fans from these countries will no doubt be devastated about the possibility of not seeing their sides play on football's biggest stage.

Alexi Lalas has outlined his selections to start for the U.S. men's national team at the 2026 World Cup.

The longtime USMNT defender did not make many surprise selections in his team, which he revealed on his ""State of the Union"" show.

Lalas started with Matt Freese at goalkeeper. The New York City FC shot-stopper took over as USMNT starter last year and has started the past 12 games for the national team.

Continuing head coach Mauricio Pochettino's recent trend of using three defenders, Lalas picked Tim Ream, Chris Richards and Miles Robinson to make up a back three.

Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest are wingbacks in the formation, with both able to move back to make up a five-man defense if needed.

Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Malik Tillman make up a three-man central midfield. Adams would operate as a shield for the back line, McKennie would be in a box-to-box role and Tillman would able to move forward and create goals.

Up top, Christian Pulisic is in a playmaking winger role and Folarin Balogun is deployed as a lone No. 9.

The USMNT would have several quality options off the bench including Brenden Aaronson, Tanner Tessmann, Tim Weah and Alex Freeman among others.

5. Christian Pulisic - 32 (2016-present; through Nov. 18, 2024)

Blues set for hefty windfall due to contract clause","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/chelsea-real-winners-marc-guehi-man-city-transfer-blues-set-hefty-windfall-contract-clause/blt937c55f01fea5806","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:51:34 GMT","

Chelsea are set for a huge benefit from Marc Guehi's transfer to Manchester City. The Crystal Palace captain is on the verge of linking up with Pep Guardiola at the Etihad for the second half of the season and beyond, as the Cityzens look to close the gap to Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table. The Gunners are six points clear of their nearest challengers, who are suffering a defensive injury crisis.

The West London club are set to benefit financially from Guehi's impending move to City, having included a sell-on clause when the defender joined Crystal Palace in 2021. The 25-year-old centre-back will complete his move to the Etihad Stadium in the coming days, with the Manchester club agreeing a £20m fee to secure his services. As part of the original deal that took Guehi from Stamford Bridge to Selhurst Park, Chelsea inserted a clause entitling them to 20% of any future transfer fee.

That provision means Chelsea are due to receive around £4m once the transfer is finalised, more than four years after Guehi left the club. City identified the England international as a priority target and moved to secure him mid-season, keen to avoid competition should he have entered the final stages of his contract. Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has also indicated the deal is nearing completion, confirming Guehi will not feature in their next match. A double blow for Eagles fans after the Austrian announced he would also be departing the club in the summer.

Speaking in a bombshell interview on Friday, Glasner said: ""My latest understanding is the deal for Marc is in the final stages,"" Glasner said. ""I cannot confirm the club's latest. It's not done. But the result is Marc doesn't play tomorrow for us. Every player, depending on their contract situation, there is a price where the club say they want to do it. When a player says they want to move, a deal happens. It looks like it happens now.""

That was not the only bad news delivered by Glasner, though, as he announced his desire for a new challenge. He added: ""A decision has already been taken, months ago. I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in October, the international break. We had a very long talk, and I told him I will not sign a new contract. We agreed at the time it was the best to keep it between us. It's the best that we could do that and keep it confidential for three months. But now it's important to have clarity, and we had a very busy schedule so that's why we didn't want to talk about it. Steve and I want the best for Crystal Palace.""

Guehi came through Chelsea's academy but made only two senior appearances for the club. After a loan spell at Swansea City, he was sold to Palace, where he established himself as captain and one of the Premier League's most reliable defenders. The additional income is a boost for Chelsea, whose head coach Liam Rosenior recently signed a long-term contract running until 2032 following his appointment as Enzo Maresca's successor. The extra finance will be the last link between the centre-back and the Premier League club, who always had half an eye on bringing the England international back to Stamford Bridge.

Guehi's move to City is set to be announced in the coming days to provide some much-needed relief for Guardiola heading into the second half of the campaign. The likes of John Stones, Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol are all currently missing for the club and not set to return anytime soon. The transfer represents a huge step up for Guehi, who was on the verge of joining Liverpool at the end of the summer transfer window. With City paying half of what the Reds were willing to fork out, they will feel the deal is a bargain, despite Guehi being in the final year of his contract and being available as a free agent in the summer.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Houston Dynamo confirmed the return of Héctor Herrera, ending weeks of speculation about the veteran midfielder's future. The club signed the 35-year-old to a contract for the 2026 MLS season, with a team option to extend the deal through June 2027. Herrera will once again wear No. 16, a number closely tied to his first stint with the Texas-based club.

To mark his comeback, Houston launched a limited-time promotion offering $16 tickets for the home opener against Chicago Fire on Feb. 21, a nod to Herrera's jersey number and his popularity among fans.

“It's an honor to welcome Héctor back to Houston,” said club president Pat Onstad. “He's a respected leader on and off the field, and his influence helped change the direction of this club during his first spell.” Onstad highlighted Herrera's role in guiding the Dynamo to the 2023 U.S. Open Cup title and a club-record points total in 2024, adding that his return aligns with the organization's desire to build on past success.

While Herrera's role may differ this time around, the Dynamo believe his experience and winning mentality will elevate the squad. Houston is also reportedly in talks with Cruz Azul for Polish midfielder Mateusz Bogusz, a move that could see Herrera surrounded by added quality in midfield.

Herrera's initial run with the Dynamo from 2022 to 2024 included 82 appearances, eight goals and 22 assists. He captained the side to silverware and a Western Conference final, though his exit was controversial. His final match ended in a red card for spitting at a referee, and shortly after, the club opted not to renew his contract.

Following his MLS departure, Herrera returned to Mexico and joined Toluca, where he lifted Liga MX titles in both the Clausura and Apertura 2025. Despite being part of a championship-winning squad, he never fully established himself as a central figure, making 34 appearances across all competitions.

The men's draw at the first Grand Slam of 2026 would seem to be as simple, straightforward, and drama-free as any we've ever seen. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have played in the finals of the last three majors, and as they head toward their mid-20s, they're only getting better.

Before we anoint Sinner and Alcaraz as the de facto finalists, we should remember that the Australian Open is the only Slam where one of them hasn't made the final. Or even the semifinals.That would be Alcaraz. Three years ago he was injured; two years ago, he lost to Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals; last year he lost to Novak Djokovic, also in the quarterfinals. He has never come out of the gates firing on all cylinders.This year the 22-year-old will be facing another potential obstacle: The absence of his long-time, and now former, coach Juan Carlos Ferrero. Along with the instruction that Ferrero gave him in practice, he also conveyed a lot of information to him during matches. When Ferrero wasn't there, Alcaraz could look lost.

What should we make of Novak Djokovic's chances? There are two radically different factors to consider. On the positive side, he has won this tournament 10 times, and has a 99-10 record there. On the negative side, he's 38 and hasn't won a major since 2023—an eternity for him.Still, Djokovic held steady when he had to in 2025, making the semis at all four Slams, before (a) his body gave out, or (b) he was overmatched by either Sinner or Alcaraz, or (c) both. This time he's in Sinner's half. More important, he's in a quarter that should give him a chance to show how much he still has left.Djokovic starts against 71st-ranked Pedro Martinez, a clay-courter he has never played before. The first seed he could face is No. 27 Brandon Nakashima; he has never played him before, either. His fourth-round opponent could be a towering server like Jakub Mensik or Hubert Hurkacz.

Sinner is on a 14-match Australian Open win streak dating back to 2023. Last year he dropped just two sets on the way to the title, and won his semifinal and final in lop-sided fashion. The courts, the atmosphere, the time of year, the fact that he has an Australian coach: Everything about the so-called Happy Slam suits Sinner's serene demeanor.His draw likely suits him, too, whoever is in it. It's hard to think of a player in the field, outside of Alcaraz, who could be called a credible threat to Sinner at this tournament right now.He'll start against 94th-ranked Hugo Gaston; Sinner is 2-0 against him. In the third round, he could play 28th seed Joao Fonseca, who made a splash at this tournament last year; they've never met. Sinner's potential fourth-round opponent, Karen Khachanov, does have a win over him, back in 2020, but the Italian is 4-0 against the Russian since.

It's a massive sum, considering the numbers were not boosted by tying into a TV broadcast event.

	In mid-December, Marvel Studios embarked on a rarity in modern movie marketing when it released a teaser for Avengers: Doomsday solely in theaters. Typically, a launch for a movie of that would size hit online immediately, and might be tied to a big TV broadcast, like a championship sporting event, to help boost the numbers.


	But the low-key teaser focusing on Chris Evans' Steve Rogers played exclusively in theaters in front of Avatar: Fire & Ash before debuting online five days later. Three more teasers followed weekly in theaters, with spots featuring Thor and The X-Men, as well as a fourth and final centering on Black Panther‘s Shuri and M'Baku meet Ben Grimm from Fantastic Four.

					Kat Dennings Says Marvel ""Did Scan Me,"" Joking ""They Could Put Me in Anything They Want""		
			









	The experiment paid off in a big way, with insiders saying that the four teasers have reached a combined 1.02 billion views. The individual numbers for each teaser was not revealed, but it's a massive sum, considering these were strictly organic online views with no tie-ins to a broadcast event.




			Popular on THR		







	Pirated versions of the teasers appeared online early, and Marvel was well aware that once something is in a theater, it's impossible to stop someone from recording it with a smartphone. But that did not dampen enthusiasm. According to insiders, the social volume was for each teaser was on average 188 percent greater than for a typical Marvel drop, and the combined four teasers now top the highest views for Marvel trailer launches on Instagram (505 million) and TikTok (103 million) views. They also spawned 16 owned organic trends on X, including “Doomsday” “Steve Rogers” “Thor” “X-Men” “Wakanda.”

	











	Just how big is the 1 billion-plus combined figure? It's tough to make an apples to apples comparison, since usually studios tout 24-hour numbers, and the first Doomsday trailer hit online Dec. 23. But consider this: years ago, Deadpool & Wolverine launched to a record-setting 365 million views in 24 hours, making it the top trailer of all time during that period. But that number included the 100-plus million who watched the Super Bowl on TV. More recently, Fantastic Four: First Steps flew to 202 million in 24 hours — tied to a big media event featuring the cast.


Doomsday, which bows Dec. 18, and 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars mark the return of Marvel stalwarts Joe and Anthony Russo as directors, with the duo producing via their AGBO banner. And the two movies bring Robert Downey Jr. back into the fold, this time as Doctor Doom. Marvel is said to be particularly proud that the four teasers were so successful without showing Downey, proving that there remains a great and passionate interest in the characters, and their originating actors. 


	In some way, Marvel sees this teaser gambit, which required close coordination with theaters around the world, as continuing the famous, five-hour live-streamed casting announcement for the movie. Marvel is continuing the tradition, launching a live-streamed countdown clock to Doomsday.


	“Each one of those trailers is narrative information,” Joe Russo recently cryptically said on the Empire podcast. “And it's all part of a larger story. And so, I would argue that Doomsday has already started for you.”

	Warner Bros. put some big tentpoles on the release calendar starting with the highly anticipated J.J. Abrams sci-fi movie The Great Beyond starring Glen Powell and Jenna Ortega which is going Nov. 13 this year in Imax. The pic joins Paramount's Johnny Depp starring, Ti West directed title Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol on that date. This is the first time we're getting news about the Abrams movie which has been shrouded in secrecy. 


	Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Merritt Wever and Samuel L. Jackson also star in The Great Beyond. 


	The rest of the movies are bound for 2027: Sam Esmail's Panic Carefully on Feb. 26 next year, the Tim Miller directed Keanu Reeves movie known as Shiver currently going Aug. 13, and the buzzed about Peter Safran Company and Atomic Monster prequel, The Conjuring: First Communion on Sept. 10, the prized Warner post Labor Day launch date for genre pics.

	Miller and Reeves' project is reportedly set in the Caribbean Sea, with the protag being a smuggler slumming on a job as he contends with dead bodies, pirates and sharks, all within a time loop. Warners was closing in on the Ian Shorr scripted package back on Halloween. The movie as of now will face off on Aug. 13, 2027 against a Universal Blumhouse title. 

	











	Very little is known about The Conjuring: First Communion which comes from director Rodrigue Huart, from a script by Richard Naing & Ian Goldberg. It's not certain if Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's The Warrens are coming back. Warners always had this September date in 2027 on hold previously.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Teresa Palmer (A Discovery of Witches, Warm Bodies) has been cast in the highly anticipated Prime Video series God of War, based on PlayStation's ancient mythology-themed video game, sources tell Deadline. She joins Ryan Hurst, who we announced yesterday would take on the lead role of Kratos.


	Palmer will play Phoebe/Sif, Thor's wife and the goddess of family, we hear. Amazon declined to comment. 


	The live-action series, from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios, received a two-season order, with pre-production underway in Vancouver, and casting has begun.

	From writer, showrunner and executive producer Ronald D. Moore (Outlander, For All Mankind), God of War follows father and son, Kratos (Hurst) and 10-year-old Atreus, as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Kratos, the titular character of the entire franchise, is Spartan by birth and a god by nature. Raised in a martial culture, he rose to command armies in the service of his homeland until one day he made a fateful deal with Ares, the Greek God of War, and lost his soul in exchange for being victorious in battle.


	Over the course of 10 successful games, Kratos vanquished mortals, creatures, and gods alike. In the process, he became an iconic character in pop culture, known for his stoic nature, unchallenged combat skills, and tragic past.


God of War is co-produced by Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios in association with PlayStation Productions and Tall Ship Productions. In addition to Moore, executive producers also include Maril Davis, Cory Barlog, Naren Shankar, Matthew Graham, Asad Qizilbash, Jeff Ketcham, Hermen Hulst, Roy Lee, and Brad Van Arragon. Joe Menosky, Marc Bernardin, Tania Lotia, and Ben McGinnis co-executive produce on the series. Frederick E.O. Toye (Shōgun, The Boys) has signed on to direct the first two episodes of God of War.

	











	Palmer most recently starred in The Family Next Door, a series from her native Australia, and AMC+'s The Last Anniversary. Notably, she portrayed the lead character of Diana Bishop, a witch, in A Discovery of Witches, an adaptation of the beloved Deborah Harkness book series “All Souls Trilogy,” from Sky. On the big screen, she is known for her work in Warm Bodies (2013), The Fall Guy (2024), Berlin Syndrome (2017), Hacksaw Ridge (2016), and Point Break (2015). Palmer, who just wrapped principal photography on the Amazon MGM Studios film Subversion opposite Chris Hemsworth, Lily James and Michael Peña, is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, Australia's Shanahan Management and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

	Directed by Jeremiah Kipp (Slapface) and starring Willa Holland (Arrow) and Paul Sparks (Boardwalk Empire), the film will stream on Shudder from March 27. We can share the film's first trailer above. 


The Mortuary Assistant follows newly certified mortician Rebecca Owens (Holland), who accepts a night shift at a mortuary, embalming bodies alone after hours.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Disney+ is remaking Will Forte's The Last Man On Earth for the French","https://www.avclub.com/disney-remaking-last-man-on-earth-french-will-forte-artus","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:31:28 GMT","

When Disney bought 20th Century Fox back in 2019, it ended up owning the rights and licenses to an absolutely gobsmacking number of TV shows and films, many of which we can't imagine it had any idea what to do with. Leave aside those wildly off-brand shows that were still in production, like It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. What is The House Of Mouse to do with a series like Will Forte's wonderfully bizarre The Last Man On Earth, which ran for four seasons of frequently wacky, frequently depressing apocalypse comedy on Fox, before wrapping up in 2017? What can you do with Phil “Tandy” Miller and his frequently eyebrow-free adventures? Sell them off to the French?

Anyway, Disney has now sold The Last Man On Earth off to the French, with Variety reporting that a remake of the series was announced at a Parisian showcase of new Disney+ shows on Thursday night. The series—about a guy who survives a global pandemic, and is forced to try to survive and restart civilization despite being a lazy, emotionally immature slacker—will be revived for French audiences with comedian Artus now in the Will Forte role.

A synopsis released for the new show leans into the wish fulfillment element that made up basically the bulk of its pilot episode, before all involved (including Forte and co-creators Chris Miller and Phil Lord) decided it'd be a lot more fun to have “hero” Phil Miller contend with other survivors, like Kristen Schaal, instead. (We don't know if France has a Kristen Schaal, but if not, they should get one. She's great!) Here's the description: “After traveling across the country, Adam must face the facts: he is the last man on Earth. Free from everything, he enjoys the advantages of solitude… but remains desperately alone. However, he still holds out hope that another survivor exists. And perhaps even a female survivor.”

Artus, for his part, is a pretty major comedy star in France at the moment; his 2024 comedy film A Little Something Extra, about a pair of criminals who go undercover in a summer camp for young adults for disabilities, quickly became one of the highest-grossing movies in the country's history.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The original Star Wars characters are coming to Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland","https://www.avclub.com/star-wars-disneyland-galaxys-edge-timeline","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:27:28 GMT","

Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland will soon expand its timeline to a slightly longer time ago, Disney has announced. The Star Wars-themed land will start featuring characters from the original Star Wars trilogy on April 29, after seven years of heavily focusing on the sequels. Darth Vader, Luke, Leia, and Han are among the old favorites who will start appearing in Galaxy's Edge, but they're not taking the whole place over: Rey will still be hanging out in the Resistance camp, while characters who can fit in either era will roam the marketplace.

“Star Wars characters appear in Star Wars theme park” might not sound like news, but this is actually a significant change for Galaxy's Edge. The land has been strict about its time period since it opened in May 2019. It's set between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, and Disney avoided elements that might undermine guests' immersion in that particular period. (This is a land that launched with even retail and food service employees instructed to stay in character, with food items exclusively referred to with made-up Star Wars words like “Endorian tip-yip”; both have been rolled back, but Disney was taking the theme very seriously at first.) Regular appearances from Rey, a masked Kylo Ren, and First Order officers and Stormtroopers have been a standard feature since day one, sequel trilogy actors appear in both video and audio-animatronic form in its signature ride Rise of the Resistance, and the lead characters from earlier movies have remained out of sight. OG-only fans could meet up with Chewbacca and check-out a life-sized R2-D2 sold in the Droid Depot, both of whom are alive and… well, present in Force Awakens. (R2's not exactly doing well in that one, spending most of it under a tarp in a closet or garage somewhere.) Han Solo and Darth Vader were nowhere to be seen (although Luke did make some appearances at the park in 2025). The Mandalorian and Grogu were later added as walkaround characters in 2022, but their timeline is fuzzy enough where it's entirely possible they could've bummed around Battuu (the planet Galaxy's Edge is set on) when the First Order was there. This all changes in April, signaling a major change in the land's approach to immersion.

Anybody who was really into the LARPing aspect of Galaxy's Edge might be comforted to hear that Disney will still try to maintain some thematic separation between the original and sequel characters. Luke, Leia, Han, and Vader will appear in one part of the land, near the Millennium Falcon, Oga's Cantina, and the shops, while Rey will patrol on the opposite side, near the Resistance camp setting of Rise of the Resistance. And in the marketplace between the two ends of the land guests will be able to meet Ahsoka Tano and the Mandalorian and Grogu.

In addition to the character additions, Galaxy's Edge will also start featuring selections from John Williams' film scores in April. First Order Cargo, a store that sold First Order merchandise (for all the aspiring space fascists on your holiday list), will change its name to Black Spire Surplus alongside the timeline shift, with a newer, broader range of items on sale. Other stores will also see a merch refresh to reflect the altered timeline. It's the biggest change to Galaxy's Edge since it opened, and should breathe some new life into the land several years into its run.

The Fallout games were never really about the end of the world—because, as it turns out, nothing ever really ends. Look back at the original entries in the long-running RPG series, published by Interplay in the 1990s: From the very beginning, these games were far more interested in what people build in the aftermath of the bombs dropping than in their actual fall, filling the Wastelands with weird new societies growing up like weeds in the wake of total devastation. It's why Interplay paid Ron Perlman “$40 bucks and a sandwich” to intone those legendary words at the top of every game: “War never changes.” We blow things up, we build something new, and, whoops, wouldn't you know it, we're in constant danger of blowing it up all over again.

It's in that mindset that I've been thinking a lot about Fallout: New Vegas lately. To be fair, I think about New Vegas a lot in any case; it's my favorite game in one of my favorite game series ever, so I can start mentally running back through its highlights without much in the way of provocation. (You can read my thoughts on one of its best bits, the incredibly dark playable short story Vault 11, right here.) But as The A.V. Club's episodic reviewer for Prime Video's generally pretty enjoyable Fallout TV show—currently in the midst of a second season that tromps straight through the 2010 classic's old stomping grounds—it's been more on my mind lately than ever. And that has me thinking about rebuilding, because New Vegas, more than any other Fallout game, isn't really about the end of the world: It's about what comes next.

Some context, for the context-hungry: New Vegas was released two years after Bethesda Softworks launched its grand project to save Fallout in the mid-2000s, reviving the moribund franchise, to massive success, with 2008's Fallout 3. That's a game I respect, more than like, if I'm being brutally honest: Fallout 3 did incredible work in dragging the series back from the dead (and straight into people's living rooms), but it also lacked much of the humor, thoughtfulness, and expressiveness that I associated with the Fallout brand. The Capitol Wasteland—transplanted 3,000 miles from the California wreckage of the first two games—was cool as hell to explore, and I liked shooting a Super Mutant in first-person as much as the next Vault Dweller. But I rarely felt I could change the game's world in the same ways that Fallout 2 had taught me I could, allowing me to decide, say, the fate of criminal cesspool New Reno, or the complex, condescending politics of newly founded “utopia” Vault City. 

New Vegas, though, was a sop to cranky-old-bastard-before-their-time 26-year-olds exactly like me: Developed, with Bethesda's blessing, by Obsidian Entertainment (staffed with many of the creators of the original games) and set in the Mojave Desert—i.e., close enough to California for there to be bleed-over from those earlier stories—it was a big, incredibly buggy love letter to old-school Fallout. And because both those players, and those developers, had gotten all of their “explore the devastated, civilization-deprived wastes” needs out of their systems with those previous games, it was also a game that was way more interested in people, and the societies they build, then Fallout often gets credit for. It's a game filled with weird little cargo cults, like the Kings—a gang who discovered a Vegas school for Elvis impersonators, decided “The King” must be a figure of great and terrible power, and patterned their whole look and mannerisms after his persona—or The Boomers, former Air Force survivors who've developed a quasi-religious fixation on their decaying weapons of war. And on the edges, pressing in, the forces of actual capital C civilization: The basically good, if bureaucratic and corruption-prone, New California Republic on one side, and the violently misogynistic Caesar's Legion on the other. (With Robert House, the shadowy, Howard Hughes-esque ruler of New Vegas pulling strings from the shadows.) Each of these groups is extending their fingers out into an essentially lawless frontier, with the player tasked with deciding which of them, if any, will ultimately take control.

If there's a thing that the Fallout show—which has just gotten done, in its most recent episode, with walking viewers through a loving, gorgeous recreation of the game's Strip area, and the surrounding town of Freeside—doesn't really grasp about Fallout in general, and New Vegas specifically, it's that this whole setup is ultimately far more Deadwood than Mad Max. I try not to bemoan this too much in my TV reviews, because the show is its own thing (no matter how many times Bethesda talks about how incredibly canon it all is). But it's pretty clear that the series wants the Wasteland to be a wasteland, and not the frontier that New Vegas (much more interestingly, to my mind) portrays it as. 

That's especially apparent in the show's treatment of the NCR, which is depicted in the series as a last gasp of civilized humanity, destroyed in a fit of cruel pique by a jumped-up middle manager with major divorced dad energy. But the NCR of the games is neither so fragile, nor so perfect, as that nuked-back-to-dust utopia. Growing up from a small settlement in Fallout 1, by the time of New Vegas it's become messy in all the ways democratic societies do: Rife with division, inefficient at the edges, and held together by a core of people who passionately believe in the goodness of its ideals. Critics point out how it's slow; how its policies inevitably favor the rich over the poor; how all its “help” in the New Vegas region seems entirely predicated on keeping control of the Hoover Dam and the power it generates. And the player can take all these critiques in, and, if they so choose, agree with them—or just as easily decide that they'll take well-meaning inefficiency over something more cruelly effective any day of the week. It's the kind of commentary and satire you can only engage in, as a player, because New Vegas is interested in operating at scale, in showing conflicts not just between characters, but between the civilizations they represent. It's a story about societies colliding, which, turns out, you can only do if you don't depict each and every one of them as being nuked back to the Stone Age.

Really, it's all there in the name: Fallout has always been a series that cares about what comes after, rather than simply exulting in the power of destruction. And while I absolutely, 100 percent get why the TV series doesn't truck with much of this stuff—getting people to tune into a video game adaptation is still hard enough, without dropping a big-ass lore bible on their heads—it's also a big part what makes these games, and especially New Vegas, special to me. The bombs were just the prelude; it's the fallout that fascinates.

When we last heard from Mitski, on 2023's The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We, she was surveying vast wildernesses with an existential glint in her eye. Those days, it would seem, are gone. “Where's My Phone?” announces Mitski's eighth album, Nothing's About to Happen to Me, on a note of anxious claustrophobia. Its insistent guitar chug harks back to the indie rock of Bury Me at Makeout Creek, but the song doesn't stay there for long, melting into a foreboding orchestral swell and chorus of wordless voices.

According to a press release, this album's main character is “a reclusive woman in an unkempt house,” and the video for “Where's My Phone?” cranks up the tone of paranoia and psychic unease. Inspired by Shirley Jackson's novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle, it shows our protagonist prowling around a gothic house, her mental state slowly unraveling until she entirely loses her cool on an outsider who dares to breach her sanctuary.

As a songwriter, Mitski harnesses resignation like no one else (hear her singsong, only slightly wry delivery of, “I keep thinking surely somebody will save me/At every turn I learn that no one will”). But her most powerful moments often come when she lets us accompany her far past her breaking point. The final moments of “Where's My Phone?” erupt into a cathartic, fuzzed-out guitar solo—a taste of the gleefully warped drama promised on Nothing's About to Happen to Me.

Rock the Country, the country-music festival launched in 2024 by headliner Kid Rock, announced its 2026 lineup on Monday. Rock was again atop the bill, along with fellow MAGA supporter Jason Aldean, and a vast undercard that included everyone from Creed and Shinedown to Gavin Adcock, Brantley Gilbert, and Nelly. Ludacris' name was also on the poster — until this morning.


	A rep for Rock the Country confirmed that Ludacris was no longer on the festival and directed Rolling Stone to the rapper's team “for any additional comments.” A rep for Ludacris told Rolling Stone that the inclusion of the rapper was “a mix-up. Lines got crossed, and he wasn't supposed to be on there.”


	Fan blowback to Ludacris' involvement with a tour, which some view as MAGA-related, was swift. “Luda, bro, what are you doing? I'm so confused,” one person posted in a video on Instagram. “We about to put you over there with Kanye and Snoop … stop playing. Why'd you sign up for this? You got 48 hours to issue a statement, you got 48 hours to let us know you're about to cancel this contract.”

	











	Another Instagram user said fans shouldn't be surprised by Ludacris appearing on the lineup and cited a photo of the rapper wearing a stage outfit emblazoned with the Confederate flag. “Any man that's willing to rock the Confederate flag as a Black man is a Black man that's willing to do anything for some money,” he said.

	Nelly, who performed on the inaugural 2024 Rock the Country festival, remains on this year's tour. The “Hot in Herre” rapper also performed at President Donald Trump's inauguration in 2025. “I was born in a military base in Austin. My father served, my grandfather served, my uncle served, my auntie served. I've been entertaining the troops all over this world,” Nelly said then, defending his appearance. “If these people can give their life for the office, Nelly can perform for it…. I love this country as well. It is an honor for me to perform for the president of the United States, regardless of who is in office.”

	While the Rock the Country festival isn't explicitly a political event, it has had its share of political statements since its inception. In 2024, Adcock went on a tirade against then-President Joe Biden. “Fuck you Joe Biden, you cocksucking motherfucker,” he shouted onstage. Last year, Trump himself introduced Kid Rock's set at the festival via a video message. “Fight, fight, fight, win, win, win, for the American people,” Trump said.


	Along with Kid Rock and Aldean, the 2026 lineup features Jelly Roll, Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, Brooks & Dunn, Riley Green, Hank Williams Jr., Ella Langley, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. It'll hit eight towns across the U.S. beginning the weekend of May 1-2 in Belleville, Texas. That this year's lineup includes such mainstream stars as Jelly Roll and Shelton underscores the embrace of Trump and the MAGA movement by Nashville's Music Row, in stark contrast to how the industry mostly avoided Trump during his first term.

BTS have announced the title of their forthcoming album. The highly-anticipated LP, the group's first studio album since 2020's Be, will be called Arirang, named for a traditional Korean folk song renowned both in Korea and around the world. 


	Per a press release, “the song has long been associated with emotions of connection, distance, and reunion.” It adds that the album is “a deeply reflective body of work that explores BTS' identity and roots.” 


	“Drawing on the emotional depth of ‘Arirang'—its sense of yearning, longing, and the ebb and flow of life, the band ultimately chose the title for its strong resonance with their current journey,” the press release explains. “The new release explores universal emotions of longing and love and will resonate with the worldwide audience as a timeless legacy across generations and cultures.”


	Digital billboards featuring the logo of the band's new album appeared across major cities to promote the announcement, including in New York, Tokyo, London, and Paris.

	As previously announced, Arirang will arrive on March 20. Before the official confirmation, the seven members teased their return in handwritten notes sent to some special fans to celebrate the New Year. In the messages, they hinted at being reunited soon with their loyal ARMY fanbase, cryptically writing the date March 20, 2026.


	“We've waited more earnestly than anyone else,” RM wrote. “The year we've been waiting for has finally arrived,” Jimin added. “In 2026, we'll make even more good memories, so look forward to it!” V said. 

	











	The band has been back in the studio together working since July, promising an album that will “reflect each member's thoughts and ideas.”

Has anyone ever seen a UFO?

I don't mean merely an unidentified flying object, but an actual flying saucer. You know, from, like, space.

I never have. I've never seen anything remotely out of the ordinary, not even your run-of-the-mill unidentified flying object. I would like to. I don't think that I'm the sort of person to just deny outright the presence or existence of the unexplained.

It's just that I have no direct experience with it.

On the night I drove to Carroll from Arkansas, I thought I was hallucinating. I kept seeing chains of blinking red lights on the horizon, very noticeable in farm country at midnight. I would not have been surprised to hallucinate, because at that point I'd been on the road for 14 hours, including a three-hour stopover at a mechanic shop to repair an engine problem that turned out not to exist. So, I can't say I was in a perfectly lucid frame of mind, especially when those wind turbines started cropping up in Carroll County.

Anyway, the point is, I thought that the lights might be UFOs.

It seemed to be a perfectly good opportunity for ships from space to descend upon a lone, weary traveler in west-central Iowa. I wasn't scared; I didn't even get on the phone to try to confirm a UFO sighting. In fact, within five minutes, I realized I was looking at a wind farm. I noted this to my dog and constant companion, Leo, who simply yawned and went back to sleep. We arrived in Carroll without abduction or incident.

But it would have been cool to have seen a flying saucer!

I bring it up because I recently rewatched “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” the Steven Spielberg film about a governmental cover-up of UFO sightings. I confirmed what I have always suspected, which is that “Close Encounters” is one of my favorite movies of all time and probably depicts what it might sorta/kinda be like to spot a UFO (or get beamed up into the Mothership). If you've never seen “Close Encounters,” do yourself a favor, and then try not looking up at the night sky in an almost hopeful manner.

Am I saying that I believe in aliens? Well ... I believe that sometimes people see things they can't explain. Am I going to go out on a limb here in public and say I believe in extraterrestrials? No. People see things they can't explain all the time. Or they hallucinate. Or they are so stressed out and distracted that they imagine things. Doesn't mean we're being watched by space critters.

I'd just like to actually see something unexplainable myself. It could be a shadow, or a weird shape, or a funny breeze. It could be almost anything. (Nothing too scary, please!) I'm 56 years old and nothing fantastical has happened to me. Will I get lucky here in Iowa?

I gotta admit, it's doubtful!

But I continue to watch the skies.

 Crypto wants its way—even if it means near-term pain.


 Fresh disagreements over how crypto should be regulated have undercut early 2026 ""we are so back"" vibes. While there was a rally in market prices earlier this week, that more recently has stumbled as the Clarity Act, legislation that seeks to create a regulatory framework for the industry, stalled in Washington.


 The almost 300-page bill was a months-long work-in-progress set for a Senate Banking Committee markup hearing this week. That, however, was postponed after Coinbase (COIN) chief Brian Armstrong pulled his support, citing issues including language that would appear to put one of the company's products at risk. Lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating an ethics issue that would restrict senior government officials, including President Donald Trump, from profiting from crypto.


 Shares of crypto companies including Coinbase, Circle (CRCL), and Bullish (BLSH) took hits following the news, but appear to be recouping some ground Friday. Bitcoin and altcoins, including ethereum and solana, also gave back earlier week gains but are also moving higher.


Fresh disagreement over how crypto should be regulated has blunted the rally in bitcoin and other altcoins. That dynamic recalls how, last year, crypto prices stalled despite a number of regulatory wins—though prices were on the upswing to start 2026 before this latest round of uncertainty.

 ""We'd rather have no bill than a bad bill,"" Armstrong said on social media Wednesday evening. He listed issues with the draft bill, including what he called a ""defacto ban on tokenized equities,"" and ""amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins.""


 A massive bill like the Clarity Act, which aims to delineate the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission in regulating crypto, sets guidelines for stablecoins, and covers treatment of decentralized finance, or DeFi, and software developers, was likely to cause friction between various stakeholders and lawmakers.


 One of the bigger issues Armstrong outlined has to do with stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-specific law passed last year, prohibited issuers like Circle from offering yield to customers but left open a loophole that would allow companies like Coinbase to provide them. The draft restricted rewards that resemble savings accounts after banks pressed lawmakers to address the issue, arguing that it would sap deposits and hurt smaller lending firms.


 Arjun Sethi, co-chief of crypto exchange Kraken, disagreed with Armstrong that the Clarity Act ""would be materially worse"" than the current state of affairs. ""Walking away would not preserve the status quo in practice,"" Sethi said on social media Wednesday evening, expressing support for the bill.


 Another point of contention: The bill would ban senior government officials from profiting on crypto ventures, which Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said was outside of his committee's jurisdiction in an interview with CoinDesk, owned by crypto exchange Bullish, and would have to be addressed ""at a later date.""


 Given the scope of some of conflict, some crypto entrepreneurs have expressed doubt that the bill will pass this year, especially with an election ahead that will likely divert attentions. Others close to the subject think it's not dead yet: Scott characterized the delay as a ""brief pause"" and saying ""everyone remains at the table working in good faith.""

Astronomers Spot Mysterious Bar-Shaped Cloud of Iron Inside an Iconic Nebula

A distinctive nebula inside the constellation Lyra holds a never-before-seen cloud of iron atoms—and researchers aren't sure why

The Ring Nebula is a sight to behold. Located in the constellation Lyra, this kaleidoscopic doughnut of gas is the dying echo of a star not too unlike our sun. And according to a new study, it also hosts a never-before-seen, massive cloud of iron atoms. Astronomers aren't sure why.

The cloud, which is in the shape of a bar, has slightly more mass than Mars. Astronomers spotted it using the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) in Spain using an optical spectrometer called the WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE). The findings are detailed in a new paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

“When we processed the data and scrolled through the images, one thing popped out as clear as anything—this previously unknown bar of ionized iron atoms, in the middle of the familiar and iconic ring,” said Roger Wesson, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales and lead author of the new paper, in a statement.

How the bar got there is a mystery. The bar is located somewhere in the middle of the nebula and is about as long as 500 times Pluto's orbit around the sun. It's possible that the bar could tell scientists more about how the nebula formed. The researchers plan to conduct a follow-up study with WEAVE to try and answer some of these questions.

Astronomers don't know why it exists, but it likely is not the only one of its kind. “It would be very surprising if the iron bar in the Ring is unique,” Wesson said in the same statement. “So hopefully, as we observe and analyze more nebulae created in the same way, we will discover more examples of this phenomenon, which will help us to understand where the iron comes from.”

The stone carving could be thousands of years old, possibly from the Bronze Age.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The land known today as Kazakhstan was formed and founded by the crucible of history. 

Home to a variety of cultures in the Bronze Age, including the Srubna, Afanasevo, and Andronovo, this country of the Eurasian Steppes hosted the Dark Age Huns, medieval Turks, and a variety of Khans. And that's all before becoming subjects of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union until eventually gaining independence after the latter's dissolution in the 1990s. Because Kazakhstan sits at such a crossroad of history, it's also one of the most archaeologically rich places on Earth—and a new discovery by unsuspecting fire crews once again proves this fact.

While patrolling the Sandyktau region, an area located some 200 miles northwest of Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, Nursultan Ashkenov and Akhmet Zaripov, both employees of the district fire service, stumbled upon an austere face carved into the side of a granite boulder. According to local news sources, the department immediately contacted the country's Ministry for Emergency Situations as well as the local museum. 

The face is around 10.5 inches long and roughly 8 inches wide, and some archeologists hypothesize that the carving was likely part of some ritual complex. 

 “The face is clearly visible,” Sergey Yarygin, a scientist at the Alkey Margulan Institute of Archaeology, said to Archaeology Magazine (click link to see images), “with large eyes, a long straight nose, and protruding lips. Kazakh archaeology not only enriches the scientific world with its remarkable discoveries but also reveals the main stages of the ancient and medieval development of Kazakhstan society.”

However, figuring out when this face was used for such ritualistic purposes is a bit more complicated.  According to Yarygin, similar carvings have been found at Bronze Age sites across Central Asia and Western Europe, but the carving also holds a striking resemblance to other types of iconography found in Iron Age sites in southern Siberia or even medieval Turkish cultures. 

The mysteries of Kazakhstan's historical melange strike again.  

Teams investigating the carving will likely need more time to determine its age and what culture might've created the stunningly somber carving. 

This discovery is only one of several made across the county recently, as reported by the Astana Times. Archaeologists uncovered a number of artifacts from the northwestern Pavlodar region, including pottery fragments, kitchen utensils, and an arrowhead dated to around the mid-13th to 8th century BCE. Other discoveries in the central Karaganda region also point to a variety of artifacts likely belonging to the Alakul culture, a subculture of the Andronovo culture, that thrived in this region around 2000 to 1700 BCE. 

All of these discoveries uncover the fascinating fabric of history that pervades the largest country within the Eurasian Steppe.

Adding cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to the antipsychotic quetiapine for the treatment of mood disorders outperformed quetiapine alone for reduced risk for suicide, improved depressive symptoms, and enhanced coping after 12 weeks, a new study showed.

“Clinical benefits from CBT combined with quetiapine suggest patients with mood disorder and suicide risk receiving pharmacotherapy should also be offered skills-based psychosocial interventions that emphasize illness management strategies and enhance coping skills,” the investigators wrote.

This study was led by Ke Wang, The Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. It was published online on January 03 in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

The absence of long-term effectiveness analysis limited the durability of improvements in coping and the risk for suicide. Additionally, the single-center design and restriction to adult participants limited the generalizability of findings to other centers and age groups.

Funding information was not disclosed. The investigators reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Benjamin Cremaschi has been recognized as U.S. Soccer's Young Male Player of the Year. The award comes as a result of a standout 2025 that saw Cremaschi become just the second U.S. player to claim a Golden Boot as the leading scorer at a major youth tournament. The midfielder, who came from the Inter Miami academy, is currently on loan at Parma.

The 20-year-old midfielder's defining moments of 2025 came at the U-20 World Cup, where he served as the U.S. team's captain through their quarterfinal run. At that tournament, Cremaschi scored five goals, headlined by a three-goal, two-assist performance against New Caledonia in a 9-1 win. He then scored a brace in the Round of 16 win over Italy, setting a U.S. U-20 record for most goals in a tournament in addition to his Golden Boot win.

On the club level, Cremaschi played 22 times for Inter Miami, having broken through as the club's biggest homegrown star. This summer, though, Cremaschi departed Florida for Italy, signing on loan with Parma.

In addition, the midfielder also featured for the USMNT in January camp.

Cremaschi's win comes just one day after U.S. Soccer confirmed that Chris Richards had been recognized as the federation's Male Player of the Year.

""This award means a lot to me,"" Cremaschi said. ""It's a representation of how my year went with my clubs and the National Team. This is an amazing accomplishment, but it also speaks to all the people around me that keep me going as a player. I want to thank my family, teammates and everyone that made this award possible. My U-20 teammates gave me the confidence I needed to be the player and leader I needed to be at the World Cup. That is a group of guys I will never forget.

""I also want to thank Marko Mitrovic – a coach I've had at many different levels with the National Team – for his belief and guidance along the way. Finally, I'm so grateful to my family, for their support and love.""

Cremaschi was one of five finalists for the award, which he claimed with 38.9 percent of the weighted vote. Finishing second in that voting was Philadelphia Union starlet Cavan Sullivan, who collected 34.8 percent, while Borussia Dortmund rising star Mathis Albert came in third with 12.3 percent.

The U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award has been given out since 1998, with Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley, Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna among the past winners. Last year, Tanner Tessmann claimed the award for his run with the U.S. at the 2024 Olympics.

Cremaschi has played sparingly for Parma this season as the American midfielder adjusts to life in Serie A. In total, he's made just four Serie A appearances, although he did start a cup game against Bologna in December.

Parma, who sit 14th in Serie A, will face 15th-place Genoa on Sunday.
