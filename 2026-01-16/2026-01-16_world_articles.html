                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Khalil's supporters fear a new ruling could pave the way for the Trump administration to rearrest and deport him. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! A federal appeals court on Thursday delivered the Trump administration a victory in its efforts to deport Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, opening the door for his rearrest. He missed the birth of his son, Deen, while in detention. “The Trump administration is trying everything in its power to come after me, to put the full weight of the government to actually make an example out of me,” Khalil tells Democracy Now! “The U.S. government has not brought a shred of evidence that I broke any laws.” The appeals court did not weigh in on the constitutional merits, instead saying Khalil should have appealed his removal order in immigration court before going to a federal judge. “What people need to understand is the immigration courts are not real courts,” says Baher Azmy, a member of Khalil's legal team. Copy may not be in its final form. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and jailed in March for taking part in campus protests at Columbia University as a graduate student. He was the first noncitizen student targeted and arrested by the Trump administration for pro-Palestine speech, detained for months, first in New Jersey, then in Louisiana, before a federal district judge in New Jersey granted a habeas petition in his case, saying his constitutional rights had likely been violated. Now in a split two-to-one decision, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned that ruling on jurisdictional grounds, saying Khalil should have first appealed his removal in immigration court. For more, we're still joined by Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as well as Mahmoud Khalil himself, who's joining us via Zoom. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, this ruling is absolutely disappointing. This administration, the Trump administration, is trying everything in its power to come after me, to put the full weight of the government to actually make an example out of me. And this means that I will be separated from my U.S. wife and son, who both were born in this country. And just, like, it underscores how this administration is weaponizing the legal system, how fragile due process can be when our rights are treated as conditional rather than guaranteed. And basically, as you said, what they want me to do is to wait for an immigration process that's fully completed — fully controlled by the Trump administration to get justice from this, from this process, which, as we know, this wouldn't happen, that this “immigration judge,” quote-unquote, will not let us develop our case to bring it on appeal. And 10 months now after my detention, the U.S. government has not brought a shred of evidence that I broke any laws, that I spoke anything in support of terrorist organizations, yet they continue to weaponize the legal system. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Mahmoud, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has claimed that your very presence spreads antisemitism, your very presence in this country. MAHMOUD KHALIL: No, I mean, this is an administration that spreads hate. You know, I'm here to support Palestinian rights, the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people for their self-determination and liberation. And again, we told them we want to see them in court, and that's what they don't want to do. They want to take this case into immigration court, which they fully control, so we don't have to present — or, they don't have to present any evidence. And as Judge Young yesterday, in another case in Massachusetts, said, that what happened in this case is essentially an unconstitutional conspiracy between Rubio himself and Noem, the secretary of homeland security, to pick up certain people, to twist the laws and to go after people they don't like. This is a judge, a Reagan appointee judge, who said that, that they are conspiring to do that, to make an example out of me, so they chill the speech of everyone in this country, regardless of their — regardless of their status. Then there was Mohsen Mahdawi, who's now a Columbia graduate student. You have filed a $20 million lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming you were falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted, deliberately smeared. And in a case, Judge William Young called Mr. Trump an authoritarian and said the administration's actions targeting noncitizen student protesters violated the First Amendment. That decision only applies to members of two academic organizations in the case. And this administration needs to pay for all these lawless actions that they are committing. So, this is just like one action towards that end. And this is why they are retaliating against me, because I'm also standing up against their actions, and they don't like that. I will continue my advocacy until Palestine is free. AMY GOODMAN: How do you keep Mahmoud Khalil free, Baher? BAHER AZMY: Well, just to reassure everyone, this decision, taking away jurisdiction from the district court, is not — doesn't immediately go into effect. So, the order releasing him is still in effect and will be in effect until the appeals process is exhausted. He also talked about how Rubio and others have a fear of freedom. Imagine being so cowardly and ashamed of the First Amendment that rather take on the speech that you disagree with, you try and imprison those who dissent from U.S. foreign policy. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But, Baher, this whole issue of Judge Young's decision on the free speech rights of noncitizens, the appeals panel claiming that he lacked subject matter jurisdiction, could you explain the logic of that? So, to be clear, the appeals court in — headquartered in Philadelphia did not take on the illegality of the detention, which basically every court that has reviewed this policy has found unconstitutional. That's why we wanted our constitutional claims to be heard in a real court, a real constitutional court. And, you know, that's where these kind of constitutional claims can be, not in a court that rubber stamps the executive branch's policies. AMY GOODMAN: Just going to end this segment with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani posting on social media, quote, “Last year's arrest of Mahmoud Khalil was more than just a chilling act of political repression, it was an attack on all of our constitutional rights. Now, as the crackdown on pro-Palestinian free speech continues, Mahmoud is being threatened with rearrest. Your final response, Mahmoud Khalil, as you sit here in New York City now free man? MAHMOUD KHALIL: You know, I would say, like, this is — all these attempts are just to really distract us from what's really happening, which is Israel's genocide in Gaza and Israel's action against Palestinians in whole of Palestine, and also to distract from the fact that this administration, just two days ago, sent $3.3 billion to Israel, from our money, from our tax money. AMY GOODMAN: Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, Mahmoud Khalil, and Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Historical Association members are undaunted by the veto: “We educate. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! “This is a really egregious violation of both the AHA's principles and mission, but also the democratic vote,” AHA member Mezna Qato, a historian of Palestine at the University of Cambridge and a member of the Palestinian Historians Group (PHG), told Truthout. Qato told Truthout that a growing number of academics have been spurred to action as they witness escalating attacks against their profession and on-campus Palestine solidarity movements. “Part of it is about bringing your historical profession in alignment with your moral and civic and political values and doing so in a way that supports and advances other struggles within the AHA, including a defense of academic freedom, freedom of speech, [and] the profession itself against the vagaries of this rising authoritarian turn in the U.S.,” she told Truthout. It is also the largest such association in the world, with over 10,000 members who research various regions and eras at institutions worldwide. This year's conference in Chicago featured panels on academic freedom, immigration, and teaching Palestine and the Middle East, which drew connections to contemporary threats to the field and attacks on vulnerable communities. The meeting followed weeks of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the host city, which disrupted learning for hundreds of students. (Now, the attacks have mostly moved on to Minneapolis, where many schools have begun offering online learning in an effort to protect students and families from harassment or abduction.) Members who voted on the “Resolution Opposing Attacks on Core Principles of Education” at January's AHA meeting said doing so felt particularly urgent in the face of those attacks. “The Trump administration has been so brutal, so unscrupulous, and so quick in mounting an attack on education and its core principles of fairness, transparency, truth,” AHA member Ellen Schrecker, a professor emerita of American history at Yeshiva University and HPAD member, told Truthout. “The whole sector, from Harvard's president down to daycare providers, are under assault.” Guiding principles call for the association to take a public stance “when public or private authorities, in the United States or elsewhere, threaten the preservation of or free access to historical sources.” The resolution calls on the association to condemn “ongoing attacks on academic freedom, free speech, faculty governance, and equity from government officials, including the president of the United States, [which] are irreparably damaging education.” It also calls on the AHA to condemn justifications for attacks on education rooted in “weaponize[d] allegations of antisemitism and racism.” That phrasing points to the way that lawmakers and special interest groups have seized on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, as well as expressions of solidarity with Palestine, to target, investigate, and attack institutions, educators, and students. The second resolution heard at this year's meeting was a “Resolution in Solidarity with Gaza.” It recognized scholasticide in the enclave and called for “support[ing] efforts to ensure the current survival, and future rebuilding, of Palestinian higher education.” AHA member Stacy Fahrenthold, a historian of the modern Middle East at the University of California, Davis, told Truthout that supporting the future of Palestinian educational institutions is not only a moral issue but also a matter of professional importance to her field. Votes on the two resolutions came after leadership vetoed a similar “Resolution to Oppose Scholasticide in Gaza” last year, even though members had voted to pass it at the annual meeting. The decision tracks with a wider trend among professional societies and unions of educators of suppressing members who speak out against genocide in Gaza, as well as their efforts to distance their associations from that violence through divestment or other actions. Many have been accused of complying in advance with an increasingly authoritarian Trump administration. Under previous administrations, AHA has passed resolutions or issued statements condemning conflicts that were led or backed by the U.S., and the destruction of educational infrastructure. In 2007, it passed a resolution urging its members to oppose the war on Iraq. It also issued a statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The statements seem to align with guiding principles that AHA published in 2017, which call for the association to take a public stance “when public or private authorities, in the United States or elsewhere, threaten the preservation of or free access to historical sources.” “These vetoes are an abandonment of the AHA's democratic principles and a dereliction of the AHA's duty to defend academic freedom. Despite setbacks, Qato told Truthout she believes many members remain committed to mobilizing within the confines of the professional association, whether through future resolutions or other interventions. “The space at AHA, and the extraordinary capacity building that it has allowed for, and the conversations that have brought so many of us together — we're not going to rescind that space.” Schrecker, who at 87 years old has been engaged in the anti-war struggle and the fight for academic freedom longer than most, told Truthout she is confident that the movement will gain ground as she and her colleagues continue their organizing work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So I may do that," Trump said in the White House while mentioning his past threats about tariffs on European pharmaceuticals. Trump has also often wielded tariffs as a tool of geopolitical coercion. Earlier this week, top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, met Danish and Greenlandic officials, but the talks failed to achieve a breakthrough. In the meantime, small groups of European soldiers began arriving in Greenland as European allies voiced support for the territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland. Trump has previously accused Copenhagen of not investing enough in the island's security and claimed that, unless the U.S. takes control of Greenland, Russia and China will. Greenland's strategic importance has grown as Arctic ice melts, opening new shipping routes and increasing access to mineral resources. The island, home to about 56,000 people, already hosts a U.S. military base. In this exclusive interview, the Kyiv Independent's Yuliia Taradiuk speaks with a Ukrainian Special Operations Forces' officer who helps organize resistance movements in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. Around 55% of Ukrainians support holding a referendum on a potential peace deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine, while 32% oppose this idea, according to the poll. Ukraine hopes to gain more clarity on "documents that we have actually drafted with the American side, and regarding Russia's response to all this diplomatic work," Zelensky said. China's electricity purchases from Russia were suspended on Jan. 1 due to higher export prices that now exceed domestic Chinese rates, Kommersant reported. Czech President Petr Pavel and President Volodymyr Zelensky will discuss ways "to advance our strategic partnership, defense cooperation, and peace efforts," said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Ex-Prime Minister Yuliia Tymoshenko is also obliged to appear in court when summoned and cannot leave Kyiv Oblast. Putin said Russia is ready to serve as a mediator in the Middle East, an offer that follows signals that the U.S. might launch strikes against Iran amid a deadly crackdown on protests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was on a trip with a friend to the east coast of Spain that the chef Matthew Slotover came across the “Garden of Eden”, an organic farm growing citrus varieties he had never heard of. The farm yields far more interesting fruit than oranges and lemons for Slotover's menu, including kumquat, finger lime, sudachi and bergamot. She recently raved about a dinner there that included langoustine and scallops with Rangpur lime and Spanish sweet limetta, and a “heavenly” guava roll with Shikuwasa mandarin. When Slotover visited the Todolí farm, he was awestruck. “It was like the Garden of Eden”, he said. “But citrus is too good to miss,” he said, during a visit to the Oxford Real Farming conference earlier this month. He teamed up with other chefs to bring over some rare varieties from the farm, and they became so popular he passed distribution over to the organic food supplier Shrub, which sells them to chefs across London. They contain zesty pearls that burst in the mouth and have a fragrant sweet-and-sour flavour. “When we first approached the owner Vincente [Todolí, the former Tate Modern director], he said: ‘We don't really sell it. “Spain is the world's largest exporter of fresh citrus,” he said. Our climate, the cold nights, warm days and sea breeze help us with all our varieties, more or less.” Rather than using artificial irrigation, which is water-intensive, they have learned from the ancient Arab practices and use irrigation ditches and ponds, which are not only attractive to look at but store water very well. They have also created a haven for songbirds previously linked to Valencia's citrus groves but which have been wiped out by herbicides and insecticides. This is something unique to study,” Olivares-Fuster said. “Investigating these will be key for citrus to survive all the challenges that are coming, including climate change. One of his favourite varieties to grow is the trifoliate orange. It is a small, very sharp fruit used mostly in jams and marmalades or as a substitute for lemon zest in recipes. This means it can be very resistant to cold”. Perhaps scientists could use this genetic trait to help other citrus varieties survive in colder climates, he suggested. Chefs are keen on calamansi, a small, sour fruit originally from the Philippines, and the fragrant Borneo lumia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Any Lucía López Belloza was detained at Boston's airport in November and flown to Honduras two days later The Trump administration apologized in court for a “mistake” in the deportation of a Massachusetts college student who was detained trying to fly home to surprise her family in Texas for Thanksgiving. Any Lucía López Belloza, a 19-year-old freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, 15 miles west of Boston, was detained at the city's airport on 20 November and flown to Honduras two days later. Her sudden removal came despite an emergency court order on 21 November directing the government to keep her in Massachusetts or elsewhere in the United States for at least 72 hours for legal processes. López Belloza, whose family emigrated from Honduras to the US in 2014 when she was seven, is currently staying with grandparents and studying remotely. She is not detained and was recently visiting an aunt in El Salvador. In early December, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers reportedly turned up at her parents' home in Austin, Texas, and behaved aggressively towards the family but left without taking further action. In court filings and in open court, government lawyers said an ICE deportation officer mistakenly believed the order no longer applied and he failed to activate a system that alerts other ICE officers that a case is subject to judicial review and that removal should be halted. In a declaration filed with the court on 2 January, the ICE officer also admitted he did not notify ICE's enforcement office in Port Isabel, Texas, that the removal mission needed to be canceled. The government maintains, however, that her deportation was lawful because an immigration judge ordered the removal of López Belloza and her mother in 2016, and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed their appeal in 2017. Prosecutors said she could have pursued additional appeals or sought a stay of removal. Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, countered that she was deported in clear violation of the 21 November order and said the government's actions deprived her of due process. “I was hoping the government would show some leniency and bring her back,” he said. “It might not be anybody's fault, but she was the victim of it,” Stearns said, adding at one point that López Belloza could explore applying for a student visa.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's foreign ministry strongly recommends Russian nationals refrain from trips to Moldova amid what it called numerous cases of discrimination against Russian citizens in that country. "Moscow continues to record numerous episodes of discrimination, ungrounded harassment and undue treatment of Russian citizens in Moldova by the Moldovan authorities," the ministry said. The ministry "strongly recommend that Russian citizens take these risks into account and refrain from traveling to Moldova." "Relevant requests from the Russian diplomatic mission are ignored. The ministry warned that upon arrival in Chisinau's airport, holders of Russian passports "are regularly subjected to humiliating searches and checks." Moreover, they often have to spend hours in the transit zone, being deprived of basic services. "In some cases, Russian citizens spent more than two days at the airport. Oftentimes they were subsequently banned from entering the country under invented pretexts. Cases of arbitrary application of laws, detention at the border, and criminal prosecution without compelling evidence have also been reported. On departing from Chisinau, passengers are subjected to deliberately protracted security checks so that they miss their flights," the ministry added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Images of plants painted on pottery made up to 8,000 years ago may be the earliest example of humans' mathematical thought, a study has found. Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem examined pottery produced by the Halafian people of northern Mesopotamia, who lived between 6200 BC and 5500 BC. Many bowls featured flowers that have been depicted with four, eight, 16, 32 or 64 petals. Study authors Yosef Garfinkel, a professor in archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Sarah Krulwich, a research assistant and MA student at the university's archaeology department, examined pottery fragments from 29 Halafian sites, excavated over a 100-year period from 1899. They found that in nearly every one of the 375 fragments that depict flowers, the number of petals is determined by this doubling sequence, which divides a circle into symmetrical units. “The strict adherence to these numbers, which are repeated in examples from different sites over hundreds of kilometers, cannot be accidental, and indicates that it was done intentionally,” Garfinkel told CNN. “These patterns show that mathematical thinking began long before writing,” Krulwich said in the statement. “People visualized divisions, sequences, and balance through their art.” The study contributes to the academic field of ethnomathematics, which identifies mathematical knowledge embedded in cultural expression by prehistoric or non-literate communities. World's oldest string of yarn shows Neanderthals were smarter than we thought This is not the first time it has been suggested that artifacts other than written documents may indicate early mathematical thinking. Some experts believe that evidence of string-making by Neanderthals more than 40,000 years ago indicates that our Stone Age ancestors had an understanding of mathematical concepts like pairs and sets, as well as other basic numeracy skills. Garfinkel said his team's discovery constitutes a foundational step in the maturation of human thought, and that understanding how to do basic division would have been necessary for the later emergence of more complex mathematics. “Like everything in human development, aspects of mathematics also developed in an evolutionary way from the simple to the more complex,” he said. He and Krulwich also said in the statement that the Halafian pottery is unique in being an early instance of humans applying an understanding of symmetry to art. None of the images depicts edible crops, implying their purpose was aesthetic rather than agricultural or ritualistic. “These vessels represent the first moment in history when people chose to portray the botanical world as a subject worthy of artistic expression,” they said. However, Jens Høyrup, Senior Associate Professor Emeritus at Roskilde University, Denmark, who specializes in Mesopotamian mathematics and was not involved in the study, is less convinced by the archaeologists' argument. But we cannot decide from there that they had a mathematical system,” he adds. “There's no higher mathematics; it's just the simplest way to make divisions.” Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Worrying about money and food may age the heart even faster than traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease, according to a new study published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and the findings raise new questions about how financial stress fits into cardiovascular health and what people can do to protect their hearts. Making these lifestyle changes reduces chronic disease, even if you have a genetic risk I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen to help explain how financial stress can affect the heart and what steps people can take to improve their heart health and protect against that stress. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. Dr. Leana Wen: The researchers analyzed data from over 280,000 adults who had completed detailed surveys about the social and economic factors in their lives and underwent clinical evaluations of their cardiovascular health. Instead of just looking at whether people developed heart disease, the team focused on a concept called “cardiovascular age,” which reflects how old a person's heart and blood vessels look biologically compared with what one would expect for their actual age. They found that people who reported higher levels of financial stress and food insecurity tended to have evidence of more advanced cardiovascular aging, even after accounting for traditional medical risk factors. In other words, two people of the same chronological age and with the same clinical risk profiles could have hearts that “aged” at different rates, depending on how much financial strain they were under. While the study does not prove that financial stress directly causes accelerated heart aging, it strongly suggests that the economic strain can affect not only mental well-being but also cardiovascular health. CNN: What does it mean to say that stress can “age” the heart? Wen: When researchers measure heart aging, this refers to structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular system that increase the risk of heart disease. These include stiffening of blood vessels, changes in heart muscle function and impaired ability of the cardiovascular system to respond to exertion. When these systems are activated repeatedly over long periods, they can contribute to wear and tear on the heart and blood vessels. Over time, that cumulative effect may resemble what we see with aging or long-standing medical conditions. Wen: Financial stress has some unique features that make it particularly potent. It can involve persistent worries about bills, housing stability, medical expenses, debt or support of family members. Because money affects so many aspects of daily life, financial stress can be difficult to escape. All these factors compound one another and can amplify cardiovascular risk over time. CNN: How does financial stress compare with traditional risk factors like high blood pressure or diabetes? Wen: To me, what's most striking about this study is that the magnitude of the association between financial stress and heart aging was similar to or even exceeded that of many clinical risk factors. This research suggests that social determinants of health, including financial stress and food insecurity, may belong in the same conversation. Someone with high blood pressure who is also under severe financial strain may face compounded risk. A doctor shares the 5 science-backed habits that matter most CNN: Does this mean heart disease is inevitable for people under financial stress? CNN: How should clinicians think about financial stress when assessing heart health? Wen: Clinicians should consider financial stress as part of a patient's overall risk profile, much like family history or lifestyle factors. Asking patients about stress, financial strain and access to resources can provide important context for medical decision-making. Long walks linked to improved heart health and longevity CNN: What are other steps people should take to protect heart health? Routine checkups matter because many cardiovascular risk factors develop silently. What women can do to reduce their risk from heart disease CNN: What is the broader takeaway from this research? Wen: This study reinforces that health is shaped not only by the health care that people receive but also the social and economic conditions in their lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney inspects an honour guard during an official welcoming at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Then U.S. President Donald Trump arrived and blew up everything. Like Canadians cutting back on trips to the United States, Mr. Carney is making alternative travel plans because of an abrupt change in the weather in Canada's preferred destination. A winter sojourn in Beijing has been forced on Canada because our favourite all-season resort down south has undergone an abrupt change in management. Mr. Trump has spent the past year telling his best customer that he regards us with something between indifference and hostility. Other American allies have received similar rhetoric, and higher tariffs. Beijing's economic aim is similar to MAGA's – but its strategy has been far more thoughtful and patient. Its goal is making China the world's pre-eminent manufacturing power, through an industrial policy of subsidies, trade barriers and currency suppression. It is dumping what are effectively subsidized goods on every other country, which eliminates producers elsewhere. Campbell Clark: Carney needs to be wary of the same old China ‘reset' mirage Other formerly closed economies entered the global free trading system without ill effects, but China's impact has been different – because it set out to be different. If Beijing has its way, this year's figure will be higher, with meagre imports tilting even more to raw materials, and even more exports of manufactured goods. To take one example, a quarter-century ago, Canada produced more cars than China. In 2024, China made more motor vehicles than the U.S., Japan, Germany, South Korea and Canada – combined. One possible response to the Chinese strategy is let it happen. And that has mostly been the response until now. Artificially suppressed Chinese prices are, at least in the short term, subsidizing Western living standards. But in the long run, we'll end up with Beijing's autocratic regime dominating the world, militarily and economically, through a stranglehold on manufacturing. Lawrence Martin: Rebuilding relations with China is a gamble Mark Carney has to take The European Union also imposed tariffs of up to 35 per cent on Chinese EVs in 2024. Canada, Australia, the EU, Britain, Japan, South Korea and others are all concerned about China's impact on their industries, and the implications for their long-term security. What had been a solidifying common front against Beijing has turned into something close to the opposite. The reason for the turn is that Mr. Trump is far more interested in attacking erstwhile allies than in making common cause. Opinion: Instead of a China pivot, how about we start building at home? He appears to not grasp that U.S. manufacturers are more viable and competitive with China if they have larger markets for sales and production, which can only come through mutually beneficial co-operation with countries that are not China. Ditto for steel, aluminum, wood products, aircraft – the list is long. But Mr. Trump, by pursuing a predatory divide-and-conquer strategy against alleged allies, is empowering Beijing's own moves to divide and conquer those same countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major air defense aid package has arrived in Ukraine to help defend its stricken energy infrastructure as the country-wide winter energy crisis deepens, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 16. Each successive delivery of extra air defense support from Ukraine's partners is being begged and fought for, said Zelensky, who noted that Ukraine's needs extended far beyond the well-known U.S.-built Patriot system. Ukraine is loosening curfew restrictions to allow citizens to reach humanitarian aid centers even at nighttime amid an ongoing energy crisis caused by Russian attacks, Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Jan. 16. "This is necessary so that everyone who currently has no electricity, water, or heat receives the necessary assistance," Shmyhal explained during a meeting in the parliament, noting that similar rules are already in effect during air raid alerts. A curfew was introduced in Ukraine alongside martial law at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, largely prohibiting citizens from being outside during specific hours. In Kyiv and most other regions away from the front line, it lasts from midnight until 5 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelensky signaled upcoming changes in the rules earlier this week. The resulting hardships and dangers have affected millions of Ukrainians, with heating cut to a minimum and indoor temperatures plummet, while regular non-scheduled power outages greatly limit alternative options for staying warm. "I've recently come back to Kyiv after three years abroad, and this winter feels like the worst I have ever seen while I was visiting," said Lisa Sokolova, a 24-year-old communications manager based in the capital to the Kyiv Independent. "Life has become critically unpredictable, it is impossible to plan even an evening or the next day. You never know if there will be heat, water, light, and the ability to work or cook." In Kyiv, city authorities announced on Jan. 10 a significant dialling down in outdoor light output, with most streets lights reduced to 20% power and any decorative lighting switched off entirely. In addition to air defense support Ukraine's partners continue to supply Kyiv with emergency aid directed both at repairing energy infrastructure and mitigating the humanitarian effects of the crisis. The heaviest strikes were recorded in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast, as well as the Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Chernihiv oblasts. "At the same time, I understand that capitulation will make things worse — we will lose the opportunity for justice without guarantees of safety." In this exclusive interview, the Kyiv Independent's Yuliia Taradiuk speaks with a Ukrainian Special Operations Forces' officer who helps organize resistance movements in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. Around 55% of Ukrainians support holding a referendum on a potential peace deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine, while 32% oppose this idea, according to the poll. Ukraine hopes to gain more clarity on "documents that we have actually drafted with the American side, and regarding Russia's response to all this diplomatic work," Zelensky said. China's electricity purchases from Russia were suspended on Jan. 1 due to higher export prices that now exceed domestic Chinese rates, Kommersant reported. Most Ukrainians oppose trading the Donbas to Russia even in exchange for Western security guarantees, a new survey shows. Czech President Petr Pavel and President Volodymyr Zelensky will discuss ways "to advance our strategic partnership, defense cooperation, and peace efforts," said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Ex-Prime Minister Yuliia Tymoshenko is also obliged to appear in court when summoned and cannot leave Kyiv Oblast. Putin said Russia is ready to serve as a mediator in the Middle East, an offer that follows signals that the U.S. might launch strikes against Iran amid a deadly crackdown on protests. "In 2025 (...) growth was supported by domestic trade, construction, (...)  the production of defense products and metallurgy," Oleksiy Sobolev, Ukraine's economy minister, said in a press release.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How can its tropical tenants move without dying in the process? Even on an overcast day, it is hot in the all-glass Palm House at London's Kew Gardens. You're looking down on a thicket of plants and history. But very few of the rare and valuable tropical plants in the glass house can survive outside, even in England's mild-but-getting-hotter climate. The Palm House at Kew Gardens, opened in 1848, is a wrought-iron and glass contraption for simulating a tropical climate, insulated from the cold of London's winters. You have to manoeuvre the exotics out of the Palm House – some of them are more than eight metres tall – and into warm, moist temporary quarters known as “decant houses.” Then you have to move the plants back in. Oh, and you need to grow backups, in case the transplants don't take. This is why Will Spoelstra, the Palm House's supervisor, has the wary look of a man trying to avoid being run over by a vehicle speeding in from an unforeseen direction. In addition to the usual sweaty overheating and hydration concerns of gardeners and botanists who specialize in “working under glass,” he has a lot on his mind. Mr. Spoelstra has worked at Kew for more than a decade, and has been planning the logistics of the renovation for several years. So far, his team has identified plants whose roots can be containerized and moved by hand. That includes some specimens up to five metres in height. As a result, many species will instead be propagated or regrown from seed, from cuttings or using “air layers,” where the stem of a tree is wounded and wrapped in damp moss to encourage new roots to form. Supervisor Will Spoelstra and his team must prioritize which plants to move and which to regrow so the collection can be reassembled in the renovated space. The building's most famous residents are 175 species of palm that inspired centuries of exploitation as well as the Western world's obsession with everything warm, exotic, fecund and forbidden. They present particular problems to Mr. Spoelstra because “palms you can only really propagate from seed. No one's ever worked out how to do it otherwise.” “We've known this is likely to happen for a while, so we've been propagating for a while,” the ever-sanguine Mr. Spoelstra replies. Several species are impossible to move because they are upholstered in piercing spines – such as Aiphanes eggersii, a pinnate palm that produced fruit at Kew for the first time this year. That's not a plant you want to accidentally kill. Mr. Spoelstra will have to clear an avenue in the Palm House to get it out and into temporary storage via wheeled scaffolding. Experts who specialize in moving large works of art have been advising Mr. Spoelstra. Ivory nut palms can grow 25 metres tall, and are nearly impossible to move. A new one will have to be regrown for the renovated Palm House. But for that to happen, Kew's female ivory nut palm − nut palms are dioecious, that is, they come in male and female plants – has to produce some seed. For the palm to produce some seeds, you have to fertilize its flowers with some pollen from a male ivory nut palm. Kew, alas, does not have a male ivory nut palm. “Can't you find a male?” the visitor asks. “They're not that easy to find,” Mr. Spoelstra mutters. Kew has, however, managed to cadge some male ivory-nut-palm pollen from a botanical centre in Singapore, with which Kew's gardeners will then manually pollinate their female. The building's famous swanny two-storey wrought-iron structure is still structurally sound. (It was one of the first prefabricated edifices ever built.) Its aforementioned 16,000 panes of glass (which revitalized the British glass industry when they were first designed specifically for Kew in the 1840s) have to be replaced with infinitely more energy-efficient glass that nevertheless doesn't interfere with the tropical plants' lust for light and heat. The conservatory's soil will have to be tested and repacked; a new humidifying system, new rainwater tanks and a costly reverse-osmosis system will be installed. The greenhouse's famous heating system – staunch hot-water pipes that run under its iron grille floors and keep the all-glass Palm House no cooler than 19 degrees at night and preferably under 30 during the day – will be replaced. So will its notorious gas-fired boilers (which replaced their coal-fired cousins) located roughly 180 metres away, via underground tunnel, under a chimney and water tank disguised as a Romanesque campanile. The refurbished Palm House will henceforth stay hot via complicated new air-source heat pumps. The hope is that, postrenovation, the Palm House will be revered once again – not just carbon-neutral but carbon-negative, and therefore climate positive, by 2030. “If we can make a huge glass house in London net zero at 28 degrees constant year round, anyone can,” Rebecca Munro, Kew's executive director of development, told me on one of my visits to the garden last October. If it all works as planned, the Palm House will have been transformed from a monument to the glory of imperialism and empire, into an admonishment of the same – a practical, working example of what we can do to reverse the effects of our careless ambition. Raoul Curtis-Machin, Kew's new executive director of gardens, points out that discussions about the Palm House's future have been wide-ranging. But the flip side is that a big percentage of our population would never get the chance to see these plants. So if we can heat a palm house and still make that structure sustainable, it's win-win.” Ms. Munro and Mr. Curtis-Machin are now building a global network of glass conservatories awaiting the results of the experiment at Kew. (It's too late for downtown Toronto: The interior of the gorgeous tropical conservatory at Allan Gardens was cleared of plants in 2022 and is now rented out as an empty space for weddings.) The Palm House was recently listed as a World Heritage site. No wonder: Kew and its vast seed bank at its sister site at Wakehurst comprise 2.5 billion living seeds and 40,000 species of wild plant. A glass house is a surprisingly serious place, especially in London, where nothing happens without the past having something to say about it. Dutch House, built as a silk merchant's mansion in 1631, was here long before the Hanoverian Royal Family took a liking to this area and made it into Kew Palace. The Palm House protects palms and tropical plants, but its most lasting stock has been fantasy. What became Kew Gardens – 130 hectares in the borough of Richmond in London's west end, directly under the steadily roaring landing path of Heathrow airport – was first cobbled together from a string of royal properties in 1789. Capability Brown's landscape garden movement was taking root nearby. George used the royal pleasure grounds and what is now known as Kew Palace to recover from his bouts of illness, which may have been porphyria or bipolar disorder, or some combination thereof. On the other hand, while I was visiting Kew, Donald Trump retweeted a meme of himself wearing a crown and piloting a jet that dumped tons of excrement on American protesters, so you be the judge.) George built up Kew's exotic plant collection with the help of his pal Sir Joseph Banks, the doyen of natural science in Great Britain: By 1768, Kew had collected 3,400 species. (It boasts 27,000 today – not bad, given that Brazil, the most biodiverse country on Earth, today supports 46,000 known plant species.) Kew's future was also in peril as political factions fought for its dissolution. The issue, then as now, was money: Was it reasonable that the government should spend £35,000 on palm trees when impoverished and hungry Irish were flocking to London? She was initially of a mind to dismantle the garden, until she was persuaded it would be a big hit with the public, thanks in part to the endless politicking and finagling of its first director, Sir Joseph Hooker. A perfect storm of influences made Kew a success – not least the fact that, while Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris and Berlin had glass-housed botanical gardens, London didn't, even though it was the hub of the British Empire, whose far-flung tropical colonies produced everything from rubber and ginger to pepper and the palm oil used to lubricate British railways. Plus – as Kate Teltscher, the author of Palace of Palms, an exceptionally readable history of Kew, explained to me recently – “particularly in the 1850s, there is the development of suburbs and middle classes who want nice villas with gardens.” The new middle class's longings were inflamed by a huge boom in gardening magazines, which in turn advertised Britain's nascent plant nurseries. Many of them swing by the Palm House. She had planned to dismantle it, until courtiers convinced her otherwise.Charles Robert Leslie, c. 1897/Library of Congress For instance, looking down, you suddenly understand that most bald men in England shave their heads. They have exotic, difficult names, such as Heliconia bihai x spathocircinata “Cinnamon Twist.” Voices float up as visitors below react to what they are seeing: “Banana,” someone will say, and then your mind reels through what the Palm House has taught you about bananas. They were unknown in Britain when the Palm House was built; today, Brits eat five billion bananas a year (about two a week, each), making them Britain's favourite “healthy snack.” Those, of course are Cavendish bananas, the only kind most of us eat; they have no seeds and can only be propagated from cuttings, which means they all have the same immune systems, which is why they are all vulnerable to the vein-throttling TR4 fungus, and why, last February, a new resistant strain, the QCAV-4, became the world's first genetically modified banana approved for cultivation. Specimens at Kew are not purely for show – studying them gives researchers new insights into plant biodiversity, flood mitigation and climate change. You look down upon Arabica coffee plants and gorgeous, thick barkless bamboos – actually a grass that Kew researchers are studying for its flood-prevention attributes – that grow 2.5 metres every 16 days in the Palm House and reach 25 metres in the wild. Oh, look, a tamarind tree: Its fruit is the basis of Worcestershire sauce. It's so hot and humid I am drenched after 35 minutes. In any event, the upper storey of Kew's Palm House is where you feel the fantasy of the place, as it transports you instantly, and physically, beyond your culture, beyond where you are and who you are, beyond commerce, even, into the strange botanical Other. The Palm House was a monument to British national pride. These days, it's an international call to climate-change action. “Because the scale of climate change and biodiversity loss cut across national boundaries,” Kate Teltscher will tell you, “botanic gardens these days tend to be about saving the world from itself, from mankind.” Up there, it is very easy to feel as if you are standing on the demarcation line between the two sides of the global debate over climate change and how seriously it threatens us. Half an hour later, you are just as eager to leave. Coyotes, bats and pigeons, oh my: Canadian cities are full of wildlife.

Tomoyuki Sugano, who pitched for Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles last season, returns to the national squad for the first time in two tournaments. In his debut year since departing from the Yomiuri Giants, where he was the ace pitcher, he delivered a solid performance, recording 10 wins. From the domestic leagues, Hanshin Tigers infielder Teruaki Sato earned his first selection to the national team. Sato was a driving force behind his team's Central League championship last season, clinching two league batting titles with 40 home runs and 102 RBIs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the latest episode of ‘Sanchez Effect', we take a deep dive into the real story behind the protests sweeping Iran with a guest who joins us from Tehran. Professor Marandi reveals that Israel is practically waving its national flag, admitting it orchestrated these protests, while Western media outlets conveniently look the other way. Rick points out that even Mike Pompeo acknowledged that Mossad agents were alongside demonstrators in Tehran – a delightful setup for a color revolution! But they've had no luck so far. That can only mean one thing – they were being coordinated from abroad. Rick can't help but wonder why Israel, usually tight-lipped about its operations, would admit to being involved in this one. Marandi argues that the language of politics is shifting – just look at Trump and his tactics with Venezuela and now Greenland. That's as Rutte continues his usual diatribe that China and Russia are responsible for all the world's woes. When Greenland looks to him for help, though, he can only offer a big “NO COMMENT.” But don't worry, unlike Daddy Trump's golden boy, we've got plenty of comments and insights lined up for you – right here on RT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president intends to keep the medal and calls gift from Maria Corina Machado a ‘wonderful gesture of mutual respect' Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader, gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump on Thursday as she attempted to woo the US president. Mr Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded the honour, which has been bestowed on several former presidents including Barack Obama. It follows claims Mr Trump did not back installing Ms Machado as the country's leader following Nicholas Maduro's capture because she was given the honour. A White House official confirmed that Mr Trump intends to keep the medal. In a Truth Social post on Thursday evening, Mr Trump wrote: “Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Days earlier the Nobel Institute had ruled against Ms Machado's previous suggestion of transferring last year's peace prize to Mr Trump. Last week, Mr Trump said he could not think of “anybody in history that should get the Nobel Peace Prize more than me”. He instead has shown support for acting president Delcy Rodríguez, Mr Maduro's former vice-president, who was sworn in on Jan 5. Critics argue that Ms Rodriguez is a continuation of Mr Maduro's repressive regime. But Mr Trump appears to be pleased with the current arrangement, having praised Ms Rodriguez as a “terrific” person following a call earlier this week. Ms Leavitt said Ms Rodriguez had been in “constant communication” with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and other officials. She said Mr Trump was “committed to hopefully seeing elections in Venezuela one day” but did not give an indication of a timeframe. On Thursday, US forces seized a sixth oil tanker in a pre-dawn raid, according to the US Southern Command. “The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,” US Southern Command said in a post on social media. The move could raise tensions with Russia, which has been moving to protect dark-fleet tankers in recent weeks.</p>

UNITED NATIONS, January 16. /TASS/. Russia demands that the United States and its allies refrain from reckless actions with regard to Tehran and focus on providing firm guarantees that there will be no further confrontation, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya told an Iran-themed meeting of the UN Security Council.

"We demand the US and its partners to refrain from a yet another series of reckless decisions and steps, including related to nuclear facilities. Instead, they should focus on providing firm guarantees that there will be no further confrontation, and resume the joint search for mutually acceptable solutions, including those aimed at eradicating prejudices regarding Iran's peaceful nuclear program, based on the international law and the balance of interests of all parties concerned," he said.

The envoy added that Russia was "ready to provide all possible support" to such an effort.</p>
