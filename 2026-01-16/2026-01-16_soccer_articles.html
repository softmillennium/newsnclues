                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benjamin Cremaschi has been recognized as U.S. Soccer's Young Male Player of the Year. On the club level, Cremaschi played 22 times for Inter Miami, having broken through as the club's biggest homegrown star. This summer, though, Cremaschi departed Florida for Italy, signing on loan with Parma. Cremaschi's win comes just one day after U.S. Soccer confirmed that Chris Richards had been recognized as the federation's Male Player of the Year. "This award means a lot to me," Cremaschi said. This is an amazing accomplishment, but it also speaks to all the people around me that keep me going as a player. I want to thank my family, teammates and everyone that made this award possible. That is a group of guys I will never forget. "I also want to thank Marko Mitrovic – a coach I've had at many different levels with the National Team – for his belief and guidance along the way. Finally, I'm so grateful to my family, for their support and love." Finishing second in that voting was Philadelphia Union starlet Cavan Sullivan, who collected 34.8 percent, while Borussia Dortmund rising star Mathis Albert came in third with 12.3 percent. Cremaschi has played sparingly for Parma this season as the American midfielder adjusts to life in Serie A. In total, he's made just four Serie A appearances, although he did start a cup game against Bologna in December. Parma, who sit 14th in Serie A, will face 15th-place Genoa on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2025, there was one women's soccer player that stood above all the rest for the United States, and she's a Cincinnati native. “I'm really happy for Rose, who is thriving. She's an extremely selfless person who has been through a lot of adversity,” said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes in a press release. “I think we all know that Rose is not only one of the best players in the world, but also one of the most fun to watch, and to coach, so it's very satisfying to see her recognized in this way." She was followed by Sam Coffey (23.9%) and Catarina Macario (22.3%). Last year was a busy one for Lavelle: She played for the Stars and Stripes in her hometown for the first time since 2022 and scored two goals during the October international window. "When I look at the past year, it feels like a testament to the support system I had, with my family, the medical staff at Gotham and with the National Team, all my teammates, coaches and friends,” said Lavelle in a press release. So, this award is definitely shared with all the people I was lucky enough to have in my corner along the way.” All of that happened in a shortened campaign, after recovering from ankle surgery. 2026 will be Rose's 10th year as part of the USWNT. She's appeared in 116 matches for the United States over that time, and has an Olympic gold medal and World Cup title to her name. The USWNT will play their first match of 2026 on Jan. 24, against Paraguay, in Carson, California.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Already midway through the first month of 2026, the soccer world is fully up and running for the World Cup year, with teams in Europe hitting midseason and MLS clubs kicking off preseasons this week. While  key U.S. men's national team players like Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic are enjoying strong seasons and aiming for new deals at their current clubs, others are still looking to earn their spot on this summer's World Cup squad under manager Mauricio Pochettino. George Campbell will have a familiar face around West Brom for the foreseeable future, as the former Atlanta United and CF Montréal center back prepares for his debut under new manager Eric Ramsay, who arrives from Minnesota United. The central defender has played consistently for West Brom this season under Ryan Mason, amassing 1,766 minutes across 22 matches and netting a goal and two assists. With Minnesota, that meant significant time without the ball and more reliance on the backline to spark quick transitions, a shift from what Campbell has traditionally thrived at. He'll take on fellow USMNT World Cup hopeful Aidan Morris. After struggling to play a significant number of minutes for Atalanta in 2025 after joining on loan from AC Milan, Yunus Musah's role has been elevated since the calendar flipped. The 23-year-old American has played in each of the last six matches, bringing him to 12 appearances and 379 minutes across Serie A action this season. While he has struggled at times over the last two years, he is finally starting to reap the rewards of making the shift away from one of Italy's biggest clubs and has been versatile in his usage, before a recent spell in his natural defensive midfield position. This week sees a massive opportunity for Musah, as seventh-place Atalanta takes on 19th-place Pisa, with one club eyeing potential European qualification spots and the other in the thick of a relegation battle. Brenden Aaronson is one of the most in-form attackers in Europe at the moment, with two goals and two assists in his last four Premier League appearances with Leeds United. Yet, given his form comes in a months-long spell without an international camp, it's difficult to know where he genuinely stands in Pochettino's pecking order. As such, it's critical he maintains form enough to earn a call into the March camp, which will give him an opportunity to showcase himself as a potential World Cup player and, depending on how he continues, a potential starter. This weekend sees Aaronson's Leeds United take on Fulham in Premier League action, pitting the in-form American attacker against USMNT fullback Antonee Robinson, who has returned to an elite-level after months dealing with significant injuries. After struggling for minutes and form with Southampton, he made a loan move to the Bundesliga's Hamburger S.V. Manager Merlin Polzin threw Downs right into the starting lineup in his debut, a 2–1 loss to SC Freiburg, giving the American a level of trust and confidence rarely seen by midseason loan-player arrivals. While he has not scored since April 2025, when he found the back of the net for Köln in a 3–1 win over Preussen Münster, he was noticeable on his debut, winning 11 duels and taking a single shot. This weekend, Downs will look to snap his goalscoring drought as Hamburger takes on American-heavy Borussia Mönchengladbach, featuring Gio Reyna and Joe Scally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are set for a huge benefit from Marc Guehi's transfer to Manchester City. The West London club are set to benefit financially from Guehi's impending move to City, having included a sell-on clause when the defender joined Crystal Palace in 2021. As part of the original deal that took Guehi from Stamford Bridge to Selhurst Park, Chelsea inserted a clause entitling them to 20% of any future transfer fee. That provision means Chelsea are due to receive around £4m once the transfer is finalised, more than four years after Guehi left the club. City identified the England international as a priority target and moved to secure him mid-season, keen to avoid competition should he have entered the final stages of his contract. Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has also indicated the deal is nearing completion, confirming Guehi will not feature in their next match. Speaking in a bombshell interview on Friday, Glasner said: "My latest understanding is the deal for Marc is in the final stages," Glasner said. But the result is Marc doesn't play tomorrow for us. Every player, depending on their contract situation, there is a price where the club say they want to do it. That was not the only bad news delivered by Glasner, though, as he announced his desire for a new challenge. He added: "A decision has already been taken, months ago. I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in October, the international break. But now it's important to have clarity, and we had a very busy schedule so that's why we didn't want to talk about it. Steve and I want the best for Crystal Palace." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Guehi came through Chelsea's academy but made only two senior appearances for the club. After a loan spell at Swansea City, he was sold to Palace, where he established himself as captain and one of the Premier League's most reliable defenders. The additional income is a boost for Chelsea, whose head coach Liam Rosenior recently signed a long-term contract running until 2032 following his appointment as Enzo Maresca's successor. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Guehi's move to City is set to be announced in the coming days to provide some much-needed relief for Guardiola heading into the second half of the campaign. The likes of John Stones, Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol are all currently missing for the club and not set to return anytime soon. With City paying half of what the Reds were willing to fork out, they will feel the deal is a bargain, despite Guehi being in the final year of his contract and being available as a free agent in the summer.</p>

For country, Lavelle made her 2025 debut for the national team on June 26, against the Republic of Ireland, after missing time due to an ankle injury. In her return back to the national team, she scored once and assisted another goal. She started five of her six USWNT appearances in 2025. For Gotham FC, Lavelle started 13 of 16 regular-season appearances, scoring five goals and providing two assists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The project is currently being filmed, with no firm release date set, according to Kuffner. “So that's kind of like the little elevator pitch.” “This city had been primed by decades of treating women's soccer seriously,” Kuffner said. Spectators converse at a women's soccer match during Megan Rapinoe's UP Athletics Hall of Fame induction night on September 28, 2024. Kuffner's idea for the film was born out of creative necessity. After leading another documentary following cancer patients through clinical trials for his day job at Providence Health, he started searching for his next story around the time of Rapinoe and Sinclair's retirements from their respective international teams. Kuffner thought back to his college days at UP, where he sat in classrooms with the legendary players, and found a concept he couldn't let go of. “I don't know if there was a single moment, but it was a sort of realization that these two incredible global icons were college teammates at this tiny school, and the buzz around the city was real,” Kuffner said. “So it was just like, ‘Oh my gosh. This is a worthy story that needs to be told. Kuffner is uniquely positioned to lead the project. He not only graduated from UP in 2005 but also grew up going to UP soccer games as a kid, hanging posters of legendary female Pilots on his bedroom wall, and eventually worked in the school's marketing department post-grad. “I was there at Merlo Field's first game when it opened,” Kuffner said. “I grew up with posters of Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan on my wall. So just having that deep connection, knowing all the people at the university, there's a lot of trust there.” Director Joe Kuffner behind the scenes of "Unmatched". Kuffner reached out to UP's athletics department with the film idea in early 2024, and the university has since helped connect him with sources and granted him access to records and photos, though Kuffner and his team maintain full editorial control. Jason Brough, senior associate athletic director, received Kuffner's call and was immediately on board with the idea. I don't think there's any place that had more of a community buy-in.” The documentary will include a wide-ranging cast to tell its story. So far, the “Unmatched” crew has completed 27 interviews. Along with team members and soccer personnel, they've spoken with folks like Andrew Guest, a UP professor who's researched women's soccer, and Jenny Nguyen, founder of women's sports-only sports bar, The Sports Bra, according to Kuffner. “I think each individual has their own experience, but they also have something collective that they shared,” Tate said. “Getting to hear how they describe each other and how they were each other's witness to this time and this greatness, that's a really cool thing to be able to tap into and ask someone about, like, ‘Tell me what it was like to be a part of this team, this magic. One of Kuffner's stand-out memories from filming was Rapinoe's interview in September of 2024, the first conversation the crew shot. Though the team's standard is around two hours, Kuffner only had 30 minutes to interview her, as Rapinoe was in town to be inducted into the UP Athletics Hall of Fame and had a packed schedule. Rapinoe's fiancée, legendary women's basketball player Sue Bird, joined President Robert Kelly, Vice President of Athletics Scott Leykam, and Portland Magazine Editor Jessica Murphy Moo in “crashing” the interview. Though “Unmatched” is a soccer film, Tate, who is not a big soccer fan herself, feels strongly that it can impact people from all walks of life. “This [team] is so important to this small group of people but so relatable, almost on a global level,” Tate said. “Anyone who hears the story will be like, ‘Oh yeah, we're gonna root for these underdogs. The crew's next step is fundraising for post-production, seeking donations, grants and investors to hasten the film's progress. They've already won an Impact Grant from Oregon Film and an Amplify Portland Grant from the Portland Events & Film Office, according to Kuffner. Megan Rapinoe interacts with fans during her UP Athletics Hall of Fame induction night. She also wants “Unmatched” to be a feel-good experience that feels like an “easy choice” for anyone. Kuffner hopes “Unmatched” reminds fans of their memories on Merlo Field and encourages more turnout for the Pilots, though the college sports landscape and the team's success has changed. “This is kind of a cheesy answer, but I genuinely hope that women's soccer fans in Portland watch this and remember how fun it was to come to games at UP [because] the business of college sports is so different now,” Kuffner said. “Maybe they're not top-five ranked or going to the Final Four every year. I really hope that people remember how fun it was and come back.” STAFF OPINION: How tidying can help you take back control</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has issued a statement about the upcoming World Cup as Donald Trump's travel ban continues to throw things into chaos. It was always likely to be an unforgettable summer of football as soon as the US were confirmed as joint hosts with Mexico and Canada, and last summer's Club World Cup only added fuel to that fire. Trump even famously crashed Chelsea's medal proceedings after they won the tournament. In a strong-worded post on X, she wrote: "I just met with the President. I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies. The travel ban comes into place just a few months before the tournament is set to begin, with fans of Iran, who boycotted the draw and Haiti, for whom this is a first ever World Cup, already told that they won't be able to attend. And after Trump added a hefty amount more of countries to his list, the fans of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Uruguay may just have had their plans thrown into doubt. Senegal and the Ivory Coast are under partial travel bans while the other eight countries on that list have had their immigrant visa processing suspended. As things stand, this doesn't apply to travel visas, meaning that they can currently still visit for the summer's tournament but they will no doubt have to be extremely stringent when flying over if they don't want to find themselves in serious trouble. FIFA has now issued a press release with an update on ticket sales, warning fans that a match ticket doesn't guarantee you entry to the country. "A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each country's government website today for entry requirements for Canada, Mexico and the United States," FIFA's press release states. Iranian fans will also be prohibited from visiting Canada, although that is currently the only World Cup nation on the countries travel ban list. Even with how chaotic the World Cup draw was, fans from these countries will no doubt be devastated about the possibility of not seeing their sides play on football's biggest stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The team's base camp will be in Alexandria, where players will stay at the AKA Hotel at 625 First Street in Old Town and train at Episcopal High School as they participate in the World Cup. Games will take place across Canada, Mexico and the United States from Jun. Team representatives selected Alexandria after analyzing more than 60 locations and touring eight “potential camps” in the northeastern U.S. and Canada, after which Head Coach Zlatko Dalić and staff “unanimously agreed that Alexandria was the best choice,” HNS announced in a press release yesterday (Thursday). “Alexandria offers us the best combination of an excellent training centre and a comfortable hotel, with immediate proximity to the airport and a good geographical position in relation to the cities where we will play our group-stage matches,” Technical Director Stipe Pletikosa said. “From a sporting perspective, which is always our top priority, we will have truly top-class conditions at Episcopal High School — from the pitches and fitness facilities to recovery areas — so there were very few doubts.” In a social media video this morning, Mayor Alyia Gaskins said the city is planning a lineup of “amazing events” with the arrival of HNS. Visit Alexandria, the city's official tourism organization, confirmed to ALXnow that it was involved in the team's decision and will release more details at a later date. Gaskins also celebrated, saying it was “a huge opportunity, and we're so excited to welcome such an amazing and talented team.” “Based on everything we heard and saw, Alexandria was the best option for us, and I am pleased that we managed to secure this location,” Dalić said. “Of course, the overall impression of a camp is ultimately shaped by results, so I hope Alexandria will remain in our memories just as fondly as ‘Forest Rhapsody' in Russia or the Hilton in Doha,” the coach added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The deadline for initial World Cup ticket applications passed on Tuesday, with many England fans having no idea what they'll end up paying, despite having to commit. The difference could end up thousands of dollars, but they now can't cancel. Some fans eligible for the limited $60 "category 4" tickets will still be sitting near relatives in the same section facing thousands of dollars of difference. A new system, that represents an inexplicable shift from all recent tournaments, has ensured some tickets have gone to five times the price of Qatar. The initial backlash forced Fifa into a minor climbdown, where 10 percent of tickets for all qualified teams - the Participating Member Associations (PMA) - were brought into a fixed $60 “category 4”. Discussion groups involving members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) feature comments like “obscene”, “blatant exploitation”, a “preying on loyalty and the feeling this is priceless” and ultimately: “Fifa can stick it. Supporter groups have nevertheless expressed cynicism at those figures, and the manner they escalated over the 33-day application period, despite Fifa stating that unique credit card data has been used for validation. Such claims don't mesh with experience on the ground. That tournament barely saw any major fan group travel outside Argentina, Mexico, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. That might end up a concern given that Fifa said on Tuesday the highest number of applications outside the hosts came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. It is certainly a concern as regards how this tournament will feel, look and sound, and whether there will be enough emotionally invested fans to create the atmosphere that really amplifies a World Cup. Fans who actually have confirmed orders laugh wryly at the Fifa sign-off - typically underneath figures reaching around $7,000, potentially breaching many credit limits before hotels and flights - that reads: “Thanks for being a true fan!” Such marketing speak was echoed by president Gianni Infantino in Tuesday's statement: “I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response. Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums.” Except, this gratitude is apparently expressed in prices that ensure only a certain tax band can actually afford to be welcomed inside the stadiums, in a system that doesn't seem to truly recognise this “meaning”. Fifa, officially a not-for-profit charity, seem to very much be leaning towards the latter. By Tuesday's deadline, fans requiring accessibility tickets had no idea if they were paying $60, or if their carer will be forced to pay thousands more. The extra cost was last week criticised by Level Playing Field for fostering further “exclusion”, as they also accused Fifa of a “delay and ignore” approach in so far neglecting to answer FSE questions. Those within Fifa privately stress that the US hosting has thrown up more legal complications than any previous World Cup, especially with how legislation prevents requests for proof of disability, leading to the current system. They argue that Fifa knew all of this years in advance, so could have come up with multiple different solutions or guardrails, and that there's nothing to prevent making a companion ticket free of charge or putting accessibility in the cheapest category. Again, multiple proactive solutions were possible, including protecting PMA tickets from transfer. There's instead a feeling that Fifa are just seeking to earn resale differences themselves rather than tackle the issue. Such fans pay £70 every two years to be a member of the ESTC and generally go to at least 11 away games over four years, in the hope such loyalty will be rewarded, only to be faced with what they feel is “exploitation”. That has fostered further frustration with the FA strategy, and questions like “what results can they actually point to?” Ultimately, the big nations have never even tried to properly challenge Infantino's Fifa as a bloc. Such responses also cut to the core of all this, Fifa's power structure, and how it was decided. When pressed, insiders ultimately resort to those same justifications: raising money for the game, and “demand”. That's despite Fifa's immense surpluses coming from the old pricing system, and the key point that they just do not have to concern themselves with demand. What's more, no previous World Cup has conformed to the host market. As one senior official said, “the sad part is that it's probably done”. In other words, the prices are set for this tournament. Just one of many further questions is what happens if it's a commercial success. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA have issued a statement on the status of the 2026 World Cup after Donald Trump placed indefinite visa processing suspensions on more nations. Trump has issued a series of updated travel bans to certain foreign nations across his second term in the White House beginning January 2025. Senegal and Ivory Coast, meanwhile, are under partial travel bans. On Wednesday, it was announced that the Trump administration would suspend immigrant visa processing for a total of 75 countries. They include eight World Cup nations - Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Uruguay. They state that fans from all 211 of its member nations submitted ticket requests between December 11 and January 13, during their Random Selection Draw ticket sales phase. The statement adds that fans placed 'an average of 15 million ticket requests per day over the 33-day application window', and that it has succeeded in 'setting a new benchmark for demand in the history of world football'. A paragraph towards the end of the statement, however, notes that possessing a match ticket does not necessarily guarantee entry to host nations United States, Canada or Mexico. Canada has a travel ban list featuring six nations, but this only relates to travel to that particular country. "A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each country's government website today for entry requirements for Canada, Mexico and the United States," FIFA's press release states. "FIFA World Cup 2026 ticket holders travelling to the United States are eligible for the recently announced FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS) when it becomes available in the coming weeks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA president Gianni Infantino and the World Cup trophy Roberto Schmidt / AFP / Getty Images “UNBELIEVABLE.” He was trumpeting a number, 500 million — up from 350 million last week and 150 million late last month — the number of requests that FIFA claims it received for 2026 World Cup tickets. They have given us a big, round number. But it's somewhat empty, or at least difficult to interpret, without more specific numbers — and namely, a breakdown of how those 500 million requests are distributed across the World Cup's 104 matches. Of course, there is “unprecedented” interest in the tournament as a whole, and especially in a few dozen high-profile matches. The question is whether there's immense interest in, say, Uruguay vs. Saudi Arabia — and, more importantly, whether FIFA's prices have dampened that interest. That there would be huge demand for 2026 World Cup games has long been obvious. With more teams and more games than ever before, in massive North American stadiums — most of them in the world's richest and most diverse country — the tournament was always going to smash records. Every announcement boasting “soaring global demand” — from the 5 million ticket requests in this application window's first 24 hours to the 500 million in total — has come amid an uproar over prices. The statement, implicitly, is that despite all the criticism, people are willing to pay these prices; that demand is overwhelming supply; and that, if anything, World Cup tickets are actually underpriced. In some cases, that statement is clearly valid. The “over 500 million” requests make it resounding. FIFA could, in fact, have charged much more for Portugal vs. Colombia or for any of Mexico's matches. It could have even charged more than its current $8,680, $5,575 and $4,185 price points for the World Cup final. But what about $500, $400 and $180 for Egypt vs. Iran? Are there millions of requests for those matches? The big, round number — “a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport,” FIFA said — suggests that stadiums will be full and demand is sufficient across the board. But it's also entirely possible that a vast majority of the 500 million requests are for, say, the 30 most attractive games, while others are undersubscribed. The Athletic has asked FIFA for match-by-match numbers; the global soccer governing body hasn't provided them. So, it's plausible that there are 50 million requests for Colombia-Portugal alone, because, well, if you can afford to invest $265 (the Category 3 price) in that game, why wouldn't you apply — knowing that, even if you can't attend, you could almost certainly resell your ticket for well over $1,000? And while you're at it, why wouldn't you apply for all 43 games whose get-in price (cheapest ticket) on the secondary market right now is over $600, per TicketData.com? America's unregulated resale market — and FIFA's choice to lean into it rather than restrict it — has undoubtedly inflated these overarching ticket request numbers. The more interesting numbers are the ones for games whose primary prices aren't dwarfed by secondary prices. What about that U.S. opener vs. Paraguay, for which a fan is currently reselling a Category 3 ticket for $1,259 before fees, not all that much higher than the $1,120 price FIFA set back in October (and never raised)? Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., will be full on June 27, as will MetLife Stadium for the final on July 19, as will any stadium that hosts Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and so on. What matters is whether Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., is full for its (underwhelming) group games; and whether the 30 least attractive matchups draw packed, passionate crowds; and whether FIFA has to lower ticket prices in a fourth sales phase this spring to attract them – thereby angering the fleeced fans who bought tickets early. One big, round number isn't a definitive final chapter in this ticketing saga. Henry Bushnell  is a senior writer for The Athletic covering soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA – U.S. Men's National Team defender Chris Richards has been voted the 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year after an outstanding year in which he started 11 of 12 matches for which he was available for the USMNT and all six matches leading to the 2025 Gold Cup Final, a tournament in which he recorded two goals and earned a spot on the Best XI. This shows how well we've done as a team and the momentum we are building towards the World Cup.” This is Richards' first U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year award and it comes in his first year being nominated. First recognized in 1984, a total of 28 players have won the award. I see Pat all the time on College GameDay. It was cool for him to announce this on his show and to give a shoutout,” Richards added. In a list of nominees that included defender Max Arfsten, defender Alex Freeman, goalkeeper Matt Freese and midfielder Malik Tillman, Richards won with 48.6 percent of the weighted total, followed by Tillman (21.7%) and Freeman (13%). In addition to fan voting, votes for U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year are collected from National Team coaches, USMNT players who earned a cap in 2025, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, professional league head coaches and sporting directors, select media members and former players and administrators. A combination of leadership and strong performances led to his inclusion in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Best XI. At the club level, Richards has established himself as a key fixture within the Crystal Palace defense. Throughout the 2024-25 season with The Eagles, he made 32 total appearances in all competitions, registering a goal and assist. Later that summer, Richards and Palace opened the 2025-26 season with a victory over Liverpool in penalty kicks in the 2025 Community Shield, with Richards once again going the distance.</p>
