                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the low-key teaser focusing on Chris Evans' Steve Rogers played exclusively in theaters in front of Avatar: Fire & Ash before debuting online five days later. Three more teasers followed weekly in theaters, with spots featuring Thor and The X-Men, as well as a fourth and final centering on Black Panther‘s Shuri and M'Baku meet Ben Grimm from Fantastic Four. Black Panther Teams With the Fantastic Four in Latest 'Avengers: Doomsday' Teaser The individual numbers for each teaser was not revealed, but it's a massive sum, considering these were strictly organic online views with no tie-ins to a broadcast event. Pirated versions of the teasers appeared online early, and Marvel was well aware that once something is in a theater, it's impossible to stop someone from recording it with a smartphone. According to insiders, the social volume was for each teaser was on average 188 percent greater than for a typical Marvel drop, and the combined four teasers now top the highest views for Marvel trailer launches on Instagram (505 million) and TikTok (103 million) views. They also spawned 16 owned organic trends on X, including “Doomsday” “Steve Rogers” “Thor” “X-Men” “Wakanda.” But consider this: years ago, Deadpool & Wolverine launched to a record-setting 365 million views in 24 hours, making it the top trailer of all time during that period. Doomsday, which bows Dec. 18, and 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars mark the return of Marvel stalwarts Joe and Anthony Russo as directors, with the duo producing via their AGBO banner. Marvel is said to be particularly proud that the four teasers were so successful without showing Downey, proving that there remains a great and passionate interest in the characters, and their originating actors. Marvel is continuing the tradition, launching a live-streamed countdown clock to Doomsday. “Each one of those trailers is narrative information,” Joe Russo recently cryptically said on the Empire podcast. And so, I would argue that Doomsday has already started for you.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warner Bros. put some big tentpoles on the release calendar starting with the highly anticipated J.J. Abrams sci-fi movie The Great Beyond starring Glen Powell and Jenna Ortega which is going Nov. 13 this year in Imax. The pic joins Paramount's Johnny Depp starring, Ti West directed title Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol on that date. Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Merritt Wever and Samuel L. Jackson also star in The Great Beyond.

Warners will have Imax screens on that date with the pic going up against Universal's CoComelon Movie next year. Miller and Reeves' project is reportedly set in the Caribbean Sea, with the protag being a smuggler slumming on a job as he contends with dead bodies, pirates and sharks, all within a time loop. The movie as of now will face off on Aug. 13, 2027 against a Universal Blumhouse title. Very little is known about The Conjuring: First Communion which comes from director Rodrigue Huart, from a script by Richard Naing & Ian Goldberg. It's not certain if Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's The Warrens are coming back. Warners always had this September date in 2027 on hold previously.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland will soon expand its timeline to a slightly longer time ago, Disney has announced. “Star Wars characters appear in Star Wars theme park” might not sound like news, but this is actually a significant change for Galaxy's Edge. The land has been strict about its time period since it opened in May 2019. It's set between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, and Disney avoided elements that might undermine guests' immersion in that particular period. (This is a land that launched with even retail and food service employees instructed to stay in character, with food items exclusively referred to with made-up Star Wars words like “Endorian tip-yip”; both have been rolled back, but Disney was taking the theme very seriously at first.) Regular appearances from Rey, a masked Kylo Ren, and First Order officers and Stormtroopers have been a standard feature since day one, sequel trilogy actors appear in both video and audio-animatronic form in its signature ride Rise of the Resistance, and the lead characters from earlier movies have remained out of sight. OG-only fans could meet up with Chewbacca and check-out a life-sized R2-D2 sold in the Droid Depot, both of whom are alive and… well, present in Force Awakens. Han Solo and Darth Vader were nowhere to be seen (although Luke did make some appearances at the park in 2025). The Mandalorian and Grogu were later added as walkaround characters in 2022, but their timeline is fuzzy enough where it's entirely possible they could've bummed around Battuu (the planet Galaxy's Edge is set on) when the First Order was there. Anybody who was really into the LARPing aspect of Galaxy's Edge might be comforted to hear that Disney will still try to maintain some thematic separation between the original and sequel characters. First Order Cargo, a store that sold First Order merchandise (for all the aspiring space fascists on your holiday list), will change its name to Black Spire Surplus alongside the timeline shift, with a newer, broader range of items on sale. Other stores will also see a merch refresh to reflect the altered timeline. It's the biggest change to Galaxy's Edge since it opened, and should breathe some new life into the land several years into its run.

The 34-year-old model shared a scantily clad video on Instagram Friday morning, wearing nothing but a sheer red lingerie set. The three-piece look was from Lounge's Laced with Love Valentine's Collection, which is rife with red and black embroidered pieces sure to send temperatures soaring. Ratajkowski models the Valentina set ($125) which includes a bra, matching thong and garter belt. Ratajkowski plays with her hair and adjusts the band of her G-string while in the impressive pose. Fans, of course, went wild in the comment section. “Lord have mercy 🔥🥵🔥 i can't put it into words. Another wrote, “Absolutely out of this world 🔥🔥🔥.” The “Gone Girl” actress previously starred in a campaign for the same brand this past fall, modeling a hot pink and floral garter set as well as a brown bra and panty combo. And the model is well-known for slipping into her undies; Last year, she was the face of Italian brand Intimissimi's Valentine's Day campaign, getting vampy in a bright red set.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Justin Long has quietly become one of indie horror's most reliable trust indicators. That's an ironic testament to Prows' clear creative vision and strong narrative control. It's also proof the director was mostly successful in steering his film‘s sprawling ensemble cast through a hazy, imperfect vampire saga — about corrupt, blood-sucking police targeting vulnerable citizens in Southern California. Related Stories '28 Years Later: The Bone Temple' and Sundance Give Us Something to Talk About That Isn't Awards Season A Year After David Lynch's Death, the Band Xiu Xiu Is Keeping ‘Eraserhead' Alive Onstage Grounded in a gritty and ethereal Los Angeles that, true to life, puts “vibes” first, “Night Patrol” is a gangland dramedy that casually bounces between caustic one-liners and gun shots. Co-written by Prows, Shaye Ogbonna, Tim Cairo, and Jake Gibson, the film packs a shaggy script about power and brutality that combines beats of a satirical creature feature with the drama of a street war erupting between Bloods and Crips. When LAPD officer Ethan Hawkins (Long) gets promoted to the elite “night squad,” he and his ex-partner, Xavier Carr (Jermaine Fowler), find something even more hellish within the task force. More mystically minded than you might guess, gang members Bornelius (rapper Freddie Gibbs), Three Deuce (filmmaker Flying Lotus), and Tripp (hip-hop artist YG) buy into the fantasy and meet the genre shift with expletive-laced humor that doesn't relieve tension but increases it. evil police are presented as broadly horrific and outwardly racist. Pro-wrestler CM Punk appears as a deputy who can't figure out even one of his scenes — while co-stars Fowler and Long get the smartest jokes of the movie. There's enough blood-and-guts fun to be had thanks to the vampire setup, but Prows and his cast shine brightest when they're toying with savage melodrama. He witnesses the state murder his situationship, mere minutes before learning not only that magic is real but that it also runs in the family. Romantic, spiritual, or criminal, the textured relationships of “Night Patrol” make for enough rich connective tissue between characters across this unreal L.A. to make Prows' universe feels almost capable of supporting a TV show. Pacing proves an impossible obstacle for “Night Patrol,” with its routine lulls suggesting the theatrical release could eventually do better as “second screen” programming enjoyed at home. Astonishingly slow at times, Prows' heavy-handed style — complete with three, semi-gothic title cards it really didn't need — builds to a sense of boredom that blankets even the most essential and emotional scenes. It's a low-budget affair that feels less like wading around in a cinematic mood and more like languishing in underwhelming production values as the monotony of the last 45 minutes grinds on. But Prows takes big, decisive swings when the plot does manage to pick up, and ultimately, the audience is rewarded with a tonally chunky experience that isn't for everyone but impresses as both otherworldly and authentic. Caught somewhere between “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “The Wire,” this dark genre hybrid has a lot of flaws, but none of them are fatal. From RLJE Films and Shudder, “Night Patrol” is in theaters on Friday, January 16.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrity makeup artist Emily Cheng recently glammed up Gracie Abrams using Hourglass Illusion Luminous Glow Foundation, but you needn't be a star to get the same glow. It's not every day you find a foundation that caters to undertones ranging from cool (winter) to warm peach (summer), and I'm hooked for life on this game changer of a formula. I wore a full Hourglass foundation beat to the office, and have have never received so many compliments at work. All that positive feedback completely changed how I think about my daily makeup routine. After starting the day at 6:30 a.m. and leaving the office around 8:30 p.m., my makeup still looked and felt intact (apart from my lipstick) — perfect for my after-work social plans. The difference in coverage was immediate and noticeable, highlighting just how much application method can impact the performance of a foundation. Throughout my month of testing, I found the formula applied more evenly with the Hourglass-branded tool, and even cut my application time in half. Designed to mimic the delicate and precise control of the fingertips, the cruelty-free brush features a unique vegan fiber technology and custom bristles for effortless blending and intuitive, even application. On the cusp of 34, I've learned that fine lines don't want to be covered — they want to be negotiated with. After a 14-hour wear test, the Hourglass foundation was still delivering luscious hydration and coverage that smoothed out texture without settling into my lines. The formula is extremely smooth and glides on like a gloss — and since it's so hydrating, you don't need to moisturize beforehand. Given Hourglass' commitment to clean makeup, it came as no surprise that the foundation covered my rosacea with zero irritation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's why Interplay paid Ron Perlman “$40 bucks and a sandwich” to intone those legendary words at the top of every game: “War never changes.” We blow things up, we build something new, and, whoops, wouldn't you know it, we're in constant danger of blowing it up all over again. To be fair, I think about New Vegas a lot in any case; it's my favorite game in one of my favorite game series ever, so I can start mentally running back through its highlights without much in the way of provocation. (You can read my thoughts on one of its best bits, the incredibly dark playable short story Vault 11, right here.) Club's episodic reviewer for Prime Video's generally pretty enjoyable Fallout TV show—currently in the midst of a second season that tromps straight through the 2010 classic's old stomping grounds—it's been more on my mind lately than ever. Some context, for the context-hungry: New Vegas was released two years after Bethesda Softworks launched its grand project to save Fallout in the mid-2000s, reviving the moribund franchise, to massive success, with 2008's Fallout 3. That's a game I respect, more than like, if I'm being brutally honest: Fallout 3 did incredible work in dragging the series back from the dead (and straight into people's living rooms), but it also lacked much of the humor, thoughtfulness, and expressiveness that I associated with the Fallout brand. But I rarely felt I could change the game's world in the same ways that Fallout 2 had taught me I could, allowing me to decide, say, the fate of criminal cesspool New Reno, or the complex, condescending politics of newly founded “utopia” Vault City. New Vegas, though, was a sop to cranky-old-bastard-before-their-time 26-year-olds exactly like me: Developed, with Bethesda's blessing, by Obsidian Entertainment (staffed with many of the creators of the original games) and set in the Mojave Desert—i.e., close enough to California for there to be bleed-over from those earlier stories—it was a big, incredibly buggy love letter to old-school Fallout. And because both those players, and those developers, had gotten all of their “explore the devastated, civilization-deprived wastes” needs out of their systems with those previous games, it was also a game that was way more interested in people, and the societies they build, then Fallout often gets credit for. It's a game filled with weird little cargo cults, like the Kings—a gang who discovered a Vegas school for Elvis impersonators, decided “The King” must be a figure of great and terrible power, and patterned their whole look and mannerisms after his persona—or The Boomers, former Air Force survivors who've developed a quasi-religious fixation on their decaying weapons of war. Each of these groups is extending their fingers out into an essentially lawless frontier, with the player tasked with deciding which of them, if any, will ultimately take control. If there's a thing that the Fallout show—which has just gotten done, in its most recent episode, with walking viewers through a loving, gorgeous recreation of the game's Strip area, and the surrounding town of Freeside—doesn't really grasp about Fallout in general, and New Vegas specifically, it's that this whole setup is ultimately far more Deadwood than Mad Max. I try not to bemoan this too much in my TV reviews, because the show is its own thing (no matter how many times Bethesda talks about how incredibly canon it all is). That's especially apparent in the show's treatment of the NCR, which is depicted in the series as a last gasp of civilized humanity, destroyed in a fit of cruel pique by a jumped-up middle manager with major divorced dad energy. Growing up from a small settlement in Fallout 1, by the time of New Vegas it's become messy in all the ways democratic societies do: Rife with division, inefficient at the edges, and held together by a core of people who passionately believe in the goodness of its ideals. And the player can take all these critiques in, and, if they so choose, agree with them—or just as easily decide that they'll take well-meaning inefficiency over something more cruelly effective any day of the week. It's the kind of commentary and satire you can only engage in, as a player, because New Vegas is interested in operating at scale, in showing conflicts not just between characters, but between the civilizations they represent. It's a story about societies colliding, which, turns out, you can only do if you don't depict each and every one of them as being nuked back to the Stone Age. Really, it's all there in the name: Fallout has always been a series that cares about what comes after, rather than simply exulting in the power of destruction. And while I absolutely, 100 percent get why the TV series doesn't truck with much of this stuff—getting people to tune into a video game adaptation is still hard enough, without dropping a big-ass lore bible on their heads—it's also a big part what makes these games, and especially New Vegas, special to me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every week, Pitchfork offers a run-down of significant new releases available on streaming services. This week's batch includes new albums from Julianna Barwick & Mary Lattimore. (All releases featured here are independently selected by our editors. Last year, curators at the French museum Musée de la Musique invited Julianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore to use some of their historically significant artifacts to record an album. Although they spent nine days testing out pieces and taping compositions, the duo whittled down their recordings into an album's worth of material. Musically, Tragic Magic is almost exactly what you might expect: songs with ethereal vocal harmonies and gentle harp plucks, complete with titles like “Perpetual Adoration” and “Melted Moon.” Between the launch of his surprisingly viable acting career and the birth of three children, A$AP Rocky has found plenty of time since 2018's Testing to pretend his follow-up, Don't Be Dumb, was just around the corner. Doppelgänger, their first new album in nearly seven years, wastes no time explaining just how happy they are to be back with the jubilant opener “End of the World.” From there, though, Peaer find themselves caught in bristly knots like “Button” and “Bad News,” suggesting they returned to a thornier world that needs some untangling after all. In the midst of a tour with his Surf Gang cadre, evilgiane has surprise-released this follow-up to his 2022 instrumental LP Giane. 1 a perfect introduction to the influential art-rockers' dark allure. About half of the tracklist checks out—takes on direct antecedents like Throbbing Gristle, This Heat, and Coil—leaving a half-dozen curveballs, from a dubbed-out take on Talking Heads' “Psycho Killer” to an industrial revamp of GloRilla's “Lick or Sum” and a disarmingly gorgeous interpretation of Daniel Johnston's “Some Things Last a Long Time.” Sleaford Mods foretold The Demise of Planet X with an increasingly surprising string of collaborations with British darlings, from Life Without Buildings' Sue Tompkins (on the joyous single “No Touch”) to Andrea Arnold (director of Fish Tank and, now, the “No Touch” video) to Game of Thrones and Star Wars star Gwendolyn Christie, who blazes through an unlikely rap verse on “The Good Life.” That collaborative spirit extends to the commonwealth on “Elitist G.O.A.T.”—which features New Zealander Aldous Harding—but not to the likes of compatriots Rishi Sunak or the old English fascist Henry Williamson, who get a lyrical kicking in Jason Williamson's latest batch of reliably caustic bars. Once a hired hand for the likes of Jimmy Eat World and Damien Jurado, Courtney Marie Andrews has beaten down a country-folk path of her own in the past decade. The poet and singer-songwriter recorded Valentine, her follow-up to 2022's Loose Future, in Los Angeles, with Jerry Bernhardt co-producing and Grizzly Bear's Chris Bear on drums. “I was in one of the darkest periods of my life, and songs were the only way I could reckon with it.” Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly noted the A$AP Rocky and Jessica Pratt song “Hijack” appeared on the rapper's new album.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark star Melissa Gilbert is receiving love from a friend and fellow former child star as she faces one of the most difficult times in her life. The loving message was shared days after Gilbert's husband, actor and producer Timothy Busfield, turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police Department following a warrant for his arrest. Busfield is facing charges of sexual abuse involving a minor when he was a director for the Fox TV series “The Cleaning Lady,” according to court documents obtained by local news station KOAT. The actor has denied the allegations against him and vowed to fight to clear his name, he said in a video message posted by TMZ. Scarpelli, 59, is best known for his role as Alex Handris on the CBS sitcom “One Day at a Time,” from 1980 to 1983. He captioned the post with a simple show of support for Gilbert. Fans reacted in the comments section to note that Scarpelli has a kind heart. “Melissa has always been one of my favorite child actresses and I that you and she are still close friends, Glenn,” one fan wrote. “Well said, such a tough time for her❤️,” another fan agreed. Gilbert, 61, has not directly spoken about the allegations against her husband of 12 years. She deactivated her Instagram account, and her rep, Ame Van Iden, told People magazine that Gilbert is “not making public statements at this time” as she honors the request of her husband's lawyers. “During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment,” Van Iden added. Bob noted that it had been a “tough week,” and said she was happy to have old episodes of “Little House” as a “safe space. It is unclear when the podcast episode was taped.

The artist teased the new clip with an Instagram reel, explaining she wrote the tune, on which she sings, “I can see the light of a clear blue morning” and “everything's gonna be all right,” in 1976 when she “needed a little hope.” At the time, she was coming to terms with separating from her musical and business partner, Porter Wagoner. “This time around, I've invited some very special women, some real ‘shining lights' to help me bring that hope to life again.” “As I celebrate my 80th birthday, this new version is my way of using what I've been blessed with to shine a little light forward, especially by sharing it with some truly incredible women,” Parton echoed in another statement when the song came out.

She re-recorded the song as a more upbeat, modern-sounding pop song for the Straight Talk movie soundtrack in 1992, and again in 2003 as a lush piano ballad for her post-9/11 patriotic album, For God and Country. “Tomorrow is Mother's Day, and this is for all the moms out there,” Cyrus said before the performance, which was a cold open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After HGTV star Leslie Davis dropped the bombshell on January 14, 2026, that she was engaged to a man she met while filming “Rock the Block,” fans have been eager for more details. Davis and her twin sister, Lyndsay Lamb, won season five of HGTV's popular competition series, but it turns out Davis also won the heart of carpenter Don Reidy — a shock to “Unsellable Houses” fans who thought she was still married to her first husband, Jacob, with whom she shares three sons — Kyler, Cash, and Cole. Reidy had worked on multiple HGTV shows before being called to Treasure Island, Florida in late 2023. That's where four teams of HGTV duos were competing on the fifth season of “Rock the Block,” tasked with completely renovating identical, luxury waterfront condos in six short weeks. On January 15, Davis told People that Reidy was assigned to her and Lamb as their “specialty carpenter,” explaining, “He worked on mine and Lyndsay's home exclusively for the entire project, helping us make all of our custom woodwork items.” But the entrepreneur, who co-owns a real estate and renovation company in Washington state with her sister — Lamb & Co. — told People that falling in love was “completely unexpected,” insisting she had “zero clue it would happen.” Reidy's Facebook profile shows that he left Colorado in August 2024, telling friends, “God has given me so many big opportunities and I am jumping in … Life here has been amazing but I am ready for my next adventure.” Her rep told People a wedding date has not been set. They came right over to me and we had a nice chat. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

A shouty and self-serious action thriller about a team of ambiguously corrupt Miami cops who threaten to turn on each other after they discover a fortune of very stealable cartel money hidden in an unassuming safe house, Joe Carnahan's “The Rip” would be easy to dismiss as run-of-the-mill streaming fare if not for the casting wrinkle that juices up its drama at every juncture. To put it simply: Ben Affleck plays one cop. They love each other, albeit only in a pathologically straight let's bark hyper-steroidal sub-“Heat” jargon at each other while swallowing our feelings sort of way. Tense as the situation is on its own, the whole thing is kicked up a notch by the sick meta spectacle of watching Hollywood's bestest friends begin to sour into mortal enemies. It just hits different when Ben and Matt are trying to bring each other down, and “The Rip” takes full advantage of the palpable history between them from its first proper scene all the way through the last and most ridiculous of its (way too many) different endings. Related Stories ‘Night Patrol' Review: Police Brutality Meets ‘Buffy' in Ryan Prows' Dreamy Gangland Vampire Saga '28 Years Later: The Bone Temple' and Sundance Give Us Something to Talk About That Isn't Awards Season The suspicions kick off with a murder-mystery that will hover over the rest of Carnahan's script, as the captain of a Tactical Narcotics Team is gunned down by two masked shooters for reasons unknown. Quoth Detective Numa Baptiste (Teyana Taylor in a small, functional role that she unsurprisingly imbues with life): “She was my friend. She was also Detective Sergeant JD Byrne's fuck buddy, so he's extra steamed about the murder as well, and hellbent on figuring out whether his captain was killed by one of their own (Affleck is great at playing aggro with a conscience, and, as we learn in the most gratuitous one-shot male shirtless scene this side of “Ant-Man,” also shredded to the bone). It's the only thing JD cares still about, and we believe him when he says that Damon's increasingly disaffected Lieutenant Dane Dumars deserved the recent promotion that both men were vying for. Dane has a dead son, he needs something to live for, and JD is the kind of guy who cares about balancing the scales of justice to whatever degree he can. So when Dane's team discovers that the six-figure Hialeah rip is actually worth closer to $20 million, the situation turns into something of a purity test, as each member of the TNT has to suss out how far across the line their partners are willing to go (Steven Yeun and Catalina Sandino Moreno capably round out the overqualified team, the latter armed with a money-sniffing dog named Wilbur). The intergroup suspicions are plenty tense enough, but Carnahan packs this powder keg even tighter by placing Dane's team under a ticking clock; after some other interested parties catch wind of the fortune, it's only a matter of time before our characters find themselves under siege. Imagine a crazy aggro cross between the claustrophobic back-stabbing of a classic French heist movie and the walls are caving in implosiveness of “Assault on Precinct 13” and you'll have a decent idea of how “The Rip” unfolds, which it does in sufficiently entertaining fashion. It's also worth nothing that the movie was produced by Affleck and Damon's Artists Equity, and promises all 1,200 members of the cast and crew a one-time bonus if it manages to surpass certain viewership benchmarks; not only does that share the wealth mentality dovetail with the story at hand, but, for viewers aware of the arrangement, it also helps to chip away at the inherent disposability of straight-to-streaming content. Is “The Rip” a better film because its third AD might actually be able to afford their rent next month? Not necessarily, but knowing that its performance matters to more than Netflix's shareholders does restore an ounce of material weight to a project that might otherwise have felt like vaporware. I can only speak as someone who's associated these actors with each other for more than 30 years, but it's raw to see JD and Dane start to second-guess each other — it engenders a state of disbelief that echoes the uncertainty felt by the rest of their team. “Fuck, it'd be so much easier if we just stole this money,” Dane half-jokes at one point early on. Easier to steal from a stranger's house maybe, but there's nothing easy about taking something that valuable away from your friends. “The Rip” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, January 16.
