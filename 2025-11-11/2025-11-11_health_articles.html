                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Risk prediction tools might help identify patients at the highest risk of overdose and death after a "before medically advised" (BMA) hospital discharge according to new research in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250492. Patients who leave hospital against the advice of a physician are about twice as likely to die and about 10 times more likely to experience an illicit drug overdose in the first 30 days after leaving hospital. Calculating a specific patient's risk of death and drug overdose - combined with clinical judgment and other risk scores - might help clinicians and patients have a constructive, patient-centred discussion about the decision to initiate a BMA discharge, including assessing the patient's capacity to make such a decision and discussing ways to mitigate risks after BMA discharge. By reducing uncertainty, risk estimates might also reduce clinician moral distress when faced with a BMA discharge." Researchers developed 2 risk prediction models: one to estimate the risk of death from any cause during the 30-day period after a BMA discharge, and another for patients with a history of substance use to estimate the risk of illicit drug overdose in patients with a history of substance use. In cohort A, researchers found that death was less common than generally expected, with 1 death within 30 days for every 63 BMA discharges. In cohort B, homelessness, income assistance, opioid use disorder, non-alcohol substance use disorder, drug overdose within the past year, and discharge from a surgical service were strong predictors of drug overdose after BMA discharge. "Among patients with a history of substance use, illicit drug overdose was a relatively common outcome soon after BMA discharge (i.e., around 1 illicit drug overdose within 30 days for every 19 BMA discharges), suggesting this period is a critical but largely unexplored opportunity for overdose prevention," write the authors. They suggest that hospitals and health systems could use risk prediction models to automate the approach to higher-risk BMA discharges, with alerts and automatic enrolment in support programs. "These models offer a starting point for identifying patients who are high risk and may benefit from greater support."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases among children, affecting nearly 475 million globally. For decades, exercise was discouraged due to the risk of triggering wheezing and breathlessness, known as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). This avoidance has led to lower fitness levels, obesity, and poorer mental health outcomes. Yet, modern studies reveal that structured exercise improves pulmonary capacity, reduces inflammation, and boosts overall quality of life when symptoms are well controlled. Despite these findings, many parents and clinicians remain hesitant to recommend exercise. Based on these challenges, there is a need to develop evidence-based guidance on safe and effective exercise programs for children with asthma. New evidence-based exercise recommendations for children with asthma (DOI: 10.1007/s12519-025-00976-6) have been developed by a multidisciplinary panel of 17 experts led by the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and published in the World Journal of Pediatrics in October 2025. The multidisciplinary team conducted an extensive literature review across eight major databases, identifying 64 studies that met inclusion criteria. Using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) framework and Delphi expert voting, the team developed recommendations across nine domains, including exercise safety, prescription design, environmental considerations, and monitoring. Key findings indicate that moderate aerobic exercise 3-5 times per week—such as walking, cycling, or swimming—can safely enhance cardiopulmonary function and reduce asthma symptoms. The guidelines emphasize individualized plans based on asthma control level, fitness status, and environmental quality (optimal temperature 20-24 °C; humidity above 40%). The authors highlight that well-controlled asthma should not limit children's physical activity; rather, exercise is a crucial component of rehabilitation and prevention. With proper control and individualized plans, most children can safely engage in physical activity that strengthens their bodies and minds. Our recommendations provide clinicians and families with the scientific framework to transform exercise into an integral part of asthma care—promoting not only lung health but also confidence, social participation, and psychological resilience." These recommendations mark a shift from restriction to empowerment in pediatric asthma care. By integrating exercise into routine management, healthcare providers can reduce medication reliance, prevent obesity, and enhance children's long-term physical and mental health. The study also encourages the use of smart health devices and digital monitoring tools to track symptoms and activity, making precision exercise prescriptions feasible in daily life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Published in Nature Neuroscience, this research challenges longstanding boundaries between neurology and psychiatry and points to the need for more integrated approaches to brain disorders. We found that psychiatric and neurological disorders share genetic risk factors to a greater extent than previously recognized. This suggests that they may partly arise from the same underlying biology, contrasting the traditional view that they are separate disease entities. Importantly, the genetic risk was closely linked to brain biology." The team analyzed genetic data from close to one million individuals with a wide range of psychiatric or neurological conditions. This large dataset made it possible to map both shared and disorder-specific genetic signals. "The findings are consistent with what we see clinically: patients often present with overlapping symptoms across neurology and psychiatry", says Professor Ole Andreassen, leader of the Centre for Precision Psychiatry. "Our results support a more unified view of neurological and psychiatric disorders". According to Smeland, the study suggests that patients could benefit from treatment strategies that take both biological and mental aspects into account. "We should ask whether patients receive the best care when neurology and psychiatry operate in parallel rather than together", he says "For instance, genetic susceptibility to stroke was associated with risk factors for thrombosis, while epilepsy was connected to neurons - the brain's nerve cells. The genetic risk for psychiatric illnesses was consistently linked to neurons. "This tells us that neurological and psychiatric disorders are heterogeneous, but may still be connected within a common biological framework," Smeland explains. While distinctions between neurological and psychiatric disorders do exist, this study paves the way for a more holistic understanding of brain disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Laboratory technicians continue to face many challenges when it comes to labelling, marking, and tracking vials, especially in fast-paced research, clinical, or industrial settings. This article examines the key issues that impact accuracy, workflow efficiency, and data integrity - the hidden bottleneck in many laboratories. A large number of laboratories still use handwritten, faded, or half-peeling labels on their vials. Even with all the technological progress, vial labelling remains one of the most overlooked and frustrating challenges in today's laboratories. Here are a few common issues still seen far too often. Manually writing or printing small labels for hundreds of vials is tedious, slow, and prone to mistakes. Barcodes that are too tiny or curved to scan correctly. Vials that vanish between preparation and analysis – or mysteriously reappear weeks later. Many labs still rely on spreadsheets as their “tracking system.” There is rarely a simple way to identify where a sample is, who last handled it, or what its status might be. Repetitive labelling work leads to fatigue and errors. New team members must learn yet another “custom” set of abbreviations and naming rules. The truth is that vial labelling has not evolved alongside laboratory automation. It continues to be treated as a small detail, yet it silently drains productivity and undermines both data quality and compliance. Forward-thinking laboratories are now reimagining vial identification – moving away from disposable labels and fragile adhesives toward direct, permanent marking. Only clear, durable, and accurate identification that lasts through freezing, washing, or sterilization. It is faster, more reliable, and eliminates human error (and the endless rolls of labels) from the workflow. Produced from materials originally authored by Katie Simpson at Labman Automation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A nanoparticle vaccine designed to fight cancers induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) eradicated tumors in an animal model of late-stage metastatic disease, UT Southwestern Medical Center scientists report in a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The findings could ultimately lead to a new type of vaccine that would be used to treat a variety of cancers. Our study provides a safe and effective way to treat cancers that have spread or cannot be surgically removed. Creating a nanovaccine for systemic use for metastatic cancers is not easy due to potential toxicity, but we have overcome those challenges with this new therapy." Jinming Gao, Ph.D., Professor in the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center and of Biomedical Engineering, Cell Biology, Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery, and Pharmacology at UT Southwestern More recently, they have developed a growing number of therapeutic vaccines, which harness the immune system to manage or treat preexisting diseases, such as cancer. HPV causes about 37,800 new cancer cases in the U.S. each year, a number that continues to grow. Although there is an effective vaccine to prevent HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, no therapeutic vaccines exist to treat HPV-related cancers. Such a vaccine would be used to treat patients with HPV-related cancers, such as cervical and head and neck cancers, that have spread or are in locations that are inaccessible to surgical interventions or where radiation therapy is not feasible, Dr. Gao explained. Few effective treatments currently exist for these disease subsets. When the researchers examined mice that received the nanovaccine, they found it was taken up by the spleen, an organ that harbors immune cells for surveillance of foreign particles such as viruses. Nanoparticles that entered immune cells unraveled into their components, with the polymer and drug stimulating STING activity and the viral protein priming the immune system to fight against cells that carried it. Tests showed that the nanovaccine eradicated both primary HPV-related tumors and metastatic cancer nodules that spread to other organs. In a mouse model of metastatic HPV-related lung cancer, 71% of animals that received the nanovaccine were still alive 60 days after treatment, while those that received immune checkpoint inhibitors – drugs that are considered the current gold standard for treating metastatic HPV-related cancers – died of their disease during this time. The nanovaccine appeared safe, causing no organ damage, weight loss, or immune activity beyond that aimed at the cancers. Dr. Gao said these results showcase the promise of this approach for treating HPV-related cancers and could be adapted to other cancer types by customizing the cancer-related protein targeted by the vaccine. He and his colleagues are continuing to test this approach in animal models with a plan to eventually conduct clinical trials in patients.

Dodson, MD, MPH, principal investigator and lead author of the study. BETTER-BP included 400 adults from three community health clinics in New York City. These clinics primarily serve patients with Medicaid and those without health insurance—groups that often struggle with uncontrolled blood pressure and have difficulty following prescribed treatments. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, and it can often be controlled through consistent medication use. About two-thirds were entered into a program in which they could win cash rewards for taking their blood pressure medication, and the remaining third were in a control group that didn't get this incentive. Before the study began, everyone reported that they were not consistently taking their medication as prescribed. To track how often participants took their pills, Dr. Dodson and the research team used electronic pill bottles that recorded each time the bottles were opened, rather than relying on participants to self-report. For reference, the American Heart Association's 2025 guideline says a normal systolic blood pressure is below 120 mm Hg. Participants in the rewards group were entered in a daily drawing for cash prizes from $5 to $50, but only if they opened their pill bottle the day before, showing that they took their blood pressure medication. Those in the control group didn't receive text messages or have a chance to win money. The study lasted 12 months—6 months with rewards, followed by 6 months without, to see if participants' healthy habits continued when the incentives stopped. But we were surprised that this didn't lead to significantly better blood pressure control. It's unclear whether participants opened the bottles without taking the medication, or if other untracked factors, like different medications or lifestyle behavior, affected their blood pressure. We were also surprised that adherence dropped once the rewards ended. There's still a lot we need to understand about what helps people stick with healthy habits long term." Also, researchers monitored only one blood pressure medication per person, even though many participants were prescribed multiple drugs to manage their blood pressure. In addition, blood pressure was measured in clinic at just three points—at the start of the study, at 6 months, and at 12 months (6 months after the rewards ended)—rather than through more-frequent home monitoring, which might have produced different results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects nearly 40 million individuals globally, resulting in a gradual loss of memory and independence. Despite extensive research over the past decades, no treatments have been found that can halt or reverse the progression of this devastating disease. In AD, a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction is the protein tau. Tau typically plays a crucial role in keeping the internal structure of neurons stable, much like train tracks help trains stay on course. However, in some diseases, tau undergoes abnormal modifications and starts to aggregate, disrupting this transport system, thus leading to neuronal damage and subsequent memory loss. Their paper, titled "NAD⁺ reverses Alzheimer's neurological deficits via regulating differential alternative RNA splicing of EVA1C", is published in the renowned journal Science Advances. The team is led by Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang from the University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital, Norway, in collaboration with Professor Oscar Junhong Luo from Jinan University, China, and Associate Professor Joana M. Silva from the University of Minho, Portugal. It is normally declined with age and especially in various neurodegenerative diseases. Preliminary studies have shown that supplementation with NAD⁺ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), can offer therapeutic benefits in AD animal models and early clinical trials. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these benefits remain largely unclear." The new study reveals that NAD⁺ works through a previously unidentified RNA-splicing pathway. This pathway is regulated by a protein called EVA1C, which plays an essential role in the process of RNA splicing. RNA splicing allows a single gene to produce multiple isoforms of a protein, and one isoform may show distinctive effects to the other isoforms. Its dysregulation is one of the most recently acknowledged risk factor for AD. The researchers discovered that when NAD⁺ levels are increased, EVA1C helps correct mistakes in RNA splicing. This restoration process improves the function of hundreds of genes, many crucial for brain health, which can help reverse the neurodegenerative damage caused by tau. To demonstrate the impact of this mechanism, the researchers used a comprehensive approach that included computer predictions and validation in different animal models, including worms, mice, as well as human brain samples. In mice with tau-related mutations, NAD⁺ supplements improved RNA splicing, restored brain function, and enhanced memory performance. "Notably, we found when the EVA1C gene was knocked down, these benefits were lost, confirming that EVA1C is essential for NAD⁺-mediated neuroprotection", Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem says. To further investigate how EVA1C works, the team used an AI-driven platform to predict how proteins interact with one another, analysing structural, sequential, and evolutionary data from millions of proteins. This analysis revealed that NAD⁺ promotes a specific form of EVA1C that efficiently binds to essential proteins, which are central to protein folding and clearance. "We propose that maintaining NAD⁺ levels could help preserve neuronal identity and delay cognitive decline, paving the way for combination treatments to enhance RNA splicing", Ai says. NAD + reverses Alzheimer's neurological deficits via regulating differential alternative RNA splicing of EVA1C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with atrial fibrillation (AFib) and obesity may have fewer episodes of AFib after ablation if they take the diabetes medication metformin in addition to standard care, according to a preliminary, late-breaking science presentation today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Metformin is a widely prescribed generic medication that helps control blood sugar levels, primarily in people with Type 2 diabetes. It is often used as an initial treatment due to its effectiveness, long history of use and relatively low cost. In previous research on adults with diabetes and obesity, those taking metformin to manage blood sugar and weight had a lower risk of AFib as compared to other antidiabetic agents. Researchers wanted to find out if metformin can help lower the chances of AFib returning in people treated for AFib who are overweight or obese. The Metformin as an Adjunctive Therapy to Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (META-AF) study analyzed 99 adults with AFib and obesity or overweight to determine whether adding metformin to standard care after a catheter ablation procedure would be beneficial. All participants received ablation and then were randomly selected to receive either usual care (lifestyle education about physical activity, healthy eating, sleep and managing other medical conditions) or usual care plus metformin. "Treatment with metformin in people with obesity who do not have diabetes and are undergoing AFib ablation seems to lower the likelihood of recurrent AFib or atrial arrhythmias after a single procedure. Obesity is a common risk factor for AFib, and recurrent episodes of irregular heartbeats are more common in obese and overweight patients after catheter ablation, a procedure to eliminate small areas of tissue generating abnormal heartbeats. I would suggest conducting a larger study to investigate metformin and other diabetes treatments. We know that many of these medications offer cardiovascular benefits, and we are starting to gain a better understanding of how they might specifically benefit patients with arrhythmias. A study comparing various medications would be valuable to confirm our findings and also to address questions about tolerability, the feasibility of long-term use and costs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A minimally invasive heart procedure to correct irregular heart rhythms called catheter ablation may reduce the risk of stroke enough that some patients can discontinue blood thinners, according to a preliminary late-breaking science presentation today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. An international group of researchers enrolled nearly 1,300 adults at multiple sites in several countries and followed their progress for three years after they had ablation to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib). Participants included people with no evidence of irregular heart rhythm recurrence and those with moderate to high stroke risk, which calls for long-term blood thinners. An estimated five million people in the U.S. live with AFib, and it is predicted that more than 12 million people will have it by 2030, per the Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics report. Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend continuing blood-thinning medications in moderate-to-high risk individuals to prevent stroke, even after a successful ablation. "We know that ablation for AFib is effective, however, we did not know if elimination of the arrhythmia also reduces the long-term risk of stroke," said study author Atul Verma, M.D., director of cardiology at McGill University Health Centre in Montreal. Many people who have undergone successful ablation will ask 'Can I stop my blood thinners?' So, it was important to find out if successful ablation could allow discontinuing blood thinners." The other half were prescribed 15 mg daily of oral rivaroxaban, a potent blood thinner. The study found that prescribing the blood thinner rivaroxaban after catheter ablation to treat AFib offered no major difference in stroke protection than those taking aspirin and increased bleeding risk compared to aspirin. "In essence, catheter ablation for AFib reduced the recurrence of atrial fibrillation and can also reduce the risk of stroke associated with this common heart rhythm condition," Verma said. "With the notably increased bleeding risk associated with rivaroxaban, we concluded that the anticoagulant did not offer any advantages in comparison to aspirin for reducing what we found to be a low stroke risk in these individuals. Now, we can advise patients that it may be safe to stop blood thinners, even if they have a moderate stroke risk." As a result, the findings may not be relevant to higher-risk individuals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This possibility is due to a compound the body converts the psychedelic into called psilocin, but psilocin's mechanisms remain unclear. Researchers, led by Sarah Magee and Melissa Herman at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, explored whether psilocin targets neurons in the central amygdala involved in emotional processing and stress to alter alcohol use in their JNeurosci paper. Herman emphasizes that preclinical work like this is necessary for filling gaps in knowledge about drug mechanisms, especially in the field of psychedelic research. Focusing on female mice because they drink more alcohol than male mice, the researchers discovered that psilocin dampened the activity of these neurons following long-term alcohol exposure. This decrease in activity was associated with less alcohol drinking during drug exposure, though drinking was restored in later sessions. These observations also occurred in mice with less severe alcohol exposure, supporting clinical work showing that psychedelics may help improve issues with emotional processing and stress across a range of psychiatric disorders. According to the researchers, these findings may shape interpretations of clinical studies on psychedelic treatments. Elaborating on their findings, says Herman, "It makes sense that dampening this neuron population reduces drinking because increased activity in these neurons is associated with alcohol use disorders. These neurons also play a role in depression and anxiety, which psychedelics are also showing promise at treating, so our work provides some mechanistic insight in those contexts, too." Magee, S. N., et al. (2025) The psychedelic psilocin suppresses activity of central amygdala corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 neurons and decreases ethanol drinking in female mice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study says one more factor should be considered – chronological age. The study, published in the October 28, 2025 edition of New England Journal of Medicine Evidence, was led by senior author Daniel Spratt, MD, Chair Radiation Oncology at University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center and Vincent K. Smith Chair in Radiation Oncology. Older men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) are more likely to have comorbid medical conditions and die from causes other than pros­tate cancer. The study aimed to determine if age impacts the overall survival (OS) benefit from sys­temic treatment intensification (TI) with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and/or chemotherapy in mHSPC. Older men with prostate cancer have a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and other comorbid conditions that can be exacerbated by common treatments, such as androgen deprivation therapy and ARPIs. Currently 1 in 3 men with metastatic prostate cancer die of causes other than prostate cancer, such as heart disease. Older patients who receive these therapies are more likely to experience falls, fractures, cardiac morbidity, and even grade 5 treatment associated adverse events" says Dr. Spratt. We observed an interaction between age and systemic treatment intensification on survival for men with mHSPC. Patients older than 70 years old with low volume mHSPC, especially when treated with radiotherapy to the primary, did not demonstrate improvements from the addition of systemic treatment intensification."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Large-scale, government-led cash transfer programs drove significant improvements in health outcomes across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), according to a major new study in The Lancet from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. More women received health care early in their pregnancies, more babies were born in health facilities, and more births were attended by trained health workers when governments gave money through cash transfer programs. Researchers analyzed data from more than two million live births and nearly one million children under the age of five, spanning 37 LMICs, such as Haiti, Malawi, and Cambodia, between 2000 and 2019, 20 of which introduced large-scale cash transfer programs. The study found that, when governments give people money through cash transfer programs, women were more likely to plan pregnancies as they wished, and more women were also able to get and use birth control when they needed it. The study builds on prior research by the same team, published in Nature, showing that these same cash transfer programs led to large declines in mortality rates among women and children. As many countries consider the future of their cash transfer programs-including approaches such as basic or guaranteed incomes-this research highlights the broad health benefits these programs can deliver." The study also found that in countries with cash transfer programs, babies were more likely to be fed only breast milk, more young children got enough healthy food, and more children overall were vaccinated against measles. These programs also helped to lower the number of children who got diarrhea or were reported as underweight. While previous research has shown favorable impacts of cash transfers on beneficiaries' schooling, nutrition, and well-being, this study is among the first to demonstrate population-wide health improvements, including among non-beneficiaries. The authors combined national survey data with a comprehensive database of government-led cash transfer programs to evaluate seventeen outcomes related to maternal health service use, fertility and reproductive decision-making, caregiver health behaviors, and child health and nutrition. "Unfortunately, that gap has likely only widened since," added Richterman. This research also has relevance for ongoing debates about cash transfers and other forms of economic support in the U.S. The new study appears amidst a reduction of social safety net programs like Supplemental Needy Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which saw significant federal cuts beginning this month. Some cities, like Flint, Michigan, have considered cash transfers and similar programs, such as guaranteed income. Flint's Rx Kids program promised $1,500 for all expectant mothers during pregnancy and $500 per month for the first year of their baby's life regardless of income. Taken together, the research gives policymakers new data to consider when outlining how best to support families in low- and middle-income countries-as well as potentially here at home. "Cash transfer programs impacted not only mothers, but their children, and led to a broad array of health improvements."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Providing healthy, medically tailored meals or boxes of fresh produce along with nutrition counseling with a dietitian led to improved quality of life for people with heart failure compared to people who received dietary counseling without healthy food deliveries, according to a preliminary late-breaking science presentation today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. People with heart failure can often experience their condition worsening if they are not eating the right kind of food after they go home from the hospital. This randomized trial included 150 adults who were enrolled within two weeks of being discharged from the hospital for acute heart failure. Researchers assigned participants to one of three groups: one group received medically tailored meals and dietary counseling with a dietitian; the second group received fresh produce boxes and dietary counseling; and the third group received dietary counseling without food delivery. Participants receiving either meals or produce were also divided into two subgroups. The meals and grocery food delivery programs lasted for 90 days. "These findings indicate the potential for healthy foods to affect outcomes and disease progression for people with chronic conditions like heart failure. If we can identify the best strategy for providing access to healthy food, this could be transformative for people with heart failure who are particularly vulnerable after hospitalization," Pandey said. Current evidence indicates that food insecurity, or limited access to enough food, and nutrition insecurity, or limited access to healthy foods, are both associated with more chronic health conditions and worse outcomes. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Scientific Statement, Systematic Review of "Food Is Medicine" Randomized Controlled Trials for Noncommunicable Disease in U.S., programs that incorporate healthy food and health care for people with or at high risk for chronic disease showed great potential in improving diet quality and food security. Larger studies with more participants and following patients for a longer time period are needed to assess whether food programs may lower hospitalizations or improve survival rates. Pandey and colleagues are planning a phase 3 trial with 1,200–1,500 people at multiple hospitals. This initiative is conducting scientific research, public policy advocacy and stakeholder education to advance food is medicine interventions that incorporate healthy food into health care to treat, manage and prevent diet-related diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track Designation to a new drug combination for metastatic colorectal cancer, following encouraging results from a clinical trial led in part by the University of Oklahoma Health Stephenson Cancer Center. The treatment offers potential hope for patients whose tumors lack a key DNA repair protein called ATM. The drug combination pairs alnodesertib, a targeted therapy that blocks cancer cells' ability to repair DNA damage, and a low dose of irinotecan, a chemotherapy drug that causes that damage. "The treatment responses we have seen are very exciting, and they are in a patient group that has very few options." Normally, a protein called ATR would try to repair that damage before the cells divide again. But alnodesertib, an ATR inhibitor, blocks the repair signal, preventing cancer cells from recovering and multiplying. This mechanism is particularly effective in cancers that already have defective repair systems, such as those lacking ATM. The drug combination's Fast Track Designation is for patients who have already received at least two rounds of other colorectal cancer treatments that have not been effective. Alnodesertib is from Artios Pharma Limited and was tested in the STELLA clinical trial. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 154,000 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2025, and 52,000 people are expected to die from the disease. We have had only two good treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer, so there is a very high unmet need. We are seeing young, otherwise healthy patients who have limited treatment options. This clinical trial has produced very promising results."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Matthew Rettig and his research team have been awarded a Clinical Cancer Research Center grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a new clinical cancer research center that will expand access to precision oncology clinical trials and patient care for veterans across the Southwest United States. The new center will serve as the central research "hub" for all seven VA medical centers in the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) region, supporting lung and genitourinary (GU) cancers, which are leading causes of death not only in veterans, but in men more broadly. Current access to precision oncology across the region varies widely, and many veterans are diagnosed at later stages when treatment options are more limited. The grant is designed to close these gaps by funding the infrastructure needed for clinical trials, research coordination and high-quality data collection across all partner sites. I was ecstatic to learn that we were selected for funding. This includes a tissue and data biorepository containing information from 11.2 million veterans dating back to 1999, which can be linked to major datasets such as the VA Million Veterans Program. The new center will also create an ideal environment for junior faculty and trainees pursuing careers in clinical trials and outcomes research, noted Rettig. "This is a highly rewarding population of patients to serve," he said. "Veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and they deserve the very best care that we can possibly offer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers analyzed blood samples from over 4,000 people without known heart disease and linked the results to the history of cardiovascular disease in parents or siblings of participants. The study identified 38 different proteins found in blood, many linked to inflammation and fat metabolism, that were more prevalent in people with a family history of cardiovascular disease. We see that certain proteins, such as follistatin and cathepsin D, are significantly elevated in people with a family history of early-onset coronary heart disease, regardless of traditional risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol." Agnes Wahrenberg, first author of the study and researcher, Department of Clinical Research and Education, Södersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet The study is based on data from the Swedish population study SCAPIS, in which participants took part in comprehensive health examinations, including computed tomography of the coronary arteries. By linking registers, including the Swedish Multigenerational Register, the researchers were able to show that people with a family history of early-onset coronary heart disease had more widespread coronary atherosclerosis, measured as the number of diseased vessel segments. In addition, certain proteins were found to have a stronger association with the degree of atherosclerosis in people with hereditary risk. These included the LDL receptor and PECAM1, a protein that affects blood vessel function. 'Our results suggest that there is a specific biological pattern connected to hereditary atherosclerotic disease, which may help to explain why some people are affected despite leading a healthy lifestyle,' says Per Svensson, last author of the study, associate professor at the same department, and senior physician at Södersjukhuset. The researchers also used genetic analyses to investigate whether certain proteins may have a direct causal role in the development of heart attacks. The results indicate that follistatin, PCSK9 and PECAM1, are such proteins. Plasma Protein Profile Associated With a Family History of Early-Onset Coronary Heart Disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For older people with irregular heart rhythms who are at high risk of stroke and bleeding, standard care (including the use of blood thinners when indicated) was found to be the better choice compared to a promising, catheter-based procedure, according to a preliminary late-breaking science presentation today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. The trial, Left Atrial Appendage CLOSURE in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation at High Risk of Stroke and Bleeding Compared to Medical Therapy (CLOSURE-AF), compared a catheter-based procedure to medical therapy among patients with an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation or AFib. An estimated five million people in the U.S. live with AFib, and it is predicted that more than 12 million people will have it by 2030, per the Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics report. While blood thinners can be highly effective at reducing the risk of stroke among people with AFib, the medication may cause severe bleeding in some people. It also can allow people to stop taking blood thinners for clot prevention. The CLOSURE AF study compared catheter-based left atrial appendage closure with physician-directed standard medical care (including timely anticoagulant blood thinning when eligible) in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke and bleeding. The aim of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority for catheter-based LAA closure regarding risk of stroke, systemic embolism, cardiovascular/unexplained death or major bleeding. We expected that catheter-based LAA closure would be comparable to physician-directed standard medical care often using blood thinning anticoagulant medications. However, this was not the case in this trial of older patients at very high risk of bleeding and stroke. Our findings indicate that standard physician-directed medical care, including blood thinners for eligible patients, remains a valid management option for those older patients with irregular heartbeat who are at very high risk for stroke and bleeding." Landmesser said that the results of the procedure are different for lower-risk patients, and studies investigating this are currently underway. Because medical treatments and LAA closure for AFib remain in development the results of this study may not apply to future research, other techniques or procedures.
