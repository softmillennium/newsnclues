                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Threads, Meta's competitor to X, will now begin targeting a specific type of creator: podcasters. Initially, Threads will roll out a couple of new features to help on this front. For one, it will give podcast links in the feed a unique and more pronounced look, with colorful backgrounds and image thumbnails, making them easier to spot. In the year ahead, these features will be followed by others that will also focus on serving podcasters and their listeners, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. Today, such discussions are distributed across social media, on places like Reddit, X, Facebook and Instagram, as well as on the platforms where podcasts are streamed, like YouTube and Spotify (the latter added support for comments last year). However, while Threads will target the discussions that result from podcasts, the company told TechCrunch it doesn't intend to be a podcast distribution platform. Instead, the company will focus on giving podcast hosts more insight and analytics on how the conversations around their shows are resonating with fans. This isn't the first time Threads has targeted creators as a way to differentiate its social network from X, Bluesky, and others in the space. The company more recently also began allowing creators to share longer thoughts and perspectives through a text attachment feature. Meta says users can expect to see Threads explore more features focused on podcast discussions in the months ahead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2023, after nearly three decades as CEO of the company he founded, Robert LoCascio stepped down as CEO of LivePerson, the public firm credited with pioneering web chat in 1997. Generative AI advances inspired his next project, which he calls “the highest bar” for the technology: replicating human beings with their life stories and personality. In 2024, he founded and self-funded, Eternos, a legacy service that allows people to preserve their voice and stories for loved ones after they pass away. The startup gained significant media attention after its first client, the terminally ill Michael Bommer, revealed how he worked with Eternos to create a digital replica of himself after spending 25 hours talking to Eternos about his life, interests, and worldview. Lo Cascio was set on building a legacy business, but what surprised him was that most of the people considering using Eternos weren't preparing for death. Eternos developed the Human Life Model (HLM) — a framework that uses only an individual's data, rather than general LLM data, to capture their unique values, life story, and decision-making traits. Since the personal AI models hold the individual's full expertise, a digital replica can be put to work to generate content, handle customer interactions, and even execute projects. Once Uare.ai's platform launches later this year, individuals will be able to start training their HLMs by responding to Uare.ai questions about their lives using text, voice, and even video. What's a crossroad in your life when you were younger?” LoCascio said. “We blend the facts with this human life story, and that gives us your model,” he said. Uare.ai intends to generate revenue through subscription fees or take a share of the revenue generated by customers who earn income from their digital twins. Another startup developing personal AIs is Sequoia-backed Delphi, which has attracted people with large followings, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, and enables others to interact with his replicated knowledge via voice or text. Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield, believes Uare.ai stands out from competitors because it targets individual professionals like CPAs. Plus, it has LoCascio, a very successful entrepreneur at the helm, he told TechCrunch. Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google Photos has rolled out a series of new AI-powered features, including a way to edit objects and people in images, a new Ask button for AI-powered answers about the photo or edit requests, AI templates to create new photos, and the expansion of natural language search. The company first introduced prompt-based editing for Pixel 10 series phones in August. Now, iOS users in the U.S. can describe their edits using voice or text to modify images, Google announced Tuesday. The company is also bringing its redesigned photo editor with easy editing options to iOS. The upgrade includes a new personalized edits feature that recognizes people from Google Photos' face groups. For instance, “Remove Riley's sunglasses, open my eyes, make Engel smile, and open her eyes” to get edits related to each person, as the image below shows. Google is also adding AI templates to easily let users convert one photo into a specific format. With Nano Banana, formats like turning images into retro portraits or action figures became popular. Users can ask for information about the photo, discover related moments, and edit it using prompts. The company will also show some suggestion chips to indicate what users can do with this feature, which is rolling out to users in the U.S. on iOS and Android. Today, the company is expanding the search to more than 100 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Africa. It will support more than 17 new languages such as Arabic, Bengali, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portugese, and Spanish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arrived, a Seattle-based tech startup that turns rental homes into a mainstream asset class for everyday investors, raised $27 million in new funding to support its new “stock market for real estate” platform. Neo led the latest round, which included Forerunner Ventures, Bezos Expeditions, Core, and other backers. Arrived (formerly Arrived Homes) lets people buy fractional shares of single-family rental homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100. It's pitched as an alternative way to gain exposure to real estate without taking on a full mortgage or managing a property. Investors can buy shares in individual homes or pooled funds through the Arrived website. They earn quarterly dividends from rent plus a share of any appreciation when the property is sold after a multi-year holding period. Since launching in 2019, nearly 900,000 registered investors have invested more than $340 million on the Arrived platform. This week the company officially announced its new Secondary Market — a peer-to-peer marketplace where investors can buy and sell shares of rental homes directly from one another. The market, which debuted earlier this year, saw investors place more than 57,000 buy and sell orders in its first three weeks of availability. “We believe real estate investing is going to move online,” Ryan Frazier, co-founder and CEO of Arrived, said in a statement. “Our vision is a future where real estate investing feels just like investing in public companies — where anyone can buy and sell shares of properties in minutes, not months.” Arrived earns revenue through multiple fee streams tied to the acquisition and ongoing management of rental-property investments. Competitors include Landa and Lofty, which describes itself as a “NASDAQ for real estate.” Critics argue that turning more single-family homes into investment products can worsen affordability by adding investor demand to already tight markets.

As the AI-driven shortage of NAND tech continues to bite and enthusiasts chart 100% price increases on RAM for their builds, popular PC hardware vendor PNY has confirmed that it is suspending its upcoming Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions on flash USB storage, citing rising NAND costs. In a possibly devastating sign of a price squeeze and shortage to come, the company says no new deals are being put in place ahead of Black Friday. For instance, its Elite Turbo Attache 4 64GB USB 3.2 Flash Drive is currently just $7.99 at Best Buy instead of $19.99. Tom's Hardware was contacted by a third-party PR representative of PNY on November 10, who advised us that the deals shared on behalf of the company were no longer valid. Crucially, we were also told that no new deals are being put in place on these products. PNY was not immediately available when approached directly for comment. Notably, if NAND shortages are trickling all the way down to flash drives, the impending market crunch could be worse than first thought. While Early Black Friday deals aplenty can be found on a new gaming chair, peripherals, monitors, and components like some GPUs and CPUs, the best SSD deals and memory savings are a little softer. As per our previous coverage, enthusiasts trying to build PCs on popular hardware forums are charting price increases on DDR5 kits of 100% or more. In one notable case, one beleaguered builder cited that the 64GB Kingston FURY Beast kit they'd marked out for their build is now more expensive than the Ryzen 7 9700X CPU it was being paired with. It is also unclear whether there will be any knock-on effect on PNY's supply of consumer SSDs, including its new CS3250. We continue to await comment from PNY and will update this story accordingly.

As it appears, there are no delays compared to the timelines that Micron announced in mid-2025. Micron has published the final draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for its fabs near Clay, New York, which reveals the final schedules for construction of four fabs starting late 2025 through 2041. Meanwhile, a report from Syracuse indicates that the company is accelerating its Idaho fabs and reallocating CHIPS Act funding to that facility. "Micron remains focused on bringing leading-edge memory manufacturing to New York, and we appreciate the strong partnership with federal, state, and local authorities," a Micron statement supplied to Tom's Hardware reads. According to Micron's official draft EIS document released back in June and the latest draft EIS published in November, the construction phase for the first fab (Fab 1) would start from late 2026 (after a year of preparations that start in late 2025, according to the company's U.S. expansion plan unveiled on July 1, 2025) and will last till the second half of 2028, or early 2029. This way, the Micron Clay campus will be fully built and ramped to full production by 2045, which is five years behind schedule. "Micron would mobilize for initial site preparation for the Proposed Project beginning in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the first two DRAM manufacturing facilities (Fabs 1 and 2) estimated to be operational by 2029 and 2030, respectively, and the remaining fabs (Fabs 3 and 4) estimated to be operational by 2035 and 2041," a statement by Micron from the EIS submitted in June reads. Micron reportedly acknowledged an amendment to its $6.1 billion CHIPS Act funding agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, as the company is reportedly bringing forward its ID2 facility in Idaho. The two Idaho facilities — one existing and one newly planned — will be completed ahead of those in Clay, which means that there is a strategic reshuffling of project priorities in place. Local authorities, including Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon, reportedly attributed the delay of Micron's New York campus to widespread labor shortages and the longer construction cycles that have become.

Meanwhile, prioritization of the fab ID2 will have a positive effect on Micron's output of HBM memory in the U.S., as the company also intends to build an advanced packaging facility for HBM and other types of memory that require stacking and advanced packaging in Idaho.

The AOC leaves out some peripheral amenities but delivers on all the important metrics, speed, smoothness, saturated color, high brightness and addictive gaming. And it's less than half the price of a comparable OLED. Wide gamut color that's spot-on accurate out of the box Excellent video processing with low lag and precise overdrive There are so many excellent 27-inch OLED gaming monitors appearing almost weekly that one might wonder if LCD is on the way out. This is definitely not the case for one major reason: cost. An LCD with the same specs will set you back $350 or less. Mini LED panels are delivering over 1,000 nits full-screen, whereas an OLED might hit 500. AOC has long been a master of price/performance, bang-for-the-buck, value among the best gaming monitors — choose your metaphor. It delivers excellent color accuracy, broad contrast, and premium gaming performance for beer money. This 27-inch VA panel boasts QHD resolution, 240 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, HDR1000, a full-array local dimming Mini LED backlight with 1,152 zones, and wide-gamut Quantum Dot color for just $330. OLED will always have one significant advantage over LCD, and that is regarding black levels. It can shut off individual pixels frame by frame, which means blacks will be darker and contrast will be higher. But a well-engineered LCD with the right combination of technologies can still approach that image quality. It's a VA panel, Fast VA in AOC's parlance, with a Mini LED backlight that not only approaches 1,500 nits full-field, but also has 1,152 dimming zones, each with four LEDs. It's rated for DisplayHDR 1000, and I saw 1,460 nits measuring a full-field white pattern. There are a few slightly more colorful monitors out there, but in the Mini LED camp, it's one of the most colorful. Accuracy is also spot-on, with no need for calibration. I achieved only a tiny gain in the numbers after making adjustments. HDR color is even more saturated with tremendous vibrance and impact. Gamers will be looking for video processing cred, and the Q27G4ZMN covers that base too. There's a precise overdrive to remove almost all motion blur as well. To keep the price low, AOC leaves out conveniences like speakers and USB ports. There's no OSD joystick, you'll have to make do with buttons. If you're focused on performance and image quality, it's on par with the very best at an attractively low price. A simple clamshell box with molded pulp inside, no crumbly foam, contains the Q27G4ZMN in three pieces that assemble without tools. There's a 100mm VESA mount in back with fasteners if you want to use an arm. You can buy two of these for the price of one OLED, so I expect to see them in multi-screen setups. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. AOC keeps the Q27G4ZMN's styling understated, but there are a few bits of red trim to signal its gaming intent. There's no LED lighting, aside from a tiny power indicator that glows white when the Q27G4ZMN is on and orange in standby mode. Five control keys protrude slightly from the bottom right with their functions labeled in front. Buttons aren't my favorite, as I'm spoiled by joysticks and nifty remotes, but here, they get the job done. You won't need to do much tweaking as the picture is already very close to perfect out of the box. There's a little wobble at the fulcrum, but ergonomics are sound. You get 5/23 degrees tilt and 20 20-degree swivel plus 4.9 inches of height adjustment. Pressing the Q27G4ZMN's second-from-the-right control key brings up an intuitive OSD with six sub-menus. There are plenty of options for image tweaking and video processing, but once you've made a few settings changes, you won't be visiting the OSD often. The Q27G4ZMN has four fixed gaming picture modes and three settings memories. I stuck with Standard as it made all the image controls available. Additional game tweaks include shadow control to make dark areas easier to see, color saturation, Adaptive-Sync toggle, aiming point, three-level overdrive and a refresh rate indicator. The overdrive is very precise and works best on its Fastest setting. There are no ghosting artifacts, and blur is almost absent. The only thing missing here is backlight strobing. In the picture menu, there are more image modes called Eco Adjustment. I recommend leaving this on Standard as well to avoid confusion. This menu includes three fixed color temps and a user mode with RGB sliders. I tweaked them for a tiny improvement in measured values, but they made no visual difference. HDR signals unlock four more modes, of which Display is the best. The other three, Picture, Movie and Game, can be used as emulations with SDR content. There are three levels for local dimming available. Strong works well and doesn't clip detail, so I used it for HDR games. I appreciated the flexibility to use this feature for both SDR and HDR You don't have to calibrate the Q27G4ZMN in its Standard gaming mode. It's also best to leave Eco Mode on Standard. I tweaked the RGB sliders, for a tiny bit better grayscale tracking, but this had no visual impact. You can see those results on page five. Local Dimming is available for both SDR and HDR. I found it was better left off for work tasks and most video content. Color was also the star with rich hues and vivid textures. It's vibrant without veering into the cartoon look. And if you prefer sRGB, that mode is spot-on in every metric. This monitor is fully qualified for color-critical work like Photoshop or video post-production. The overdrive is very precise and works perfectly on its highest setting. Blur is nearly nonexistent, and there are no ghosting artifacts. There's no backlight strobe option here, so you'll want to make sure you can get as close to 240fps as possible. The Q27G4ZMN is a bare bones gaming monitor so there aren't USB ports, speakers or LED lights. But none of that detracts from its capabilities. It is a seriously good monitor in every respect, gaming, image quality, ease of setup, and out-of-the-box performance. There is nothing to complain about here; it just works.

Since so many other organizations succeeded at creating open source models of far higher quality at much lower cost, it would be instructive to understand what exactly went wrong there. Given his remit was a research time horizon of 8-10 years, and the fact that he's gone on record saying that he expects the technology will stall out in the time horizon, it seems he can only take Ws and ties. Indirect influence on open-sourcing the models to propel research forward (which is pretty important for a chief scientist) which added benefit for Meta's other products. US labs are operating on the power law. They also, arguably, distilled from western models (llama). Was this written in earnest or as an ironic/facetious joke?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consumers, on the other hand, absolutely love to use it. Some methods are respectable, like aging a whiskey for 15 years to file down its rough edges. Some are less so, like dumping in loads of chemical additives. Some are more successful than others, but none can completely eliminate that burning sensation in your mouth. But it wasn't until Joana Montenegro and Martin Enriquez, the spousal founders of Voodoo Scientific, that anyone really asked: Why does alcohol burn, anyway? And, most importantly, is there a way to get rid of that gasp-inducing burn altogether? During the months of Covid-19 lockdown, Enriquez, a former telecom executive, says he and Montenegro, essentially on a lark, had the idea to dig deep into this question. They started by scouring the scientific journals to see if anyone had pinpointed the reason why whiskey and its ilk can cause an unpleasant burn. “No one could really identify what it is that attacks you and creates pain.” Montenegro, a veteran food scientist from General Mills and Land O'Lakes, said they decided to go deeper. Masked and 6 feet apart in a Starbucks, Montenegro says, Julius didn't comprehend why someone who was part of the team that patented Go-Gurt had an interest in pain receptors. Nevertheless, the duo persisted, and Julius eventually guided them on how to research the concept and determine which receptor was being activated to cause a pain response. Eventually Montenegro and Enriquez found it, a receptor called TRPA1. Alas, that didn't work for hiding the burn of alcohol. “This receptor has a very unique property called reversible bonding,” says Montenegro. “In other words, you can't block it,” she says. The only problem was they didn't know what those compounds were. To find them, GC mass spectrometry was used to identify hundreds of molecules that are common across all spirits categories, and then whittle them down to find the few that had the characteristics that would trigger TRPA1. The most surprising thing about these compounds is that none of them are ethanol itself but rather various by-product compounds of the fermentation process that are expelled by yeast and survive distillation. Specifically, says Montenegro, “As yeast ages, fat around the cell starts to oxidize. They're present in every fermented product at a scale of parts per million or billion. It's just a natural adjacent bioprocess to fermentation, making alcohol,” says Enriquez. Turns out some can also convert those offensive compounds into something neutral during fermentation. “The beauty of nature is, when you have an irritant, nature tends to have a way of detoxifying it,” says Montenegro. Voodoo Scientific didn't create the enzyme it uses in its process, but rather worked with a biotech company to pore through thousands of commercially available enzymes to find a handful that could impact the nine suspicious compounds it had targeted. Voodoo Scientific's product is called Viriato, named after a legendary warrior in Portugal—where Montenegro is from and where the couple now lives—who held off Roman soldiers from invading his village. One of those testers is Pete Barger, CEO of Southern Distilling in North Carolina, who first met the team five years ago, during their early Covid-era development. “I liked the concept and the technical approach,” he says, saying that Voodoo's idea was a breath of fresh air in a stodgy industry built on tradition. “So much of the American whiskey space is ‘We do it that way because that's how we've always done it.' Encouraged by his tastings of Voodoo's production samples, Barger says Viriato isn't about “fixing a bad product” but rather about opening the door to creativity that might otherwise not be possible. “If you can have a better, cleaner distillate going into a barrel,” he says, “we don't have to ask that barrel to atone for the sins of production. Southern is now waiting on a product to test Viriato at scale. Enriquez echoes Barger's hopes that Voodoo will spur more creative distillations. “They like making things that have nuance to them, and Viriato allows them to explore places they couldn't previously.” When independently tested by experts at the Beverage Testing Institute in January 2025, tasters noted that the treated samples not only were much less harsh but also that one processed sample surprised them because “it tasted more like rum than moonshine,” BTI president Jerald O'Kennard said in an interview for this story. After all, that pain response is there for a reason, ostensibly working to keep drinkers' consumption in check. If there's no burn, won't people just guzzle down these super-smooth spirits without a care? “This is basically removing the biological barrier to overconsuming alcohol,” says Nicole Avena, a neuroscience researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. People could definitely run a risk of becoming highly intoxicated rather quickly.” Jared L. Ross, an emergency medicine doctor in Charleston, also says that he has some worries. That said, notes Ross, “There are certainly other ways to mask alcohol.” Montenegro and Enriquez at least concur with that last statement, saying that distilleries already add loads of sugar and glycerin to hide the bite of booze. Rather than encouraging distillers to mask the harsh bite of alcohol with adulterants, they reiterate that they feel it's better for both producers and drinkers to eliminate it. Naturally, I had to see for myself if the product lived up to its promises, and the company sent me a tasting kit of two vodkas and two unaged whiskeys (they call it moonshine), one of each made traditionally, the other processed using Viriato's enzymes. After hours of talking about the product, I thought I had a good handle on how Viriato would impact a spirit. To my palate, it wasn't so much a matter of removing burn—probably because after 18 years of tasting spirits professionally, I'm immune to burn at standard proof levels. I really didn't detect much burn in any of the samples. Rather, what the Viriato samples did reduce was a sense of roughness and immaturity. More importantly, I could now readily taste how the spirits had been doctored during their production. And it was also trivially easy to detect that the vodka had been made from a base of grain, rather than, say, potatoes. If Viriato catches on, will we soon have access to cleaner, less adulterated spirits, all without harshness and burn?

Better yet, when was the last time you commented on a piece of non-Facebook content by clicking a Facebook comment button? Apparently these buttons are still alive somewhere, and used enough to merit an announcement from Meta that they're going away next year on Feb. 10. It's probably wise for Meta to memory-hole these artifacts of a more naive time on the internet. It was, in theory, a sort of symbiotic throuple relationship between the external site, which got traffic; the user, who got a social experience; and Facebook, which got everyone's data. It's eerie to read Time‘s Dan Fletcher writing about the release of these products back then. If enough of your friends like the same restaurant on Yelp, you'll see that on Yelp and when you log in to Facebook. One Cambridge Analytica scandal later, I think we can all agree that letting our preferences and emotions be converted into data and harvested all day long by a tech company was, at best, a questionable life decision. According to Meta's own blog post about the sunsetting of these features, “The plugins that will be discontinued reflect an earlier era of web development, and their usage has naturally declined as the digital landscape has evolved.” Meta notes that developers don't actually have to do anything to get rid of the buttons. When the end comes, they'll just stop showing up—or rather that each will be rendered as a “0x0 pixel (invisible element) rather than causing errors or breaking your website functionality.” But not all of the old fashioned “Social Plugins” for Facebook are ending. If you'll scroll to the bottom of this article, you'll see a “Share this story” module with a little Facebook “F.” That thing is not going anywhere as far as we can tell.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If we assume for a moment that Tesla's recent sales declines are entirely due to faulty management, specifically caused by people with the job title “program manager,” then Tesla is well in its way to massive improvements. According to an October story in Electrek, Musk's companies SpaceX and xAI are buying up excess Cybertruck inventory. There was a recall last month of 63,000 Cybertrucks due to the headlights being too intense, and that came after the more notorious March recall of 46,000 Cybertrucks after an embarrassing mishap kept occurring where a thin piece of decorative Cyber-metal held on with glue kept falling off and revealing the very un-Cyber-car guts underneath. “I recently made one of the hardest decisions of my life,” wrote former Cybertruck program manager Siddhant Awasthi in a LinkedIn post on Sunday. He may simply be moving on to greener pastures. Awasthi notes in his post that his signature accomplishments at Tesla occurred “all before hitting 30.” Indeed, it appears that in 2017, when he was 23, he was a student at the University of Cincinnati working on a school project related to the Musk-led “Hyperloop” concept. The eight-year Tesla tenure Awasthi describes in his LinkedIn post indicates that he joined Tesla around that same time. According to Reuters, it was only “hours later” that Emmanuel Lamacchia, who held the same job title as Awasthi also left Tesla. “What a journey it's been,” Lamacchia's LinkedIn post began. Reuters' story on Lamacchia's exit notes that “several senior program managers” have left Tesla over the past year. Late last month on a rambling Tesla earnings call, Elon Musk said “corporate terrorists” might stand in the way of shareholders pledging to award him a pay package that would make him a trillionaire. But shareholders ended up making that pledge after all and now he'll be a trillionaire if Tesla accomplishes a certain set of goals. Some of those goals involve selling cars, but most involve transitioning Tesla into the futuristic, automation-and-robots company Elon Musk has been promising recently—goals like deploying 1 million robotaxis and 1 million humanoid robots. Are people mellowing Elon or is there just a lot of inventory to go around? 75% of shareholders voted to approve the pay plan. In Europe, there's more bad news for Tesla. "If you took all the James Bond cars and combined them, it's crazier than that," said Musk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Senate Democrats crossed the aisle to reopen the government on Monday night, helping to pass a budget criticized for “making the largest cut to Medicaid in American history to pay for the largest tax break for billionaires in American history,” those billionaires' preferred mode of travel was in the midst of a major setback: they're reportedly banned at 12 major airports. On Sunday, Ed Bolen president and CEO of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), which is a lobby for the private jet business, said his organization's press release that along with the previously announced flight restrictions at 40 U.S. airports were additional restrictions that “will effectively prohibit business aviation operations at 12 of those airports, disproportionately impacting general aviation, an industry that creates more than a million jobs, generates $340 billion in economic impact and supports humanitarian flights every day.” French economist Thomas Piketty frames private jet usage a little differently, claiming that they should be banned as a visible penalty on the rich for their disproportional contributions to climate change, and that such a ban would help the poor feel involved. You have to start right at the very top, [with] people who would take a private jet.” Earlier on Monday, President Donald Trump used a Truth Social post to attack air traffic controllers who stayed home, or sought other work, while their jobs were unpaid amid the government shutdown. According to the NBAA, House members with access to private jets will not be able to land them at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, because it's on the list of 12 currently grounding private jets. Powers laptops with triple 100W USB-C ports and massive 25,000mAh flight-approved capacity. Are people mellowing Elon or is there just a lot of inventory to go around? 5.5% of flights in the U.S. have been cancelled for Monday. It's roughly at the level you would see in a light snow storm.</p>
