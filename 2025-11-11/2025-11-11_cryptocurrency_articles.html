                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Publicly traded financial services firm SoFi unveiled the launch of SoFi Crypto on Tuesday, allowing users to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other crypto assets alongside the firm's other banking services. “Today marks a pivotal moment when banking meets crypto in one app, on a trusted platform, and driven by our core mission to help our members get their money right,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a statement. “I believe blockchain technology will fundamentally change EVERY way finance is done throughout the world by making money movement faster, cheaper and safer,” he added, “while opening new ways for people to borrow better, invest better, spend and save better.” Noto telegraphed SoFi's crypto plans in a January earnings call, and the firm formally announced its intentions in June to support crypto trading. At that time, it also hinted at offering crypto staking and borrowing features, though Tuesday's rollout makes no mention of them. Highlighted in the firm's announcement is the ability for users to buy crypto with funds sitting in their FDIC-insured SoFi checking or savings accounts, without needing to open a separate account. “Data shows 60% of SoFi members who own crypto would prefer to buy, sell and hold their crypto with a licensed bank over their primary crypto exchange—a clear signal of the confidence consumers place in regulated institutions and SoFi's unique position to meet this demand head-on,” the firm wrote.

A Chinese woman has been sentenced to over 11 years in prison in Britain for laundering money from a major scam in China

LONDON -- A Chinese woman who was found with 5 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) in Bitcoin after defrauding more than 128,000 people in China in a Ponzi scheme was sentenced by a U.K. court on Tuesday to over 11 years in prison.

Police said the investigation into Zhimin Qian, 47, led to officers recovering devices holding 61,000 Bitcoin in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the U.K. 

Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said.

Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets.

When she attracted the attention of Chinese authorities, Qian fled to the U.K. under a fake identity. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month.

Investigators found notes Qian had written documenting her aspirations — including her "intention to become the monarch of Liberland, a self-proclaimed country consisting of a strip of land between Croatia and Serbia.”

The businesswoman, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering offenses and transferring and possessing criminal property, was sentenced Tuesday to 11 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court. 

She was sentenced alongside her accomplice Seng Hok Ling, 47, a Malaysian national who was accused of helping Qian transfer and launder the cryptocurrency. Ling was jailed at the same court for four years and 11 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of transferring criminal property.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monday's rebound in crypto markets quickly unwound on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$103,376.03 slipping back to $103,000. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,465.30 fell 2.3% to below $3,500 and large-cap altcoins such as Solana's SOL SOL$158.70, XRP$2.4322 and SUI$2.0892 dropped 4%-5%, marking a broad retreat across digital assets. TeraWulf (WULF) and Bitdeer (BTDR) also booked double-digit declines. The sector-wide weakness stemmed from a roster of firms reporting weaker-than-expected earnings and growth outlook in a sign that the red-hot AI infrastructure trade, driven by lofty expectations of demand for increased computing capacity, is due for a correction. Cloud computing provider CoreWeave lowered its next quarter outlook, citing delays in data center development, sending its stock 15% lower to the weakest level since early September. Rounding up the negative headlines was Japanese investment bank SoftBank selling its entire stake, worth $5.8 billion, in chipmaking giant and AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA), driving the world's most valuable company's stock 3.5% lower. Also this morning the ADP reported that U.S. private employers cut an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Oct. 25, signaling a deteriorating labor market. The CME FedWatch tool now prices a roughly 67% chance of an interest-rate cut at the Federal Reserve's December meeting, while Polymarket sees it slightly higher at 72%. BTC revisiting these gaps in price is often seen in market behavior, though not all gaps are necessarily filled, CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten noted.

Bitcoin fills its weekend CME futures gap, but bulls struggle to produce a BTC price turnaround. Analysis shows Bitcoin whales selling into price at local highs. Derivatives traders continue to avoid risk with $100,000 still hanging in the balance. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed that the BTC price action dipped further after hitting new November highs near $107,500. As Cointelegraph reported, such gaps often form short-term targets for the BTC price. This has become an incredibly reliable and predictable pattern by now,” trader Daan Crypto Trades wrote in a response on X. With a rebound yet to occur, however, trading resource Material Indicators warned that a snap sell-off by Bitcoin whales worth $240 million had contributed to the comedown. FireCharts shows a massive $240M market dump in the $BTC order book.Interestingly, Brown Mega Whales only account for about $3M of that. “Some size sold into $104K price area & renewed short interest,” trader Skew wrote on the topic. Earlier, market participants outlined the BTC price support targets now relevant, including sub-$100,000 levels. Open interest (OI) decreased by over 11% in just a week, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts. “The 11.32% drop in OI over 7 days is a sign that the market is eliminating speculative risk, which has historically been a precursor to recovery,” contributor GugaOnChain wrote.

Jurisdictions that create regulatory clarity around digital assets are more likely to attract institutional investment and drive real-world usage, experts told The National in April. The UAE's central bank strategy on the Digital Dirham was initiated in March 2023, and local regulation has required stablecoins to be fully backed by high-quality liquid assets and subject to audit. In April, Abu Dhabi entities IHC, ADQ and First Abu Dhabi Bank announced that they plan to launch a dirham-backed stablecoin, which will be fully regulated by the UAE Central Bank.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was "the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed". After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. "Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost." So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property. As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could "get rich while lying down". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth. Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. One of her investors, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. "That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company," he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. "There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: "We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance." These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. "We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?" "That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red," Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. "Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck," he remembers. "We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. "She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations." What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Before her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a "glimpse of sunlight". Its fate will be decided by a civil "proceeds of crime" case that will start in earnest early next year. There are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain. It is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value. As in other "proceeds of crime" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond. Separately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage. The toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine. Mr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said. "Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice." Myanmar's scam clans are being brought to justice in the full glare of Chinese state TV.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With over 130 countries, representing nearly 98% of global GDP, actively engaged in CBDC initiatives, these state-backed digital currencies are no longer a distant concept but a rapidly materializing reality. While central banks champion CBDCs as a modern solution for financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and monetary sovereignty, their development has ignited a fierce debate within the cryptocurrency community and among privacy advocates, who foresee unprecedented central control and surveillance. While some see CBDCs as a gateway to familiarizing the public with digital transactions, potentially paving the way for wider crypto adoption, others view them as a direct ideological and existential threat to decentralized cryptocurrencies and private stablecoins. The direct, immediate price action of major cryptocurrencies in response to specific CBDC announcements has historically been nuanced, often overshadowed by broader market sentiment or macro-economic factors. Decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have not experienced sharp, direct declines solely attributable to CBDC news. This could potentially lead to a bifurcation of the digital money market, with CBDCs serving as the primary medium for everyday transactions and cryptocurrencies retaining their role as speculative assets, stores of value, or foundational layers for decentralized applications. While specific trading volumes and liquidity changes directly attributable to CBDC developments are hard to isolate, the ongoing debate contributes to the overall risk assessment and investor sentiment, potentially influencing capital allocation decisions in the long run. The crypto community's response to CBDCs has been largely characterized by skepticism and, in many quarters, outright opposition. Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit are rife with discussions highlighting profound privacy concerns. Some see CBDCs as a potential on-ramp, bringing more users into the digital asset fold who might then explore decentralized alternatives. Others view them as a competitive threat that could stifle innovation in private digital payment solutions. Concerns also exist about potential regulatory frameworks that might accompany CBDCs, which could extend to existing decentralized protocols. In the short term, the ongoing development and pilot phases, particularly in major economies, will continue to fuel debate and shape regulatory discussions. These developments will likely inform global best practices and regulatory approaches, which could then influence how decentralized cryptocurrencies are treated. Long-term implications suggest a potential bifurcation of the digital financial system. CBDCs could become the dominant form of digital cash for everyday transactions, while decentralized cryptocurrencies continue to serve as stores of value, collateral in DeFi, and the underlying infrastructure for permissionless innovation. Strategic considerations for crypto projects and investors will involve navigating this evolving landscape. Projects may need to demonstrate clear value propositions that CBDCs cannot replicate, such as true decentralization, enhanced privacy features, or novel use cases beyond simple payments. Investors will need to assess how different assets perform in a world where central bank-issued digital money is prevalent, potentially leading to a flight to quality for truly decentralized assets that offer censorship resistance and monetary independence. Possible scenarios range from harmonious coexistence where each serves distinct purposes, to increased regulatory pressure on decentralized assets as governments seek to maintain monetary control. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, the rise of CBDCs is a critical development that demands close attention. While CBDCs offer potential benefits like enhanced financial inclusion and payment efficiency, the inherent trade-offs in terms of privacy and central control are significant. Important dates and events to monitor include legislative milestones for major CBDC projects, the expansion of pilot programs, and any new regulatory frameworks targeting digital assets in response to CBDC developments. Ultimately, the co-evolution of CBDCs and cryptocurrencies will define the future of money, presenting a dynamic interplay between centralized control and decentralized freedom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since October, BitMine, ETHZilla, SharpLink Gaming, and several other treasury firms' stock prices have performed worse than ethereum itself. The overall performance of digital asset treasury firms (DATs) focused on ethereum has been significantly down as shares of these firms are performing worse than their underlying asset in Q4. “An mNAV under one limits the ability for DATs to perform accretive dilution, which is the principle that permits DATs to purchase more underlying assets and fulfill their mandate of increasing the asset value per share,” per Gurnoor Narula, a research analyst at Placeholder VC. Narula told Sherwood News, “DATs start showing cracks when they aren't able to close that mNAV gap, either because they've run out of funds to do so, or the underlying asset is distressed such that investor confidence has waned.” Bitcoin powerhouse Strategy has also suffered, declining 26% since October 1, though its mNAV stands just above 1. Kenetic, a blockchain venture capital firm that invested $5 million in ETHZilla, is not deploying more funds at this point, the investment firm's founder and managing partner, Jehan Chu, said to Sherwood. However, Chu remains confident in the digital asset treasury model and is “optimistic that when interest rates are lowered and crypto experiences a push, we will see a corresponding surge in DATs including ETHZilla.” Market-implied probabilities derived from event contracts show that traders believe there's a 29% chance bitcoin gets to $130,000 or above this year. Ripple is also jump-starting a pilot program with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to explore settling credit card transactions on the XRP Ledger. Spot ethereum ETFs also a fifth straight day of outflows, with roughly $219 million leaving the investment funds on Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Bitcoin has rebounded from a recent low of $100,000 to test the daily TBO Fast line near $106,000. The current strategy favors shorting ETH while reallocating capital to undervalued, low-capitalization altcoins such as STRK. Although ETH boasts superior fundamentals and broader adoption, STRK exhibits early reversal signs and offers higher potential returns, making it the preferred choice at this market juncture. With both metrics falling, market share is shifting to OTHERS.D, TOTALE50.D, and TOTALE100.D—collectively representing altcoins. Notably, Top 10 Dominance generated a TBT Bullish Divergence, and OTHERS.D is on track to reach resistance at 8.33%, suggesting significant inflows into smaller altcoins. The overall crypto market cap (TOTALES) climbed to its daily TBO Fast line but faces resistance at approximately 3.36 trillion. While no reversal warnings have emerged on the 4-hour chart, TOTALE50 and TOTALE100 both closed within the daily TBO Cloud, confirming a shift to bullish consolidation. The TOTAL3ESBTC ratio also trends higher toward its 0.38 resistance, with a potential extension to 0.50, reinforcing an early-stage altcoin rally. In traditional markets, the US dollar index retraced modestly from just above 100 yet remains in strong bullish mode above its TBO Cloud. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown's end drove a 1.54% gain in the S&P 500 and lower VIX levels, yet gold surprised with a 2.77% surge, underscoring continued safe-haven demand. SOL and TRX each formed TBT Bullish Divergences, while HBAR also closed short. Noteworthy moves include STRK's 40% advance above its 0.236 Fibonacci retracement and ICP's 4-hour TBO Close Long, highlighting broad-based bullish momentum. Traders should follow their risk management rules, consider scaling into positions early, and retain a portion of gains to capture potential multi-bag moves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On November 8, IcoBeast, a pseudonymous crypto influencer with 67,000 followers, posted on X that his allocation from MegaETH's token sale was worth “nearly $1 million dollars,” and that he needed “to figure out how to hedge this.” In the case of hedging crypto tokens, it often refers to placing a bearish bet that pays out if a token falls in value. “My allocation has been revoked and is now worth $0,” he said. MegaETH is an upcoming blockchain project built on top of Ethereum. It aims to provide 100,000 transactions per second by using parallel transaction execution, among other technical features. IcoBeast, MegaETH Labs, and Muduroglu did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The decision to rescind IcoBeast's token allocation has divided opinion among crypto investors. “Feeling sorry for IcoBeast here, but this should be a strong signal to the community and all $MEGA holders that you're in the best possible hands,” Simon Dedic, founder of crypto investment firm Moonrock Capital, said on X. “Not allowing people to hedge is nuts,” Grug, a pseudonymous crypto influencer, said on X. “Language like this will also just lead to more people hedging, which, let's be honest, you nor anyone other protocol can effectively track.” It's not clear how MegaETH will enforce its no-hedging policy. Token sales like MegaETH's have surged in popularity in recent months as investors bet on them replicating the eye-watering returns generated by similar investments. In June, Bitfinex's Plasma blockchain conducted a sale for its XPL token. When XPL launched in September, it traded at around $1.20, delivering an eye-watering 2,300% return to sale participants. The XPL token has plummeted some 77% since then as early investors cashed out. Direct crypto token sales, often called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, have a turbulent history. They peaked in popularity in 2017, but were swiftly cracked down on by the US Securities and Exchange Commission after developers piggybacked on that popularity to peddle hundreds of dubious projects. Bipartisan support for crypto legislation in the US, coupled with a more permissive approach to industry regulation from President Donald Trump's administration, has given firms the confidence to conduct token sales again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoFi Technologies (SOFI) announced on Tuesday that it will become the first nationally chartered bank in the U.S. to offer crypto services for retail customers. The bank said its newly launched SoFi Crypto platform will allow members to buy, sell, and hold dozens of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around the company trended in ‘bearish' territory even as chatter rose to ‘normal' from ‘low' levels over the past day. SoFi noted that its data showed 60% of members who already own crypto prefer conducting transactions through a licensed bank rather than a primary crypto exchange, which it said highlighted strong consumer demand for regulated services. However, the service was shut down two years ago, and the company stated that it was reevaluating its cryptocurrency strategy and product offerings. SoFi may be the first nationally chartered bank to offer crypto trading fully integrated with banking and other financial services – but other U.S. banks are also on the same track. Citi, for example, is planning to launch crypto custody services by 2026. SoFi's launch comes at a time when Bitcoin's price is trading 17% below its all-time high of more than $126,000 seen in October.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SOFI), the one-stop shop for digital financial services, today announced the launch of SoFi Crypto, becoming the first and only nationally chartered bank where consumers can bank, borrow, invest — and now buy, sell and hold crypto – all in one place and on a platform they trust. SoFi Crypto's phased rollout starts today and will become available to more members over the coming weeks. “Today marks a pivotal moment when banking meets crypto in one app, on a trusted platform, and driven by our core mission to help our members get their money right,” said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi. “I believe blockchain technology will fundamentally change EVERY way finance is done throughout the world by making money movement faster, cheaper and safer, while opening new ways for people to borrow better, invest better, spend and save better. As the first and only nationally chartered bank to launch crypto trading to consumers, we are uniquely positioned to drive this innovation and set a new standard built on security, stability, and transparency.” SoFi Crypto launches at a time when interest in digital assets is at an all-time high, with ownership doubling in 2025. This shift in how people manage and invest their money has created a growing demand for secure, stable, and regulated platforms. Data shows 60% of SoFi members who own crypto would prefer to buy, sell and hold their crypto with a licensed bank over their primary crypto exchange — a clear signal of the confidence consumers place in regulated institutions and SoFi's unique position to meet this demand head-on. This launch is the beginning of SoFi's broader strategy to weave blockchain innovation throughout its entire ecosystem. SoFi is currently leveraging blockchain to power global crypto-enabled remittances that make sending money internationally faster and more affordable. They can also enter for a chance to get one Bitcoin through joining the waitlist by November 30, opening a crypto account, and making three qualifying transactions of at least $10 by January 31, 2026. SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is a one-stop shop for digital financial services on a mission to help people achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions. Fintechs, financial institutions, and brands use SoFi's technology platform Galileo to build and manage innovative financial solutions across nearly 160 million global accounts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's crypto rails are switching on, but the promised rework of America's "ancient" legacy system is still missing. “You have certainly as an industry gone up more than anybody. Nobody's gained the respect in such a short period of time.” “Many Americans are unaware that behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of date[…] but payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear. This will increase demand for US treasuries, lower interest rates and secure the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency for generations to come.” Trump also stated that he believes stablecoins help protect the dollar. He asserted that he is “not going to let the dollar slide,” because with a “smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide.” Can Trump have his dollar cake without eating crypto, too? The Treasury initiated GENIUS Act processes on September 18 with an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks input on how to license issuers, establish capital and liquidity requirements, and define bank-permissible activities. The consultation window is the first step toward binding standards that would allow banks and payments firms to issue fully backed dollar stablecoins under federal oversight. The original promise was framed as upgrading an “ancient” stack without building a CBDC. In an executive action signed Jan. 23, Trump created a CBDC ban, and bills to codify it have cleared the House but are not yet law. The policy direction is set, while statutory endpoints and detailed implementation are pending. Supervision has shifted in a way that matters for banks seeking to integrate with crypto rails. The OCC also issued specific bulletins on bank activities related to digital assets, reestablishing permissible paths under review for safety and soundness. Throughput on public stablecoin rails is already substantial by on-chain measures, although a significant share is intra-exchange and automated, rather than point-of-sale spending. Industry research from McKinsey frames the stablecoin thesis as tokenized cash for settlement and treasury, not a consumer swipe replacement on day one. According to McKinsey, distribution and last-mile integration drive real-economy impact once backing standards converge under rules like GENIUS. After reserves are standardized, competition shifts to who controls distribution between merchants, acquirers, and wallets. The private Real-Time Payments network processed $481 billion in the second quarter, with a single-day record of 1.81 million transactions and $5.2 billion on October 3. Swift states that 90% of cross-border payments now reach the destination bank within one hour on GPI, which narrows the speed gap that once separated public chains from correspondent banking. The competitive wedge for crypto rails centers on 24/7 uptime, weekend and cross-border settlement, programmability, and capital efficiency at the treasury layer, rather than raw domestic speed. The pipes that connect those advantages to everyday commerce are turning on. Mastercard unveiled end-to-end capabilities to power stablecoin transactions from wallets to checkouts, and began regional settlement rollouts for USDC and EURC in corridors where cross-border friction is highest. According to Visa Investor Relations and Mastercard, these integrations enable the movement of stablecoins into acquirer-ledgers and settlement files without altering the consumer checkout experience. Policy timing sets the boundary for when a “replacement” rail can be measured in production. In parallel, banking agencies must set capital, liquidity, and supervision standards for PPSIs and for banks that hold reserves or intermediate stablecoin settlement. Market-structure legislation, including the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act that passed the House in July, would clarify the treatment of exchanges and commodities versus securities, but has less direct impact on payments on day one. Forward adoption will depend on whether card networks and acquirers shift their settlement to stablecoins, which can reduce costs or shorten the time. According to Mastercard, multi-rail acceptance is already a program goal. For banks, the revived OCC guidance means that reserve custody, tokenized cash activities, and payments DLT can be situated under existing risk frameworks once final rules define eligibility and oversight. If supply and distribution expand under federal licensing, the reserve base forms a recurring bid for short-dated U.S. government debt. A larger stablecoin float channels demand into 1- to 3-month bills, thereby reinforcing dollar distribution abroad, provided that par convertibility and intraday liquidity are robust. The range matters less than convertibility, audits, and narrow-banking-style safeguards that address bank supervisors' concerns about the singleness of money, elasticity, and integrity. There is a competing path where public stablecoins cap out and bank-led tokenized deposits take the lead. The Bank for International Settlements outlines a next-generation system built around tokenized deposits and unified ledgers anchored in central bank reserves. Public stablecoins then remain a crypto-native rail with ring-fenced use. Rules are in consultation, OCC and the Fed have softened posture on bank participation, SEC leadership has turned over, and the card networks are deploying. RTP's throughput and transaction limits have risen, which reduces the domestic gap crypto once exploited. For readers tracking whether the replacement is genuine, watch metrics that test the settlement thesis rather than relying on consumer-facing anecdotes. Compare stablecoin weekend and FX costs against Swift GPI routes at the corridor level. Track aggregate Treasury bill holdings by licensed issuers against auction sizes. These are the gauges that convert political promises into measurable payments infrastructure. The real turning point occurs once GENIUS rules are finalized and acquirer adoption is reflected in measurable settlement flows. That is real progress toward a crypto-native settlement layer. But a full replacement of legacy rails is nowhere near done (nor what Trump actually promised). FedNow, RTP, and Swift GPI are scaling in parallel, not being switched off. GENIUS standards are still under consultation, bank capital rules for PPSIs remain unresolved, and acquirer adoption is in early pilots rather than being system-wide mandates. Even on an aggressive timeline, most of the heavy lifting, including final rules, bank balance-sheet treatment, and cross-border corridor build-out, will occur in 2026, and realization is likely to extend beyond his second term. The most realistic outcome is not a clean swap of one system for another, but a multi-rail stack where stablecoins and tokenized deposits handle settlement in the background while cards and instant bank transfers remain the consumer touch points. In that world, Trump can credibly argue that he pushed the system toward crypto rails and away from a CBDC, but the “replacement” he promised will look more like a gradually rewired back end than a flag day where legacy rails disappear. At this stage, he is on track to influence how the next-generation stack is wired, rather than entirely replacing legacy rails in a single term. The scorecard today reads: policy momentum and live pilots, but no decisive break where the bulk of U.S. and global retail payments move onto crypto settlement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins just put in their cleanest rebound since September. Fresh figures show the non-$BTC market added roughly $156B–$158B in value over the last week, lifting total altcoin capitalization from about $1.41T on Nov. 6 to over $1.54T by Nov. 11. As data from CoinGecko shows, the total crypto market sits above $3.6T, with alt segments recovering more quickly than the headline implies. When breadth improves and volatility compresses, capital hunts high-convexity setups. In this tape, three names capture different parts of the opportunity set: PEPENODE's ($PEPENODE) gamified ‘mine-to-earn' presale, Maxi Doge's ($MAXI) high-beta meme-plus-staking flywheel, and Dogecoin's ($DOGE) liquid, exchange-everywhere anchor. For traders watching risk rotations, or just scouting the best meme coins, here's how each stacks up right now. The whitepaper lays out a virtual mining simulator where users assemble server rooms, acquire ‘miner nodes,' and earn rewards, turning passivity into gameplay that persists post-TGE. That design keeps holders active and gives the token something to do on day one. This si an underrated edge when rotations are fragile. Recent coverage pegs the raise above $2.1M, with a live token price at $0.0011408. For you, the appeal is simple: if alt breadth continues, low-float gamified assets tend to over-respond. This alone recommends $PEPENODE as one of the best altcoins to buy and most intriguing meme coins to hit the market. It leans hard into trader culture with staking and stage-based pricing to keep momentum visible. The presale raised over $3.9M+ as of this week's round-ups, helped by constant campaign cadence and a clear claim path at the end of distribution. That matters in a market where many retail flows want structure, not just slogans. On mechanics, the presale page displays staking rewards at 77%. The trade here is beta with an exit plan: capture the narrative legs while conditions favor memes, manage unlocks, and rotate into liquidity when needed. If alt breadth persists for another week, the token has the ingredients to keep trending, and post-launch, $MAXI looks even better. In $MAXI math, that means getting one step closer to retiring at 22. You can't talk memes without mentioning the original. Dogecoin ($DOGE) remains one of crypto's deepest, most liquid tickers, with CoinMarketCap showing a market cap near $27B and price at $0.1773 at the time of writing. For active accounts, that depth means tighter spreads, robust derivatives, and cleaner execution. That's useful when rotating out of presales or high-slippage names. Earlier this year, Reuters covered Grayscale's launch of a $DOGE trust aimed at accredited investors. This was a reminder that even jokey assets can secure ‘serious' wrappers when demand is persistent. Add the Musk-adjacent meme machine and global exchange coverage, and you've got a liquid proxy for meme risk when you don't want contract risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout the past year, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have emerged as the primary focus for a growing trend of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), particularly driven by favorable pro-crypto regulations worldwide. However, recent reports from Reuters indicate that this focus is beginning to shift towards less popular altcoins. This figure reflects a more than threefold increase from the previous year. Yet, as Bitcoin's value declines, these firms are increasingly turning to new tokens in hopes of achieving greater returns. In recent weeks, companies such as Greenlane, OceanPal, and Tharimmune have announced plans to acquire tokens like Berachain (BERA), Near protocol (NEAR), and Canton Coin (CC), respectively. Peter Chung, head of research at crypto-focused Presto Research, noted that while the initial hype surrounding DATs has diminished, there remains potential for a resurgence. In a recent interview with Reuters, an OceanPal representative stated that their acquisition of NEAR tokens was intended to leverage the asset's integrated artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Earlier in the year, many digital asset treasury companies traded at a premium to their crypto holdings as investors believed these firms could leverage credit to acquire more tokens. However, with Bitcoin's recent struggles and an influx of Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) imitators, some companies are beginning to falter. Retail investors, significant buyers of high-profile Bitcoin treasury companies, reportedly lost around $17 billion on these trades, according to estimates from Singapore-based 10x Research. Additionally, digital asset treasuries focusing on other leading cryptocurrencies are also facing challenges; ETHZilla and Forward Industries have recently approved share repurchases, a strategy typically employed to support share prices. Cristiano Ventricelli, vice president and senior analyst of digital assets at Moody's Ratings, cautioned that expanding into “exotic” and less liquid cryptocurrencies could significantly heighten risk. According to Ventricelli, when market conditions worsen, companies that invest in these assets face greater pressure on their equity. Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, also expressed concern that most digital asset treasury companies may ultimately trade at a discount to their digital assets.</p>
