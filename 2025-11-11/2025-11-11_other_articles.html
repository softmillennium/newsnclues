                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Collingswood, New Jersey -- New Jersey native and psychic medium Kym Durham didn't know what to expect when first stepping foot inside the Hurley Mansion for her first paranormal investigation there. But after repeated notifications from her ghost hunting gadgets and vibes from her ghost hunting team she was picking up, she can say it was a qualified success. She says, "Energy can't be destroyed. And that's how they communicate with us a lot through electrical devices." Her mother, Joan, founded Paranormal Investigations and Studies. This is the first time she'll investigate the Hurley Manion and Scottish Rite Auditorium in Collingswood, New Jersey. Her team includes her daughter, and they'll utilize tools to help speak to the departed. She says the beeping heard throughout the halls are a sure sign of a spirit trying to communicate. Kym says she felt Mr. Hurley himself upstairs, and auditorium workers from days long past downstairs. The gadgets going off on video and during her ghost hunting tour on this night alert to the presence of a paranormal anomaly by beeping when there is a sudden change in ambient temperature. They were at times going off in front of each group of startled ghost hunting fans. Needless to say, this won't the be last time Kym and her team hunt in the historic mansion. Save your spots for next Halloween if you dare! This is just an enjoyable evening where you come out and get into the swing of the season."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Magic, misogyny, and the origin of tarot. If you don't believe in psychics, that might be the best reason to see one. I do not “believe” in the afterlife, guardian angels, or that a deck of cards can predict my breakup cycle. I believe in the small and occasionally humiliating ways we try to understand ourselves. And after visiting three psychic mediums in the Twin Cities—Rachel, Nikki, and Lisa—I've come to believe that dismissing the whole practice says more about misogyny than about science. I didn't set out to test the practice for validity or expose frauds. I went in the way I approach any new experience: You get out what you put in. They're experts at reading energy, tone, and micro-expressions, and they spin your vague hints into something that feels like revelation. Over the past couple weeks, I saw three readers/healers: Rachel Dominguez from 3rd Eye Psychic Salon in Minneapolis (they don't do hair! I went in with two questions: What's next for my comedy career and why are all of my romantic relationships just emotional escape rooms? Rachel's shop looks like Stevie Nicks opened a Sephora, a black-and-pink bohemian salon smelling faintly of incense and conditioner. Magazines about shamans, portals, and oracles are scattered across a window ledge. She is dressed to match her décor—part rock star, part soothsayer. She shuffles her deck and asks me to cut it. I tell her about getting a huge compliment from a comic with clout, how it froze me up instead of motivating me. She tells me I'm losing the love for it, that I'm approaching comedy like work instead of play. “Take a shot of whiskey before you go up there. Loosen up.” (Later, I'll take a shot of Grey Goose at House of Comedy, and my set will go really well. Her reading becomes a mix of roast, pep talk, and creative intervention. “You're trying to be perfect instead of brave. Tap into your femininity—that's where the pain and absurdity live.” “That's good if you're a comic,” she says. Her kindness and warmth bridges the geographical gap, making me feel comfortable by establishing a familiarity in a matter of minutes. “You're holding back.”The phrase will follow me. All three psychics eventually say it, like a chorus of gentle ghosts: You're holding back. She lays out a full spread: The Tower (letting go of old ways), The Sun (joy, good fortune), and Death (not physical, but transformational). “You can't speed up the outcome,” she says. The Spirit told me how funny you are. And I'm not just saying that to get a good review!” she laughs. She tells me that humor, for me, is a form of armor, that I use jokes to cover vulnerability. “Instead of using humor or anger, let yourself feel the emotion underneath,” she says. But you don't have to keep fighting everyone and everything.” Her light critique of some of my character foibles strikes a chord without breaking any strings (no easy feat when dealing with me, as I can be a little stubborn and temperamental). That's who's playing right now,” she tells me. She reads oracle cards instead of tarot. She says she already set an intention the day before, and paid attention to everything on her way to meet me: songs she heard on the bus, found objects, even strangers' conversations. She guesses I am from a small town. Her diagnosis: I am putting up walls. “That's not good for comedy or relationships,” she says. “You're aligning with the energy of scarcity—you're attracting the same problems because you're afraid to ask for more.” Then she says something that sticks with me. “Stop entertaining people you don't like. Her last card, Justice, tells her that comedy can heal, that making people laugh is a way of restoring balance. By the end of my three readings, I realize they were all saying the same thing—not just about my love life or career, but about how I think and how I hide. “If you go see one, you're gullible,” my atheist roommate responds when I tell him what I've been up to. “Do you go to magic shows?” I ask. “Do you think people aren't entertained by an hourlong psychic reading about themselves?” I respond. People assume women go to psychics because they think ghosts are real. That's like saying men go to magic shows because they believe objects can levitate on their own. When men practice illusion, it becomes magic: top hats, rabbits, the power to make women disappear. When women practice intuition, it becomes witchcraft: hysteria, delusion, the power to make men uncomfortable, and, therefore, dangerous. A magician's trick is an illusion we agree to believe. The history of mediums goes back further than organized religion. It wasn't until the 19th century that mysticism returned to the public sphere through the Spiritualist movement, led by three sisters from Rochester, New York: Leah, Margaretta, and Catherine Fox. They trademarked themselves as professional mediums who could communicate with the dead.Eventually, the Fox sisters confessed it was all a hoax, but it was too late: by then, women across the country had found a new kind of agency. Mediumship gave them a way to earn money, speak publicly, and claim authority over unseen forces. Spiritualism also overlaps with abolitionism and the first-wave feminist movement. It was also one of the only professions where women could earn a living without a husband's permission. And because of that it was immediately treated with suspicion.Minnesota magician and comedian Derek Hughes agrees that the origins of magic, communal bonding, and fortune telling through tarot are intertwined. “Magicians guided the tribe to food and shelter.” When the leaders of the Spanish Inquisition burned magicians' books and tortured and killed magicians, some of their secrets survived, hidden in paintings. “Some people think those symbols became the tarot,” he says. When we dismiss tarot as “woo-woo nonsense,” often we're really mocking a language of intuition that women kept alive while the church and state tried to burn it. “A lot of people think what I do is fortune-telling. “It's about patterns—seeing what behaviors or beliefs aren't working.” The point of any psychic reading is not prophecy. Whether that's tarot, comedy, or therapy, it's the same job: helping people locate themselves in their own story. And in holding up a softened version of that mirror, you can finally see the truth you were avoiding without feeling judged. That's why a psychic reading works even if you don't believe in psychics. The holy idiot who risks humiliation to find transcendence. In tarot, The Fool is not an insult. It's the card of curiosity, risk, and beginner's mindset. And that's the beauty of seeing a psychic. Sometimes, you just need a stranger with a deck of cards to remind you that falling on your face is the only way to keep moving forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Storefront ad for the 2025 UFO Festival in Roswell, New Mexico. (JTA) — ROSWELL, New Mexico — If it weren't for an Ashkenazi Jew named Stanton T. Friedman, the world might have long ago forgotten what's come to be known simply as the “Roswell incident.” Instead, countless books, documentaries and made-for-TV dramas have explored the 1947 discovery of mysterious materials found on a New Mexico ranch that Friedman argued were the relics of extraterrestrials. And this dusty desert town has been transformed according to an unusual paradox: It's shaped by conspiracy theories, yet is home to virtually no Jews. Roswell's only synagogue, Congregation B'nai Israel, closed up and moved to Albuquerque five years ago. “They didn't have a rabbi and they only met twice a month, on Fridays,” said Leslie Lawner, who made the move with her husband in 2020, reducing Roswell's tiny Jewish population by two. “There was really nothing we could do for them.” The Lawners left behind a town that is largely defined by what happened in the summer of 1947, when local rancher W.W. “Mac” Brazen found rubber strips, tin foil, thick paper and other debris on his property and shared the material with Sheriff George Wilcox of Roswell. In 1987, Friedman — who died six years ago — told the New York Times that federal officials had engaged in a “cosmic Watergate” to cover up the truth. There's also a UFO-shaped McDonald's, along with a bug-eyed little green alien relaxing under an umbrella in front of the nearby Western Inn. proudly holding up the Dunkin Donuts marquee along Main Street. Not surprisingly, Martians are a common theme in Halloween displays here. In 1997, the Air Force — attempting to dispel rumors that had persisted for decades — released a 231-page report concluding that alien bodies recovered at the Roswell crash site weren't aliens at all, but dummies used in parachute tests. It also said that the “spacecraft” that had fallen to Earth on Brazen's ranch was really an Air Force balloon used in a top-secret program code-named Project Mogul to monitor the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests. President Donald Trump is a known skeptic of UFOs. In a town forged around the religion of aliens, Jewish life is virtually nonexistent. There aren't enough Jews here to make a minyan — let alone support a synagogue — and the few who did live here have mostly died off or moved away. Lawner and her husband Bob rarely attended services at Congregation B'nai Israel, located a block from their house at 8th and Washington, during their 27 years in Roswell. But Lawner did help develop a curriculum on Holocaust studies for Sidney Gutierrez Middle School, which she helped found and where she taught for 17 years. It was an area of inquiry that overlapped with one outlandish but persistent theory about the Roswell incident. Annie Jacobsen claims in her 2012 book, “Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base,” that just before the Roswell crash, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin recruited Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele — the infamous Auschwitz “angel of death” — to create “grotesque, child-size aviators” to pilot a plane in order to trigger widespread panic throughout the United States. An Orthodox Jewish rabbinical authority, Rabbi Pini Dunner of Beverly Hills, California, has called the Roswell incident “nonsense.” “Most people don't believe any of this, nor, for that matter, do we entertain the claims of those who maintain that the Apollo moon landings were all an elaborate hoax, or that Denver International Airport stands above an underground city that serves as a headquarters for the masonically inspired New World Order,” Dunner wrote in an online post. The question is: why would any intelligent person believe such nonsense to be true?” The Israeli-American physicist Avi Loeb, who runs a lab at Harvard University, argues that some objects and phenomena in space cannot be explained except as evidence of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb has emphasized the appeal of aliens and space exploration on Jewish grounds. “It is reasonable to imagine the absence of antisemitism in interstellar space,” he wrote earlier this year, noting that anything traveling from the other side of the Milky Way would have had to set out before there were Jews. The resulting frenzy has embroiled U.S. transportation officials and even Kim Kardashian. Factual or not, this past July, Roswell marked 78 years since the mysterious 1947 event, with an annual Roswell UFO Festival that lures thousands of tourists from all 50 states and beyond. Every year, sidewalk vendors do a brisk business selling funnel cakes, alien salt-and-pepper shakers and other trinkets, while tourists happily pay $5 each to visit the downtown International UFO Museum and Research Center. “These exhibits are designed not to convince anyone to believe one way or another about their subjects,” says a sign at the museum's entrance. Local merchants don't seem to care much what really transpired that night in 1947. They're just grateful for all the desperately needed cash this festival generates. “Roswell didn't have a tourist industry and one of my friends was telling me about this UFO stuff. We live out in the middle of the desert, and without a lot of bright lights, at night you can see a lot.” Added Todd Wildermuth, Roswell's public information officer: “I don't have an opinion about it. I haven't really given it any deep thought.” Roswell is certainly not the kind of place to visit if you don't like reptiles and other poisonous creatures. At the local Home Depot, two of the biggest-selling items, along with plywood and barbecue grills, are Harris Scorpion Killer and Snake-A-Way pellets. These days, only a handful of Jews remain in Roswell. “The building was deteriorating and there was no one within the group who knew how to keep it up,” said Judy Stubbs, B'nai Israel's former treasurer. The community's Torah, meanwhile, has found a new home at Congregation Nahalat Shalom in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city and home to many of the state's estimated 25,000 Jews. In 2018, Roswell's dwindling Jewish community agreed to “indefinitely loan” Nahalat Shalom the sacred scroll, which had been rescued from a small town in Czechoslovakia by the Karnowsky family during World War II. In 2018, Nahalat Shalom's spiritual leader, Rabbi Min Kantrowitz, led a special Simchat Torah dedication service in the presence of Kathryn Karnowsky and her Jewish friends from Roswell. “My husband is from a ranching family with longtime roots in this area, and all of their ranch neighbors strongly believe it is not a hoax,” said Liakos. Both of us are scientists, and we're not shrugging it off as ridiculous.” Stubbs, a longtime resident of Roswell and former city council member, agrees with her friend. “People ask me that all the time,” said Stubbs, who remains active in politics. “With all the continued hype, I believe something must have happened.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aliens continue to capture widespread imagination — including that of Harvard professor Avi Loeb. ROSWELL, New Mexico — If it weren't for an Ashkenazi Jew named Stanton T. Friedman, the world might have long ago forgotten what's come to be known simply as the “Roswell incident.” Instead, countless books, documentaries and made-for-TV dramas have explored the 1947 discovery of mysterious materials found on a New Mexico ranch that Friedman argued were the relics of extraterrestrials. And this dusty desert town has been transformed according to an unusual paradox: It's shaped by conspiracy theories, yet is home to virtually no Jews. Roswell's only synagogue, Congregation B'nai Israel, closed up and moved to Albuquerque five years ago. “They didn't have a rabbi and they only met twice a month, on Fridays,” said Leslie Lawner, who made the move with her husband in 2020, reducing Roswell's tiny Jewish population by two. A granite monument in front of the Chaves County Courthouse in Roswell, New Mexico, displays the Ten Commandments and a Star of David. The Lawners left behind a town that is largely defined by what happened in the summer of 1947, when local rancher W.W. “Mac” Brazen found rubber strips, tin foil, thick paper and other debris on his property and shared the material with Sheriff George Wilcox of Roswell. In 1987, Friedman — who died six years ago — told the New York Times that federal officials had engaged in a “cosmic Watergate” to cover up the truth. proudly holding up the Dunkin Donuts marquee along Main Street. Not surprisingly, Martians are a common theme in Halloween displays here. In 1997, the Air Force — attempting to dispel rumors that had persisted for decades — released a 231-page report concluding that alien bodies recovered at the Roswell crash site weren't aliens at all, but dummies used in parachute tests. It also said that the “spacecraft” that had fallen to Earth on Brazen's ranch was really an Air Force balloon used in a top-secret program code-named Project Mogul to monitor the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests. In a town forged around the religion of aliens, Jewish life is virtually nonexistent. There aren't enough Jews here to make a minyan — let alone support a synagogue — and the few who did live here have mostly died off or moved away. Lawner and her husband Bob rarely attended services at Congregation B'nai Israel, located a block from their house at 8th and Washington, during their 27 years in Roswell. But Lawner did help develop a curriculum on Holocaust studies for Sidney Gutierrez Middle School, which she helped found and where she taught for 17 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are many reasons why The CW's Supernatural lasted for a historic 15 seasons. However, the show's biggest storytelling trick was taking a somewhat dated Monster-of-the-Week approach as a foundation and infusing it with key moments of character development to connect the ever-expanding mythology. Supernatural turned this perceived weakness into its strength, nearly eliminating episodes that felt like filler. Each Monster-of-the-Week entry established the lore that the hunting universe of Sam and Dean Winchester was built upon. Especially early in the series, each hunt felt like its own campfire tale, episodes that viewers could follow and understand if it were their first time catching the show. Why these episodes shine and stand out more than filler is that they also give the audience a look into Sam and Dean on a deeper level, as most of the hunts serve to explore parts of their characters and flesh out their families' backstory. The monsters and the lore behind them are an essential part of their family history, working to change the Monster-of-the-Week episodes into a look into their everyday life since childhood. Two brothers driving across the back roads of America, chasing things that go bump in the night. Early episodes of Supernatural played out very much like an old-school horror anthology TV series. The first few entries tackled urban legends, folklore and ghost stories that fans were familiar with. The trick was that these early hunts were tied to and became a reflection of Sam and Dean's lives. What at first seemed like simple Monster-of-the-Week episodes slowly became revelations into the characters themselves. What would be considered filler from other series became essential viewing for fans seeking insight into the Winchesters. Every case was a peak behind the curtain. Before Supernatural transformed into cosmic battles and larger storyline territory in later seasons, the series gave itself and viewers time to breathe and take in the journey. The show was more about how hunting changes a person and what it means to live on the road. This gave Supernatural the building blocks to seamlessly blend episodic storytelling with standalone episodes in a way that made it hard to separate the two. By doing this, the pacing never felt off. Sometimes, a regular hunt can help the narrative dust settle by sprinkling in bits of the overarching plot. The emotional throughline of those so-called filler episodes is what helped define Supernatural. A viewer could tune in for one episode and get a satisfying story, but fans who followed every week could feel how much these smaller encounters built up. Even when Sam and Dean were in situations that didn't seem connected to the main story, it was used to deepen the audience's understanding of the two leads. In urban legend-focused episodes such as season one's "Bloody Mary," the ghost only targets those with hidden guilt. While Supernatural generally kept the horror framework, the Monster-of-the-Week focus allowed writers to experiment with tone. This could lead to more playful, meta and dark episodes, such as "Mystery Spot." That willingness to bend its own rules kept the series fresh, even after hundreds of episodes. Most series that try to blend emotional horror with self-aware humor end up feeling disjointed, but Supernatural had the advantage of two grounded leads and a flexible format. When the more cosmic-oriented and biblical storylines, even introducing God, were introduced in Season 4, suddenly everything changed for the Winchesters. Once the angels were introduced, Supernatural could have fallen into the trap that dooms a lot of genre TV series by having overarching plots that crush the previous plots under their narrative weight. Even during the apocalypse seasons, the show found a way to get Sam and Dean back on the road for a good old-fashioned hunt, hunts that remained relevant and believable in the sense that they didn't feel like storyline breaks. It became a comfort watch, an episode fans knew that was going to feel familiar, but never boring even though the stakes got higher as the series went on, Supernatural knew when to go back to basics. The writers had mastered that ebb and flow. The series would present a massive, world-shattering confrontation and follow it up with a classic throwback episode that allowed Sam and Dean to digest the major events on a smaller scale. The Monster-of-the-Week episodes felt organic and never gimmicky because that was their life. The tonal flexibility and adherence to the format that built their fanbase are why Supernatural endured, even amid its harsh realities upon rewatch. When Supernatural hit its final stretch of seasons, the series had grown into a phenomenon that few could have predicted. Even when God himself became a character, the show didn't lose sight of what made people fall in love with it in the first place. No matter how vast and epic the storylines were, Supernatural always brought it back to its intimate and emotional core. Despite all the battles with Angels, Demons and Leviathans, it is a typical Monster-of-the-Week hunt that takes his life, and that's about as fitting as it gets. It's truly a brilliant approach and accomplishment. Supernatural took what was typically seen and dismissed as filler and turned it into its storytelling backbone. Each hunt reflected how far Sam and Dean had come. The true lesson here may be that Supernatural found historical success not by reinventing itself or chasing trends, but by staying true to its formula.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Does a Sasquatch live among us in Centre County? Science has thus far been inconclusive, but believers may very well be onto something. A month ago, on October 4, 2025, an unnamed witness, deemed “sincere and very credible” by the authorities on Bigfoot sightings, claims he saw one only 25 miles from Penn State's campus. This spotting places a third Bigfoot sighting in Centre County in only six years, with the earlier two only 25 miles away; a feasible range for a cryptid to roam. How do we know it's not right behind us? The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, also known as the BFRO, has done in-depth research and fact-checking on all of these reports and thousands more across America and the world. Established in 1995, the organization is determined to compile and collate reports in one central database, to, hopefully, truly answer the question of Bigfoot. The witness, left unnamed in BFRO's report for his privacy, is a retired civil engineer, Air Force veteran, and an avid hunter of 50+ years. Returning to his home in Western Pennsylvania from a trip with his wife in a Dodge Ram truck, the witness says he was driving around 77 mph with a Subaru Crosstrek around 165 yards in front of him. Then, he says, he saw what he initially assumed to be a man begin to cross the road directly in front of the Subaru. Startled, he continued to observe, slowly realizing that this thing could not be a human. Nothing quick or jerky like a sprinter. Once at a red light, the witness exited his truck and moved to the car, but a green light flashed and the Subaru sped away, without a word. Perhaps they were so terrified of the creature that passed before them that they ran off, for fear of exposure? On BFRO's website, there are two more sightings, both only 20 miles from the one on October 4 near Gamelands 333 and Fisherman's Paradise— spots significantly closer to Penn State campus. One, which reportedly occurred on February 19, 2025, to a Penn State student, was much more action-packed than even the one on I-80. He had set off a call to attract his prey, which could potentially account for his inevitable encounter. The dreadful feeling increased, and he decided to leave the area and head back to his car. He stopped at some point, with his back to a creek, and turned with his flashlight, seeing a black silhouette disappear into the brush. He escaped with clean hands that time, but returned to the area later on and had another experience. As he pushed on, he began to hear movement in the brush, which seemed to be following him. He pointed his flashlight all over the place, eventually landing on another dark figure disappearing as quickly as he had found it. Information from these two events, along with a third dated in 2019, all align in their descriptions. We may very well have a Bigfoot on our hands, hiding masterfully in the shadows of the wilderness around our campus. For the nonbelievers, this information may not mean much. But, it should be acknowledged that seeing is believing. Some may discredit his sightings, perhaps due to age (he was at least 60, if not older), or the distance of the encounter. But, as an avid hunter of over half a century, it can be assumed he has “good eyes”. The BFRO has put a significant amount of energy into these sightings and their investigations, which you can read here. It may be easier to dismiss all of this, of course, or just move on. But someone needs to ask the questions, don't they? All hate mail goes to: [email protected] Penn State's losing streak was extended to six games on Saturday. Wear an actual coat, it's cool. Hit up NRT this weekend after all those midterms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The horrific murder of “Little Girl Blue” is among more than 50 Birmingham cold cases that have been highlighted by a new crime map revealing 1,000 unsolved murders. This exclusive list was compiled from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, supported by research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives. Read more: Calls for tougher punishment after teen's cruel actions caught on doorbell camera Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers with no apparent motive.Included in the files is the tragic case of eight-year-old Helen Bailey. Her body was discovered in an overgrown parcel of land known locally as “The Magic Wood”, close to her family's home in Great Barr, Birmingham. The case has never been solved, although a man confessed to the crime, only to later claim he had lied in the hope of “making himself look interesting” to a psychiatric hospital. Also among more than 50 Birmingham cases highlighted in the map is the shocking murder of 15-year-old Jacqueline Thomas, whose body was found a week after she went missing in 1961. The teenager had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Other cases include Intaz Ali, who died from multiple stab wounds at his Ladywood home in 1974, and Douglas Jones, who was strangled to death at his flat in Perry Barr. The online map has been produced to support the special publication Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders Vol II: Midnight Stalkers. It seeks to re-examine cold cases that have been held in the files of police forces nationwide, in some cases for decades.The publication includes a full timeline of 1,000 unsolved murders, dating from the pre-war period to the last decade, alongside more than 20 in-depth features. Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel Harper and Alice Pittman, who were both strangled during the wartime blackout. Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.You can purchase a copy of Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders Vol II: Midnight Stalkers in newsagents or by following the link to our online shop.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy McCarthy is an Editor at PEOPLE. Her work has appeared at Eater, Vox, Texas Monthly, Salon, and more publications. Kim Kardashian isn't happy with her family's team of psychics. In a TikTok recap of mom Kris Jenner's star-studded 70th birthday blowout, Kardashian, 45, unloaded on the psychics who she says told her she would pass the bar exam. "All of the f--king psychics that we have met with, and that we're obsessed with, are all f–king full of s---,” Kardashian said in the short clip, which shows the All's Fair actress speaking into her phone as a makeup artist works on her eye look. “They all collectively, maybe 4 of them, have told me I was gonna pass the bar, so they're all full pathological liars, don't believe anything they say,” Kardashian continued. She announced the results in an Instagram post on Saturday, Nov. 8. "Well...I'm not a lawyer yet, I just play a very well-dressed one on TV," she wrote. Kardashian has been studying law since at least 2019, when she accepted an apprenticeship at a San Francisco law firm, which in her home state of California is a viable alternative to attending law school. In 2021, she shared that she had passed the “baby bar,” or the First-Year Law Student's Examination, on her fourth try. "OMFGGGG I PASSED THE BABY BAR EXAM!!!!" For anyone who doesn't know my law school journey, know this wasn't easy or handed to me." She's also been active in criminal justice reform advocacy, successfully advocating for the release of Dawn Jackson, a New Jersey woman who was imprisoned for 25 years years for killing her abusive step-grandfather. Phil Murphy commuted Jackson's sentence, and said that Kardashian deserved "enormous credit" for her work on Jackson's behalf. "Six years ago, I embarked on an unconventional path to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer,” she wrote on Instagram. In a February episode of The Kardashians, Kim shared that she “always” hears the same message from her father, the late Robert Kardashian Sr., when she seeks spiritual guidance from mediums.

In 2019, Kardashian invited Theresa Caputo, star of the reality TV series Long Island Medium, to her Calabasas home so that Caputo could perform a personal reading for Kardashian and her sister, Khloé. Though Kardashian didn't share what Caputo told her, she did say that the experience was “probably one of the best days of my life.”</p>
