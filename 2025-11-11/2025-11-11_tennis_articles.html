                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not only is the Spaniard within touching distance of reclaiming ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours, but he is also chasing his first title at the prestigious season finale, with which he would enter elite company. 1, joining the likes of fellow ATP No. 1 Club members Jannik Sinner, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Pete Sampras. It is a distinction that has long symbolised both dominance and endurance — the mark of a player capable of finishing the season at the top, and proving it against the very best. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings. The four players who have triumphed at the season finale while as World No. 1 at least three times — Djokovic, Federer, Sampras and Lendl — also boast the most overall weeks spent at No. 1 for a total of 1,294 weeks, underlining how exclusive that territory is. It's a reminder that this achievement belongs firmly to the game's elite. Federer and Djokovic have embodied that standard over the past two decades. Federer's three titles as World No. 1 showcased his indoor mastery and sustained excellence during the mid-2000s, while Djokovic's record-setting forays — including four as No. Andy Murray's 2016 triumph remains one of the most emotional chapters in Nitto ATP Finals history, as his victory over Djokovic in the title match sealed his Year-End No. 1 finish for the first and only time in front of an adoring London crowd. For Alcaraz, unbeaten so far in Jimmy Connors Group after wins against Alex de Minaur and Taylor Fritz, the challenge now is to turn opportunity into history. It would also add a major milestone to his fast-growing resume, placing him alongside icons who have ended their seasons on top of the sport. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Away from tennis, Ons Jabeur announced her pregnancy, launched a youth foundation and even earned a motorcycle license. The critical question in this one-on-one interview has been raised: When will she return from her now-four-month hiatus? And through the sound of grunts and the thumping of balls, Ons Jabeur cracked a coy smile. Six days later, the reason behind that Mona Lisa smile became clear. Jabeur and her husband, Karim Kamoun, are expecting a son next April, she announced in an Instagram post Monday. “Took a little break to reset and recharge,” Jabeur wrote. “Turns out, we've been planning the cutest comeback ever. A post shared by Ons Jabeur  أنس جابر (@onsjabeur) Jabeur stepped away from tennis this summer after retiring in the first round at Wimbledon against Viktoriya Tomova. She was 15-15 for the year and struggled with a number of injuries. It's nice to spend time with my family and discover myself outside the tennis courts. And she finally achieved this bucket-list item: I've got a helmet, all the gear. “Really, I just want to look cool on a motorcycle.” But there's a lot more substance to Jabeur's sabbatical. Her current focus is a new tennis academy scheduled to open in Dubai by the end of the year. She'll be there for the next few months, making sure operations are smooth. “I want to see more Middle East players on the Tour, so Dubai was the right place to open,” she said. “I want to offer these things so that their minds can be easy.” A post shared by Ons Jabeur Academy (@onsjabeuracademy) 2, Jabeur is famously the first Arab and African to achieve so many firsts in professional tennis. She reached 3-of-5 Grand Slam finals in a remarkable run from 2022-23. But as the 2025 season progressed, Jabeur knew a break was needed. “Mentally I was not feeling well at all,” she said. I was not enjoying playing to be honest with you. In Riyadh, Jabeur said all of her injuries have healed sufficiently, and that she hasn't picked up a racquet and played a single point in more than four months. “I'm not the kind of person that goes crazy if I don't hit a ball,” she said. I'll be in Dubai as long as it takes, maybe seeing the kids practice will give me back the motivation to come back.” Jabeur is the most recent player to leave the game to become a mother, following Naomi Osaka, Elina Svitolina and Belinda Bencic, among others. Jabeur would do well to emulate Bencic's return path. After giving birth to daughter Bella in April 2024, Bencic returned to the court six months later, playing two ITF W75s and a WTA 125 in December. After completing her season a few weeks ago in Hong Kong, Bencic rose all the way to No. I don't know the experience of giving birth, how it will be. “If mentally I am ready to come back, anything can happen.” Away from tennis, Ons Jabeur announced her pregnancy, launched a youth foundation and even earned a motorcycle license.</p>
