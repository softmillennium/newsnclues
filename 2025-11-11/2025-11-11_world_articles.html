                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are demanding an extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans set to expire at end of year As House Republican leaders move to hold a vote on legislation to reopen the US government, top Democrats vowed on Tuesday to oppose the bill for not addressing their demand for more healthcare funding. Democrats have for weeks demanded that any measure to fund the government include an extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans, which were created under Joe Biden and due to expire at the end of the year, sending premiums for enrollees higher. With Donald Trump's encouragement, Congress's Republican leaders refused, sparking a spending standoff that resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. The Senate passed that legislation on Monday evening, and the House of Representatives is expected consider it beginning on Wednesday afternoon. “No matter what comes over to us from the United States Senate to the House of Representatives at some point this week, our position as House Democrats has been crystal clear: we will sit down with any Republicans, anytime, anyplace, anywhere, in order to find a bipartisan path forward, but we're not down with their ‘my way or the highway' approach to governance that's failed the American people,” he said. “While New Dems always seek common ground, our coalition remains united in opposition to legislation that sacrifices the wellbeing of the constituents we're sworn to serve,” chair Brad Schneider said. With a 219-member majority with full attendance, he can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no. Maine's Jared Golden, who last week announced he would not seek another term representing a district that voted for Trump last year, was the only Democrat in September to vote for a Republican funding bill that did not extend the tax credit. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, whose Washington state district is similarly friendly to the president, also expressed her support for that bill. Both lawmakers' offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how they would vote on the Senate's compromise. All Republicans supported the measure's passage except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office. Progressive organizations who backed Schumer's strategy during the shutdown have now turned on him for allowing the compromise to come together. Indivisible announced plans to support Democratic candidates in primaries who oppose Schumer remaining as the party's leader, and MoveOn joined in the calls for him to bow out. “It is time for Senator Schumer to step aside as minority leader to make room for those who are willing to fight fire with fire when the basic needs of working people are on the line,” MoveOn Political Action's executive director, Katie Bethell, said.</p>

We speak to The American Prospect's David Dayen about what could be the end to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, after seven Democratic Senators and one independent struck a deal with Republicans to pass a short-term government funding bill. Calls are now growing for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now! AMY GOODMAN: The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has entered its 42nd day, but it could soon end after seven Democratic senators and one Independent joined Republicans to pass a short-term government funding bill that now goes to the House. The bill does not include an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies, which had been a key demand for Democratic lawmakers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has agreed to a separate vote on extending the subsidies. Some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups are now calling for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to resign his position as minority leader. While Schumer voted against the bill, he's facing mounting criticism. Democratic Congressman Ro Kanna said, quote, “Senator Schumer's no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Kanna asked. Meanwhile, Congressmember Delia Ramirez said, quote, “Eight Democrats caving to empty promises is an indefensible leadership failure. We're joined now by David Dayen, Executive Editor of The American Prospect. Can you talk, David, about what exactly the senators who have agreed to avoiding getting rid of a filibuster — getting rid of the filibuster by getting that 60-40 vote, what they've agreed to, and what they haven't agreed to, and what happens next? DAVID DAYEN: Well, they didn't agree to too much. And there's no reason to believe that that won't happen again during this promised vote down the road. There is three of the 12 appropriations bills that were negotiated in a bipartisan fashion. They will pass for a full year in this bill, along with a continuing resolution to fund the other programs of the government through January 30, and there is a prohibition on the administration firing federal employees. And so, Trump is going to get a bill and sign it for appropriations to fund the government, but he still could very easily not fund whatever he so chooses under this agreement. Section 120 of the continuing resolution says that no money appropriated during this continuing resolution can be used to fire federal workers. And indeed, the federal workers who were let go during the shutdown must be reinstated with full back pay. So, that's an example that we have the ability, as Congress, to reassert itself as an institution and use the power of the purse to say, “Trump, you can't continue to unilaterally put forward your prerogatives.” The problem is, they just didn't do it for anything else and therefore were making an agreement — Democrats are making an agreement with someone who has shown an ability and an eagerness not to honor that agreement. And I think that is one of the fundamental problems with this deal. DAVID DAYEN: Yeah, I think what frustrates a lot of Democrats is that Donald Trump and the Republicans were being blamed for all of this chaos. People don't really understand when, in a situation where the Democrats seemed to be winning the politics of the shutdown, when Donald Trump was kind of flailing and asking for an end to the filibuster, which, I think, long-term, would've been good for the country, why would you end this now? Especially when if this is what you get after 42 days, it calls into question why you even put the shutdown forward to begin with. But on the issue of extending health insurance benefits, while Thune says he's going to take that as a separate vote – of course, they can vote it down — the House speaker, Johnson, has not said necessarily that he would do that. So, what do you expect would happen — if that vote were taken in the House, if in fact, this deal gets approved by the House, what do you think would happen? And then, talk about the money Trump wants to disburse. Well, the fact that Speaker Johnson hasn't committed to holding a vote whatsoever just shows you how worthless the ask of a vote in the Senate really was. And again, Republicans already voted down a one-year extension of the healthcare subsidies yesterday. So, I don't know what that really gets you. As far as what Trump wants to do, his idea is that these enhanced subsidies, which are about $35 billion annually, they're not trillions of dollars, that that money would go directly to individuals to then have to purchase health insurance. So, tell me exactly how this is any different than the subsidies lowering the cost of a premium? What I believe Trump wants to do is allow individuals to buy essentially junk insurance that doesn't really work. It takes us back to a time before the Affordable Care Act, when your insurance was something, when you tried to use it, you had to basically cross your fingers whether or not it would provide any benefit to you or not. AMY GOODMAN: David Dayen, if you could talk about this call for Schumer to step down as Senate Minority Leader. Now, he voted against the deal, but some are alleging he actually, behind the scenes, was supporting those, like Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and the other senators, in voting for it. And then, if you could comment on Jeanne Shaheen, who seems to be the leader of the group of eight, seven Dems and an Independent. We've reported that Minority Leader Schumer was in constant contact with these eight Democrats who were negotiating an end to the shutdown. I think it's kind of an insult to our intelligence for him to say, “Oh, I had no idea what was going on.” Only one of two things are true in that instance. And so, I don't think either scenario looks very good for Chuck Schumer, and I think that's why a number of Democratic groups as well as members of the House have said that he should step down. And we will see if they end up taking that step. So far, no senator has come out and said they want Schumer to go. She is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. And she seems more interested in her parochial work product to have these appropriations bills pass into law than the signature policy that Democrats have advanced over the last 20 years, which is the Affordable Care Act. DAVID DAYEN: Yeah, we're here all over again on January 30, and there are still nine appropriations bills that will need to be passed at that time. And now that Democrats have kind of shown their hand, that they are a divided caucus on this matter, and that they have a number of members who are all too happy to just move on, I think it's going to be difficult to hold together the caucus to get any other concessions in that timeframe. But one thing I would like to see in that final deal is some more guardrails and safeguards against Donald Trump doing what he's done all year, which is withhold funds, rescind funds, dismantle agencies. Adelita Grijalva, the Congressmember Elect who represents more than 800,000 people in the greater Tucson area has not been seated yet, to the shock of many, even Republicans, not to mention Democrats. If the House reconvenes, so he could've done it anyway, will Johnson have to seat her? DAVID DAYEN: Speaker Johnson has said he will seat Adelita Grijalva. So, what that means is that there will then be 218 votes on a discharge petition to release the Epstein Files. That means it gets an automatic vote on the House floor, and I would expect that to happen rather quickly after she is sworn in. AMY GOODMAN: And that comes as the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jamie Raskin says, in speaking to a whistleblower, Ghislaine Maxwell, the Epstein co-conspirator jailed for 20 years, is seeking a commutation from Trump, and in the meantime, is getting concierge treatment at a minimum-security prison that she's been moved to after meeting with Trump's former personal attorney. David Dayen, I want to thank you for being with us, Executive Editor of The American Prospect. Coming up, we go to Chicago, where Juan is, but also where protestors are, who've denounced federal immigration agents for dragging a daycare teacher out of a Spanish immersion school in front of the pre-K students and parents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The regime of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, meanwhile, announced what it called a “massive deployment” of land, sea, air, river and missile forces, as well as civilian militia, to counter the US naval presence off its coast. Donald Trump has sought to justify the massive military buildup as part of his “war on drugs”, targeting traffickers allegedly smuggling narcotics through Caribbean and Pacific waters. That campaign has included airstrikes on boats that have so far killed at least 76 people in South American waters since September. Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement released by the US navy that the arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford, with “more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft aboard”, will “bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities” in the region. Many analysts see the attacks on boats and the growing military buildup as a way to pressure Maduro to step down after stealing last year's election. On Tuesday, before the US navy confirmed the carrier's arrival, the Venezuelan regime announced a new phase of its military deployment against what it called the US “imperial threats”, with state television broadcasting footage of military leaders giving speeches across several states. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is negotiating a deal with Trump to cut tariffs on Brazilian imports by more than 50%, also avoided any direct mention of Washington. He said: “We are a zone of peace. The problem in Venezuela is a political one, and it must be resolved through politics.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chicago is giving the US “a stellar example of how to fight back against these xenophobic pogroms,” said one organizer. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani won a brilliantly executed mayoral race against sexual harasser and primary loser Andrew Cuomo. In Chicago, a federal judge called out Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino for lying during a deposition, and again ordered ICE agents to limit their use of force in the Chicagoland area. When you're living in a state of emergency — hypervigilant and raging against injustice — feelings of bitterness, rage, grief, and anxiety can feel all-consuming. More than 3,000 people have been abducted by ICE across Chicagoland since early September. As journalist Sarah Lazare recently wrote on social media, “[I] don't want to downplay the harm [or] make it seem like a fair fight. But in neighborhoods across the city, ICE is getting chased by people blowing whistles and shouting. People are running TOWARD ICE to protect neighbors.” So many Chicagoans are not only practicing vigilance, but rushing toward ICE agents, thrusting themselves into dangerous situations — sometimes, in organized deployments, and sometimes, in their pajamas, as they run out of their homes because whistles are being blown. There are moments when we are able to deter or interrupt federal agents, or successfully alert our targeted neighbors, allowing them to evade ICE. But far too often, we arrive in the wake of an abduction, and are left trying to piece together what happened, or find ourselves witnessing something awful, wholly unable to intercede. Those moments of witnessing may be the worst — when ICE agents, who are usually gone before we arrive, are still present, with our captured neighbors in their grasp, and we're unable to do a goddamn thing about it, except document the harm being done. (Documenting such moments is profoundly important, and also excruciating.) Earlier this week, after one of those moments, I felt like a hole had opened up inside my chest, and it was swallowing up everything I might think or know how to do. I was sputtering inside and had nothing to offer. I felt terrible about that sudden fit of ineptitude. I wasn't the young woman asking one of my friends what she should do now, because one of those men was her father. I was just a person, wounded by the inhumanity of other people. I was reeling, devastated, and so frustrated with myself. If I had fallen and scraped my knee during that incident with ICE, I wouldn't have thought twice about taking the time to clean and bandage my wound, once the situation was over. Someone urged me to slow down and take care of myself. So, here is my attempt to pay it forward. People who feel frozen or stuck, or who have no idea how they would respond to such an onslaught, are getting a sense of what they're made of. My friend William*, an undocumented organizer in New York, has been forced to keep a lower profile in recent months to avoid being kidnapped and deported. While grappling with those limitations, William told me he has been heartened by our actions in Chicago. “In the midst of an immigrant pogrom, the Democratic Party is still largely divided over whether it should respond forcefully to all this brutality,” he told me. “But what we are seeing in Chicago — and thankfully in other parts of the country — is that regular people have stepped up to confront these ICE raids, family separations, and kidnappings. “We see this every day in Chicago, which is currently giving the nation a stellar example of how to fight back against these xenophobic pogroms.” Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network, praised the long-term organizing that helped Chicagoans prepare for this moment. “For years, the people of Chicago and surrounding communities have fought to limit ICE's reach,” Silky told me. “Despite the federal government's repeated efforts to increase deportations and expand detention in the region, Chicago organizers have adapted their strategies to throw a wrench in ICE's plans, playing one of the most successful games of whack-a-mole against detention while advocating for everyone — including immigrants encountering the criminal legal system.” While the scope and scale of ICE's tactics have changed, Silky noted that Chicagoans have not wavered in their resolve. My friend Mariame Kaba, who organized in Chicago for many years before returning to New York City, also praised Chicago's organizing as an example for other cities. “The regime wants all of us afraid,” Mariame told me. Instead, what we are currently seeing in Chicago is that solidarity can overcome fear and can give people the courage and tenacity to fight for each other.” Mariame emphasized that Chicagoans are helping to light a path forward in this moment. “Faced with unrelenting state violence, Chicagoans have refused to be cowed. I am honored to be part of that refusal, and to think and dream alongside people like my friend Olly Costello, an artist and activist I have worked with many times over the years, and who I am steadily encountering in the streets as our rapid response work plays out. Olly is no stranger to the painful feelings I've described — the sense of defeat that can creep in when our best efforts cannot prevent a dreaded outcome. “There are days when getting out on my bike with my little plastic whistle and safety vest feels futile,” they told me. Then, Olly reminded me of my own words: “What we have is each other and our will to remake the world.” “Having each other is no small feat,” Olly said. “When the raids hit, and I see my community out en masse, I feel myself transformed by the bravery, innovation and determination of my neighbors to keep each other safe and defend our shared belonging.” Olly reminded me of the creativity and ingenuity we have brought to this fight. “We are building new infrastructure, creating warning systems to reduce abductions, sharing resources to support families with missing loved ones, and turning toward each other in ways I have not yet experienced,” they said. Gabe Gonzalez, an organizer with Protect Rogers Park, hopes that people around the country recognize that if this kind of infrastructure doesn't exist yet in their communities, it can be built. “I think the most important lesson from Chicago right now is that anyone can do this and everyone should do this,” Gabe told me. Please, hang onto those words, whatever your something might be, because it all matters. As Mariame told me, “I am filled with gratitude for everyone fighting against ICE and this regime in all the ways that they can: blowing whistles, patrolling alleys, buying out vendor carts, filming ICE, protesting detention centers, engaging in mutual aid, documenting the violence, walking other people's children to and from school and so much more. While this is a challenging time, Chicagoans are facing it with profound courage and sustained action. I keep using the word “ecosystem” to describe the emerging and enduring resistance in our city, because I don't think there's a better way to describe it. So, if you're hurting, struggling, or sputtering inside right now, I want you to take a moment to see what I see. I see you brave and beautiful in your cars, tailing ICE vehicles. I see you defending each other in the face of repression. I see you singing in the street, on a chilly Monday night, holding a lighted message that reads “RESIST ICE.” I see you gathering, hundreds at a time, to learn, to keep watch, and bare your teeth. I thought I knew what it meant to love Chicago — to feel something settle inside of me when I saw her skyline from the expressway, or her lights from the window of an airplane, after crossing the cloud line. And I believe we can build a new life in this moment — something we can keep, that will also keep us. As my friend Olly said, “I am so grateful for us all, and when this violence is over, I hope our togetherness never ends.” *William's name has been changed to protect his identity and safety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union and the Council of Europe are facing a lack of resources to organize, at Kiev's request, a "tribunal against Russia," as the United States refuse to continue financing Ukraine, Euronews TV channel reports. The Council of Europe has estimated that the project would require about €75 million per year, not including rental and security costs. The EU itself would need to contribute €10 million annually to the project, the channel adds. It is unclear whether they are willing to fund the tribunal project. A Council of Europe representative told Euronews that negotiations with member states are ongoing but declined to provide further details. The channel has not yet received any clarifications from Washington regarding the US role in the initiative. European sponsors fear that financing the tribunal could become increasingly challenging as the US continues to distance itself from international organizations. Earlier, US President Donald Trump announced that the United States would no longer allocate funds for Ukraine. Commenting on the decision, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that these international structures and the so-called experts "deliberately adopt an entirely one-sided, unconstructive stance and are not ready to look at reality." He reminded that the same experts "remained silent since 2014, when the Kiev regime sent tanks" against their own citizens who did not accept the change of power in the country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>East Room used by first lady set to be removed as part of president's White House renovation Donald Trump has appeared to confirm the first lady was initially opposed to his plans to build a ballroom for 1,000 people at the White House because she “loved her little, tiny office”. Earlier this year it was reported that Melania Trump had distanced herself from her husband's plans and questioned the project. Some sections of that part of the building are 100 years old and have traditionally been where the first lady located their offices and staff. Two former Democratic Party occupants of the East Wing, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, are among those critics of the ballroom, which is being built with $300m from private corporate donors including Apple, Amazon, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft and Google. “She loved her little, tiny office,” Mr Trump said. The president said there had been many previous alterations to the East Room, which he said was “a poor, sad sight”. He added: “Just so you understand, the East Wing sounds good. Mr Trump has pointed out the East Room can only accommodate 200 people and that events such as state dinners are held outside under tents. Speaking recently on CBS's The Late Show, Ms Clinton told host Stephen Colbert: “What I will remind people is that house is not our house. She added: “We always felt it was the people's house.” Ms Clinton said of Mr Trump's plans: “It's not his house. In a segment on universities, Mr Trump hailed the number of Chinese students who come to America and suggested Chinese immigration benefitted the US. Mr Trump replied: “What, you think the French are better? We've had a lot of problems with the French.” He added: “We get taxed very unfairly on our technology with, you know, they put 25 per cent taxes on American products.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Timur Mindich, one of President Volodymyr Zelensky's closest associates, was among the seven people charged as part of a major corruption probe, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) announced on Nov. 11. According to the Anti-Corruption Bureau, the group "set up a major corruption scheme to control key state-owned enterprises," including Energoatom, Ukraine's state-owned nuclear energy agency. According to the Kyiv Independent sources in law enforcement, the NABU conducted searches in Kyiv in premises connected to Mindich on Nov. 10, but he was tipped off and had fled before the searches took place. "Any effective actions against corruption are very needed. The inevitability of punishment is necessary," he said in his evening address, without naming Mindich or others involved. "Everyone who created schemes must receive a clear procedural response. A 15-month investigation and 1,000 hours of wiretapping resulted in 70 raids, according to the agency. "In fact, the management of a strategic enterprise with an annual revenue of over Hr 200 billion ($4.7 billion) was carried out not by officials, but by outsiders who had no formal authority," the NABU said in a statement. Released tapes reveal voices identified as "Roket" and "Tenor" plotting to pressure contractors, the agency said. According to the Kyiv Independent sources, "Roket" is Ihor Myroniuk, former advisor to then-Energy Minister Halushchenko, and "Tenor" is Dmytro Basov, former prosecutor and ex-head of Energoatom's physical security department. Previously, Myroniuk also served as an aide to fugitive Ukrainian ex-lawmaker Andrii Derkach, who serves as a Russian senator since 2024. The NABU says Myroniuk and Basov effectively "took control of all company purchases." Audio recordings capture "Roket" calling protective structures for energy facilities a "waste of money." The two discussed that they earned only 90,000 hryvnias or dollars from a prior Hr 3 billion ($71 million) contract and decided to wait for a more profitable deal, while Russia had already begun targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure in September. Amid the growing scandal, Halushcnko's successor, Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, said later in the day on Nov. 10 that Energoatom isn't directly controlled by her ministry, according to Ukrinform. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko also addressed the investigation. Combating corruption is one of the government's key priorities. There should be sentences and inevitable punishment for any offenses. Mindich was looked into, among other people, in connections to drone producer Fire Point, sources previously told the Kyiv Independent, citing a NABU investigation into the company. Fire Point has denied having any links to Mindich. The news comes days after Ukrainska Pravda's investigation reported that Zelensky's former business partner has significantly increased his clout in recent years. The bank did not respond to a request for comment. Another industry where Mindich allegedly has interests is energy. In June, the NABU reportedly arrested his relative Leonid Mindich when he was trying to flee abroad. He was charged with embezzling $16 million from the electric power company Kharkivoblenergo. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Based in Kyiv, she focuses on domestic affairs, parliament, and social issues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Under the cover of heavy fog, Russia is intensifying its push to seize Pokrovsk — exploiting low visibility that blunts Ukrainian drone surveillance and strikes, the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces reported on Nov. 11. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces continue to detect and neutralize Russian groups in urban areas, even under low-visibility conditions. After taking control of Avdiivka, a longstanding Ukrainian stronghold roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk in February 2024, Russian forces have been steadily pushing toward Pokrovsk, a former key Ukrainian logistics hub located in a relatively secure part of Donetsk Oblast. Russian troops have now encircled Pokrovsk on three sides, leaving only a roughly 15-kilometer (nine-mile) corridor for Ukrainian forces to bring in reinforcements and supplies, according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. "There will be meetings in the coming days, particularly in Turkey," National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said. Ukrainian troops have pulled back from positions near five settlements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, fully withdrawing from the villages of Uspenivka and Novomykolaivka in the Polohy district. Russian forces are advancing into Pokrovsk from the southern outskirts, using light equipment, according to the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces. Romanian troops received a report of a drone crash near the village of Grindu, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Timur Mindich, a former business partner of President Volodymyr Zelensky, is the co-owner of Kvartal 95, a production company founded by the president. Major Andrii Kovalev, a spokesman for Ukraine's General Staff, told Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda that logistics to Pokrovsk still exist, and the troops, including wounded soldiers, are being rotated in and out. An oil refinery in Saratov, Russia, was reportedly attacked overnight on Nov. 11, according to local Telegram channels that shared footage appearing to show explosions at the facility. U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House on Nov. 10, marking the first visit to Washington by a Syrian head of state since 1946.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A TikTok influencer accused of posting videos supporting Mali's army has been killed by suspected jihadists, according to authorities in the West African nation. It comes as a well-armed jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda is closing in on Bamako, the capital. The country's military junta and their Russian partners are struggling to counter the jihadis, who now hold sway in many parts of the huge Sahelian country. The mayor of Tonka in the Timbuktu region, Mamadou Konipo, confirmed Cissé's killing but didn't have any more information. Tonka is a village along the Niger River, about 90 miles from Timbuktu. Members of the al-Qaida affiliate Jama'at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, or JNIM, are known to operate there. No group has taken responsibility for the killing. Cissé, who was not a member of the military, sometimes posted images of herself in military fatigues to her more than 140,00 TikTok followers, which is thought to have drawn attention from the armed men. Cissé received death threats several days before she was abducted, according to the Timbuktu mayor. Another military officer seized power in a coup the following year. Insecurity has worsened since then, according to monitoring groups. Armed groups, primarily JNIM, operate in large swathes of rural regions. The landlocked nation is currently under a fuel blockade by JNIM.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinidad and Tobago drawn into the crosshairs of US president's drug boat campaign Hours later, Ms Clement's phone was flooded with messages of condolences. Her grandson, Chad Joseph, 26, had been on board, they said. Mr Joseph's suspected death has plunged this close knit family from Las Cuevas, a small fishing village in the north of Trinidad, into the centre of a geopolitical crisis at a time when tensions in the region are teetering on edge of war. For the past two months Mr Trump has spearheaded a controversial campaign in his so-called war on drug cartels. His aggressive campaign has drawn Trinidad and Tobago, a country just seven miles from Venezuela, into the crosshairs, as well as shining a light on the Caribbean island's role in international drug trafficking operations. Even if these men are drug smugglers, they deserve due process and to be tried in court, critics claim. Despite government pushback, Mr Joseph's family have insisted he was on board. They say he told his girlfriend he was returning to Trinidad by boat that day after having spent six months working on a farm in Venezuela. His phone goes straight to voicemail, texts do not deliver. “The boy never, he never got hold of narcotics,” Lynette Burnley, his aunt, said from her bright pink home on a hilltop overlooking the fishing bay. However, images have circulated online allegedly showing Mr Joseph being arrested in 2018, with packages of drugs laid out on the table in front of him, but Ms Burnley said he was charged with possession of ammunition. Speaking to The Telegraph in her front room over the whirr of an electric fan, she said when Mr Joseph was young he had “followed the wrong set of friends”, but she insists he had turned his life around. Last week, Venezuela declared Ms Persad-Bissessar a “persona non grata”. Ms Burnley suggested that even if the US did suspect these boats to be involved in drug trafficking, those on board should be arrested and tried in court, not killed at sea. “Hold them, charge them, do whatever you have to do, but you can't just accuse without no evidence and take somebody's life... he [Mr Trump is] blowing them up like dogs,” she said. Rosales said he did not venture into Venezuelan or international waters, where the US claims the boat was blown up, to fish. Speaking to The Telegraph in the baking sun while his friend descaled and gutted fish, he said: “I knew Chad a little, he was a fisherman. With its porous borders and close proximity to Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, famed for its carnival and laid back attitude, has for decades been used as a landing point for drug trafficking operations. The majority of the world's cocaine is produced in Colombia before it is trafficked internationally, including by land through Venezuela and sometimes moved by boat or plane. Trinidad forms part of the Caribbean narco highway, which is used to smuggle drugs north, usually destined for Europe and the Middle East – and Trinidadian fishermen do play a role. He added: “The fact is that a lot of fishermen are involved in drug trafficking. I cannot say whether this one was involved or not, of course, but a lot of fishermen are involved in trafficking activities.” “We don't have a cocaine demand as some of the larger continents, but because of our geographic position, our porous borders and probably vulnerabilities in certain other areas, it's easy to stop and move... and send off to other destinations,” he added. The boat bombed on Oct 14 was in international waters, a region Dr Heera said most fishing boats do not venture into unless they were deep sea fishing. In Caranage, a fishing town near Port of Spain, Arnold Mason said he stopped fishing at night and had been hugging the coastline in light of the strikes, which had significantly impacted the amount he could catch. That morning Mr Mason, 44, had ventured out for four hours but came back with no fish. “It has to be considered that this man [Mr Trump] is blowing boats out of the water,” he told The Telegraph, adding that this was a “scary” situation. Local reports claimed the bodies were missing limbs and appeared to be burnt, leading to speculation they had been victims of Mr Trump's strikes. When he came home from work at around 11am on Sept 5, Lincoln Barker, 63, who lives on a hill around 200 metres from the beach, saw police officers removing a body. In his decades living in his white, wooden home he has occasionally seen bodies of drowning victims wash up, but nothing like that. Back in Las Cuevas Mr Joseph's family still cling to hope that he somehow survived the blast. They held a memorial service for him last month and a large cardboard poster with pictures of Mr Joseph and his date of death sits on the mantelpiece. But, Ms Burnley said: “We're still hoping he has survived. Because, you know, if you survived and washed ashore and somebody picked them up, it will take years for you to know if they're alive or not... we hope somebody's looking after him.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two of China's most popular gay-dating apps have disappeared from app stores in the country, reinforcing fears of a widening  crackdown on LGBTQ+ groups and online content. Blued and Finka were not available on Apple's App Store as of Tuesday and the apps had been erased from locally adapted platforms that serve Android devices. China operates one of the world's most extensive online censorship and surveillance regimes that scrubs political dissent and criticism of the ruling Communist Party's leadership and ideologies, including a drive against feminine portrayals of men in pop culture. China's LGBTQ+ community has faced an intensifying crackdown since Xi Jinping came to power more than a decade ago. Authorities have ramped up control over what they consider the undue influence of Western values, with Pride parades canceled, films and TV shows featuring same-sex themes banned, and China's most popular messaging app WeChat shutting down dozens of LGBTQ accounts. There has been no official announcement about the apps' removal from the app stores in China, where regulators routinely remove content without explanation. CNN has reached out to Apple, Blued, Finka and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment. Apple said it removed the apps from its China store after a request from the country's internet regulator, tech website Wired reported. Blued's international version HeeSay remains searchable on app stores outside of China, while Finka operates solely within the country. The apps are hugely popular, with Blued reported as having 54 million registered users worldwide in 2020 and Finka 2.7 million, according to state media CGTN. The Trump administration, however, has been scaling back federal diversity programs while piling pressure on the private sector to end similar initiatives. China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 but does not recognize same-sex marriage. This is not the first time China has reined in gay-dating apps. Grindr, which targets the international market, was removed from mobile app stores in China in 2022, citing difficulties to comply with a new privacy law. Blued, launched in 2012 to offer the local market a more approachable alternative, continued to operate alongside its rival Finka, which targets a younger demographic. Blued's parent company BlueCity acquired Finka in 2020, a year after its debut. One user, surnamed Zhao, told CNN that the two apps enabled friends to meet especially in the less cosmopolitan parts of the country where places for gay people to gather are almost non-existent. It's unclear if their removal from Chinese app stores is permanent. “Things are just difficult right now,” the source said, adding that Blued would likely have to “lay low and even transform” to survive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) thwarted a Ukrainian military intelligence operation to hijack a Russian MiG-31 fighter jet equipped with a Kinzhal hypersonic missile to carry out a false flag attack on NATO's largest airbase, the FSB press office told TASS. "The Federal Security Service has uncovered and thwarted an operation by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate and its UK supervisors to hijack a Russian MiG-31 supersonic fighter jet, which is equipped with a Kinzhal hypersonic missile, and fly it abroad," the press office said. "In order to hijack the aircraft, Ukrainian military intelligence officers tried to recruit Russian pilots, offering $3 million. The special services then planned to send the jet with the Kinzhal missile to the area where NATO's largest airbase in southeastern Europe is located, in the Romanian city of Constanta, where it could be shot down by air defenses," the FSB emphasized. "The measures taken have thwarted the plans of the Ukrainian and UK intelligence services to carry out a large-scale provocation," the press office pointed out. Constanta, located in southeastern Romania, is home to the largest NATO military base in Europe, which is currently under construction. The town will house 10,000 NATO servicemen, their families, and technical personnel. However, the media has speculated that the number of NATO troops could double, potentially making the base one of the biggest hubs for supplying Ukraine with aid, including munitions and military equipment. The base is expected to be fully operational by 2040. As of now, around 5,000 NATO servicemen are stationed there, primarily from the US, Poland, France, and Spain.</p>
