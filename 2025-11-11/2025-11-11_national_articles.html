                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., makes a statement to reporters without taking questions following a vote in the Senate to move forward with a stopgap funding bill to reopen the government through Jan. 30, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — After refusing to convene the U.S. House during the government shutdown, Speaker Mike Johnson is recalling lawmakers back into session — and facing an avalanche of pent-up legislative demands from those who have largely been sidelined from governing. Hundreds of representatives are preparing to return Wednesday to Washington after a nearly eight-week absence, carrying a torrent of ideas, proposals and frustrations over work that has stalled when the Republican speaker shuttered the House doors nearly two months ago. First will be a vote to reopen the government. With efforts to release the Jeffrey Epstein files and the swearing in of Arizona's Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, the unfinished business will pose a fresh test to Johnson's grip on power and put a renewed focus on his leadership. When the House gavels back into session, it will close this remarkable chapter of Johnson's tenure when he showed himself to be a leader who is quietly, but brazenly, willing to upend institutional norms in pursuit of his broader strategy, even at the risk of diminishing the House itself. Over these past weeks, the chamber has sidestepped its basic responsibilities, from passing routine legislation to conducting oversight. “You can see it is pretty empty around here,” Johnson, R-La., said on day three of the shutdown, tour groups no longer crowding the halls. That is how it works,” he said, blaming Democrats, with their fight over health care funds, for the closures. He argued that the chamber, under the GOP majority, had already done its job passing a stopgap funding bill in September. When the Senate failed over and over to advance the House bill, more than a dozen times, he refused to enter talks with the other leaders on a compromise. Johnson also encouraged Trump to cancel an initial sit-down with the Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to avoid a broader negotiation while the government was still closed. Instead, the speaker, whose job is outlined in the Constitution, second in line of succession to the presidency, held held almost daily press conferences on his side of the Capitol, a weekly conference call with GOP lawmakers, and private talks with Trump. He joined the president for Sunday's NFL Washington Commanders game as the Senate was slogging through a weekend session. “People say, why aren't you negotiating with Schumer and Jeffries? I quite literally have nothing to negotiate,” Johnson said at one point. “As I've said time and time again, I don't have anything to negotiate with,” he said on day 13 of the shutdown. And besides he said of the GOP lawmakers, “They are doing some of their best work in the district, helping their constituents navigate this crisis.” In many ways, Johnson has become a surprisingly effective leader, an accidental speaker who was elected to the job by his colleagues after all others failed to win it. This year, with Trump's return to the White House, the speaker has commandeered his slim GOP majority and passed legislation including the president's so-called “one big beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending reductions that became law this summer. Johnson's shutdown strategy also largely achieved his goal, forcing Senate Democrats to break ranks and approve the funds to reopen government without the extension of health care subsidies they were demanding to help ease the sticker shock of rising insurance premium costs with the Affordable Care Act. Johnson's approach is seen as one that manages up — he stays close to Trump and says they speak often — and also hammers down, imposing a rigid control over the day-to-day schedule of the House, and its lawmakers. Under a House rules change this year, Johnson was able to keep the chamber shuttered indefinitely on his own, without the usual required vote. This year his leadership team has allowed fewer opportunities for amendments on legislation, according to a recent tally. Other changes have curtailed the House's ability to provide a robust check on the executive branch over Trump's tariffs and use of war powers. Johnson's refusal to swear-in Grijalva is a remarkable flex of the speaker's power, leading to comparisons with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's decision not to consider President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, said David Rapallo, an associate professor and director of the Federal Legislation Clinic at Georgetown University Law Center. But said Short, “The legislative branch has abdicated a lot of responsibility to the executive under his watch.” As lawmakers make their way back to Washington, the speaker's power will be tested again as they consider the package to reopen government. Republicans are certain to have complaints about the bill, which funds much of the federal government through Jan. 30 and keeps certain programs including agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs running through September. But with House Democratic leaders rejecting the package for having failed to address the health care subsidies, it will be up to Johnson to muscle it through with mostly GOP lawmakers — with hardly any room for defections in the chamber that's narrowly split. Jeffries, who has criticized House Republicans for what he called an extended vacation, said, “They're not going to be able to hide this week when they return.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, bringing the longest shutdown in history closer to an end as a small group of Democrats ratified a deal with Republicans despite searing criticism from within their party. President Donald Trump has signaled support for the bill, saying Monday that “we're going to be opening up our country very quickly.” The Republicans never did, and five moderate Democrats eventually switched their votes as federal food aid was delayed, airport delays worsened and hundreds of thousands of federal workers continued to go unpaid. The League of United Latin American Citizens is urging Congress, the Department of Veterans Affairs and state governments to accelerate benefit reform that would expand health access, strengthen suicide-prevention outreach for veterans and invest in culturally responsive support for Latino veterans and families. LULAC National Vice President for Military Affairs, Lawrence Romo said Veterans Day serves as a standing promise that the U.S. government will “stand by its defenders long after the battles have ended.” “Now the nation must ensure that they receive benefits, strong mental health support and real pathways to rebuild their live. Tony Evers said Tuesday that he was not going to criticize Democratic senators who voted for the deal to reopen the federal government. “They have good reasons for doing it,” Evers told The Associated Press. Evers said it was “hard to say” whether the deal will make it easier or more difficult to extend health care tax credits that expire Jan. 1 as Democrats had pushed for. “It's going to be difficult regardless because Republicans have been pretty clear that they don't want to do anything,” Evers said. Robert Harshbarger Jr., who was a licensed pharmacist, pleaded guilty in 2013 to substituting a cheaper drug imported from China that was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a drug the FDA had approved for kidney dialysis patients. Harshbarger was sentenced to and served four years in prison. The pardon was among a batch that Trump granted on Friday. FILE - Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, holds a packet of potential redistricting maps as SB1012 Congressional Boundaries Designation is discussed in the House chamber during a special session at the Capitol on Monday, Oct. 6, 2025, in Salt Lake City. Republicans hold all four of Utah's U.S. House seats and had advanced a map to protect them. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled just before a midnight Monday deadline that it “unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats,” despite her order to draw a map that complies with standards established by voters to ensure districts don't deliberately gerrymander to favor a party. Gibson ultimately selected a map drawn by the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government that puts Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four. Top diplomats from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies are converging on southern Ontario as tensions rise between the U.S. and traditional allies like Canada over defense spending, trade and uncertainty over President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan in Gaza and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in an interview with The Associated Press that “the relationship has to continue across a range of issues” despite trade pressures as she prepared to host U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday. Multiple military officials wouldn't offer further location details when asked by The Associated Press. He, Vance and other top administration officials saluted throughout the song.

The typical Sora video, made on OpenAI's app, is designed to be amusing to click and share on TikTok, Instagram, X and Facebook. But a growing chorus is raising alarms about the dangers of letting people create AI videos showing just about anything they can type into a prompt, leading to the proliferation of nonconsensual images and realistic deepfakes. “Our biggest concern is the potential threat to democracy,” Public Citizen tech policy advocate J.B. “I think we're entering a world in which people can't really trust what they see. And we're starting to see strategies in politics where the first image, the first video that gets released, is what people remember.” OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. ▶ Read more about how advocates see OpenAI's Sora videos threatening democracy He's convinced his brand of gruff populism and calls for economic equality are what's needed to beat Gov. Janet Mills for the Democratic nomination and then unseat five-term incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins. Like Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, Pennsylvania, who said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery. He previously received $350 a month in SNAP payments to help buy food for the family. “It's kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.” Youth-led protesters drew a red line as they encircled the sprawling buildings in the capital, Belgrade that were partially destroyed in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign. It's the latest flashpoint in yearlong protests against rampant corruption that have shaken Vucic's firm grip on power. ▶ Read more about Kushner's controversial real estate investments in Eastern Europe Volunteer Angus Hsigh helps a military member during a Feeding San Diego food distribution for military families affected by the federal shutdown Friday, Nov. 7, 2025, in Oceanside, Calif.

Whether feeding hungry families or maintaining local museum tours, volunteers nationwide are strengthening social ties they hope will continue making their neighbors whole amid persistent precarity. Anna Culbertson, a National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases program specialist, was among the thousands laid off this spring at the nation's top health agencies. She then co-founded 27 UNIHTED, a National Institutes of Health alumni network providing peer support and career resources. The network put together food drives for federal employees going without pay and created a spreadsheet identifying help for furloughed workers and placed collection boxes outside Panera Bread and Starbucks locations as well as the “No Kings” protest in Washington, D.C. ▶ Read more about how grassroots philanthropy is responding to the shutdown But Scott Bessent didn't say how much of a profit the U.S. made after it bought Argentine pesos and finalized a $20 billion currency swap line with the South American country's central bank. Nor was he asked for a dollar amount during an interview on MSNBC's “Morning Joe.” He was asked how extending a financial lifeline to the cash-strapped U.S. ally helped Americans. A currency swap line is an agreement between two central banks to exchange currencies. It is the Republican's first Veterans Day since he returned to office. Air travelers could face more frustration as busy U.S. airports need to meet a higher FAA target for reducing flights Tuesday after already canceling thousands to scale back demands on the nation's aviation system during the government shutdown. Southwest Airlines planes sit at gates as travelers walk through Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in Baltimore, Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. But it was unclear exactly how many additional flights would need to be canceled Tuesday. The FAA also expanded its flight restrictions Monday, barring business jets and many private flights from using a dozen airports already under commercial flight limits. It's up to the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress to decide when full payments will resume under the SNAP food aid program that helps 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries as the financial pressures mount on families in some states. The Supreme Court is expected to rule Tuesday on a request from President Donald Trump's administration to keep blocking states from providing full benefits, arguing the money might be needed elsewhere. The seesawing rulings so far have created a situation where beneficiaries in some states, including Hawaii and New Jersey, have received their full monthly allocations and those in others, such as Nebraska and West Virginia, have seen nothing. The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history appears to be nearing an end, but not without leaving a mark on an already-struggling economy. Thousands of flights have been canceled, a trend that is expected to continue this week even as Congress moves toward reopening the government. But some canceled flights won't be retaken, missed restaurant meals won't be made up, and some postponed purchases will end up not happening at all. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost.

(AP Photo) Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana praised them Monday morning, saying they “decided to put principle over their personal politics.” The Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, bringing the longest shutdown in history closer to an end as a small group of Democrats ratified a deal with Republicans despite searing criticism from within their party. President Donald Trump has signaled support for the bill, saying Monday that “we're going to be opening up our country very quickly.” The Republicans never did, and five moderate Democrats eventually switched their votes as federal food aid was delayed, airport delays worsened and hundreds of thousands of federal workers continued to go unpaid. House Speaker Mike Johnson urged lawmakers to start returning to Washington “right now” given shutdown-related travel delays, but an official notice issued after the Senate vote said the earliest the House will vote is Wednesday afternoon.</p>

Former President Barack Obama surprised a group of World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War veterans as they arrived in Washington, D.C., to visit memorials honoring fallen service members. Former President Barack Obama surprised a group of veterans in a heartfelt moment after they touched down on a flight into Washington, D.C., ahead of Veterans Day to visit memorials honoring their fellow service members. Obama boarded the plane just before the group of World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War veterans were about to disembark for their tour, and he took to the plane's intercom to thank them for their sacrifice in serving the country. Veterans aboard an Honor Flight from Wisconsin gather in a cabin adorned with American flags and red, white and blue streamers as they travel to Washington, D.C., to visit war memorials. exclaimed one person, while another veteran in a red cap and jacket could be seen in disbelief with his mouth wide open. The emotional greeting was captured in a video posted to Obama's X account. "As we approach Veterans Day, I just wanted to stop by and say thank you for your extraordinary service," the former president continued as the veterans looked on in astonishment. "To you, your family — the sacrifices that you all made to protect our country is something that will always be honored, and we are very grateful," he added. Obama could then be seen shaking hands with every veteran as they exited the aircraft at Reagan National Airport, presenting each with a presidential challenge coin — a tradition in which presidents give coins as a symbol of appreciation for service or contributions to the nation. "Ahead of Veterans Day, I was honored to welcome a flight of veterans and their families as they arrived in D.C.," Obama said in the X post. "To all those who bravely served our country, thank you to you and your family for your extraordinary service," he added. "The sacrifices that all of you made to protect our country will be honored today and every day." The veterans were aboard a flight organized by Honor Flight, a nonprofit launched in 2005 that provides free trips to Washington, D.C., memorials for veterans. The group operates in 46 states, has transported more than 300,000 veterans and is funded entirely by donations and volunteers, according to its website. "I had tears in my eyes," said Army veteran Joe Parr. "I just couldn't believe that there were that many people around who remembered us and were there to greet us. Former Presidnet Barack Obama speaks over the intercom to veterans aboard an Honor Flight as they arrive in Washington, D.C., thanking them for their sacrifice ahead of Veterans Day. Mary Quigley, a U.S. Navy veteran and volunteer, said it was the first time she had seen a president greet one of the flights. "A leader who's going to show up and tell you that your service was worth something — I think that's the important part — so I think it was a great thing," Quigley said. Quigley said it was important that veterans are welcomed and acknowledged for their sacrifice, noting that many who returned home from past wars weren't offered the same ovation. U.S. Navy veteran Nels Swenson echoed those sentiments. "I'm real happy that now, with current troops, they come back from deployments and they get welcomed back really nicely — because that's what should happen," Swenson said. "So it's being recreated in this flight. Seventy-nine veterans and their families made the trip, according to reports. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

"Forrest Gump" star Gary Sinise talks about the importance of supporting veterans and service members who struggle to express trauma and vulnerability. "DHS honors the patriotism and heroism of Americans who served our country and continue to protect our homeland and freedoms by arresting the worst of the worst criminals across the U.S.," a department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin added that there are more than 7,500 veterans serving as ICE agents – a job where videos and reports in recent months show similarly dangerous situations and confrontations with armed civilian adversaries and violent protesters. "Just yesterday, ICE arrested pedophiles, rapists, and other violent criminals. We are eternally grateful to all Americans who have bravely served [and] protected our freedoms. Veterans-turned-ICE agents took part in several Veterans Day eve operations targeting sex offenders and child predators across locations ranging from Pennsylvania's Coal Region to the Utah desert. On Monday, ICE's Philadelphia office arrested Columbian national Albert Quinones-Quinones in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Residents in Pottsville – known nationally for being home to America's oldest brewery; Yuengling; and a once-booming coal industry – are safer now that Quinones-Quinones is off the street, DHS said. The illegal immigrant has a prior sexual assault conviction in local court and a longer criminal history, according to the agency. He has a prior conviction in Bronx County, New York for rape. Also in The Bronx, ICE corralled Luis Castillo-Flores, 45, another Dominican national with a violent prior rap sheet.

Board certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani breaks down the dangers of teen marijuana use and why the drug is becoming more appealing to young users on ‘America Reports.' Officials in Tiburon, California, have moved to prohibit the sale of all tobacco. On Wednesday, the town council unanimously passed an ordinance that would ban the sale of cigarettes, cigars, vapes, e-cigarettes and all other nicotine products. Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier told Fox News Digital in a statement that she is "pleased to have sponsored" and "voted to save lives and save our environment." "With local youth in Marin County vaping at twice the national average, it is critical that we take all efforts to reduce teen addiction," she added. "By banning all tobacco sales here in Tiburon, we are preventing youth from getting addicted and protecting our environment." Cigarettes are the biggest source of single-use plastic finding its way into rivers, bays and oceans in the world, Thier said. An anti-tobacco group of high school students from across Marin County, the Youth Advocacy Committee (YAC), were present at a few town council meetings to advocate for the ordinance. Diana Garcia, a YAC student, reiterated her strong support for the ban. In 2022, nearly 50 million U.S. adults reported the use of any tobacco product, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC also reports that smoking and secondhand smoke exposure cause over 480,000 deaths each year, with "smoking harm[ing] nearly every organ of the body and caus[ing] many diseases." The new anti-tobacco ordinance is set to take effect in December. "We remain committed to doing the hard work and changing the outcomes so all in Marin can thrive and live healthy lives," said Niccore Tyler, Marin County's health and human services' chief strategy officer, at the time. "We believe this complete prohibition sends a discouraging message to small businesses and entrepreneurs. Small businesses, including convenience stores and gas stations, are essential to communities and provide residents with convenient access to everyday necessities," it read. Nearly 50 million U.S. adults reported the use of any tobacco product in 2022. "Complete prohibitions on product categories, rather than reasonable regulation, send a message that small businesses may face unpredictable restrictions, creating uncertainty that discourages entrepreneurship and investment in Tiburon," the letter continued. The ordinance is set to take effect in December. Ashley J. DiMella is a lifestyle reporter with Fox News Digital. Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The measure doesn't secure Democrats' demand of extending expiring health subsidies, but would restore critical services like federal food aid and pay for federal workers. • Shutdown shockwaves: Cuts to flights at 40 of the busiest US airports are increasing to 6% today, with experts saying the window for sufficient recovery before Thanksgiving is narrow. Air traffic controllers have now missed their second full paycheck since the lapse of government funding. President Donald Trump took a moment during his Veterans Day remarks Tuesday to congratulate House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune after Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to approve a funding measure to end the longest shutdown in US history. While expressing gratitude, the president also used the occasion to tout his administration's record on veterans' issues and to stray into political topics, taking aim at his predecessor's administration. The president revisited his call for Veterans Day to be renamed “Victory Day,” a proposal that has drawn criticism from those who argue it will honor the conflicts, instead of the veterans who fought in them. “As you know, today is not only Veterans Day, but it's my proclamation that we are now going to be saying and calling ‘Victory Day' for World War I,” he said. This post has been updated with additional remarks from Trump. As FAA's emergency order for today calls on airlines to reduce flight operations by 6 percent at 40 selected airports, the country's major carriers have preemptively canceled more than 800 flights to meet the order's requirements. The cancellations come as air traffic controllers miss another day of work today, in larger numbers, having yesterday missed their second full paycheck since the lapse of government funding. Acknowledging a “crisis within aviation” as a result of the ongoing government shutdown, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suggested the Federal Aviation Administration's﻿ mandated flight reductions may not end immediately after a deal is reached to reopen the federal government. The FAA's emergency order called for airlines to reduce operations at 40 selected airports by 6% on Tuesday, and then by 2% more over each of the next two days. “If you thought this weekend was bad with delays and cancelations, by truly, this Thursday and Friday I think you would have seen mass, you know, double, triple the number of cancelations and delays in the airspace,” Duffy said. With the narrowest of majorities in the House, and as newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva will finally be sworn in on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose two Republican votes on a party-line vote — assuming there's full attendance. Two GOP sources say that they are not anticipating any attendance issues on their side — but that it's too early to know for sure. Plus, many are in their districts Tuesday for Veterans Day events. Problems are being reported Tuesday morning with staffing at two Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control facilities, according to a just published operations plan. The TRACONs that handle flights approaching and departing Las Vegas and Newark Liberty International Airport are not fully staffed until 6 p.m. Controllers will have to reroute or delay flights, to make sure they can remain safe in the airspace with fewer staff working. Monday there were 40 reports of staffing problems at FAA facilities from Orlando to Anchorage. There have been 638 reports of short staffing since October 1, more than six times as many as were reported on the same dates last year. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries signaled support for Sen. Chuck Schumer as the Senate minority leader faces criticism after a number of centrist Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to approve a funding measure for reopening the government. When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” if Schumer should be replaced, Jeffries said: Jeffries said “it's unfortunate” that eight lawmakers voted against their caucus. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries reiterated to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Democrats will “strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican health care crisis.” We'll continue to stand by our hardworking federal employees and civil servants. But we have a responsibility to make sure that we extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so that tens of millions of Americans don't experience dramatically increased health care costs that's going to prevent them from being able to see a doctor when they need one,” Jeffries said on CNN's “The Situation Room.” Yesterday's critical vote capped a frenzied few days of negotiations between Senate centrists, GOP leaders and the White House. If you're just joining us, here's where things stand and what to expect next: Essential FAA employees who have worked during the shutdown will not immediately receive back pay, and some may choose not to return to work right away. If controllers come back to the job, pilot and aviation consultant Kit Darby thinks it might take airlines a “week or two” to snap back. “If we can't get it done this week (to end the shutdown), we're starting to get to the point where it won't be fully recovered by Thanksgiving,” Darby said. “I think if they do it this week, we can be very close to fully recovered by Thanksgiving.” He said that if the shutdown is resolved no later than the end of this week or even this coming weekend, airlines should have enough time to reassemble their schedules and get flights operating at normal levels by Thanksgiving. But if the shutdown has not been resolved at the end of this week, there is a big risk that Thanksgiving travel could be disrupted, he said. How we got here: Despite a series of lower court orders, there is one only order – from Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson – that is controlling what happens with food stamps. On late Friday, Jackson entered what's known as “administrative stay” that effectively sided with President Donald Trump and temporarily allowed the government to withhold full SNAP benefits. If that happens, a lower court order would take effect, and Trump would be required to spend an additional $4 billion on the food program. Given that Congress is moving toward a resolution of the shutdown, a more likely scenario is that the Supreme Court – either Jackson or a majority of justices – would extend the administrative stay. Travelers at Newark Liberty International Airport were cautiously optimistic early Tuesday morning, with many of them telling CNN their travel plans had yet to be significantly disrupted by the government shutdown and related flight reductions. April Taylor, who was on her way to Texas, told CNN she was notified about potential disruptions through her airline's app. Even though her original flight was not yet cancelled, she used the opportunity and flexibility airlines are providing to move up her travel and avoid potential issues later in the day. Many US airlines, including Delta and United, are waiving fees for customers who want to change or cancel their plans because of shutdown cuts. They let us move it to an earlier flight, so we feel like so far everything's saying it's on time. Even as some travelers were expecting to leave on their Tuesday flights without issue, some acknowledged their return flight could be subject to cancellation. “Hopefully I'll get out to LA today, and then hopefully I'll get back on Thursday,” Tom Westdyk told CNN. At Newark Airport, 27 flights scheduled to fly out had been cancelled as of 9:20 a.m. Security and check-in lines appeared to be flowing normally inside Newark Airport's Terminal A, even as metal gates across two sections of the security area remained lowered. Those heading to warmer destinations — as a cold front impacts the East Coast — were anxious to get away and dismissed the possibility their return flight could be compromised as flight cancellations are scaled up through the week. “That's a good place to be stuck at.” The order calls for airlines to cancel flights seven days before they are scheduled to fly, and once they are canceled and passengers are informed, they can't easily be reinstated. When the shutdown ends and controllers come back to the job, pilot and aviation consultant Kit Darby tells CNN it might take airlines a “week or two” to snap back. Here's what some recipients have to say about the legal back-and-forth: “You make plans to buy groceries and then it's gone. It's pulling the rug out from under you, and you think ‘What am I going to do now?”- Trena Picou, Louisiana “I'm not going to keep logging in (into my SNAP account) and refreshing when it seems like they haven't figured this out. Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants said President Donald Trump's demands that all air traffic controllers “get back to work, NOW” or face penalties, are “disgraceful” and demanded a rescission of those comments. “Not only is it disgraceful, … it also shows that the President does not understand where Americans are living paycheck to paycheck these days and stressed to the max,” Nelson told CNN's Kate Bolduan on CNN News Central. “We will not, in any way, entertain those comments from the President.” Nelson said instead, “we should all be expressing empathy and thank you,” toward air traffic controllers, “who have worked through this miraculously, without getting paid.” As the government shutdown continues to disrupt the airline industry, one Sacramento International Airport worker and mother of a 9-month-old says she's barely making ends meet without pay. “I've missed two paychecks now,” Mary Becker told CNN affiliate KXTV. She shows up to work every day, even as she struggles to care for her daughter, Alice, and keep up with mounting bills. “We've had to ask for help when buying diapers and formula, because formula is very expensive — especially since she has a dairy allergy, so we have to get goat milk formula,” Becker said. “I can't afford the $50 copay right now,” she added, noting that Alice had to see the doctor four times in two weeks after catching hand, foot and mouth disease. Becker, who has worked for the Transportation Security Administration for nine years, has experienced two government shutdowns, but says this one feels especially difficult as a single mother. But the moment you miss that paycheck, suddenly it's very real that we're not getting paid — and we're still having to come to work.” It's Veterans Day, and President Donald Trump will be going to Arlington National Cemetery this morning. Monday was the worst day for air traffic control staffing that wasn't a Friday, Saturday or Sunday since the start of the government shutdown, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations plans. Controllers would have been paid then if the government was open. Controllers would have been paid yesterday, if the government was open. There were 40 reports of “staffing triggers” yesterday at FAA facilities, from Orlando to Anchorage. A “staffing trigger” is when air traffic controllers alter operations to keep the airspace safe with fewer people working. These steps can include rerouting planes or delaying flights when there are not enough controllers to handle the normal workload. There have been 636 reports of short staffing since October 1, more than six times as many as were reported on the same dates last year. For context: Control towers at Chicago's O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Nashville, Phoenix, and San Diego reported staffing problems Monday. Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities (TRACONs) in Anchorage, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, New York, Newark, Orlando, Phoenix and Southern California were also short-staffed. Air Route Traffic Control Centers, which control flights en route at high altitude, were without their normal complement of controllers Monday in Albuquerque, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Oakland, Washington, DC, and Jacksonville. Dozens of flights at Miami International Airport were canceled under FAA-mandated flight reductions, leaving travelers stranded and anxious like thousands nationwide. Passengers Judith and Thomas Miadock, who arrived in Miami on Monday after a three-week cruise, found out their flight home to Cleveland had been canceled three times. Rent a room again for the third night,” Thomas Miadock told CNN affiliate WFOR. “I think it's horrible that our government looks at these people and not supplementing their income, along with the service people…It's absolutely horrible,” Miadock said, adding that he's been thanking TSA staff for their work. “But my complaint is little compared to everybody else's,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., makes a statement to reporters without taking questions following a vote in the Senate to move forward with a stopgap funding bill to reopen the government through Jan. 30, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — After refusing to convene the U.S. House during the government shutdown, Speaker Mike Johnson is recalling lawmakers back into session — and facing an avalanche of pent-up legislative demands from those who have largely been sidelined from governing. Hundreds of representatives are preparing to return Wednesday to Washington after a nearly eight-week absence, carrying a torrent of ideas, proposals and frustrations over work that has stalled when the Republican speaker shuttered the House doors nearly two months ago. First will be a vote to reopen the government. With efforts to release the Jeffrey Epstein files and the swearing in of Arizona's Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, the unfinished business will pose a fresh test to Johnson's grip on power and put a renewed focus on his leadership. When the House gavels back into session, it will close this remarkable chapter of Johnson's tenure when he showed himself to be a leader who is quietly, but brazenly, willing to upend institutional norms in pursuit of his broader strategy, even at the risk of diminishing the House itself. Over these past weeks, the chamber has sidestepped its basic responsibilities, from passing routine legislation to conducting oversight. “You can see it is pretty empty around here,” Johnson, R-La., said on day three of the shutdown, tour groups no longer crowding the halls. That is how it works,” he said, blaming Democrats, with their fight over health care funds, for the closures. He argued that the chamber, under the GOP majority, had already done its job passing a stopgap funding bill in September. When the Senate failed over and over to advance the House bill, more than a dozen times, he refused to enter talks with the other leaders on a compromise. Johnson also encouraged Trump to cancel an initial sit-down with the Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to avoid a broader negotiation while the government was still closed. Instead, the speaker, whose job is outlined in the Constitution, second in line of succession to the presidency, held held almost daily press conferences on his side of the Capitol, a weekly conference call with GOP lawmakers, and private talks with Trump. He joined the president for Sunday's NFL Washington Commanders game as the Senate was slogging through a weekend session. “People say, why aren't you negotiating with Schumer and Jeffries? I quite literally have nothing to negotiate,” Johnson said at one point. “As I've said time and time again, I don't have anything to negotiate with,” he said on day 13 of the shutdown. And besides he said of the GOP lawmakers, “They are doing some of their best work in the district, helping their constituents navigate this crisis.” In many ways, Johnson has become a surprisingly effective leader, an accidental speaker who was elected to the job by his colleagues after all others failed to win it. This year, with Trump's return to the White House, the speaker has commandeered his slim GOP majority and passed legislation including the president's so-called “one big beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending reductions that became law this summer. Johnson's shutdown strategy also largely achieved his goal, forcing Senate Democrats to break ranks and approve the funds to reopen government without the extension of health care subsidies they were demanding to help ease the sticker shock of rising insurance premium costs with the Affordable Care Act. Johnson's approach is seen as one that manages up — he stays close to Trump and says they speak often — and also hammers down, imposing a rigid control over the day-to-day schedule of the House, and its lawmakers. Under a House rules change this year, Johnson was able to keep the chamber shuttered indefinitely on his own, without the usual required vote. This year his leadership team has allowed fewer opportunities for amendments on legislation, according to a recent tally. Other changes have curtailed the House's ability to provide a robust check on the executive branch over Trump's tariffs and use of war powers. Johnson's refusal to swear-in Grijalva is a remarkable flex of the speaker's power, leading to comparisons with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's decision not to consider President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, said David Rapallo, an associate professor and director of the Federal Legislation Clinic at Georgetown University Law Center. But said Short, “The legislative branch has abdicated a lot of responsibility to the executive under his watch.” As lawmakers make their way back to Washington, the speaker's power will be tested again as they consider the package to reopen government. Republicans are certain to have complaints about the bill, which funds much of the federal government through Jan. 30 and keeps certain programs including agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs running through September. But with House Democratic leaders rejecting the package for having failed to address the health care subsidies, it will be up to Johnson to muscle it through with mostly GOP lawmakers — with hardly any room for defections in the chamber that's narrowly split. Jeffries, who has criticized House Republicans for what he called an extended vacation, said, “They're not going to be able to hide this week when they return.”</p>

President Donald Trump participated in a wreath-laying ceremony Tuesday at Arlington National Cemetery to commemorate Veterans Day and honor the nation's fallen service members. He was joined by Vice President JD Vance and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins. "This morning on these hallowed grounds where generations of American heroes rest in eternal glory, we gather to fulfill the sacred duty of every free man and woman. On Veterans Day, we honor those who have worn the uniform, who have borne the battle, who have stood to watch, and whose ranks have formed the mighty wall of flesh and blood, bravery and devotion that has defended our freedom for 250 years," Trump said at the Memorial Amphitheater. "Today, to every veteran, we love our veterans, we say the words too often left unsaid, thank you for your service. And we want to also say thank you for carrying America's fate on your strong, very broad, proud shoulders. President Donald Trump, left, arrives with Vice President JD Vance, to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025. Vance, a Marine veteran, encouraged attendees to thank a veteran for their service and sacrifice. "During my four years of the Marine Corps, I met the very best of America. People who are willing to put on a uniform and risk their lives for their entire country. Just yesterday morning, I met people who lost limbs, who lost very, very important family members, who lost their psychological health," he said, referencing his visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cashier scans groceries, including produce, which is covered by the USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), at a grocery store in Baltimore, Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. It's up to the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress to decide when full payments will resume under the SNAP food aid program that helps 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries, as some wonder how they will feed their families without government assistance. The Supreme Court is expected to rule Tuesday on a request from President Donald Trump's administration to keep blocking states from providing full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, arguing the money might be needed elsewhere. The seesawing rulings mean that beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens or the Supreme Court orders full payments would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it's easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount. In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year. That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what's left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen. “It's kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.” The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help. “I figure that I've spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York. The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere. An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement is set to kick in Tuesday night unless the top court takes action again. “The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gibson said the GOP-proposed map “was drawn with the purpose to favor Republicans,” ruling that it violates Utah's Proposition 4 law, a state ballot initiative passed in 2018 that bans partisan gerrymandering. It also divides both Salt Lake and Davis Counties, which surround the state's main liberal bastion of Salt Lake City. Gibson called the map an “extreme partisan outlier,” based on partisan bias tests conducted on each proposed map in the case. “Map C creates four districts in which zero Democratic statewide candidates have prevailed under the assessed elections,” Gibson wrote in the ruling. “In short, Map C does not comply with Utah law. The selected “Map 1” gives Democrats an over 17-point edge in the Salt Lake County district, according to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis, while Republicans have an over two-to-one lead in the other districts. Utah's current congressional map from 2021 favors Republicans in all four districts by anywhere from 19 to 28 points, according to the same outlet. In a joint statement on the redistricting ruling, Utah Senate and House Democrats said they “feel a deep sense of hope and relief” after the selection of “Map 1.” We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise,” Utah Senate and House Democrats said. The win for Democrats follows California's win with Prop 50, as Democrats make headway in their fight to counter GOP-favored redistricting in states like Texas and North Carolina.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Best known for his images of extravagant, almost sculptural, women's hairstyles, the work of the late Nigerian photographer J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere has been exhibited around the world. Recently, 150 photographs from his archives, most of which hadn't been publicly exhibited before, were the focus of a special exhibition at one of Africa's premier art fairs, ART X Lagos, in Nigeria. Titled “An Exacting Eye,” the exhibition, as well as a masterclass taught by his son Amaize Ojeikere, sought to honor the life and work of one of the country's most prolific documentary photographers. These photos are part of an expansive archive, according to photographer and archivist Amaize, who said his father had “thousands and thousands of negatives.” The exhibition's curator, Missla Libsekal, said investigating the largely analog archive required “time and commitment,” reviewing almost 8,000 images — a fraction of the trove — in a process that took several months. Describing Ojeikere's approach to photography as poetry, she said, “the way he saw the world and how he transformed that perception into an image is quite remarkable. “He translated this into images that enhanced and depicted a particular idea of beauty … It is a talent to make images that keep you engaged and marveling, and that was what he did.” With ART X Lagos celebrating its tenth year, founder Tokini Peterside-Schwebig said highlighting Ojeikere's work was about tribute and reconnection. “It is about ensuring our young people know the artists and teachers who shaped our visual language. The masterclass ensures that younger artists not only engage with his techniques and visual language but also understand the cultural lineage they inherit,” she said. Peterside-Schwebig says this year brought scale, with a “richer and more layered experience that holds both legacy and experimentation,” as well as depth, with offerings like the masterclass and more as part of their strategy to invest more deeply in younger generations. Ojeikere, who died in 2014, documented Nigerian architecture, people and culture for over 60 years, with his most recognized work being the acclaimed “Hairstyles” series. Libsekal said the photographer was saddened that his work was well received internationally but not valued in Nigeria, adding that the exhibition, was “bringing his work home and taking one of many steps to remediate that.” In the exhibition were photos from his early career, festival photography and a range of portraits, as well as new images from the “Hairstyle” series, and photos of Lagos' architecture, coastline and port, from the 1950s to the 1970s, capturing life pre- and post-Nigeria's independence from colonial rule. Amaize said he hoped to impart lessons to the 10 masterclass students about archiving as a practice, but also about his father's tenacity, originality and work ethic. “It's very important that different generations are able to preserve what existed in their time for others to see, because there's so much to learn from the past … so that the present and the future can be better,” he said. With hundreds of thousands of photographs and negatives still in the archive, Amaize said there are plans to build institutions that will allow the work to be viewed by a wider audience for years to come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military has undertaken a campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea using a variety of drones, gunships, and fighter jets, according to people familiar with the assets being deployed. Other strikes have been conducted by manned aircraft, including AC-130J gunships and fighter jets, the sources said. Since early September, the US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. The US military has concentrated many of its assets in Puerto Rico, including the MQ-9 drones, F-35 fighter jets, and at least one AC-130J gunship. The gunship was spotted on October 9 armed with precision-guided missiles for striking ground targets, CNN has reported. Last week, an AC-130J gunship operated by the US Air Force surfaced in El Salvador, at US Cooperative Security Location (CSL) Comalapa, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN. The facilities in both Puerto Rico and El Savador are seeing highly unusual US military activity. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004, is now back up and running, according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base. And while the US facility at El Salvador International Airport has regularly hosted surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft since it was set up in 2000, the outpost had until recently been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the United States Southern Command. Previously, most potential smuggling vessels transiting the Pacific would have been too far from the types of attack aircraft sources said have been used for the campaign, all of which have limited range and were based either in Puerto Rico or the continental US. Exclusive: UK suspends some intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break Before the US began striking alleged drug boats in September, CSL Comalapa played a different role in fighting narcotics trafficking, historically hosting maritime surveillance aircraft, including a Navy P-8A and P-3 Orion operated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The MQ-9 Reapers, at least seven of which are based in Puerto Rico, according to photos captured in Aguadilla, are predominantly used to strike targets with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, a weapon that was originally designed to destroy enemy tanks but that has become a workhorse for the military as part of drone operations against a range of ground targets. The Pentagon shifted its strategy in recent weeks to more frequently striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN has reported. Lawmakers have been seeking answers from the Pentagon about how much the counternarcotics campaign is costing taxpayers, but officials briefing Congress in recent weeks have not provided an overall dollar amount, sources said. One hellfire missile, for example, typically costs about $150,000, and reaper drones cost around $3,500 per hour to fly. The cost per flight hour of an AC-130J gunship is not public but its predecessor, the AC-130U, which was phased out in 2019, cost over $40,000 per hour to fly. But questions have been raised about whether everyone the US has killed is truly a member of, or even affiliated with, one of the dozens of drug cartels the US has designated as terrorist organizations. In several briefings to Congress, including one last week, administration officials have acknowledged that they do not necessarily know the identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it. Strikes are instead conducted based on intelligence that the vessels are linked to a specific cartel or criminal organization, CNN has reported. A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally have been located in US Southern Command since last month. Administration officials have told Congress that the Ford is moving there to support counternarcotic operations and conduct intelligence gathering, two of the sources said, but its deployment to the region is raising questions about whether President Donald Trump could soon launch strikes against Venezuela. In a briefing last month, two senior US Special Operations officers could not explain why the administration needed so many powerful military assets stationed in the Caribbean just to blow up small boats, a source familiar with the closed-door session on Capitol Hill said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everything was set for the Navy officer to take over a new role that would have capped an already distinguished career— and made her the first woman in a Naval Special Warfare command overseeing Navy SEALs. A formal ceremony marking her new position was planned for July. But just two weeks before the ceremony, her command was abruptly canceled with little explanation, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Under the Navy's “up or out” policy, with no command slot to take, the officer's more than two-decade military career was effectively over. But multiple people familiar with the dynamics of Navy personnel matters scoffed at those explanations. For one, the Navy doesn't typically restructure commands by axing an incoming commanding officer days before they are set to take over. The Pentagon did not respond to specific questions from CNN about her situation, including what role, if any, Hegseth played. Her story encapsulates what many in the military now fear is a culture of misogyny permeating the US armed forces under Hegseth. CNN spoke to more than a dozen active-duty women across the military branches, all of whom expressed a deep and growing alarm that Hegseth's actions, policies and rhetoric risk pushing out both experienced soldiers and those interested in joining. Several said they knew of other female servicemembers who had recently been passed over for deserved promotions. Others said they are now considering leaving the military. CNN asked the Pentagon about Hegseth's views on women in the military, including claims that women are considering leaving service and feel they are not valued. In some cases, pseudonyms are used to describe them. CNN also spoke to multiple senior male servicemembers as well as several retired female servicemembers – some of whom were reluctant to publicly criticize the administration over fears that their veterans' benefits could be taken away. With Hegseth at the helm, many who spoke to CNN felt women are no longer wanted in uniform— a potentially seismic shift since they make up roughly 18% of the US military. “To be quite honest, I am fearful for women in uniform right now,” said Patti J. Tutalo, a retired Coast Guard commander who served on a decades-old advisory group for women in the military before it was shut down this year. “I definitely think there will be a retention issue for women,” Tutalo added. He also scrapped the advisory panel Tutalo was part of: the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, which recommended best practices to support women in uniform including securing properly fitting body armor and appropriate health care. And he's vowed to take away the ability to file anonymous whistleblower complaints, a key tool for reporting allegations of sexual assault. Among these were fitness standards that he claimed were eased in recent years to make it possible for women to serve in combat roles. “If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it,” Hegseth said. But men and women alike who spoke to CNN said that Hegseth's claims are flatly false, and that physical standards are gender-neutral for combat positions — a sentiment that is borne out by the experiences of numerous women in combat roles. For the Navy captain whose command orders were revoked, she met every physical standard, multiple sources familiar with her qualifications said. That included being able to perform 25 lb weighted pull-ups. According to a retired senior enlisted Navy SEAL who served with her at SEAL Team Six, there was never any question about her qualifications for the role, particularly amid the debate of diversity hires. There is absolutely no DEI ,” the retired SEAL told CNN, adding that the captain spent her spare time competing in IRONMAN races. She would have overseen bomb disposal technicians and divers in addition to Navy SEALs, three communities in which she had worked. For Hailey Gibbons, an Army veteran who was among the first women to graduate from Ranger School after it was opened to women a decade ago, the idea that women aren't meeting the same standards as men is “laughable.” Her initial physical test at Ranger School – a grueling two-month training course – was the same as her male comrades, she said: 49 pushups, 59 sit-ups, and a five-mile run in under 40 minutes, plus six chin-ups. Hegseth is making it okay for others in the military to say, “women can't do this,” said Gibbons, who served in the Army's elite 75th Ranger Regiment. Another woman in the Army who spoke to CNN – an enlisted soldier in a combat arms unit – said that she is already feeling real-life effects of Hegseth's September speech. Following the secretary's remarks, she said a male noncommissioned officer in her unit told her: “All you women are getting out now.” “I want nothing to do with the military after this,” she said. In a statement to CNN, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said women “are excited to serve under the strong leadership of Secretary Hegseth and President Trump.” When then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced the change in 2015, Kate was elated. For Kate, a pseudonym CNN is using to protect her identity, the announcement meant being able to continue a family legacy. She had grown up wanting to follow in her father's footsteps and serve in the Marines, the last branch to officially integrate women into combat roles. She headed to Marines basic training in 2017, finished with some of the highest fitness marks after boot camp and listed a combat role as her first choice. “I was really proud to be part of that first wave of women serving in a combat arms job,” said Kate, now a Marine Corps officer. And in some ways, it felt harder, Kate said, because she was made to feel unwelcome. “I had to go above and beyond the standard because I had way stricter eyeballs on me than a lot of my male counterparts.” Hegseth's views on women were well-known before he took over the Pentagon. Those views toward women are particularly popular among many in the special operations community, several female servicemembers said. “A lot of people in special operations like [Hegseth] because he's getting back to a place where physical toughness is the most important thing,” said the Navy special operations source. Women in other branches said the services had become a more welcoming place in recent years, but many are now questioning if policy changes are reversing that trend. They feared that Hegseth's remarks and deeds could embolden more mistreatment of women from commanders throughout the ranks. One woman, an experienced Air Force officer whom CNN is referring to as Anne, has served with specialized units and deployed on multiple combat tours. She loves her work and is proud of her service, but lately, Hegseth's rhetoric “has impacted how I see myself in the military,” Anne said. It is hard not to feel scrutinized, she said, pointing out that “almost every woman I know in the military has deleted their social media presence.” Smaller changes clearly aimed at women are also demoralizing colleagues she knows, Anne said. She pointed to new grooming standards that further restrict the muted colors of nail polish women can wear, and ban false eyelashes. “For women, getting your nails done was just a small way to relax and still, within regulations, be able to have something that looked both professional and made them feel confident,” Anne said. Kate, the Marine Corps officer, who is Black, said the new grooming regulations requiring women to gel back baby hairs and for all men to be clean-shaven unfairly target people of color, particularly Black men who disproportionately suffer from a skin condition that causes painful razor bumps and scarring. She and others questioned how these new rules improve force readiness. Anne and other female servicemembers who spoke to CNN said they are particularly concerned that policies Hegseth has vowed to enact could make the military a dangerous place. Hegseth railed against anonymous and repeat complaints   to the military's equal opportunity and inspector general offices, vowing to take away a tool that allows soldiers and defense personnel to file whistleblower complaints, report leadership or point out discrimination. Anonymous complaints for sexual assault – called restricted reports – made up over a third of sexual assault reports in the military in fiscal year 2024. Without an avenue for a servicemember to make them, several women said, men and women alike could decide not to report at all. Though it is unclear when this change to the reporting process will occur, women who spoke to CNN said the mechanisms to investigate misconduct inside the military are already flawed, and Hegseth's new edict would make things worse. A veteran-turned-Defense Department civilian who CNN is identifying as Mary, a pseudonym, said that joining the armed forces 20 years ago was “the best thing” she's ever done. But now, despite her teenage daughter's participation in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, Mary said she wouldn't want her child to join. “I do not feel confident that there is a new era and a new generation of leaders who are going to make a significant cultural change, where she will not be subjected to sexism or sexual harassment or even potential for sexual assault,” Mary said. But many of those women would have actually signed up to serve six months to a year before that, putting them as having joined in 2024, explained Ky Hunter, PhD, a Marine Corps veteran and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. That means the impacts of the current policies and rhetoric on recruitment may not be fully known until this time next year, Hunter added. “Women are going to feel that they don't have a place in the military anymore,” Hunter said. While some women told CNN they feel women are getting pushed out by this administration, others said they now feel more compelled to stay and improve things. “Part of me doesn't want to leave, because if I do, who will take my place?” For the Navy captain whose change of command was canceled she's now unexpectedly winding down a trailblazing career in the Navy. It makes her former SEAL Team Six teammate furious. That's horse shit,” the former senior enlisted SEAL said. He voted for and supports Trump, but says he thinks Secretary Hegseth's personal views are blinding him from retaining obvious talent at the expense of some of the military's most elite warfighters. “It pisses me off because it is clearly someone who is capable and has done extraordinary things and is being punished because of — and I hate that I have to say it this way — weak-ass men,” they said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In what became a seven-week war of attrition, Republicans finally won over the eight crossover votes needed to clear a Senate filibuster and begin the process of reopening the government on Sunday night. Those eight breakaway senators were quick to point out the back pay guaranteed for furloughed workers plus a new and late-developing concession: the White House would reverse thousands of layoffs it had initiated after the shutdown began on Oct. 1. Republicans agreed to reboot bipartisan spending talks, with a package of yearlong bills passed Monday alongside a short funding patch into January. That subsidies vote is a far cry from what Democrats have been demanding since before the shutdown began. At first, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wanted a permanent extension of the subsidies and, later on, could not get Republicans to commit to a one-year deal. But Democrats did succeed in making healthcare a rallying cry with their base, dragging out the shutdown long enough to get past off-year elections in Virginia, New Jersey, and beyond. Ultimately, Democrats caved once it became politically untenable to continue, with centrist “yes” votes citing airport delays and a freeze on food stamp benefits. The funding deal vindicates Senate Majority Leader John Thune's (R-SD) decision not to negotiate the subsidies until Democrats cooperate on funding. That negotiating position was shared by the rest of congressional GOP leadership and the White House, but pressure was applied unevenly to Democrats. Early on, the White House decided to keep paying troops unilaterally and prevented a program for low-income families from shuttering. It was not until food stamps payments were put at risk that Democrats became exasperated, with the White House insisting it did not have the legal authority to keep doling out benefits. By the time a deal came together, the Federal Aviation Administration was ordering hundreds of flights to be canceled due to staffing shortages. He described a conversation he had this past week with the head of the air traffic controllers at Chicago O'Hare International Airport as an inflection point. “There were more and more people who said this has gone on way too long,” Durbin added, arguing that Democrats had stood their ground and had nothing more to gain by prolonging the shutdown. He put a House-passed funding bill on the Senate floor well over a dozen times and, when Democrats were not budging, forced them to vote on “rifle shot” bills that would have opened the government in piecemeal fashion, all of which failed. But Republicans remained united long enough that centrists were convinced it was futile to stick with their Obamacare demands. Thune offered a meeting with Trump over the subsidies once the government reopens, though that meeting has yet to be announced. And obviously, what we have today isn't working.” He stayed just as dug-in as Thune, at least publicly, and decided to join most of his caucus in voting against the funding bill. But Schumer was navigating the shutdown fight with his left flank already upset that he caved back in March, when Republicans won a separate funding standoff. That earlier standoff led to a flurry of speculation that the length of the shutdown was performative and meant to ease blowback in New York, where he could face a primary challenger in 2028. Schumer, for his part, has dismissed claims that he wanted to get past the elections or, relatedly, break the 35-day shutdown record set in Trump's first term. He noted last week that he and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the House minority leader, have requested multiple meetings with Trump to overcome the impasse. His deputies also denied that Schumer privately blessed the deal as progressive Democrats began to once again call for his resignation as Democratic leader. “I've been in many of those rooms, and he fought like hell against that,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), who is slated to replace Durbin as Democratic whip when he retires next year. To a large extent, the deal that emerged was a byproduct of negotiations that were already underway between congressional appropriators. But Republicans argued that the best move for Democrats, who spent months complaining that Trump was illegally defying Congress on spending, was to jump-start the appropriations process. The group negotiating that compromise got larger as Democrats began to entertain an end to the shutdown, with Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) serving as a go-between for Republicans and Schumer. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Angus King (I-ME), an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, took the lead on rank-and-file talks. The most notable concession, a moratorium on Trump's layoffs through January and a reversal of those he initiated during the shutdown, was inspired by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), who represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers in Virginia. Thune told reporters on Monday that he believed the White House was “involved in all the discussions around that subject,” which picked up traction only a couple of days before a deal was reached. As for the vote on Obamacare subsidies, Thune gave Democrats a commitment that a bill would be brought to the floor by the second week of December, though Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will not give a similar commitment in the House, leading Senate Democrats to question their sincerity on getting a healthcare deal done.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Its roots spilled over the side like melting candle wax. I scrambled up the cliff for a better view of the canopy, when I saw something staring back at me: a lemur. It had scruffy white fur, a black face with bug-eyes, and a tail that was at least the length of its body. This wasn't just any lemur; it was a Verreaux's sifaka: a critically endangered species that I've spent much of my life longing to see. This fall, Vox is publishing a three-part series on conservation in Madagascar, supported by the BAND Foundation. Madagascar, an island nation east of continental Africa, is the only place on Earth where lemurs exist. There are more than 100 lemur species, and nearly all of them are at risk of extinction, including the sifaka. Their foe is deforestation; all lemurs depend on trees for food and shelter, and half or more of the country's forests are now gone. In Madagascar, unlike in many other forested nations, the bulk of deforestation isn't caused by the industrial-scale farming and cattle ranching that often enriches big corporations. Forests here are primarily felled by individual families who cut trees to grow crops or collect cooking fuel. That's how many people feed themselves and make money. They often have few other options; Madagascar ranks among the top five poorest countries in the world, and people here have few economic opportunities that don't rely on exploitation. Against this dim reality, the lemur before me represented something hopeful. And this tree was still standing, because nearby villages have worked hard against tough odds to protect the forest they all share. The road was mostly dirt and spotted with crater-sized potholes, which — along with several goat-related traffic jams — turned a 15-mile trip into a three-hour, butt-bruising adventure. Working alongside staff from WWF, they manage a protected area called Amoron'i Onilahy. The park is only around 250,000 acres — making it a little larger than New York City — yet it envelops a wide variety of ecosystems, from wetlands to spiny thickets and a huge number of rare species, including eight kinds of primates. The island nation is packed full of different habitat types, which is one reason why it has a higher proportion of endemic species than any other place on Earth. Protected areas — which typically restrict certain activities that degrade ecosystems and endanger biodiversity — have a mixed record of success. One reason is that most of Madagascar's parks lack the funds to monitor vast areas for illegal woodcutting. But a bigger challenge is that few protected areas confront the reason why people cut trees at all: their own survival. “Deforestation and illegal exploitation are still impacting nearly all protected areas despite 30 years of intensive conservation efforts,” as the authors of one study put it. Demonstrators — largely led by Gen Z — expressed outrage over water, electricity shortages, and a lack of economic opportunities. The protests continued for days, supercharged by broader grievances including corruption and poor governance. Col. Michael Randrianirina is now in control of a transitional government that's meant to organize elections within two years. The government upheaval highlights the deep level of human need in Madagascar, which drives people to exploit free natural resources. Amoron'i Onilahy, however, appears to be an exception. There are a few things you notice right away in Maroamalo: Many of its homes are made of mud, rock, and plant fiber; chickens, ducks, and goats seem to be wandering around everywhere; and just behind the village center, where the land slopes into the river valley, there are acres of verdant farmland, which pop against the surrounding brown Earth. It was as if a patchy green quilt had been laid across the valley. Worldwide, agriculture is the number one threat to biodiversity. But here in Maroamalo, farming is actually helping keep the forest intact. Only about one in three people in Madagascar have access to electricity, and even fewer people use natural gas. That's why nearly everyone cooks with either simple firewood or, in more urban areas, charcoal — a carbon-rich fuel source produced from tree branches. Around cities like Toliara, making charcoal is how many people earn money to pay for food, school supplies, and medical bills. In Madagascar, that's enough to buy a few meals. Charcoal production was once common among villages in the region like Maroamalo, said Nanie Ratsifandrihamanana, who leads WWF's work in Madagascar. That's one reason why the river basin has lost so many of its trees. Shifting cultivation, better known as slash-and-burn agriculture, further eroded the forests here. People would burn one plot of forest to clear the way for crops, and then, once the soil was exhausted and weeds took over, do the same thing in another. Across nearly all of Madagascar, and much of Africa, these are among the two largest forces that raze forests. WWF has long been aware of these problems. So, more than a decade ago, staff from the organization began talking with communities here about how they could earn money without cutting trees. Losing trees also made the landscape drier and more likely to flood. WWF later worked with villages along the river — which are now part of the protected area — to build out economies that don't exploit the remaining tracts of forest. Instead of only growing staples like cassava and corn, the village would cultivate a wide variety of vegetables to sell in Toliara. They'd also help connect farmers to buyers in the city, including hotels. The idea was that if people could earn more money from farming, they wouldn't need to clear forests for charcoal. Later that morning, Mme Lalao, a resident of Maroamalo who oversees farming in the village, walked me through the vegetable fields. She showed me ten or so different crops — including eggplant, cabbage, and onions — all planted in neat rows, like what you might see in California. One vegetable farmer can earn about $21 per month, according to Mercie Ramilanajoroharivelo, a WWF employee who works with the communities. That's far more than people typically make from selling charcoal, Ramilanajoroharivelo told me. “We didn't have the agriculture skills before, so people would go into the forest for charcoal,” Lalao said that morning. Creating new economies only goes so far in protecting the forests and lemurs of Amoron'i Onilahy. While villagers inside the park now seldom bake charcoal or burn the forest, people who migrate here from other areas are still cutting trees. When deforestation, droughts, and floods make it hard to farm or find wood in one area, people move to another in search of a better life. And climate change is making those sorts of moves more common. “That's two places: the coast where you can do beach seining, or the forest where you can produce charcoal. Things like charcoal production are a livelihood of last resort.” It had bigger trees, denser undergrowth, and lots of life. On a walk in the woods that night, I saw chameleons hiding in the trees; fruit bats flying overhead; and, of course, hissing cockroaches (which do, I confirmed, actually hiss). The next morning, around sunrise, I met up with a group of men from Mahaleotse known as polisin'ala, or forest rangers. Villages in Amoron'i Onilahy that work with WWF have a team of paid patrollers. They walk the forest 10 times each month, receiving about $2 per patrol from WWF. If they spot illegal woodcutting, they'll try to stop it and report the infraction back to their community and environmental authorities. In some cases, the perpetrator will have to pay a fine. Outsiders who come here to cut wood are often desperate for money, but local villagers don't want to lose the surrounding forest and the benefits it provides. “It was their decision to destroy their own forest, so that doesn't mean they get to destroy ours,” Renama Zatompo Mahinty, one of the patrollers in Mahaleotse, said of migrants from outside villages. “If I tear my own T-shirt, that doesn't give me the right to take someone else's.” They were wrapped in each other's fluffy black-and-white tails and hardly moving, because, as Roland said, they had just woken up. Ring-tailed lemurs are endangered, yet, in just an hour that morning, we saw two different troops of them — a sign that something here is working. “It's not really a matter of money,” Roland said that morning. Madagascar is among the most challenging places on Earth for wildlife conservation. Political unrest hampers the flow of foreign aid, weakens law enforcement, and disrupts tourism, which is a vehicle to fund environmental protection. And poverty leaves people with little choice but to depend on activities that erode the forest. Those are some of the reasons why a lot of non-governmental organization (NGO) projects fail, as I wrote in October. Data from WWF is limited and more mixed. Amoron'i Onilahy hasn't lost any forest cover this year through June, the most recent months of data, WWF says. Donors tend to be drawn to projects that sound new and exciting rather than funding the same activities for years and years, he said. What's also worth pointing out is that strategies to restrict charcoal production in Amoron'i Onilahy don't quell demand for it nationwide. If people stop cutting trees in this forest, they might just do it elsewhere. Yet, Amoron'i Onilahy does offer important lessons on how to help conservation succeed in other challenging parts of the world. Investing in non-exploitative economies is essential, even if building businesses doesn't sound like “conservation.” Even more important is that local communities lead the work themselves and don't forever rely on external organizations like WWF for help, said Ranaivo Rasolofoson, a researcher at the University of Toronto and an expert on forest conservation in Madagascar. Large environmental NGOs don't have a great track record of yielding control to people who live in the environments they're trying to protect. WWF, for its part, has made some grave mistakes that put conservation at conflict with human rights. But here, the communities are choosing how they want to conserve the forest, and WWF is just there to provide support. Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination in Madagascar, and ardent observers, I was told, will sometimes make pilgrimages to this spot. I first encountered these animals in a BBC nature show more than two decades ago. Back then, I imagined that wildlife in a place like this lived — as nature shows made it seem — within vast stretches of wilderness, far from human life. Yet, that's not how these animals really exist, and it never has been. I came face-to-face with this critically endangered lemur at a roadside shrine between two villages. Humans and animals share the landscape here, so it's only logical that, for conservation to work, it must consider the needs of both. Rising power bills quietly shaped this year's races — and gave Democrats a new attack line on climate. But his policies are making gas cars more expensive too. The Category 5 storm is an extraordinary threat — even in a season that felt unusually quiet. ﻿People in the Caribbean need help now — and for years to come.</p>

President Donald Trump's legal team appealed to the Supreme Court on Monday a New York jury's 2023 verdict that found him liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll decades ago. 

Trump has denied Carroll's accusation that he sexually abused her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s, suggesting she first publicly brought up the matter in 2019 to help promote her book that year. After the president accused Carroll of lying and said she was not “my type,” the writer mounted a successful defamation lawsuit against him. 

The president's latest move to challenge the decision at the Supreme Court comes as he has hit a number of legal hurdles in contesting the jury's verdict that he should be liable for sexual assault and defamation. 

Trump's lawyers argued in court filings Monday that “no physical or DNA evidence corroborates Carroll's story” after initially filing an application to appeal the case at the Supreme Court in September. The appeal has not yet appeared on the Supreme Court's public docket, and it remains unclear whether the justices will agree to hear the case, according to Axios.

“There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation,” his team wrote in a 33-page petition. Lawyers contended that allegations leading to the $5 million verdict were “propped up” by a “series of indefensible evidentiary rulings” that allowed Carroll's lawyers to present “highly inflammatory propensity evidence” against him, including the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape and testimony from other women who accused Trump of sexual assault, which he denies.

WHERE THE REMAINING LEGAL CASES AGAINST TRUMP STAND

“Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th President, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself,” the petition reads. 

The country's highest court must intervene to reverse “facially implausible, politically motivated allegations,” it reads.</p>
