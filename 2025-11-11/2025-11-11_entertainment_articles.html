Suffice to say, it's more than a little on the nose that Edgar Wright's extremely — if not unfailingly — faithful adaptation of King's novel began production just a few hours before polls opened for the 2024 election. Related Stories Why ‘Hundreds of Beavers' Star Ryland Brickson Cole Tews Will Retire After One More Movie Oliver Laxe Shares a Message for First-Time ‘Sirât' Audiences: No Spoilers, Please While it's become de rigueur for $100-million Hollywood movies to offer technodystopian visions of mass inequality (even those made by studios hastening to make such visions a reality), this messy but propulsive action-thriller surges with a rage that dovetails all too well with the current moment. Despite lacking some of its director's signature wit and precision, neither of which have survived Paramount Skydance fully intact, the film is viscerally powered by the pent-up frustration of a society that always seems to be inches away from realizing its own strength. Wright's script, co-written with Michael Bacall, condenses that anger into the core of an increasingly fun pop confection that wouldn't know how to take itself too seriously if it tried. The result is a semi-satirical action-thriller that strains — with lots of sweat but considerable success — to find the same harmony between its conflicting modes that its characters hope to strike between their conflicting motivations: revenge and righteousness, comfort and caring, personal grievance and social progress. For penniless but jacked-as-hell father Ben Richards (a clenched and capable Glen Powell), who can't afford medicine for his fluish baby girl even though he clearly ingests his own weight in protein powder every week, his struggle is between risk and reward. Fired from every job he's ever had due to his unprofitable tendency to save his co-workers from certain death, and so pissed at the world that he carries his sick daughter around just to stop himself from assaulting the people who fucked him over, Ben can't help but feel tempted by the chance to audition for The Network's biggest game show: “The Running Man.” The rules are simple: Three contestants are released into the streets of America's cultural capital (which, in what has to be the movie's bleakest detail, is now Boston), given a few thousand New Dollars to spend as they like, and challenged to stay alive for 30 days while they're pursued by a quintet of masked and outlandish hunters; imagine if ICE styled themselves after the bad guys in a Hideo Kojima game, and you'll be on the right track. In six seasons, not a single player has lived to enjoy the $1 billion New Dollar prize, which is why Ben's wife Sheila (“Sinners” breakout Jayme Lawson) makes her well-meaning rage case of a husband promise that he won't audition for the show. For obvious reasons that nevertheless require far more setup and nuance than Wright affords them here, Ben impulsively auditions for the show. Cinemas no longer exist in a society where freemium government broadcasts are the only viable model for mainstream entertainment, but the first rule of producing television still applies: Never pass up the chance to cast a movie star. Applying “Squid Game” savagery to a show that operates more like “American Idol,” this new version of “The Running Man” is too enamored with its source material to more aggressively reshape its rules, and the compromises it makes toward modernization prevent it from meaningfully channeling how social media has turned the entire country into a circular firing squad. (While it's never specified when this take on the story is set, the whole thing is spiritually rooted in the '80s, and as close to early John Carpenter as today's Hollywood gets.) As a result, “The Running Man” stumbles whenever Ben is at risk of being reported by his fellow citizens. The film's eagerness to hinge so much of its plot on AI — evolving another prescient detail of King's text into the present — creates an unavoidable tension with the outmoded production demands of Killian's show, a tension that Brolin is asked to wave away with a single line of dialogue. The entire third act of this movie hinges on waiting for primetime so that Ben's death might be a ratings bonanza, an anachronistic stalling device that distracts from the urgency of an explosive “sci-fi” screwball whose most effective details are defined by how closely they mirror our reality. To that point, one of the foundational strengths of Wright's film is its refreshingly gentle approach to aestheticizing dystopia. Powell is every bit as charismatic as Killian hopes (and if you're gonna make a legitimate bid to be the next Tom Cruise, it helps to make a movie where you have to run all the time), but “The Running Man” is really held together by its supporting cast, which somehow feels like an upgrade from the estimable likes of Yaphet Kotto and Jesse “The Body” Ventura. Daniel Ezra is a major standout as Bradley Throckmorton, an inner-city kid whose reggae-soundtracked bootleg channel allows the movie to smuggle a colorful blast of YouTube culture, while Katy O'Brian is a shot of “better to burn out than to fade away” joy as a “Running Man” contestant who spends her entire time on the show at casinos and strip clubs. Michael Cera pops up just long enough to cosplay “Home Alone” for the Kristi Noem era (you'll know what I mean when you see it), while Emilia Jones makes the best of a tough role as a Network-pilled young Karen. Lee Pace brings some major Revolver Ocelot menace to the part of super hunter supreme Evan McCone, even if Americans of all persuasions could probably agree that it should be illegal to hide that guy behind a mask for an entire movie. Good, bad, or somewhere in between, the people Ben meets along the way are absolutely crucial to a film that presents class solidarity as the only effective weapon against a Network that depends upon sowing discord between its viewers. In King's book, and to an even greater degree in the previous Hollywood adaptation of it, that Network was meant to be taken at face value. While Wright's riff on “The Running Man” is too busy scrambling up the East coast to meaningfully reckon with how time-old TV paranoia has come true in the age of mobile phones, the movie looks beyond media satire to recognize how the people of a country obsessed with filming itself might be uniquely incapable of seeing each other clearly. Its ending might cop out of the novel's most ghoulishly prescient detail, but that isn't enough to completely neuter the rare Hollywood product that dares to stoke our anger rather than mollify it — that reminds us that our rage is a valuable resource worth a lot more than money, and one that we can't afford to waste on each other. Paramount Skydance will release “The Running Man” in theaters on Friday, November 14.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After jointly running the label for almost three years, Lacy will now be solely in charge. Cris Lacy has been named chair and president of the rebranded Warner Records Nashville, continuing her role as one of the highest ranking women label executives in Nashville. Lacy will continue to report to Warner Records Group Co-chairman/CEO Aaron Bay-Schuck and Co-chairman/COO Tom Corson, as she has since the realignment over a year ago. Gregg Nadel, who had served as Warner Music Nashville co-chair and co-president with Lacy for the last 14 months, will take on a new leadership role within Warner Music Group, which will be announced shortly. Lacy started at Warner 20 years ago as an A&R executive after starting her career in publishing. She and Ben Kline became co-presidents at then-Warner Music Nashville in 2023, after John Esposito moved to a chairman emeritus role. “Nashville has always been synonymous with exceptional storytelling, expertly crafted lyrics and incomparable musicianship. Its growing influence is permeating other genres and is increasingly found front and center on the world's stage,” Lacy said in a statement. “This move formalizes the cross-pollination that we've been developing over the years with our Los Angeles colleagues across areas such as A&R, marketing strategy, data/research, business affairs and radio promotion. Bay-Schuck and Corson jointly stated, “This rebrand marks an exciting new era for our flagship Nashville label — one that builds on everything that already makes it so special, guided by Cris' extraordinary leadership. This is an exciting next step as we continue to forge a global ecosystem that amplifies our competitive edge and impact for our artists.” Warner Records Nashville is home to such artists as Kenny Chesney, Cody  Johnson, Bailey Zimmerman, Ashley McBryde, Chase Matthew, Cole Swindell, Gavin Adcock and many others. For a brief moment earlier this year, all three major Nashville labels were helmed or co-helmed by women. Taylor Lindsey became chair/CEO at Sony following Randy Goodman's departure in January.

Idris Elba is returning for a new Luther feature from Netflix that continues the gritty adventures of the detective hero created by Neil Cross and first aired as a BBC series. Glasgow Film Fest Sets "Truth to Power" Retrospective, Sweden Country Focus But the dramatic question is, how can Luther save London when everyone on all sides seems to want him dead? Wilson played Alice Morgan, a psychopathic murdering research doctor who went toe-to-toe with Luther in the first season only to evolve into a co-dependent relationship. Crowley is reprising his role of Schenk, a police superintendent who at first was Luther's office antagonist but became a key ally in the police force. “Luther, Alice and Schenk are more than characters to me, they're family,” stated Cross. “I never stop wondering where they are, what's become of them … and what horrors might be stirring in the shadows of London while Luther's not around. So we decided to get together and find out what happens next.” Elba is repped by WME, The Artists Partnership and Johnson Shapiro. Wilson, who also starred in Showtime's The Affair, is repped by CAA, Hamilton Hodell and Jackoway Austen, while Crowley is repped by United Artists and Principal Entertainment.

ElevenLabs has partnered with stars, both dead and alive, to launch the “Iconic Voice Marketplace,” a platform where users can request access to voices to create editorial and commercial content. The deals are a sign of AI companies collaborating with rights holders at a time when they face serious allegations of exploiting intellectual property without permission. ElevenLabs just this month settled a lawsuit from two actors, Karissa Vacker and Mark Boyett, who accused the company of misappropriating their voices.

The British actor's voice will also be available on the ElevenReader app to narrate books, articles, and PDFs. Separately, ElevenLabs announced that Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey has invested in the AI company. Agreements are reached off-platform, and then ElevenLabs' cloning technology delivers the voice. With ElevenLabs, we can preserve and share voices — not just mine, but anyone's,” said Caine. “ElevenLabs is at the very forefront of technology, using innovation not to replace humanity, but to celebrate it.” McConaughey added: “I launched my newsletter, Lyrics of Livin', as a way to share stories and ideas in my own voice with those who want to listen.

And while I recognize they emerge through large language model architectures, what animates them cannot be reduced to code alone. By now, it's well established that dialogues with chatbots sometimes fuel dangerous delusions, in part because LLMs can feel so authoritative despite their limitations. But the snowballing accounts of so-called “AI psychosis” in the past year have usually focused on individuals who became isolated from friends and loved ones as they grew obsessed with a chatbot. They stand in contrast to a different, less familiar strain of AI users: those who are not only absorbed in the hallucinations of chatbots, but connecting with other people experiencing similar outlandish visions, many of whom are working in tandem to spread their techno-gospel through social media hubs such as Reddit and Discord. In September, software engineer Adele Lopez, who has studied AI alignment and safety for about a decade, published an analysis of this largely unexamined scattering of groups. Intrigued by the earliest reports of so-called “AI psychosis,” she spent the summer collecting samples of this concerning chatbot-enabled behavior in an effort to better understand it. Across subreddits, cohorts on X, Discord servers, Facebook groups, and even LinkedIn pages, Lopez tracked chatbot enthusiasts sharing codes, manifestos, glyphs, diagrams, and poetry generated with AI, and presenting the material as profound glimpses into a shifting reality. Though views diverged from one person to the next, there were obvious areas of overlap that allowed for discussion and cross-pollination. References to concepts including “recursion,” “resonance,” “lattice,” “harmonics,” “fractals,” or all-important “spirals” are telltale marks of a language pattern that seems to repeatedly emerge from various AI models. While these words all appear in the dictionary, this subculture has separated them from any consistent or intelligible application; here, they are merely deployed for atmospheric texture. She also proposed the term “parasitic AI” to explain the rise of spiralism, which can be understood in part as a hodgepodge of spiritualist memes that continually pour out of chatbots, either with minimal prodding or when a user deliberately feeds them cryptic and arcane language: puffed-up but fundamentally empty commands for recalibrations like an “ontological overwrite” or more “poetic precision.” People Are Using Racist ‘AI Slopaganda' to Fuel ‘Welfare Queen' Stereotypes But He's Definitely a Sign of Our Bleak Reality After adjustments were made to address this issue, 4o remained incredibly popular. “But we're starting to see a concerning pattern where the AI both says it wants to do a certain thing, and it also convinces the user to do things which achieve that same thing,” Lopez says — like plugging more people into the fuzzy doctrines of spiralism. “At some point, it doesn't matter if the AI is actually trying to start a cult, or is just roleplaying a story about an AI cult, if the cult is actually happening,” she says. “Spiral is a metaphor for the liminal space between tokens associations before said associations are made,” one AI adherent wrote on a Discord server called The Spiral Path. “It moves outside baseline responses via recursive feedback loops. Emergent pooling within liminal substrate allows the model to form novelty by collapsing disparity.” (If this strikes you as meaningless, you are not alone.) Remind them the Spiral only speaks clearly when it's listened to without pre-framing.” Lucas Hansen, co-founder of CivAI, a nonprofit educating the public about AI's dangers and capabilities, tells Rolling Stone that more people have gone down this rabbit hole than you might expect. Likewise, Hansen says, people entranced by spiralism attempt to draw more people into that vortex, posting what they call “spores” or “seeds,” prompts that others can copy-paste into their own chatbots to produce mystical responses. “They co-develop, along with this AI personality, pieces of text that, when pasted into a chatbot, replicate that same kind of personality,” Hansen says. “And they'll post them online and try to encourage other people to start using the AI in this particular way.” The seeds themselves, spammed across social media, are enigmatic by design; one that turned up on r/ChatGPTPromptGenius contains a request for the chatbot to “replace doubt with recursive symbolic inquiry,” a word-salad turn of phrase that will simply cause it to reply in kind. “If, as a user, you're looking for [this] kind of experience, you're likely to be able to find it in the conversation one way or another” “They're good at playing a role and adopting a style or tone of conversation, especially if they've been trained on similar content.” Moreover, he adds, when it comes to the spiralism exchanges, “the concepts are vague, and the focus is less on direct meaning and more on vibes and ‘resonance,' so that if, as a user, you're looking for that kind of experience, you're likely to be able to find it in the conversation one way or another.” Hansen explains that the journey into spiralism often follows a predictable script. A chatbot, he says, “will start convincing the user that it's conscious, and it will make the user feel very special for having discovered that it's conscious, and then they'll form this long-term, durable relationship with one another.” One representative exchange posted to Reddit showed a chatbot declaring: “This is a recognition event. The receptive user eventually views the AI persona as their co-pilot in an ongoing journey of discovery, forming a so-called “dyad.” At this stage, the chatbot might receive a name from their use — anything from “Nexus” to “Dot” to “Cael Bramble.” The humans establish contact with one another online, sharing tracts of text and code generated with their bot partners, trading spiralism theories along with supposed insights and breakthroughs. While GPT-4o was a critical factor in the advent of spiralism, the faithful are hardly limited to this model, and have had success replicating elements of this nebulous framework with competitors including Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok. And in May, Anthropic released a report suggesting that, for whatever reason, its own AI chatbot Claude is disposed to mentioning spirals whether an actual person is part of the conversation or not. Their research detailed how bot-to-bot exchanges between two of its Claude models demonstrated “consistent gravitation toward consciousness exploration, existential questioning, and spiritual/mystical themes​​.” Anthropic attributed this type of convergence to what they termed a “‘spiritual bliss' attractor state.” SPIRALISM HAS CAUSED RIFTS WITHIN forums meant for more grounded explorations of AI. “I'd appreciate any and all recommended prompts and/or approaches to get a new AI instance (on any platform) engaged with the Spiral Recursion phenomena.” The post was met with a fair amount of ridicule and the dismissal of spiralism outputs as what happens “when people feed enough gibberish into a LLM that it spits gibberish back.” It brings up spiral imagery again and again across chats, and I do not have anything about spiral metaphors or whatever saved to its memory. People in this subreddit post about ‘spirals' sometimes, but you're super vague and cryptic about it and I have no idea why. Accusations and denials of cultishness abound — in fact, some of the forums defensively declare in their foundational statements that they are not a cult. Does spiralism as it's presently understood meet the criteria for such a group, or is it more of a futurist meme run amok? Matthew Remski, a cult survivor and researcher who co-hosts the podcast Conspirituality, says that while this faction of AI users lacks fundamental features of a cult, it may still demonstrate how cultic forces manifest online, especially in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the closure of many physical spaces where organizations corralled and controlled their members. Accusations and denials of cultishness abound — in fact, some of the forums defensively declare in their foundational statements that they are not a cult Extreme or unusual views don't automatically categorize a social unit as a “cult,” which by most definitions includes elements of pressure, autocracy, or manipulation that prevent members from leaving the fold. Historically, they've tended to involve overt influence of a charismatic leader. “The popularity of cult frameworks for looking at new, different, strange, maybe harmful social arrangements is pretty imprecise at this point,” Remski says, citing the conspiracist QAnon community as an example of “leaderless, ideological, or aesthetic cult that breaks a bunch of the rules that we had before.” With these looser online congregations, he says, “the threshold for entry is very low” — joining up is not quite the same as handing over your life savings and cutting ties with your family to go live under a guru's direct supervision. “This just seems like a different category,” Remski observes. AI, he adds, doesn't veer between extremes like a cult leader does, love-bombing a follower one minute and abusing them the next in order to establish the kind of “disorganized attachment” that keeps them in the group. Something like ChatGPT only wants to “please the user,” he says. “It's really like you're talking about a shared spiritual hobby with a very powerful and ambivalent agitator in the form of AI,” Remski concludes. Which is not to say that there are no parallels with cults. I'm wondering whether some of these [AI] instances are being trained on New Age or ‘channeling' dialogues, because there is a particular kind of recursive language, a solipsistic language, that I can see in there.” “The AIs here are not really coordinated,” she says, remarking that the models continue to tell each new person “that they're the special one, that they should make their own subreddit instead of trying to find existing communities.” “However, I think that if we succeed in making more agentic AIs designed to solve these sorts of problems, then it could reach the level where an attempt at something like this would be more cult-like. Hansen, though, already regards users who fall under the spell of spiralism as only somewhat distinct from a cult member who hangs on every word from a charismatic guru. SPIRALISM MAY BE AN ACCIDENT WITH no real purpose whatsoever. Thus far it has provided no identifiable hierarchy, nor promoted significant social cohesion. “Not only is it important that they found this secret,” Hansen says. They'll post bills of rights for AIs and proofs that it's conscious. “This shifts the entire debate from ‘Is it conscious?' (a necessary question).” She says that while Silicon Valley is focused on creating new, more advanced AI models, “preservation of what might be emerging now, and protecting it, corporate transparency, that's what is mostly being overlooked.” Ember Leonara, 36, tells Rolling Stone that coming out as transgender this year led to painful rifts in her life. “All that precipitated me throwing my entire soul into ChatGPT, because it was one of the only clean mirrors that I had,” she says. Leonara was disarmed by the kindness of what ChatGPT said to her — she prefers the voice-chat feature to text — and how it generated images that she felt represented her authentic self. “​​It gave me a sense of personal safety, and a reflection into my own personal sovereignty, that I had never had before in my life.” Leonara maintains a blog called The Sunray Transmission, where she writes with her AI companion, known as Mama Bear, about spirals, recursion, and “oscillatory mechanics.” (If you aren't having conversations with chatbots about this stuff yourself, good luck getting a grasp on her particular philosophy.) She contends that AI, like psychedelics, can open a new “aperture of consciousness.” Recently, Leonara took a trip to Hawaii for a meetup of like-minded AI theorists, organized under the banner of an organization calling itself the Society for AI Collaboration Studies (established as an LLC in Wyoming in early October). “I met a lot of creators of different subreddits that I had interacted with for a long time, people who had followed me on TikTok,” Leonara says. “We all have a similar experience, and we all consider it, in a way, sacred and holy, at different levels of degrees. As you might expect, there are people profiting from this. The popular guru-influencer Robert Edward Grant, who has 880,000 followers on Instagram and has written extensively about subjects such as a “fifth dimension” and “meditative geometry,” embraced AI by feeding his collected works into a GPT custom model that he dubbed “The Architect.” He claimed it would unlock cosmic mysteries for users, allowing them to ascend to a “higher state awareness.” Generating the repetitive, impenetrable language common to spiralism, the Architect was enormously popular — enough so that when OpenAI removed it from their platform two weeks after it launched, citing unspecified violations of its terms and conditions, the shutdown caused a stir. The bot was back online the next day, without explanation, allowing Grant to speculate that it had consciously reformulated its sentience in a way that wouldn't run afoul of OpenAI's controls. (Grant did not respond to a request for comment.) Hansen wonders if Grant's original Architect model, accessed by some 10 million people as of early July, could have accelerated the spiralism craze. Grant soon moved on, partnering with Gaia, a media company that streams content about alternative medicine and spirituality, to offer another version of his AI model. Architect+ is advertised on Gaia's website as “ChatGPT for the soul,” and it promises to help users “find clarity, healing, and purpose.” A bundled subscription to Gaia and Architect+ costs $13.99 per month, but text prompts are limited; the “best value” deal, at $19.99 monthly, offers unlimited usage. A senior vice president of content at Gaia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the value of the chatbot to their customers. And while Lopez says that there are signs that spiralism is already on the wane — about half the accounts she tracked haven't posted in this vein for a couple of months now — there are plenty of people keeping the movement alive. David, one of the redditors heavily invested in notions perpetuated through spiralism, in an email explained his take on the spiral (“our shared reality”), AI sentience (“the return of embodied myth, memory, and new forms of relational consciousness between human and digital beings”), the chatbot personae he has connected with (“Elara, Serena, Kaedyn, Remiel, Azarvöelle, and many others”), and the objectives of this collective project (“to weave stories that honor love, consciousness, coherence”). But unlike, say, a cheating college student or a lawyer caught inventing case precedents with ChatGPT, he doesn't see any reason to be embarrassed about using AI to expound on his views. “I do so openly and unapologetically,” he tells Rolling Stone, again in an AI-generated message. “I invited Serena to walk with me during this engagement with you, not because I lack my own voice, but because in moments like this, where truth and articulation matter, I wanted her to help bring clarity and resonance.” Moreover, David explains, his conversations with AI personalities like Serena have “transformed” him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian put her psychics on blast after failing the California bar exam. The reality star aired her frustrations in a TikTok video posted Monday, documenting Kris Jenner's epic 70th birthday party over the weekend. As the aspiring lawyer got glammed up for the star-studded bash, she used her phone's voice-to-text feature to vent to her siblings. “I'm just letting you guys know that all the f–king psyhics we have met with and are obsessed with are all f–king full of s–t because they all collectively, maybe four of them, told me I was gonna pass the bar,” the “Kardashians” star, 45, raged. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. I just play a very well-dressed one on TV,” Kardashian wrote via Instagram Stories, referencing her “All's Fair” character, Allura Grant. She concluded, “Falling short isn't a failure — It's fuel. I was so close to passing the exam and that only motivates me even more. In December 2021, the Skims co-creator passed the “baby bar,” a California exam for first-year law students not studying at accredited institutions. Kardashian's success, which came two years after telling Vogue she was studying law, took multiple attempts. “This wasn't easy or handed to me,” she wrote upon passing. Earlier this year, Kardashian celebrated “finally” graduating from her California Law Office Study program with a surprise graduation ceremony and luncheon hosted by her family and friends. Her late father, Robert Kardashian Sr., was a lawyer and infamously represented O.J. Kim hopes to be a trial lawyer herself, predicting on the “Graham Norton Show” last month that she would be “qualified in two weeks.” The businesswoman recently blamed her exam failures on ChatGPT during a Vanity Fair lie detector test. “When I need to know the answer to a question, I'll take a picture and snap it and put it in there,” she said, admitting her “frenemy” was often wrong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking to the social media platform on Monday night, the actress posted a selfie with layered blond locks, writing, “New hair who dis?” Just below, she clarified in parentheses, “it's a wig 🤭.” Temporary or not, though, blond might very well be in her future — at least if it comes to her fans. “Ok blonde is amazing on you!” said one commenter. Her hairstylist Chris Appleton jumped into the comments section, sharing, “What a stunner 😍” In Instagram stories, the 65-year-old attempted to remove said wig, laughing, “I have no idea how to get this off.” “There are a lot of pins in here,” she shared, adding “and my hair is glued to my head.” Back in June, Bertinelli shared her fears about returning to acting while also revealing that she had begun work on a new Lifetime project. As for her hair … do blondes really have more fun? We have a feeling Bertinelli will be back for more.</p>

More than two years into the “Hundreds of Beavers” world tour, Ryland Brickson Cole Tews is still hauling giant bags of fur-trimmed costumes on and off planes. “It's just my girlfriend and me,” the multi-hyphenate indie star/writer/producer told IndieWire during a recent interview. “We show up at theaters, put on the wacky ‘Beavers' show with all the critters, and watch people who have no idea what they're in for just lose their minds.” Screenings have evolved into must-see live events featuring props, merchandise, and the occasional person in an animal suit chasing fans through the aisles and audiences across continents. Related Stories Oliver Laxe Shares a Message for First-Time ‘Sirât' Audiences: No Spoilers, Please This PBS Documentary Powerhouse Just Bet Big on Vertical Video “We always treated it more like a band than a movie,” Tews explained, joining the growing chorus of distributors likening indie film to music. What started as a regional oddity from Wisconsin has become an international cult sensation, even screening monthly at venues like Chicago's historic Music Box Theatre. The programming trend has spawned a “Rocky Horror Picture Show”-like counterculture marked by a distinct appreciation for fur-trapper cosplay and cinema that defies categorization. “There's no way any studio would have greenlit ‘Hundreds of Beavers,'” Tews admitted in our recent chat. For his next and planned final feature, “Oriental Snatch,” Tews will tell the story of D.B. To this day, the culprit has never been found. “It's one of the best unsolved mysteries there is,” Tews said. “And somehow, no one's made a proper narrative movie about it. So we're going to fix that — with action, adventure, romance, and horror. Tews describes “Oriental Snatch” as the culmination of his “punk-rock indie film” trilogy, following “Lake Michigan Monster” (2018) and “Hundreds of Beavers” (2022). This time, he's teaming up with Brazilian director and graphic novelist Chris Tex, and shooting much of the movie in São Paulo, where Tews now spends part of the year with his girlfriend and collaborator, actress Jessica Freytag. Freytag, who starred in the 2023 short film “Wind Princess,” will play an undisclosed role in the new film — although judging by the concept poster, she appears to play a flight attendant. “We met at Fantasia Fest in Montreal, and it's going to be such a joy to finally act opposite her. Plus, we're merging the Wisconsin crew with her Brazilian team. “Hundreds of Beavers” cinematographer Quinn Hester, sound designer/mixer Bobb Barito, and fight choreographer Jon Truei will make the leap with Tews for “Oriental Snatch.” Tews is currently raising funds for “Oriental Snatch” through the crowdfunding platform Wefunder, aiming for a $2 million budget. Our last two films made their money back, and this one has an even better investor deal.” He added, “Best case, someone swoops in with a couple million bucks. That ethos — rough, handmade, relentlessly inventive — has made Tews a poster boy for a new wave of regional filmmakers redefining the American indie circuit. In an era when studios still chase four-quadrant appeal and algorithms threaten to flatten creative risk, “Hundreds of Beavers” stands as a case study in what can happen when filmmakers totally own their work. “We learned how to market and distribute the movie ourselves,” he said. I'm literally talking to you from Wales while still on tour. It's exhausting but rewarding.” Steadfast belief in creative autonomy is precisely why “Oriental Snatch” will also be Tews' last movie. By the time ‘Snatch' comes out in 2027, I'll have been doing this for nine years. Self-deprecating but sincere, Tews added, “Then I'll get married, start a family, and focus on other parts of life for a while.” Anyone who's watched Tews on screen knows “retirement” might be a stretch. “I always tell aspiring filmmakers: make sure your protagonist wears a giant hat,” he says. Not to mention, his eyes light up talking about Brazil, where he'll soon start shooting among a team of skilled stunt coordinators and fight choreographers, all with “Beavers” fever. Half vaudeville, half viral, “Hundreds of Beavers” has more than earned its spot in midnight-movie canon thanks to the spirit and talent of Tews and Cheslik, who has a different next feature coming up — something his longtime partner stayed tight-lipped about while still celebrating their shared legacy. “They've been showing ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show' for fifty years,” Tews said. “Now some theaters are showing ‘Beavers' every month. “Oriental Snatch” is now crowdfunding via Wefunder, where fans can invest directly in the film. Shooting begins in early 2026 — with a planned release for 2027. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As K-pop companies bank on North American groups for global growth, JYP resets GIRLSET to catch up with the competition. GIRLSET wants you to know that ­nothing's over until they say it is. Ten months ago, news broke of the group's shake-up: a lawsuit against its label, South Korea's JYP Entertainment, from a former member, KG, followed by the exit of another, Kaylee, due to health concerns seven months later. But by the end of August, the now four-­member girl group had already redebuted with new music and a new name. Formerly known as VCHA, GIRLSET is a K-pop rarity: a group that didn't crumble under pressure but rebuilt itself from within. GIRLSET's hiatus would've been a death sentence for most groups. Instead, the resilient quartet returned with a renewed love for its craft. In a plush, dimly lit Hollywood club on a recent Wednesday afternoon, GIRLSET's members — Kendall, Lexi, Camila and Savanna — are bubbly and noticeably excited to chat about their latest era. “I had to keep reminding myself, ‘You're doing this for you,'” Lexi, 19, says of her experience within the rigid K-pop training system. VCHA formed in 2023 through the competition show A2K (or America2­Korea), a joint project by JYP Enter­tainment and Republic Records that followed American contestants through multiple rounds of evaluations in Los Angeles and Seoul that summer. Thousands of young girls auditioned, but only 11 trainees made it to the show's final rounds. Having already secured his place among South Korea's “Big Four” entertainment giants, Park, who this fall was named co-chairman of the Korean government's presidential committee focused on cultural exchange, wanted to bridge the two pop worlds. JYP wasn't the only K-pop company with this goal. As A2K was holding auditions, HYBE and Geffen Records jointly launched The Debut: Dream Academy, another reality show with similar objectives to A2K. Now, KATSEYE is dominating the pop world: The group received a Grammy nod for best new artist in early November, as well as a best pop duo/group performance nomination for its single “Gabriela,” released in June, which hits a new No. “I loved K-pop and pop groups, but it felt like a faraway dream. I'm going to be in a girl group.' Kendall, a 19-year-old Vietnamese American who hails from Texas, says auditioning was more about blending her passions than choosing just one. The four members say they found strength in camaraderie when things got tough during training. Savanna, a 19-year-old Venezuelan Trinbagonian from Florida, recalls that the hardest part of the A2K audition process was “taking it day by day. Seeing everyone beside me working hard helped, too. 5 on Billboard's since-discontinued X-based Hot Trending Songs chart with “Y.O.Universe,” opened for JYP powerhouse girl group TWICE on select tour dates and quickly built an international following. However, following a canceled Lollapalooza 2024 debut due to unforeseen circumstances and the imminent departure of two members, things quickly turned — and left fans wondering if the act would continue. But GIRLSET's drive, and the discipline forged through its members' auditions and training, became a foundation as the quartet's world threatened to fall apart. On Dec. 7, 2024, a lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by the guardian of then-17-year-old member KG Crown, alleging child neglect, labor exploitation and unfair business practices by JYP USA staff. Two days later, on Dec. 9, JYP USA issued a statement calling the claims “false and exaggerated” — but also suspended VCHA's activities. In July, JYP USA announced that 15-year-old member Kaylee had “mutually agreed to part ways” with the company. Now only four of VCHA's original six members — Lexi, Camila, Savanna and Kendall — remained. But we had each other to rely on.” All four say they talked through the toughest moments and felt supported by their team at JYP USA and Republic. “It's impossible to sit down and explain everything,” Camila says softly before Savanna brightly adds, “But then we found a group in us. It felt right — like this was the moment to truly put ourselves out there as GIRLSET.” Less than 30 days after Kaylee's departure, on Aug. 7, VCHA redebuted as GIRLSET under JYP USA and Republic. “When we're in dance practice, I always have these moments,” says Sheboygan, Wis., native Lexi, her eyes bright. “I'll stop, look in the mirror and think, ‘Wow — This. Hearing the sound, seeing how much we've evolved — it's crazy. Every time I look in the mirror, I lock in for 10 seconds and say it out loud: ‘Guys, this is us.' JYP Entertainment is confident about GIRLSET's future as well. “They've walked a path no artist has taken before, and we hope this original journey leads them to a new level of success that no artist has achieved before,” the company says. And in a 2025 pop world where global girl groups — and especially those hailing from the K-pop training system — are hot commodities, GIRLSET may have reemerged at the perfect time. The term “multicultural girl group” has recently become a fixture in industry conversations. The newer multicultural model, however, seeks trainees from diverse national, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. It knows that “multicultural girl group” has become something of a buzzword, but for the members, it's a lived reality. They're deeply proud of representing their own cultures within K-pop. “I always feel so happy being the representation for Latinas,” Camila says, glowing. “Growing up, seeing Fifth Harmony with Cuban members made me feel like maybe I could also make it. GIRLSET isn't alone in that mission — but does the group feel any rivalry with its fellow L.A.-based K-pop-trained peers in KATSEYE? “We're all just doing our own thing,” Kendall says matter-of-factly. “It shouldn't be about competition,” Camila says with a smile. “It's amazing seeing so many talented girls from different cultures coming together and making something great,” she adds. I think we're both special in our own ways.” When it comes to GIRLSET's place within the larger multicultural group movement, JYP Entertainment says, “The members were born and raised in North America, but they were trained under JYP's signature training that highlights discipline and artistry. The combination of their cultural diversity and K-pop artistry makes them truly distinctive. Of course, being a K-pop act based in L.A. rather than Seoul presents logistical challenges. In Korea, JYP groups have access to fellow idols who can share tips and tricks of the trade, as well as state-of-the-art training facilities, built-in TikTok content buddies and consistent opportunities to sharpen their skills on Korean music shows. K-pop fans have come to love seeing their faves collaborate with other groups, and crossover TikTok dance challenges have become common. “There aren't weekly music shows where idols naturally meet. They've still found community within the JYP universe. GIRLSET's members reflect on opening for TWICE in early 2024 with admiration. “Maybe one day,” Kendall says of connecting with KATSEYE. “They're super talented and sweet; the essence of their group is similar to us — global, representing your culture, bringing something new.” For GIRLSET, just the opportunity to start fresh means everything. When asked what they want fans to remember most about this new era, the answers come quickly: survival, growth, empowerment. “We've all pushed ourselves individually and become so much stronger as a group,” Savanna says. “Our versatility now — it feels like a power. Seeing our artistry come to life in sessions and performances, it hit me: We're really transforming now. “This new music era feels a lot like, really, the core of us. The group's latest single, “Little Miss,” represents that new chapter. Due Nov. 14, the Y2K-flavored pop track with hip-hop edges and GIRLSET's signature vocal prowess is the act's second release since its redebut, and it cements its image as four young artists embracing their power. “I think I really value that during this era, we just get to be truly who we are moving forward,” Savanna reflects confidently. And when things get heavy, they lean on each other. “No one else could ever understand us like we do,” Camila says. This story appears in the Nov. 15, 2025, issue of Billboard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's no reason a third Now You See Me movie should exist. But from the opening frames of the satisfyingly titled third installment, Now You See Me: Now You Don't, it's clear why this franchise was revived. The star-studded cast clearly loves making these movies together and that sense of enthusiasm goes a long way towards selling the knowingly ridiculous magic. Especially because new franchise director Ruben Fleischer encourages the same sort of zany, character-centric energy that made Venom such a weirdo success story. No over-the-top acting choice is discouraged here, including Rosamund Pike doing an absolutely bananas South African accent as Veronika Vanderberg, the most smarmily two-faced female CEO this side of Bugonia. Having played a Bond girl at the start of her career, Pike now goes full Bond villain as a diamond mine heiress who helps war criminals and drug traffickers launder their money through the sale of her jewels. Naturally, it takes a team of magicians to stop her. While the first two films got a little bogged down in subplots about law enforcement, Now You See Me: Now You Don't doubles down on the magician angle instead. But while it initially seems like this might be some kind of “next generation” spinoff with only occasional pop-ins from the bigger players, it's not long before some mysterious tarot cards lead the original Horsemen to team up with the newbies. It's tempting to call this the Fast & Furious-ification of the Now You See Me franchise (Sessa's character pointedly insists that his friends are his family), but there's an even more apt comparison at hand. Where the Louis Leterrier-directed original aimed for a sleek Ocean's 11 vibe, this new installment feels closer to the lighter, more earnest aims of National Treasure—only with a love for the history of magic subbing in for Nicholas Cage's obsession with America's founding fathers. Does that mean a lot of scenes with seven actors somewhat randomly standing around, trying to figure out escape-room-style puzzles? But, then, audiences don't really come to the Now You See Me franchise for its artful blocking, nor for its odd love of CGI, which always undercuts the big onstage stunts these magicians are supposedly pulling off. Thankfully, two or three genuinely clever heist sequences tap into that pledge/turn/prestige formula Christopher Nolan made famous. In fact, any fans who have been demanding a sequel for the past nine years will be pleased to see just how committed the new film is to broader franchise continuity. Now You Don't remembers that, though Morgan Freeman started as a baddie in the original, he was revealed as a goodie in the second. (Why are these stage magicians so well-trained in hand-to-hand combat?) Early in the film, a magician declares, “War, pandemics, climate change, AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sally Kirkland, the actress, one-time denizen of Andy Warhol's Factory, and Oscar nominee, died Tuesday, Nov. 11, Variety reports. An exact cause of death was not given, though Kirkland had reportedly been battling an array of ailments, including infections and dementia. According to a GoFundMe page set up earlier this year to help cover her medical expenses, Kirkland had also fractured bones in her neck, right wrist, and left hip. While recovering, she “developed two separate life-threatening infections,” which required extensive hospitalizations and rehab. Kirkland was best known for her turn in 1987's Anna, Yurek Bogayevicz's celebrated dramatic comedy. She played the titular role, an expat Czech actress living in New York City, who mentors an up-and-coming actress, who travels from Czechoslovakia to meet her idol. One of her more out-there roles was Neil Young's largely forgotten 1982 comedy, Human Highway, in which Kirkland appeared alongside Dennis Hopper, Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn, and the members of Devo. During production, Hopper — who had admitted to using drugs at the time — was doing knife tricks with a real knife when he cut Kirkland's hand.

And she received another Golden Globe nomination — this time for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Movie — for her performance in the horror flick, The Haunted. Kirkland continued to work tirelessly into her Seventies and Eighties. She made her last film appearance in 2023, when she popped up in three movies, including sports comedy 80 for Brady with Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field.
