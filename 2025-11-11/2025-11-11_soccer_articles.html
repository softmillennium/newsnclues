                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IF Sarah Hunter wanted evidence of the difference between playing and coaching, she got it during the World Cup when her watch told her to calm down. England's most capped rugby player found herself in a new role as defence coach for the Red Roses in 2025 as they lifted the World Cup for the first time in 11 years, when Hunter was in the middle of her playing career. The demands as a coach are very different to those of a player and Hunter admitted the adjustment took some getting used to. You get a lot of different satisfaction from it compared to when you are winning as a player and you have gone out and physically made it happen. But for new mum Hunter, whose daughter Olivia turned one last week, any break from coaching was quickly replaced by the even greater demands of parenting. “The morning of the World Cup final, when we have so much time, she was in camp, I was playing with her, sorting her out. “After we finished all our coaching meetings, I had that time with her, and then I was ready to go to the World Cup final, rather than twiddling my thumbs, getting really nervous about it.” The initial returns have been promising, with swelling crowds in Premiership Women's Rugby as fans flock to see their new heroes back in club action. And the RFU have launched a pair of initiatives for those young girls who have got the rugby bug, giving them a chance to try their hand at the sport. Try Love Rugby is a four-week programme being run by community rugby clubs, introducing girls aged 8-11 to rugby in a supportive, all-girl environment, while the Love Rugby Series is a nationwide series of girls-only festivals for the same age group. Hunter picked up the game at the age of nine, but was one of very few girls playing rugby at the time, and is grateful that there are more opportunities for those coming through now. Hunter added: “I hope the momentum grows and it is sustained as we carry on because I think this is a defining moment within in the game. “These initiatives are really important because when people have that fun and enjoyable experience, they are likely to come back and tell their friends. “We talk about legacy and the RFU have worked so hard on ensuring there are things in place. Now they can go and try this sport, which might not have been possible beforehand.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legendary striker Cristiano Ronaldo insisted Tuesday that the 2026 World Cup will be his final one as a player. Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson (h/t CNN.com's Michelle Velez and Wayne Sterling), the Portuguese superstar said next year's World Cup will "definitely" be his last one. On top of that, Ronaldo provided some insight regarding when he plans to retire from soccer completely, saying, "I'm enjoying the moment, but when I mean soon, it's really soon because I gave everything for football." Ronaldo, who currently plays professionally for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, has accomplished almost every accolade possible in the sport of soccer. Ronaldo is also a five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or and a five-time UEFA Champions League winner, plus he won three English Premier League titles with Manchester United, two La Liga titles with Real Madrid and two Serie A titles with Juventus. Internationally, Ronaldo won the UEFA Nations League twice and the UEFA European Championship once with Portugal, but a World Cup title is the one thing that continues to elude him. Ronaldo played in five World Cups in 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022, and he is the first male player to have scored a goal at five different World Cups. The 2022 World Cup also represented Argentina's first World Cup title since 1986, and the first Lionel Messi's illustrious career. Messi is the player who Ronaldo is most often compared with, so it would be fitting if Ronaldo finds a way to end his World Cup career triumphantly. The 2026 World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Mexico and Canada, beginning on June 11, 2026, and it will feature the largest field in World Cup history with 48 teams vying to be world champion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo says the 2026 World Cup will be his last, while retirement could be on the horizon in “probably one or two years.” “Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old,” Ronaldo said, regarding the World Cup. Ronaldo's comments regarding both topics come one week after he was interviewed by Piers Morgan, saying he could retire “soon.” Ronaldo joked during the summit, saying “soon for me means in 10 years” before adding: I'm enjoying my game in the national team. What I mean by soon, it's probably one or two years.” Portugal could qualify for the World Cup during this FIFA international window, when they visit Ireland on Nov. 13. Ronaldo and Lionel Messi would become the first players to play in six World Cups if they both appear in the tournament next summer. He has said he will make a formal announcement on playing in the World Cup after the 2026 MLS preseason. The World Cup final is July 19, 2026 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could a new manager at Atalanta change his fortunes? On Aug. 26, Yunus Musah made it clear that he had big plans for the 2025-26 season at AC Milan. "The nearest goals and achievement for me are winning trophies here at Milan," he told ESPN. "This season we have the possibility to win three trophies [Serie A, Coppa Italia, Italian Supercoppa]. I'd love to win all three of them. There was confidence, gusto, the idea that Musah believed that all of those things were possible at Milan and for the USMNT. A week later, he was holding up an Atalanta shirt, grinning, after agreeing to a year-long loan to Milan's direct rivals. It is impossible to speculate on the minutea here. The first is that Musah has played just under 300 minutes of football this season. He has also played for two different club managers and is about to play for a third after Atalanta sacked Ivan Juric on Monday. And, according to insights offered by U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, it is playing time, not injury, that has seen him dropped from the U.S. squad. Piece it all together, and this looks like a footballer who made one of those rare, truly poor decisions in his career. His move may have come late, but the destination was also frightfully ill-judged, with Musah now stuck in a spot where he is unlikely to play more, and without a steady parent club to return to. The state of tension between Musah and Allegri was perhaps a bit overblown. But the eye test certainly didn't help. There were, in fact, two significant incidents in the game between Milan and Lecce that suggested that something was up. Allegri didn't "kick" him, per se, but there was, to be sure, contact between the manager's foot and Musah's body. Musah dropped the ball and looked away without even looking at his coach. It must be acknowledged here that managers and players are allowed to disagree. Allegri, too, isn't exactly the most fun guy. He is a strict disciplinarian who plays intense, testy football. He was famously denied a job in the Premier League when he outlined his playing style: "I don't have one." Allegri also made it abundantly clear to Milan's hierarchy that he wanted a center midfielder who could offer a little more control in his side. Veteran Frenchman Adrien Rabiot, one of Allegri's favorites at Juventus, and a regular for Didier Deschamps in the French National Team. There had been some scattered talk for a few weeks that his long term future might not lie with the Rossoneri, but the pace at which his loan move was tracked through was remarkable. The club was reportedly prepared to pay €25 million for his services. There were, admittedly, some things to like about playing for Atalanta. They are in the Champions League this season. Atalanta play a 3-4-2-1, with two disciplined, defensive center midfielders and proper runners on the wing. Musah, at his best, is an energetic, box-to-box No. But he can also play on the right or left. He even admitted, after playing well in a 4-3-3 for the USMNT, that he could play on the wing if needed. "So ultimately, when the coach tells you to play free, then it gives you even more of a chance to do those things." Musah's versatility, in a way, cannot be questioned. But it might have also held him back a bit. But 42 percent of his minutes came in central midfield, where he was genuinely excellent for spells. Under Paolo Fonseca, he operated mostly as a right attacking midfielder. The Portuguese did not set up in a system that offered his preferred position. And even if he finished the campaign with 1,600 minutes under his belt and 19 Serie A starts, Musah didn't quite offer a sense of specialization that he needed. And Atalanta have, in a way, capitalized on that. Musah has perhaps a similar problem to Weston McKennie in that he can do a little bit of everything - but is caught in a system that doesn't truly excel in his greatest area. In Ederson and veteran midfielder Mario Pasalic - a similar profile of player to Musah - they have two established center midfielders. Raoul Bellanova has impressed on the other wing. Musah isn't a good fit in either of the No. So, yes, the tactical fit is an awkward one. Ederson is a star midfielder who plays nearly every minute. Zappacosta, too, could do with a rest here and there. Rotational minutes may not be ideal, but even they should still be attainable - especially for a player of Musah's potential. Instead, Musah has played just six times in Serie A, totaling 145 minutes. His one start came not for Atalanta, but Milan - where he played all 90 minutes against Lecce. It is admittedly hard to make much of an impact when minutes are sparse. But there are some broader reasons for optimism here. The first might seem a bit counterintuitive, but Atalanta are struggling mightily. They are expected to compete for Champions League places, yet find themselves in 13th after 11 games. They have lost just twice, but drawn seven times. There have been public fallouts between Ademola Lookman and management. And despite securing European football, their transfer window was marked by the $78 million sale of star man Mateo Retegui to the Saudi Pro League. He was always going to be up against it, and was publicly very much their second choice after Thiago Motta last summer. An ugly loss to Sassuolo at the weekend only sealed his fate. In his place is Raffaele Palladino, who was named manager on Tuesday. Palladino overperformed with a mediocre Fiorentina squad last season, but resigned over the summer - reportedly with one eye on the Atalanta job. A few months later, he has his wish. And, more importantly, Musah might have another chance. On the face of things, then, this seems a far better setup for Musah. Pochettino has made it abundantly clear that anyone not named Gio Reyna has to be playing regular football in order to be considered for selection. It is why Musah has been left out before. It perhaps also shouldn't be forgotten that, at his best, Musah was truly excellent for Gregg Berhalter. The chemistry he struck up with Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie in the U.S. midfield during the 2022 World Cup made them a difficult unit to play against, and it was easy to see why Musah was so highly rated as a youngster while working so effectively in a well balanced team. Last camp, Pochettino said that Cristian Roldan is apparently the perfect player. And if he uses this chance to ensure that Atalanta might yet have been the right move after all, then the U.S. will surely be stronger for it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exasperated fans who bought the “right to buy” 2026 World Cup tickets say that FIFA has forced them into an “unjust ultimatum”: gamble that opaque ticket prices will be affordable, or cut their losses and concede that they were “scammed.” Over the past year, FIFA and a crypto partner, Modex, sold tens of thousands of “Right To Buy” tokens on their FIFA Collect platform. Each token cost hundreds of dollars and promised buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets at a to-be-determined later date, for a to-be-determined price. They are untradeable once the purchasing window opens on Thursday, FIFA Collect recently announced, and “will lose all ticket-related value” when the window closes on Dec. 1. Fans could, alternatively, resell their RTBs before Thursday's deadline on FIFA Collect's secondary marketplace — but likely at a loss. Prices there have tanked since the early-October revelations that 2026 World Cup tickets would cost multiples more than any previous World Cup tickets; and that most RTB holders will only be allowed to purchase Category 1 or 2 tickets, the most expensive ones. Selling an RTB, therefore, would amount to losing money on FIFA Collect, forfeiting the right to purchase World Cup tickets, and acknowledging that the time and energy invested in acquiring RTBs was all for naught. Many seem willing to hold out for tickets at the unknown prices, but they've been voicing “massive discontent and financial frustration,” Rafael Baqueiro, an RTB holder and leader of two international World Cup fan groups, told The Athletic. With the deadlines before the Dec. 5 World Cup Draw, and with initial ticket prices — never announced by FIFA, but revealed by The Athletic last month — “super high,” FIFA is “forcing fans to commit thousands of dollars to tickets without knowing which teams are playing,” Baqueiro, a Toronto-based supporter of Mexico's national team, wrote in an email. As of Monday, he and others were still awaiting word on how much they'd have to pay. Last Friday, six days before the deadline, a FIFA Collect administrator wrote on Discord: “The situation on pricing is that we have not yet received it from FIFA ticketing. FIFA, which has made tens of millions of dollars on the FIFA Collect project, did not answer emailed questions seeking explanations for the tight timeline and pricing opacity. When FIFA, the global soccer governing body that runs the World Cup, launched FIFA Collect in 2022, it said that the digital collectibles platform would be “affordable, inclusive and accessible to all football fans.” In its early days, it served a small community of avid collectors. It was “promoted as a trustworthy and innovative digital collectibles ecosystem backed by FIFA,” Alann Diaz, an early user, told The Athletic via email. FIFA, in emails and on its website, began to promote the RTBs aggressively — even as it withheld details of its standard World Cup ticketing processes. One set of “Terms & Conditions” stated: “Actual ticket prices and purchase process will be communicated separately. Throughout 2025, in an official Discord channel and elsewhere, users pressed FIFA Collect administrators for the “when,” “how” and “how much.” Instead, they got what one user called “a pattern of vague answers, shifting promises, and last minute shocks that keeps repeating.” They were told in one December 2024 email reviewed by The Athletic: “Tickets will be available across different categories, providing options to suit various preferences and needs.” Then, last month, they were told that 70 percent of the tickets made available to RTB holders will be in Category 1, the most expensive category; 28 percent will be in Category 2; and a mere 2 percent will be in Category 3. “NO WAY,” one RTB holder wrote on Discord in an incredulous response to that announcement. Others told The Athletic they felt “scammed” or “taken advantage of.” “I feel ripped off,” said Weston Binford, a fan who spent thousands on RTBs for several matches in Texas, then felt “turned off” by early ticket prices. But a few weeks later, on Oct. 30, an admin communicated: “Unfortunately, no additional allocations were received.” The admin also mentioned that pricing “details” were “still being coordinated with FIFA Ticketing.” FIFA Collect, the admin said, “will share them in the coming days — allowing sufficient time for everyone to trade and make decisions ahead of [the Nov. 13 deadline].” But eight days later, in Friday's Discord message, there were no updates, and the admin again passed blame for the lack of information to FIFA Ticketing. “How can we make ‘appropriate' decisions with our RTBs without that big piece of information and yet only 6 days before they LOCK!??? “I don't think they care about the fan experience.” Others directed their ire at FIFA Collect's operators, who are mostly nameless. Another added: “A 6-year-old school project is better organized and communicated then this scammy thing.” A FIFA spokesperson, in response to previous questions about the RTB scheme, wrote in an October email that “FIFA does not disclose specifics on business, financial or commercial strategies. It does, however, continually analyse and assess these strategies on a regular basis to ensure they are working in the interest of the fan and global football.” The spokesperson added: “As with all of FIFA's commercial activities, revenues go directly back into football development and social projects worldwide.” In mid-July, FIFA Collect began contributing “20 percent of all proceeds” on RTB sales to the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund to “help provide education access to the world's most marginalized children, build safe learning environments, and accelerate progress toward every child's right to quality education across more than 200 countries.” FIFA Collect's website says that $3.1 million has been raised for the fund. Also in October, the Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority, a governmental agency known as GESPA, filed a criminal complaint against Zurich-based FIFA targeting FIFA Collect and its “Right to Final” scheme. For months, FIFA Collect offered fans an NFT that could be used to purchase a ticket to the 2026 World Cup final if a specific team reached the final. There were similar offerings for 33 other teams, with prices ranging from $999 to $299. Earlier this year, GESPA caught wind of the scheme and opened an investigation into FIFA Collect. “During the investigation, suspicions were confirmed that collect.fifa.com offers gambling services that are not licensed in Switzerland and are therefore illegal,” GESPA said in a statement. Seemingly in response to the investigation, but quietly, sometime in recent months, FIFA Collect amended the terms of each “Right to Final” listing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite fresh speculation regarding supposed interest in Erling Haaland and Harry Kane surfacing, teenage wonderkid Yamal is hoping to see a prolific Polish No.9 handed an extension to his expiring contract in Catalunya. Lewandowski, who is now 37 years of age, has not been a guaranteed starter for Barca this season - with Ferran Torres often being asked to lead the line. He did, however, net a hat-trick in his latest appearance, as Celta Vigo were swept aside 4-2, and found the target on 42 occasions across all competitions last term. Rivals are aware of the need to try and contain one of the finest strikers of his generation, meaning that Yamal gets more time and space in which to do his thing. Lewandowski helps to pin defences back, allowing Yamal to receive more passes and impact proceedings in the final third. According to El Nacional, the relationship between two players at opposing ends of their respective careers has “strengthened both on and off the field”. Yamal is said to view ex-Bayern Munich star Lewandowski as “a mentor”, with there a productive understanding between the pair as they look to pose problems to La Liga and Champions League opponents. Yamal now wants to see Lewandowski remain in his current surroundings beyond the summer of 2027, when free agency is set to be reached. He is said to be of the opinion that there is nobody “better suited to continue fostering his development” while providing much-needed leadership. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Lewandowski believes that he still has more to offer at Barca, telling ESPN of his hopes for the immediate future: “It doesn't matter how many titles you have already won. The most important thing is how many titles you want to win. There has, however, been talk of Barcelona lining up moves for another No.9. It has also been revealed that England captain Harry Kane has exit clauses in his contract at Bayern Munich that can be triggered at around £57 million ($75m) in 2026. Ex-Bayern star Dietmar Hamann told GOAL recently when asked if Kane could become a stopgap for Barca as they wait on a window of opportunity in which to snap up Haaland: “Obviously they find it hard to register players, so I'm not sure they'd be able to register Haaland. But then again, this is probably a few years away. So that's certainly something I can see. “And if it were to be a stopgap, obviously it's a good stopgap because we know the record of Harry Kane. So, it's certainly something I can see, yes.” It remains to be seen what approach Barca take when it comes to the focal point of their attack. Will they listen to Yamal and enter into contract extension talks with Lewandowski, or move in a different direction as another proven target man is approached?</p>

The NWSL quarterfinals concluded yesterday with two more matches that went to extra time, including a massive upset victory for No. When midfielder Jaedyn Shaw took the mic postgame, she wrote her own version of “Don't call it a comeback, I've been here for years,” when she said, “Underdog, my ass. We are not an underdog.” (That reference is mostly for my sister, who I can hear “rapping” the ‘90s lyrics, but hopefully others enjoyed it, too.) Seriously, though, Gotham FC has been doing this for years. With their 2-1 win over the Current, they've qualified for a third consecutive semifinals, including 2023 when they completed a worst-to-first NWSL title run. Gotham looked lost in their Decision Day loss to North Carolina Courage on Nov. 2, and even with a string of injuries, including to star Temwa Chawinga, Kansas City had been an absolute force this season. That's no regular jam, as LL would say. A few stories from the other games this weekend: Because the postseason is better with friends, we are headed back to the Slack chat for more takes from our WoSo writers. First up, Meg has player-themed three-word recaps for the quarterfinals: Here are the staff's bold NWSL award finalist thoughts, ranked by spice level: I need to give some explanation on the leveling. Asli's take on MVP has all the spice, mainly because it feels like Chawinga is a lock to go back-to-back in the category. (This must-read from Tamerra explains just how important she is to the Current.) Meg prefaced her take by saying it's not “that spicy,” but I disagree. And the only reason Tamerra and Melanie lacked spice is that those observations just feel like really good common sense. Let's get a “young player of the year” award. Even with injuries to their Golden Boot winner and MVP front-runner Chawinga and forward Michelle Cooper, plus a sprained MCL for Bia Zaneratto, history seemed to be on KC's side heading into their quarterfinal. The Current had not lost in that building since July 6, 2024, and Gotham FC had never managed a victory against KC before. But, for a second straight year, the powerhouse fell short. The challenge now is how big an asterisk we attach to the Current's incredible regular season and NWSL Shield win. The Europeans reading this are probably shaking their heads in frustration, but it's a fair question here for us American women's soccer folks to ask. The quarterfinal exit doesn't negate all 26 weeks that came before it, but the upset will always be mentioned in the same line: “Best regular season ever, ousted early by a No. Now, if anyone wants to discuss which is the best playoff upset of all time —  this weekend's Gotham-KC match or 2016's semifinal between the Thorns and the Western New York Flash — you know where to find me. It was a long weekend of exciting matches, so when Asli called me with news, I was not at all expecting it to be this. NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman has a very open-door policy on expansion. She has often compared the league's potential to that of the NFL and NHL, which are both at 32 teams. ET on Paramount+ The UEFA Women's Champions League is back this week in a continuation of the league phase. It will be PSG goalkeeper Mary Earps' return to her old club with the added heat from her recently released autobiography. 📺 NWSL semifinals Saturday and Sunday on ABC and CBS The Spirit host the Thorns at noon ET on Saturday and the Pride host Gotham at 3 p.m. on Sunday. While my head says the weekend will finish with a rematch of the 2024 NWSL Championship, Gotham's win reminded us that anything can happen. We have thoughts, and so does Megan Feringa. Heartbreaking: Washington goalkeeper Mia Hamant, whose courage and optimism inspired the Huskies and the wider college soccer community during her fight with a rare kidney cancer, died Thursday at 21. Over the weekend, many NWSL teams showed solidarity with orange ribbons in a touching show of community. You can still clear the boards and keep playing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE WEEKEND WAS highly eventful in American soccer in every level – from the MLS playoffs, to Americans abroad, to U.S. youth national teams, as well as the full national team. For the purposes of breaking things up, we will look at Americans abroad in a separate article. Over the weekend, midfielders Tyler Adams (Bournemouth) and Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew) suffered injuries in their club matches and had to be withdrawn from the U.S. national team roster. Adams was involved in a collision with teammate Adam Smith in early minutes of Bournemouth's 4-0 loss to Aston Villa on Sunday. Smith had to leave the game with a concussion. Adams played the entire game, but did not play well. TEAM NEWS: Timmy Tillman has been added to the November camp roster.Tyler Adams and Sean Zawadzki have been withdrawn due to injury. Despite losing two players, head coach Mauricio Pochettino made one addition to the roster with Timothy Tillman joining the squad in Philadelphia. The brother of Malik Tillman, who is a mainstay under Pochettino, Timothy Tillman has one USMNT cap and has been a mainstay with Los Angeles FC this year where he has played 2599 minutes as the team is now into the Conference semifinal. Despite the injury, Pochettino did not want to draw from familiar central midfielders such as Johnny Cardoso, James Sands, or Yunus Musah – likely for a variety of reasons. The United States U-17 team again faced a difficult test in the group stages of the World Cup but ended up winning over Tajikistan 2-1 behind standout performances from Nimfasha Berchimas and Cavan Sullivan. He was then able to move in alone on U.S. goalkeeper Aidan Stokes for a goal. The U.S. team dominated possession and chances and finally equalized in the 30th minute when Sullivan hit a cross that was headed home by Berchimas. Sullivan stepped up and chipped it down the middle for a 2-1 lead. All smiles for the go ahead goal ? While Bukina Faso had many chances to score in the opening game and was dangerous on the counterattack, Tajikistan scored on its best chance in the game. Outside of that, they were not dangerous at all. Still, the U.S. team needs to find ways to generate more chances and be more clinical with its finishing. It needs to turn possession into chances. Physically, the win over Burkina Faso came at a cost. That also likely played out against Tajikistan. The standings in this group are interesting. The Czech Republic defeated Tajikistan 6-1 while it lost to Burkina Faso 2-1. The U.S team is the only team to have won its first two games, and it will win Group I with just a draw against the Czech Republic. The U.S. team has also been very reliant on Sullivan. Yes, he is the team's best player but the team has depth to be dangerous with a variety of players. Moving forward, the knockouts will be tough unless the U.S. team can thrive physically and have different points of attack. The game was a wild 3-3 draw after regulation that saw Minnesota reduced to 10 men in the 41st minute when Joseph Rosales was sent off for a head-butt. Despite being down to 10 men, the Loons played as well as they could have hoped and took advantage of every opportunity, equalizing in the 62nd and moving ahead in the 71st. But when Minnesota looked to be heading for a win, Jordan Morris equalized in the 88th to send it too a shootout – where it got even wilder. MARKANICH.Ten-man @MNUFC have turned this game on its head! But Obed Vargas and Osaze De Rosario both missed their chances. Then after Minnesota keeper Dayne St. Clair made his chance, Thomas had to take an attempt from the spot – which he missed. First, it was a truly great effort from Minnesota which began the game horribly with dumb mistakes and no composure. For Seattle, it was an extremely painful loss and also one that is inexcusable given the team's depth, experience, and quality in coaching. In the end, it was done in by basic mistakes such as a failure to mark set pieces. Shootouts often come down to luck, but it also showed the value of maturity in pressure situations. Seattle's youngsters in De Rosario and Vargas were not able to connect. This game will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest MLS playoffs games in history. In the decisive game three, Messi scored two goals and assisted twice more to Tadeo Allende for a convincing 4-0 win. Nashville did well to push this to a third game, but when Messi plays like Messi can (which doesn't always happen at age 38), Nashville stood no chance. Shots were almost even at 12-11 in favor of Nashville. Miami can win any game comfortably, but it's tough to be consistent when relying on older players. But in this game, it was impressive. Cincinnati won the third and decisive game against in-state rivals Columbus 2-1 on Saturday night. Cincinnati showed you could go home again as Brenner scored the equalizing and winning goals for Cincinnati in the 67th and 86th minutes. Unlike when Atlanta reacquired Miguel Almiron only to miss the playoffs, bringing Brenner back has paid off for Cincinnati. From a USMNT perspective, Max Arfsten set up two big chances for Columbus that should have resulted in at least one goal. Patrick Schulte maybe could have stopped one of Brenner's goals. But it was also the end of a great career for Darlington Nagbe who announced this would be his last season. Meanwhile, Miles Robinson had a very good game for Cincinnati playing in the middle of a three-man backline. As for Columbus, we will now wait to see if Wilfried Nancy sticks around after being linked to the Celtic job. On Sunday night, San Diego trounced Portland 4-0 in the third game of its series. Good morning San Diego, Please enjoy FULL highlights from last night's 4-0 dub. What will be interesting to see moving forward is how San Diego embraces the youth approach they stressed by being part of the Right To Dream Network. While some of their defenders were young, the ages of their front six were on the older side (35, 32, 26, 35, 29, 27). Right now, none of that matters and the team's academy is not yet full up and operational. But if the club wins with an older approach, will it easy shift to using RTD players? But this team will be a tough out for anyone having to play in San Diego. It was a fun game to watch and their support is amazing. New York City FC defeated Charlotte FC 3-1 in the third game of the series and New York successfully navigated a path that included winning both of its games on the road. Charlotte managed to score one goal in 270 minutes. In the third game, it scored its only goal of the series in what turned out to be its only shot on target in the game. Charlotte simply went cold at the worst possible time. Nicholas Fernandez and Alonso Hernandez were the two best players in the series as both players scored all four of NYCFC's goals this series. But the loss was very costly as defensive midfielder Andres Perea suffered a broken leg. The former Colombian and U.S. youth international had been playing the best soccer of his career in recent months. In New Jersey, the New York Red Bulls II won MLS Next Pro Cup with a thrilling shootout win over the Colorado Rapids 2 after a 3-3 draw. Rafael Mosquera, 20, scored two goals and has proven to be a very promising prospect for the Red Bulls after being acquired in a transfer in August. This game was played in front of over 9,000 people, which is a tremendous crowd for this league, even for a final. In a crowded New York sports market, there was little to no publicity for this game. But the fans turned up and were energized. But the most interesting story was Michael Bradley. We will now see where that leaves the Red Bulls first team which is without a head coach and is heading into a different direction. Is he what the Red Bulls want?</p>
