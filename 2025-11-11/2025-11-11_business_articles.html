                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nasdaq Composite fell on Tuesday, pressured by declines in key artificial intelligence stocks, following strong gains in the previous session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 422 points, or 0.9%. Shares of AI chip darling Nvidia also pulled back 3% after SoftBank sold its entire stake in the chipmaker for more than $5 billion. "These tech companies, they're cash flow machines," Bill Fitzpatrick, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, said in an interview with CNBC. "They're terrific companies, but the starting point does matter, and given where they're valued today, it doesn't take much – a little bit of a negative news – for the sentiment to turn just a little bit and you get an unwind that is that is more favorable to value equities." The AI trade has been under pressure this month amid growing valuation concerns, a development that has put the Nasdaq's month-to-date losses at more than 1%. On Tuesday, notable names in the play, such as Micron Technology, Oracle, and Palantir Technologies, moved lower in sympathy with CoreWeave and Nvidia. Micron declined 3%, while Oracle and Palantir each pulled back 2%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR fund (XLK), which tracks the S&P 500 tech sector, was also down 1%. "The [S&P 500] is trading well above 20 times. That's going to be biased upwards by the ['Magnificent Seven'] and the other technology companies," he added, noting that there have been some names that have been "left behind" in the bull market. "There's so much going in to expected capital expenditures over the next couple of years that if there is a pullback at all on that front … it would send a message that perhaps things have gotten a little bit ahead of themselves." Adding to the downbeat sentiment seen in the Nasdaq Tuesday, a new report from ADP revealed that for the four weeks ending Oct. 25, private sector job creation was down more than 11,000 on average per week. The negotiated deal does not include Democrats' demand that any funding bill must include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and instead calls for a vote on the tax credits in December. "Yes, we're going to get a resolution, but the polarization is still very much prevalent, and that is one of many factors that I think should push investors toward a higher quality trade." Michael Burry, the investor made famous by "The Big Short" who recently roiled the market with a tech short bet, is accusing some of America's largest technology companies of using aggressive accounting to pad their profits from the artificial intelligence boom. In a post Monday on X, the Scion Asset Management founder alleged that "hyperscalers" — the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers — are understating depreciation expenses by estimating that chips will have a longer life cycle than is realistic. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done." On Tuesday, 16 stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new all-time highs. On the other hand, just two stocks in the benchmark hit new 52-week lows: Charter Communications and Chipotle Mexican Grill. As stock market investors support economic sentiment, some economists wonder if a looser labor market could pull the rug out. The University of Michigan's widely-followed consumer sentiment index slid more than 6% in November, nearing all-time lows and down about 30% from a year ago. Respondents were concerned that the long-running federal government shutdown would drag on the economy, according to survey director Joanne Hsu. Shares of Rocket Lab were nearly 4% higher in morning trading on Tuesday on the heels of the space company reporting third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's expectations. The company posted a loss of 3 cents per share, coming in above the loss of 10 cents per share that analysts surveyed by LSEG had estimated. Revenue for the quarter also came in at $155 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $152 million. Rocket Lab's fourth-quarter revenue outlook was also uplifting, with the company anticipating that to come in between $170 million and $180 million. Tuesday's gains add to the stock's monstrous rise in recent months, putting its six-month gain at more than 162%. Shares have also surged more than 111% this year. Judging by current data, you'd think there's literally a job out there for anyone who wants one. Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story. The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers. But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled. Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with "ghost jobs" that never seem to get filled. China plans to block companies with ties to the U.S. military from receiving rare earths while allowing exports to other firms, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce late last month in which the U.S. agreed to reduce some tariffs in exchange for China lifting rare earth export restrictions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by contrast, gained 107 points, or 0.2%. To see more stocks making premarket moves, read the full story here. Recent indicators are showing that private employers actually cut payrolls in October, ADP reported Tuesday. The payrolls processing firm reported that companies shed an average 11,250 jobs over the past four weeks, according to preliminary numbers. Economists had been expecting an official nonfarm payrolls count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show a drop of 60,000 for the month. That report, however, did not come out due to the government shutdown. Across the tech sector this earnings season, companies told Wall Street to get ready for ramped up spending as the artificial intelligence boom accelerates. But while investors largely rewarded the megacaps for their boosted capital expenditure forecasts, or just shrugged off their guidance, companies outside the trillion-dollar club are getting punished. DoorDash, Duolingo and Roblox all saw their stock prices suffer double-digit slumps last week after the companies said spending is on the incline, raising concerns about future profitability. Unlike the tech giants, which are promising hefty buildouts to meet soaring demand for AI services and workloads, smaller companies are getting viewed more skeptically, with analysts uncertain about whether their bets will pay off and result in substantial new revenue opportunities. "Investors don't like investment cycles," Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney told CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime" last week. That's what happened, he said, with "all those companies that went into and out of this earnings cycle and negatively surprised the market by saying, 'We really want to lean into investments first.'" SoftBank said Tuesday it has sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion as the Japanese giant looks to capitalize on its "all in" bet on ChatGPT maker OpenAI. "We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors, while we can still maintain financial strength," said SoftBank's Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto during an investor presentation. "So through those options and tools we make sure that we are ready for funding in a very safe manner," he said in comments translated by the company, adding that the stake sales were part of the firm's strategy for "asset monetization." The Senate passed a bill on Monday night that would reopen the government by a vote of 60-40, with a handful of Democrats voting in favor of the measure. The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown. Wells Fargo expects gold's bull run to continue into 2026. Has there been any change in the bull market story? "Gold remains the outlet for investor concerns over government debt, geopolitical risks, economic uncertainty, inflation, among other factors, while central bank and investor demand should remain robust. We expect that the gold bull run is not over and forecast that price will reach $4500 – $4700 (per troy ounce) by year- end 2026." Take a look at companies making moves after Monday's close: The company's CEO said on a conference call that CoreWeave remains supply-constrained with the availability of partly completed "powered-shell" data centers in which the cloud-based infrastructure company can set up its own equipment, he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CoreWeave shares sank 13% on Tuesday after CEO Mike Intrator addressed delays at a third-party data center developer that hit full-year guidance in its latest earnings report. "Quite frankly, every single part of this quarter went exactly as we planned, except for one delay at a singular data center," Intrator told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Tuesday. He then clarified that a "singular data center provider" is more accurate. "Some people might think it's one complex, but when I go over the numbers, we're talking about multiple places," CNBC's Jim Cramer said. "And it just so happens that the places are all connected to an outfit called Core Scientific that you tried to buy." Cramer noted delays at complexes in Texas, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Intrator said the companies have been working together on infrastructure for a long time a would continue work to bring it online. He did not directly confirm that Core Scientific is the third-party provider. CoreWeave tried to acquire Core Scientific for $9 billion earlier this year. During CoreWeave's quarterly earnings call on Monday, JPMorgan Securities analyst Mark Murphy asked if the delay was related to Core Scientific, but Intrator declined to name the company. At a different point in the call, CoreWeave's CFO Nitin Agrawal said the delays stem from "a single provider, data center provider partner." When reached for comment about how many sites were affected, CoreWeave did not provide a number and pointed to Intrator's statements on the earnings call and during his "Squawk on the Street" interview. CoreWeave, which provides infrastructure for artificial intelligence companies, reported third-quarter results on Monday that showed $1.36 billion in revenue for the period, up 134% from $583.9 million a year ago. Intrator told CNBC on Tuesday that CoreWeave has teams of employees working with contractors and Core Scientific at those sites "every single day" to get things back on track. "It became apparent to us in Q3 that there were delays at the facility," Intrator said. "CoreWeave responded by deploying our own boots on the ground to ensure that everything was being done in order to move those facilities along as quickly as possible." Core Scientific did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz as big tech companies and AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure. The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure, just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.

Apple is dropping a new way to accessorize your iPhone. Apple plans to release this week a special-edition iPhone pocket designed in collaboration with the high-end Japanese brand Issey Miyake. The tech giant said it and Issey Miyake share a mutual design approach that emphasizes simplicity. "iPhone Pocket explores the concept of 'the joy of wearing iPhone in your own way,'" Issey Miyake design director Yoshiyuki Miyamae said in a news release. The $230 long version can be worn like a crossbody, and the $150 short pocket fits on your wrist or can be attached to a bag, as Apple demonstrated in photos. This is Apple's second dip into wearable iPhone fashion in 2025. This Issey Miyake design, however, is a limited-edition accessory dropping November 14 online and in select stores around the world. While it's the first time these two brands have collaborated on a product, Apple has a history with Issey Miyake that dates back to the Steve Jobs era.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flight disruptions that have marred air travel for millions of people in recent weeks could continue even after the government shutdown ends, airlines warned. That vote came as staffing shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work without their regular paychecks in the shutdown, have delayed or canceled thousands of flights, with issues worsening in recent days. Controllers missed their second full paychecks of the shutdown this week, and some have taken up second jobs and are working with increasing levels of stress, government and union officials have said. Airlines will need time to reconfigure schedules and position planes and crews, something they were forced to quickly address with last week's required flight cuts. More than 5 million travelers have been affected by airline staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Airlines for America said . The disruptions have sent some passengers looking for alternatives, from buses to rental cars and even private jets. Last Friday, the Trump administration started requiring commercial airlines to cut 4% of their domestic flights at 40 busy U.S. airports, with larger reductions on the way if the shutdown doesn't end, as officials blamed the strain on air traffic controllers. Aviation groups have said that record numbers of travelers are expected for the Thanksgiving period, with the holiday just over two weeks away. Close to 5% of the scheduled 22,811 U.S. departures were canceled as of Tuesday morning, a relatively light day for travel generally, according to aviation data firm Cirium. That's down from an 8.7% cancellation rate on Monday, or 2,239 flights, and 2,633 cancellations on Sunday, or 10.2% of the schedule. Delays had also piled up with staffing shortages and bad weather at major hubs, including Chicago O'Hare International Airport. The previous shutdown, however, ended hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers snarled air traffic in the New York area. Aviation groups on Tuesday urged lawmakers to not only end the shutdown but to provide more Department of Transportation funding to help modernize air traffic control and hire more controllers, who were in short supply even before the shutdown began. "The government shutdown has disrupted that work and slowed the strong momentum we have built for modernization," said the Modern Skies Coalition, which includes major airline, airport and aerospace groups such as Boeing, GE Aerospace and others, as well as labor unions. President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to dock pay of air traffic controllers who are absent. "All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!! !," he wrote in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who weren't absent during the shutdown. "The job of keeping aviation safe and secure is tough every day, but forcing federal employees to do it without pay is unacceptable," the Modern Skies Coalition said. "We owe public servants at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other agencies supporting aviation, like the National Transportation Safety Board, the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection, a debt of gratitude and a swift ending to this shutdown."

Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story. The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers. But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled. Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. "The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions," said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on the shadow employment market. Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the government shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone. Moreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future. Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday. However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the "quits rate" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the "Great Resignation." A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures. There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision. "For job seekers, that means wasted time. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues," Escalera said. "Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode."

"Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done." Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028. CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies. When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble. Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers "super weird" and "bats--- crazy." It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge. Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Burry said in his X post that "more detail" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should "stay tuned."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American importers say that if the Supreme Court rules that the money they paid for President Donald Trump's tariffs must be refunded to them, it would be relatively simple to do and not the "mess" that some have claimed it would be. Importers pointed to U.S. Customs paperwork that clearly details the tariffs they pay on goods brought into the United States. During oral arguments last Wednesday for a case that will decide the fate of Trump's tariffs, most Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism that the duties were legal. But some justices raised questions about what would happen if they ruled Trump did not have the power to impose those tariffs unilaterally. Justice Amy Coney Barrett said repaying the billions of dollars in tariffs the U.S. has collected since they took effect earlier this year would be "messy." But Rick Muskat, CEO of DeerStags, a third-generation, family run shoe company, told CNBC, "I beg to differ with the concern over the repaying of tariffs as being a mess." "On every customs entry, we detail specific line items that indicate the duty/tariff rates we are paying," Muskat said. On Customs Entry Summaries, importers identify the specific product code, country of origin and type of tariffs being paid. One code on that document classified a 6% tariff for an item based on the name, use and material. This duty has been in place for years, Muskat said. The third line showed a 10% "reciprocal" tariff that Trump imposed by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Since Trump announced many of his tariffs in early April, on what he called "liberation day," Muskat has paid more than $1 million in tariffs. Muskat added: "The IRS has no problem issuing refunds for overpayment of taxes. Greenbar Distillery, a small business that bottles cocktails and liqueurs in Los Angeles, has paid more than $50,000 in additional tariffs — or 10% of the company's profits — under Trump's trade policy. "In terms of getting the tariff money back, logistically, technically and theoretically, it should be easy, because they're all clearly marked and line item," said Melkon Khosrovian, Greenbar's co-founder and spirits maker. "Practically, though, I don't know," said Khosrovian. "This administration has been very creative in finding ways to do whatever they like doing with tariffs." He added: "If we could get a one lump sum, that would be great, or credits on future imports, I would be fine with that as well. But I have very strong reservations that we're not going to see a penny." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a filing with the Supreme Court in September said the amount to be refunded could be between $750 billion and $1 trillion if the court waits until next summer before issuing a ruling that says the tariffs have to be repaid. "Unwinding them could cause significant disruption," Bessent told the high court. "Our wholesalers and retailers will not accept price increases. Both Khosrovian and Muskat, along with more than 700 other small U.S. businesses, signed an amicus brief for the Supreme Court opposing the tariffs. "There have been more than 40 changes to the tariff code this year alone," said Dan Anthony, executive director of We Pay the Tariffs. "The unpredictability is paralyzing, and the cost hikes are staggering, creating an enormous burden on small business owners trying to run and grow their companies," said Anthony. U.S. importers and customs brokers said that if a Supreme Court ruling orders tariffs to be repaid, it would be challenging to execute only if the Trump administration makes it so. If the tariffs are ruled illegal, Mullins said, issuing a refund should be as easy as when U.S. Customs automatically refunded U.S. importers Generalized System of Preference duties on U.S.-eligible imports between Jan. 1, 2018, and April 21, 2018. "With GSP, imports were filed a specific way, and it was a simple process with Customs sending the money back to the importers," Mullins said. She added that because IEEPA tariffs are filed with itemization, the refund process would be similar and, in theory, faster. "But our understanding is if there is a repayment, it may be a little more complicated," said Mullins. The only way to do that, Mullins said, is for customs brokers to fill out a Post Summary Correction, which would be filed for only the specific tariff being repealed. "They are navigating new trade remedy tariffs such as 301 and 232, along with new 232 derivative additions that will continue to be added every 90 days," Mullins warned. The federal government has collected nearly $195 billion in revenue from tariffs for fiscal year 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025. Trade attorneys caution that the volume of paperwork filed by Customs would increase if the Supreme Court decides whether some of the tariffs are legal and others are not. If this happens, the clawing back of tariffs could be more time-consuming and difficult for U.S. businesses. "This will be a huge paperwork burden for businesses," said Joyce Adetutu, a partner at the law firm Vinson & Elkins. "While the paperwork is on a line-item basis, some of these shipments have thousands of products that are intermingled, and some were subject to IEEPA, and some were not," said Adetutu. "You also had tariff rates changing multiple times," she said. "It is going to take quite a bit of time untangling all of that, and it will be an administrative burden."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the weekend, President Donald Trump suggested paying Americans directly for their health-care costs and sending tariff rebate checks to families, not unlike the stimulus payments issued during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump wrote, "Republicans should give money DIRECTLY to your personal HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS." will be paid to everyone," he wrote in another post Sunday on Truth Social. Later that day, in an interview with ABC News, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he had not discussed the idea of a tariff rebate with the president and that there were no specific proposals in the works. That suggests that this is not "a real or likely policy move," said Brett House, economics professor at Columbia Business School. "I don't think consumers should expect to see these rebate checks." A White House official told CNBC that "the Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people." Tariffs are a tax on imports from foreign nations, paid by U.S. entities that import the good or service. An Oct. 30 analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale found that the current tariff policies in effect are expected to cost each household $1,800, on average, in 2025. Rising health-care costs are another issue threatening to cause significant strain. Millions of Americans are bracing for a sharp increase in their health insurance premiums next year as expiring enhanced premium tax credits trigger a so-called subsidy cliff. Although checks "would be a popular policy," said Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, "direct deposit payments are unlikely to happen without Congress being on board." With a partisan battle underway, congressional approval would be especially difficult, he said, "That's another wrinkle here." However, if the political tide changes, that could be a different story. "We do not see stimulus checks in the near future, but could see greater Congressional interest as we approach the midterm elections, especially if we see weakness among consumers," Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills wrote in a Nov. 9 research note. Economists have also warned that direct payments could cause inflation to flare up again. Pandemic-era fiscal stimulus contributed to an increase in inflation of about 2.6 percentage points in the U.S., according to 2023 research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Since the president first introduced widespread tariffs in April, inflation has hovered above the Federal Reserve's 2% target but remains relatively stable, largely because companies built up inventories and were able to absorb some of the impact. Going forward, economists say the Trump administration's tariff agenda could raise consumer prices more in the months ahead. "We still have elevated inflation over 3% based on our last reading," Kates said. The idea of sending tariff rebate checks is not new. In late July, Trump said the administration was "thinking about a little rebate" for Americans from tariff revenue. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., then introduced the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, which pitched a rebate check funded with tariff revenue as soon as this year. According to the Treasury Department's September report, the U.S. collected roughly $195 billion in customs duties so far in 2025, more than doubling last year's total. That would be less than one-third of the people living in the U.S., Philipson said; "if [Trump] includes 200 million Americans, we are up to $400 billion." A separate analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the payments could cost as much as $600 billion, assuming the dividends are designed like Covid-era checks. "They are going to pay back more than the tariff revenue," Philipson said. "Those are the numbers that make this strange." Meanwhile, the White House has contended that U.S. trading partners have shouldered the brunt of Trump's tariff policies, not consumers, he added. I have a hard time understanding why, if foreigners are paying these tariffs," Philipson said. Further, the fate of Trump's tariff policy is currently being argued before the Supreme Court, and any ruling is likely months away.

Investors yesterday were pleased with the Senate's approval of an agreement that could end the government shutdown. The three major indexes all surged in Monday's session, regaining ground after posting sizable losses last week. Japanese firm SoftBank said Tuesday that it sold all of its stake in Nvidia for $5.83 billion. Nvidia shares slipped nearly 2% in premarket trading this morning. But SoftBank is still involved with Nvidia through other artificial intelligence ventures that use the chipmaker's technology, such as the Stargate project. SoftBank also dumped some of its T-Mobile position for $9.17 billion. Paramount Skydance announced more plans to cut costs, lay off employees and raise prices yesterday. The CBS parent said it's aiming to trim an additional $1 billion from its business. As CNBC's Lillian Rizzo notes, that's on top of the $2 billion in savings the company outlined when its merger completed in August. Air travel remains under pressure as the government shutdown strains airport infrastructure. Just over 6% of U.S. flights were cancelled yesterday, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Air traffic controllers, who are required to work during the shutdown, missed their second full paycheck yesterday. Trump said he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for controllers who don't take off time during the shutdown, while threatening to dock pay for those who don't go to work. Flexjet global CEO Andrew Collins told CNBC's Leslie Josephs that demand for flights on private planes has jumped sharply in recent days. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. But Buffett said he would hold onto a "significant amount" of Class A shares so investors can build confidence in his successor, Greg Abel. Buffett said it "shouldn't take long" for shareholders to warm up to Abel, who will take over as chief executive next year. Buffett said his letter will become a Thanksgiving tradition and that Abel will take over writing Berkshire's annual shareholder letters. In typical fashion for the investing titan, the Oracle of Omaha used his note on Monday to dole out some life advice, too. The U.S. is facing a shortage in commercial explosive TNT. CNBC's Macklin Fishman explains why that could make everyday products more expensive. — CNBC's Lillian Rizzo, Sean Conlon, Dan Mangan, Kevin Breuninger, Leslie Josephs, Kate Rogers, Yun Li, John Melloy, Ryan Ermey and Macklin Fishman contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across the tech sector this earnings season, companies told Wall Street to get ready for ramped up spending as the artificial intelligence boom accelerates. But while investors largely rewarded the megacaps for their boosted capital expenditure forecasts, or just shrugged off their guidance, companies outside the trillion-dollar club are getting punished. DoorDash, Duolingo and Roblox all saw their stock prices suffer double-digit slumps after the companies said spending is on the incline, raising concerns about future profitability. Unlike the tech giants, which are promising hefty buildouts to meet soaring demand for AI services and workloads, smaller companies are getting viewed more skeptically, with analysts uncertain about whether their bets will pay off and result in substantial new revenue opportunities. "Investors don't like investment cycles," Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney told CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime" last week. That's what happened, he said, with "all those companies that went into and out of this earnings cycle and negatively surprised the market by saying, 'We really want to lean into investments first.'" DoorDash's stock sank 17% on Thursday, its worst drop in the food delivery platform's five years as a public company. In its third-quarter earnings report, DoorDash said it plans to shell out "several hundred million dollars" on new products and technology next year. "We wish there was a way to grow a baby into an adult without investment, or to see the baby grow into an adult overnight, but we do not believe this is how life or business works," the company wrote in its earnings release. DoorDash has recently amped up investments in autonomous delivery, with the launch of Dot in September, and spent a combined $5.1 billion on restaurant booking platform SevenRooms and British food delivery service Deliveroo. CEO Tony Xu said on the earnings call that the company's investment track record signals "some success in repeating this playbook, and we're doing this now for future growth." "Looking ahead, we maintain our Hold rating as we see limited multiple expansion opportunity until there is greater clarity surrounding how long investments could weigh on margins," wrote analysts at Gordon Haskett. Duolingo also had its worst day as a public company on Thursday, despite beating on revenue and bookings in its third-quarter earnings report. The stock lost a quarter of its value and is now down 41% for the year, after Duolingo said it's prioritizing finding new users. The company has been pouring money into AI features, such as an interactive video call option, as it tries to win over paying subscribers. "There are experiments that put monetization and user growth at odds, and part of my job has been, always, arbitrating between these two," CEO Luis von Ahn told CNBC after the earnings report. Meanwhile, the biggest companies in the tech industry may similarly be years away from seeing if their big AI wagers result in profits. Alphabet and Amazon both rallied after reporting earnings in late October. Amazon Web Services is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure, a market where Google is third, and is racing to build out data centers to meet expected demand for compute capacity tied to AI. AWS and Google are also investing in their own silicon so that they're less dependent on Nvidia and can offer customers a more complete tech stack. Microsoft, which is second in the cloud infrastructure market, slipped after its earnings report, which also included a guide to higher capex. But the company, valued at close to $4 trillion, still mostly has the backing of Wall Street as it competes for more AI deals and bigger workloads. The company expects to spend as much as $72 billion this year on capex, but doesn't sell a cloud service that rivals Amazon, Google and Microsoft. While Meta says it's infusing AI across its product portfolio and improving targeting in its core ad business, the lack of clarity surrounding revenue is giving investors pause. Mahaney grouped Meta in with companies that he said "negatively surprised" the market. Shares of the online gaming platform fell almost 16% on Oct. 30, after the company warned that higher spending on safety and infrastructure could hit margins. Finance chief Naveen Chopra said the investments may weigh on near-term engagement and bookings but are "a magnifier of longer-term growth." Analysts at Benchmark downgraded shares to hold from buy, expecting investments will hinder profitability. Roth analysts, who recommend holding the stock, also see a potential hit to margins next year. Roblox didn't provide a comment for this story.

Ford's CEO had an EV wake-up call after tearing apart cars from Tesla and its rivals in China. When we took them apart, it was shocking what we found," Farley told host Monica Langley in the interview, which is set to be released on Wednesday. Taking apart rival vehicles is a common practice in the automotive industry. The CEO of smartphone-maker-turned-EV-upstart Xiaomi revealed in September that his team bought three Tesla Model Ys and ripped them apart to study every component. In 2022, Farley spun out Ford's EV operations into a new division called Model E. The division lost more than $5 billion in 2024 and is projected to face a similar hit this year, but Farley said he doesn't regret the move. "My ethos is, take on the hardest problems as fast as you can and do it sometimes in public because you'll solve them quicker that way," Farley said. Farley has regularly warned that China's EV giants pose an existential threat to Ford and other Western automakers. In June, he described Chinese EVs as "far superior" to their Western counterparts, and last month he said Chinese brands like BYD were "completely dominating" the global EV landscape. Chinese automakers have outpaced most of their Western rivals by offering a range of high-tech electric models with affordable price tags — and now many of them are expanding overseas, rapidly taking market share in Europe and developing markets. The Ford CEO said last year he'd been driving an electric sedan built by Xiaomi for six months, and "didn't want to give it up." Despite this, Ford's EV push continues to face a bumpy road in the US. "We now know that the EV market in the US is totally different than we thought," said Farley on the "Office Hours" podcast, adding that US consumers are more interested in affordable electric models than a "$70-80,000 electric vehicle." To meet that new market, Ford is once again shifting its EV strategy. In August, Farley unveiled a new EV production line that he said would help Ford beat BYD and Tesla.</p>

Steve McGraw booked with Marriott in November, excited to spend a joyous 17 days in New York City with his daughter and newborn, premature granddaughter. McGraw, a retired tech executive, holds Elite status with Marriott Bonvoy. On Sunday, about a week into his and his wife's stay, he received emails from Marriott and Sonder Holdings, which operates the property, telling him to vacate by 9 a.m. the next day. "We ended up spending several thousand dollars more to find a new place," McGraw said. McGraw was one of the Marriott-Sonder guests who were unceremoniously booted from Sonder's properties on Monday. The short-term rental firm and onetime Airbnb rival filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on Monday, and Marriott said that it had terminated its licensing agreement, signed in August 2024. Business Insider spoke to 11 Sonder guests, who described travel chaos, employee mismanagement, financial fallout, and a loss of trust in the Marriott brand after the fiasco. Sonder, which operates 140 properties and about 7,700 apartments, is just a sliver of Marriott's nearly 1.8 million rooms. Neither company responded to Business Insider's requests for comment. On Sunday, Marriott said that customers who had booked a Sonder property through Marriott's channels would get a full refund. The company added that customers with future reservations would receive an email about the "potential to rebook at another Marriott Bonvoy property." "They handled all our personal belongings, toiletries, clothing, computers, electronics," Strack said. Lenny Coynault, a 23-year-old tourist from Paris who works in public relations, said that he thought Marriott's email was a scam and disregarded it. When he returned to the Sonder apartment in NYC, which he was planning to stay in for two weeks, he found guests confused at reception and staff unable to provide answers. "Being told to leave after only five days, and the lack of customer care, was surprising and disappointing to say the least," Coynault said. He had been planning to stay in the residence for 18 nights. Guests who Business Insider spoke to said they lost hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars because they had to book last-minute accommodations. "It will cost me an additional $1,401 to book a last-minute reservation at a comparable Marriott property," said Murphy, who is traveling with his six members of his family. "This does not take into account the time and frustration of renegotiating the cost of three limousines, rescheduling a hair stylist, flower delivery, and informing all guests to deliver any wedding gifts to the new location," he added. "I ended up looking for something on my own, which costs significantly more due to the short notice and limited availability," he said. Alsheikh, who works at a Saudi development fund, said Sonder had charged him $5,083 for the eight-night stay, which had not been refunded to him. "Given current rates in Lower Manhattan, I estimate that rebooking comparable accommodations could cost me at least $3,000 more than my original reservation." "This has seriously changed my perception of Marriott's customer service and reliability," Walloga said.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Hugo Barrett, 82, who works as a substitute teacher in Maryland. Barrett still works despite two disabilities that impact his mobility, as he wouldn't be able to comfortably pay his bills without the extra income. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Aging isn't something that can be taken lightly. People say that age is nothing but a number. Anybody who says that has probably not seen their mom or dad age. I started my career as a classroom teacher in Newark, New Jersey, teaching secondary mathematics. Six months into that job, I was recruited by an electric company in Massachusetts as a computer programmer and mathematician, working on the missile guidance system aboard the US nuclear submarine fleet. Business Insider's "80 over 80" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. I left after three years and went to work for an aerospace company back in New Jersey. At my final company, I served as vice president, and we had contracts with the Department of Defense. I became a certified teacher and did that for the next 12 years, retiring in 2018. The book started as a tribute poem to my mother. I took the liberty of editorializing and thinking about the decisions I made, and commenting on some of the social and environmental issues that I was affected by. Based on the statistical life expectancy of African American males, I made the calculation that I probably wouldn't make it to 80. Now, I have a smaller monthly payment. I'm in a situation where working isn't optional. Since November of last year, I've been substitute teaching two or three days a week. The money that I'm getting from substitute teaching is partly replacing my exhausted 401(k). My wife, who's 74, used to be a professional trainer for companies, but now she also works as a substitute teacher. I have a condition called lymphedema, which is a malfunctioning of the lymphatic system caused by trauma to my right leg. It's called peripheral neuropathy, which is a disorder of the nerves in the legs, so I'm not able to feel most of my feet. I walk four to five times a week, for one hour each time. Now, even getting to the kitchen is more challenging. I fear that my mobility will get worse and prevent me from traveling at all on an airplane. I'd like to see my two youngest granddaughters finish high school, but that's not likely. I recently stepped down as chairman of the board of the Howard County Poetry and Literature Society and as chair of the Alpha Foundation to make room for younger people to step in and innovate. I need to have some way of communicating with my grandchildren and learn the vocabulary that they're exposed to. The financial part of teaching isn't insignificant, and I look forward to getting those checks every two weeks. I tell the kids that I'm old enough to be their grandparent, and let them guess my age. They ask me what year I graduated from high school or college; I want their guesses to be scientific. One of the guys I was hanging with was willing to do anything on a dare, including things that would get me in trouble, so I decided to bail on him. I tell the students about the choices he made to end up in prison and the choices I made to be standing before them, telling my story. I'm 82 years into my dash, I tell them, but they have a whole number of years before them. So if they ever recognize me in the mall or at Walmart, I ask them to say, "Mr. Barrett, how's your dash going?"</p>

In the race to build powerful artificial intelligence, Microsoft has had its hands tied behind it back for years. Suleyman recently unveiled a superintelligence team at Microsoft and he spoke with Business Insider about how this came about and the company's future plans. What's clear from the interview is that Microsoft will aggressively pursue artificial general intelligence, technology capable of outperforming humans in a wide variety of tasks. While Suleyman has rejected narratives about a race to AGI, the new unit puts the tech giant in more direct competition with its partner OpenAI and other companies, including Anthropic, Google, and Meta. The superintelligence team will focus on building a "world-class, frontier-grade research capability in-house," Mustafa, Microsoft's AI CEO, told Business Insider in a recent interview. "And to do that, we have to train frontier models of all scales with our own data and compute at the state-of-the-art level." This is a major departure from Microsoft's approach in recent years. A big reason for this narrower strategy was Microsoft's previous agreement with OpenAI. That deal barred Microsoft from developing its own AGI through 2030, according to a person familiar with the matter. This reflected OpenAI's desire to maintain control over frontier AI development while relying on Microsoft for cloud infrastructure and capital investment. The new deal lets Microsoft "independently pursue AGI (artificial general intelligence) alone or in partnership with third parties." Potential future applications include healthcare, energy, transportation systems, and reducing the "cost of living for billions of people over the next 10 years," Suleyman said. The team's remit will be to focus on solving fundamental problems that present barriers to the creation of those applications, Suleyman said. Suleyman said Microsoft is making major investments in compute through partnerships with Nvidia, as well as expanding its own chip development and AI-optimized cloud infrastructure that allows training and inference capacity to be shared more efficiently. Suleyman recently said in an internal meeting reviewed by Business Insider that Microsoft plans to make "significant" investments in its own AI chip cluster to help the company build its own models. These custom chips are part of Microsoft's broader push to reduce reliance on third-party hardware and improve performance across Azure's AI services. "There's no reason for us to be religious about that," Suleyman said. "Obviously, we're very focused on getting our products working." As Microsoft enters a crowded field of companies with their own superintelligence teams, including Meta, Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. "This isn't about some directionless technological goal, an empty challenge, a mountain for its own sake," Suleyman wrote in a blog announcing the new team. In the interview with Business Insider, Suleyman declined to elaborate on which competitors he sees as directionless, but said he believes everyone will get behind developing AI that's aligned to human interests. 1 most important thing that humanity focuses on," Suleyman said. Suleyman recently added Trevor Callaghan, a former general counsel from DeepMind and legal director at Google, to his leadership team as vice president of responsible AI, according to an organizational chart recently viewed by Business Insider. The new team comes at a pivotal moment for Microsoft, Suleyman said. "We've got a huge mission ahead of us," Suleyman said. "We have $300 billion of revenues, a huge responsibility to make sure that all of our products are AI-first, that we deploy agents everywhere, and we really make all the workflows that customers use today much more intelligent."</p>

The question is whether that vision can ever become a viable business. Despite a $2.5 billion valuation and millions of sign-ups, the company is still struggling to show how its eye-scanning "Orb" can make money or win over regulators. After stepping in front of the device's glowing gaze — thereby proving their humanity — verified users gain access to what the company describes as an interactive human network. Investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital, and Khosla Ventures have poured $240 million into the venture, according to PitchBook. While former employees said they were drawn to the company's mission and the chance to work on an Altman project, some questioned whether it had a clear long-term strategy. Experts also had concerns over the company's overall viability in a crowded marketplace for both payment products and identification tools. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. "I don't see a sort of killer use case that they've really figured out and will drive major traction for them," Nick Maynard, the vice president of fintech market research at global tech strategist firm Juniper Research, told Business Insider. So far, the company says it has verified around 17.5 million people — a little under 2% of its target. The company says it has Orbs in over 20 countries, from Mexico to South Korea. It has been barred, halted, or investigated in many countries, like Spain, India, and Indonesia. Last year, German authorities investigating the company determined that its data protection measures "would not be sufficient to implement an appropriate level of security with regard to cybercriminals or state attackers." (The company said it was appealing that decision, which is on hold as regulators evaluate World's new technology.) In China, the Ministry of State Security recently warned that collecting iris data for crypto could pose a national security threat. The National Privacy Commission in the Philippines issued a cease-and-desist order to stop scanning eyeballs because it violated the country's data privacy act; Colombian regulators ordered it to immediately cease operations and delete data; and officials in Thailand raided iris scanning locations and arrested suspects "for operating an unlicensed digital asset business." In a statement, a Tools for Humanity spokesperson told Business Insider that, "World was designed for every human, which is why we are proud to have launched on multiple continents, spanning fully connected urban centers to remote rural areas." However, without access to the world's most populous countries — and as international regulators and officials ring alarm bells over iris-scanning practices and data collection — its ambitious goals may be increasingly difficult to reach. "Fundamentally, if it continues to experience those regulatory issues," Maynard said, "then scale will be an impossible task." Launched in 2019, Altman envisioned World as a way to protect against a growing problem: the proliferation of technology that mimics human speech, behavior, and thought. As AI becomes increasingly lifelike, the thinking goes, people need a way to make sure they're interacting with other humans, not bots. Part of this need is in response to the race by buzzy AI companies, like Altman's OpenAI, to create models that can convincingly replicate human nature. "He is creating the disease, but he also wants to create the cure," one former employee, who was involved with expansion in Latin America, told Business Insider. At one point, there were discussions of integrating World with OpenAI to verify the humanness of those using its services, according to two former employees. By doing that, Blania said, they could create a "really, really large network," of actual people — and, ultimately, "a network-based business." Tools for Humanity is a for-profit technology company, with headquarters in San Francisco and Munich; it develops technology for World like the Orb. Altman and Blania, a young German theoretical physicist who was previously a graduate student in Southern California, co-founded the companies, after Altman pitched him on the idea over cappuccinos. In its quest to reach that goal, the company has relied on outside funding, taking in nearly a quarter of a billion dollars over four rounds of funding, according to Pitchbook. It announced a pilot program with Match Group to verify Tinder users in Japan and partnerships with companies like Stripe, Visa, and the gaming company Razer. Blania said last April that the company had already spent millions of dollars to develop and bring them to market. Two former employees said that each device had cost thousands of dollars to produce. "That was the first question we got from regulators, like, 'This sounds great, but how do you make money?'" said the former employee involved with Latin America expansion. "Until they have that scale and the platform sort of becomes self-sustaining then they're going to be burning through cash," he said. The company doesn't charge users to access its platforms, and Blania has said that the company won't become a data broker. Still, there are some potential revenue streams: Last spring, the company introduced World ID fees, a charge for when apps use the company's services. And it introduced a community operator program that allows people to rent or purchase their own Orbs. A former employee said that the company also collected sequencer fees — the charge to process transactions — for World's blockchain, called World Chain. This person, who had knowledge of the financial impacts of Worldcoin, said he did not believe those fees alone would generate profit. "As long as VC money is flowing in, and there's VCs that see value in that," this person said, "it will stay afloat." They've "still yet to provide an actual benefit for people besides the fact they're giving the cryptocurrency," said a former Germany-based employee. Martha Bennett, vice president and principal analyst at the global research and advisory firm Forrester, who has previously been critical of the project, was more blunt: "I actually have trouble seeing it as a business," she said. "There isn't an incentive around buying or leasing an Orb other than making money off of it by scanning loads of eyeballs, and for the users, it's to get some more coins." Meanwhile, crypto experts who spoke to Business Insider raised questions over the long-term viability of Worldcoin, which has less than 0.1% of Bitcoin's roughly $2 trillion market cap. Tools for Humanity's model involved working with independent contractors across the world who oversaw Orb scanning. These contractors were paid on a commission basis for each user they signed up, often in Worldcoin, according to former employees and people involved with iris scanning. Luis Ruben De Valadéz worked as head of operations for a company in Mexico that contracted with Tools for Humanity, and he said he helped open seven stores across Mexico City. Tools for Humanity covered the rent for up to a year and reimbursed the company monthly with Worldcoin; De Valadéz said his employer was on the hook financially for all other costs. He relied on family and friends to raise around 100,000 pesos, about $5,400, for those expansion efforts. (He said that some of these funds were ultimately returned if not used.) Four former employees described the company's early strategy in some countries as asking for forgiveness, not permission — reminiscent of the fast-growing, scandal-plagued early days of Uber, where dozens of current and former Tools for Humanity employees previously worked. Early on, the company appeared to launch in places where people would be attracted by the promise of free crypto. During a recent city council session in Brazil, Bruno Bioni, founding director of the digital rights nonprofit Data Privacy Brazil, said that many people scanning their irises were socioeconomically vulnerable and incentivized by the financial compensation — a sentiment echoed by former workers who spoke to Business Insider. In Latin America, currency exchanges where cash was given for the crypto often popped up around the Orb stations, according to four people and photos viewed by Business Insider. Similar scenarios unfolded in Kenya, said an Orb operator who worked there. (In May, Kenya's High Court declared World's operations unlawful and ordered it to permanently delete biometric data.) The company changed its policies in response to these crypto exchanges, two people said, so that users wouldn't receive crypto until at least a day after the iris scans. The former employee involved with Latin American expansion also said that their team prioritized talking to regulators to explain the project and privacy policies. According to reports, police said the passengers told them they had traveled voluntarily and received payment. "They started in countries quite often where people really are desperate for money," Bennett said. She questioned why it often opted to roll out in developing countries. The company publicly touts millions of users, but the Germany-based employee, who saw a dashboard with Orb statistics, was skeptical. "A lot of those people," he said, "are random people in Latin America who wanted 50 bucks and deleted the app."</p>

If you've ever wanted to hunt down the infamous Devil Fruit in Eiichirō Oda's odyssey-esque manga "One Piece," now's your chance. The first Netflix House is set to open this Wednesday at the King of Prussia Mall in Pennsylvania, where curious fans can take part in immersive experiences based on their favorite Netflix TV shows and movies. Greg Lombardo, Netflix's vice president of experiences, said hosting smaller events helped the company prepare for larger, permanent ventures. "We've been able to dial in the type of infrastructure we need to move them in and out more seamlessly. If transforming popular IP into IRL experiences sounds familiar, you'd be right. Disney did something similar when it created year-round theme parks based on its characters and concepts. Disney's experiences division — which also includes signature experiences, games, a cruise line, and consumer products — made $9 billion in revenue during the most recent financial quarter. Disney's domestic parks and experiences' operating income increased to $1.7 billion during the same timeframe. Netflix plans to open a second Netflix House location this December at the Galleria Dallas in Texas, and a third in 2027 at BLVD Las Vegas. Netflix House isn't a theme park, but it has a variety of engaging activities for visitors to choose from. While entering the Netflix House in Philadelphia is free, guests must pay for tickets to participate in certain activities. Fans of Netflix TV shows and movies won't be disappointed. The first stop on the Netflix House Philadelphia tour was Netflix Bites, a full-service restaurant and bar decorated with nods to beloved characters. The Netflix Bites menu features a plethora of tongue-in-cheek items, including the $12 Killer Onion Dip ("Glass Onion"), $13 Regency Garden Greens ("Bridgerton"), $19 Totally Radical Pepperoni Pizza ("Stranger Things"), and the $18 WWE Smashburger ("WWE"). One of the attractions at Netflix House Philadelphia is Wednesday: Eve of the Outcasts, an interactive experience in which guests can participate in a school festival at Nevermore Academy. After a full moon causes Enid Sinclair to transform into a werewolf, she tasks Wednesday Addams with overseeing the academy's highly anticipated Eve of Outcasts festival. Wednesday: Eve of the Outcasts takes about an hour to complete, and ticket prices start at $39. Another attraction at Netflix House Philadelphia is "One Piece: Quest for the Devil Fruit," in which guests must escape prison to find Devil Fruit, a magical fruit that grants characters special powers. Along the way, they encounter Monkey D. Luffy and other familiar characters. To complete One Piece: Quest for the Devil Fruit, guests must work through puzzles and different rooms until they reach the end, where they can take wanted photos and participate in other activities. The activity lasts around an hour and costs $39. At Netflix House Philadelphia, fans can go beyond the screen and immerse themselves in the worlds of "Stranger Things," "Squid Games," or "Rebel Moon" through VR. "Squid Game Virtuals" and "Rebel Moon: The Descent" are both 25 minutes long, while "Stranger Things: Catalyst" has a 25-minute and 45-minute option. Each golf ball has a chip inside it, which allows it to be tracked and assigned to different guests. hole, guests must decide whether an object is cake or not. We didn't get to explore the Tudum Theatre on Monday while visiting the Netflix House, but future guests will be able to watch TV, films, and other content about their favorite characters there. Tudum Theater is also expected to host dine-in showings, trivia nights, and special events. Right next to Netflix Bites and Top 9 is the merch shop, which offers rows upon rows of merchandise. A Netflix representative said 70% of the items found at Netflix House Philadelphia are exclusive to that location, so there are a ton of options for people looking to stand out.</p>

"The bar to coding is now lower than it ever has been," Ng said in a talk at Snowflake's "Build" conference on Monday. "People that code, be it CEOs and marketers, recruiters, not just software engineers, will really get more done than ones that don't." Ng is a Stanford professor and the founder of Google Brain. He added that it is a "wonderful time" for people to build something they're passionate about because they can be done in less time and at costs that are much lower than ever before. "And that will make people in all job functions much more productive and have more fun." Ng said that computer science majors are seeing an uptick in unemployment because "universities haven't adapted the curricula fast enough for AI coding." "Even I can't hire enough people that really know AI," he said. Ng joins a list of tech executives hyping vibe coding tools and how they're making software development more accessible, even for non-tech roles. Last month, Jensen Huang name-checked three vibe coding startups in his list of six companies that he says will be part of the human-digital workforce revolution. In a September podcast, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said AI coding tools like Cursor have helped him build prototypes faster as someone with a non-technical background. "Rather than disturbing my poor engineers and product people with what is half good ideas and half bad ideas, now I test it myself," he said. In June, Business Insider reported that vibe coding is no longer a nice-to-have skill. Job listings from Visa, Reddit, DoorDash, and a host of startups showed that the companies explicitly required vibe coding experience or familiarity with AI code generators like Cursor and Bolt.</p>

I was born in Yangon, although I grew up, studied, and later worked in different parts of the world, including the UK, Japan, and back home in Myanmar. I was always drawn to new experiences and opportunities. My work in investment banking and asset management brought me to Singapore for almost five years. After being laid off, I found myself in Bali with my then-husband and our seven-year-old daughter, running a small boutique hotel. After four years of island life, I returned to the finance world, taking roles in Japan and later in Myanmar. By the time I got laid off again in late 2018, it just made sense for us to move to Malaysia. I was able to stay with my daughter on a guardian visa, but my husband at that time was always on a tourist visa. We applied for the visa in 2019 and got it within three months. With the long separation and travel restrictions, our marriage dissolved. I was still living in Johor at that point, but after a while, I started to feel it wasn't quite the right fit for me. An old friend told me he could see me living in Penang instead — it's way up on Malaysia's northwest coast, about 430 miles from Johor. I moved in December 2022 and have been living here since. My daughter is now studying at a university in London, so I'm an empty nester. There are about 15 of us regulars, and it's become a little community. For me, Penang offers everything I need — good healthcare, cultural life, and places of worship. There are excellent hospitals here, and temples where I can worship as a Buddhist. Hokkien is a Chinese dialect commonly spoken by locals here in Penang. I'm a lifelong learner, and that's probably why I love the bookstore, the movie club, and meeting new people. When I think about the balance of culture and the richness of everyday life here, I realize how spoiled I am by the access to so many different things. I'm getting older now and have settled into a nice routine. The Malaysian people are friendly, my Singaporean friends are nearby, and I still keep in touch with friends around the world.</p>
