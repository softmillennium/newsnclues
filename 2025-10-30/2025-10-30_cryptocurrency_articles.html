                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple Labs has long stood at the intersection of finance and blockchain innovation, aiming to revolutionize cross-border payments through faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions. As a leading fintech player, Ripple's vision extends beyond cryptocurrencies (including its native token, XRP, and stablecoin, RLUSD), focusing on transforming the global movement of money by building enterprise-grade infrastructure. On the corporate side, Ripple has recently accelerated its push into institutional finance. Following the acquisition, Ripple rebranded the business as Ripple Prime in October 2025, a one-stop institutional desk offering trading, financing, clearing, and risk management across digital assets, foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income, and repo markets. The debate really ignited when Tom Zschach, SWIFT's Chief Innovation Officer, publicly questioned whether banks would ever trust a token-based system like Ripple's. Institutions don't want to live on a competitor's rails.” Which brings one to the central question of this article: can Ripple's technology truly succeed without relying on its native token, $XRP? Together, they form the technological backbone of Ripple's mission to make global money movement faster, cheaper, and more transparent. RippleNet is Ripple's enterprise-grade network that connects banks, payment providers, and financial institutions worldwide. Its goal is simple but ambitious — to replace outdated cross-border systems like SWIFT with a unified network that offers real-time, low-cost international transfers. Over time, Ripple consolidated these products into one cohesive platform, RippleNet, making it easier for institutions to access instant payments and liquidity services under a single network. RippleNet's appeal lies in its ability to streamline international settlements, replacing multi-day, multi-intermediary transactions with near-instant transfers verified on a secure network. For financial institutions, it delivers both cost efficiency and transparency, two pain points long ignored by legacy systems like SWIFT. The XRPL was designed for speed, scalability, and energy efficiency, processing transactions in seconds at a fraction of the cost of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin. Instead of banks holding pre-funded accounts across multiple countries, they can use XRP to source on-demand liquidity, allowing funds to move seamlessly across borders. Beyond payments, the XRPL also supports tokenization, enabling issuance of stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and real-world assets, expanding Ripple's use cases beyond simple money transfers This dual-layer design allows Ripple to serve both regulated enterprises that prefer fiat-based settlement and digital-asset innovators leveraging blockchain liquidity. It's a model that combines trust, speed, and transparency, the very principles driving Ripple's ambition to modernize global finance. XRP was designed to act as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. In this model, XRP is not just “a token.” It's an efficiency play. If XRP is liquid enough in both currencies involved, then it behaves like a real-time global settlement asset. Bottom line: Alternatives exist, and in some jurisdictions (especially dollar-heavy corridors), they may be more politically acceptable than XRP. But none of them are globally mature, neutral, and interoperable at scale today. If you pull XRP out of the system, a few things change across speed, cost, and decentralization: In other words, removing XRP tends to push the model back toward trust-in-institutions instead of trust-in-protocol. But it is not indispensable in corridors where stable fiat liquidity and regulatory clarity already exist. The big question for Ripple is not “Does XRP work?” — it does, in specific scenarios, but “Will large institutions be allowed (or incentivized) to actually use XRP at scale, versus regulated stablecoins or CBDC rails?” Enterprise adoption is often more about quietly solving pain points than flashy headlines. These real‐world implementations matter because they move Ripple beyond mere theory. In these cases, banks are leveraging the network for faster payments, improved transparency, and lower costs, albeit in different configurations, with or without XRP. One of the major hesitations for banks is token volatility and regulatory ambiguity. Beyond mere token speculation, Ripple's enterprise proposition combines software plus network effects in a layered way: Essentially, Ripple offers banks “plug-in rails” to a global payment network, complemented by optional liquidity layers, which help bridge traditional finance with blockchain capabilities. Tom Zschach, SWIFT's CIO, has voiced skepticism  about private token-driven networks being viable for banks. The Ripple/XRP story offers broader lessons for enterprise blockchain adoption, and what kind of token-utility separation enterprises may prefer: Crypto Ripple Prime Explained: How $XRP and $RLUSD Power Multi-Asset Institutional Finance Blockchain What If SWIFT and Ripple Merge Paths: ChatGPT Explains the Case for a Dual-Rail Global Settlement System What is Ripple, and how does it differ from XRP? Ripple is a fintech company that develops blockchain-based payment solutions for banks and financial institutions. They may avoid XRP due to regulatory uncertainty or internal risk policies. RippleNet was built to work both with and without XRP, giving institutions flexibility based on their compliance requirements. XRP acts as a bridge currency that enables on-demand liquidity (ODL) between different fiat currencies. This reduces capital costs, settlement time, and foreign exchange friction, especially in corridors where liquidity is limited. RippleNet uses some blockchain-inspired features, such as cryptographic security and distributed validation, but it is not fully dependent on blockchain for its core operations. It's more of a networked payment infrastructure that can integrate with the XRP Ledger (a true blockchain) when institutions choose to use XRP for liquidity. In short, RippleNet blends traditional financial infrastructure with blockchain efficiency, offering the best of both worlds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has levied a fine of £200,000 (US $260,000) against a sole trader who sent almost one million spam text messages to people across the country - many of whom were already struggling with debt. According to an ICO press release, Bharat Singh Chand of Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, was behind an operation that used a "SIM farm" - capable of sending thousands of texts in quick succession - promoting "debt solutions" and "energy-saving grants." Many of the spam messages made promises to "freeze interest and charges" or "write off debts." When recipients replied "YES" to the SMS message - perhaps in desperation or confusion - they were called back by individuals pretending to work for a company calling itself "The Debt Relief Team." The ICO says that in reality, "The Debt Relief Team" was not a legitimate company, and that Chand used false business names and used unregistered mobile numbers in an attempt to avoid detection. Chand came to the ICO's attention following intelligence it gathered through several previous investigations, including one against a Daniel George Bentley (also known as Daniel George), who is said to have sent texts on behalf of Chand and provided advice about using a SIM farm. Bentley's operation is said to have sent over 2.5 million unlawful texts promoting loans and credit services. UK regulations forbid organisations from sending marketing texts unless the recipient has given specific, informed consent - or if there is an existing customer relationship. In this case, the ICO says it found no evidence of either. “These text messages not only caused a nuisance to many thousands of recipients, but were clearly targeted at people who are at greater risk of harm; such as those facing financial hardship," said Andy Curry, head of investigators at the ICO. Cases like these highlight a growing problem with small-scale but highly automated text spam operations. For legitimate businesses, the message is clear: SMS text marketing remains lawful, but only if it is transparent, and permission has been properly granted and documented. Even sole traders are expected to maintain compliance records proving how and when consent was obtained. And clearly, deliberately targeting financially vulnerable people with fake debt-relief offers is even harder to excuse as it preys on distress. Chand's spam campaign resulted in 19,138 complaints according to the ICO. Graham Cluley is an award-winning security blogger, researcher and public speaker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan said Thursday it had debuted a new blockchain-based tool that streamlines distribution and servicing of alternative investment funds as the bank pushes deeper into tokenization. The platform, dubbed Kinexys Fund Flow and developed by the bank's digital asset arm Kinexys by JPMorgan, aims to give fund managers, transfer agents and distributors a shared, real-time view of investor activity while reducing manual reconciliation and cutting delays in capital movement. This is the latest step in JPMorgan's broader push to apply blockchain tech and tokenization for traditional finance, a trend that's gaining traction among major financial institutions. The bank plans a broader rollout of Kynexis Fund Flow in early next year, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein initiated coverage on Ethereum treasury company SharpLink Gaming (ticker: SBET) on Thursday with an outperform rating and a $24 price target by the end of 2026 — implying approximately 75% upside potential from its Oct. 29 closing price of $13.61. Modeled after bitcoin treasury firm pioneer Strategy, SharpLink has built its playbook around long-term ETH accumulation and staking to earn sustainable yield. "We expect SBET to emerge as a compliant-first-institutional focused investment vehicle to access ETH as an investment and yield-generating asset," the analysts led by Gautam Chhugani said in a note to clients. Bernstein values SharpLink at a 15% premium to its Ethereum treasury net asset value, citing its capacity to generate a 3.4% compound annual growth rate yield over the next 10 years through staking, accretive ETH or share purchases, and other onchain strategies. The analysts described SharpLink as a "leading Ethereum treasury company," holding 860,299 ETH — about 0.7% of the total supply — with a net asset value of $3.6 billion. However, Tom Lee-chaired BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum DAT by holdings, with over 3.3 million ETH ($12.5 billion), according to its latest disclosures. They also noted SharpLink's alignment with the broader Consensys ecosystem, founded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, who also serves as SharpLink's Chairman, and highlighted its management's institutional experience, including recent co-CEO hire Joseph Chalom, formerly BlackRock's head of strategic ecosystem partnerships. Bernstein said the company's collaboration with Consensys — particularly through Linea and its planned $200 million ETH deployment on the Ethereum Layer 2 network — positions SharpLink to benefit from additional yield through staking, restaking, and liquidity programs. SharpLink's shares currently trade at a 19% discount to its treasury value, but continued ETH accumulation, share buybacks, and debt scaling could close the gap over time, according to the analysts. As global interest rates decline, Bernstein expects investors to increasingly seek exposure to Ethereum yields, positioning SharpLink as a key institutional vehicle in that shift. SBET was down 3.6% in early market trading on Thursday at $13.13, according to The Block's SharpLink price page, having plunged 83% since its summer peak alongside the broader DAT market collapse. The analysts said that valuing Ethereum as a tech stack is a "flawed approach," as its objective is to maintain security of the tokenized economy, and not maximize revenue. They project Ethereum-native tokenized assets, including stablecoins on both Layer 1 and Layer 2s, to scale from around $172 billion today to $5 trillion by the end of 2035. They also reiterated their prediction that ETH's price will grow from less than $4,000 today to $15,000 by 2030 and $25,000 by 2035 — implying a 20% 10-year compound annual growth rate for ETH. Gautam Chhugani maintains long positions in various cryptocurrencies. Bernstein or its affiliates may receive compensation for investment banking services from Sharplink Gaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts at investment firm Bernstein initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming with an “outperform” rating on Thursday, saying the Ethereum treasury firm's shares could nearly double as the Federal Reserve lowers borrowing costs. Bernstein analysts issued a price target of $24 per share for SharpLink, representing an 80% increase from current prices. The firm's shares recently changed hands around $13.08, after peaking at $124.12 earlier this year, according to Yahoo Finance. “As we head into a lower rate regime, we expect significant investor appetite for SBET's ability to deliver a sustainable Ethereum yield over the industry Ethereum staking yield.” Like Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, SharpLink seeks to grow the amount of cryptocurrency that it owns per diluted share to maximize value for shareholders. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can be natively staked, allowing anyone to earn rewards by participating in the process of validating transactions. That's one factor making Ethereum “ideal for a digital assets strategy,” they wrote, along with the asset's robust liquidity. “Ethereum's sustainable native staking yield (and other blockchain based yield opportunities) allows a digital asset treasury model to build sustainable operating earnings from the core treasury strategy over and above the capital market funded acquisitions,” they wrote. Bernstein highlighted SharpLink's management team, including its Chairman, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who also created Consensys, the firm behind MetaMask. (Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) The company said that would allow them to generate enhanced yield, which includes rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services through a process known as restaking. “This will likely enable them to generate incremental yield from multiple sources,” Bernstein analysts wrote. Most treasury firms grow the amount of crypto that they own per share by issuing common equity. When a company's shares trade at a premium relative to its crypto holdings, the move allows firms to grow their holdings by capitalizing on the difference. Oftentimes, this premium is referred to as mNAV, or multiple-to-net asset value. Some view this metric as indicative of investors' faith in a company's vision for delivering on its strategy, whether that involves Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets. Bernstein's price target indicates a 15% premium to its crypto holdings, reflecting an ability to generate yield at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% over the next decade. On Thursday, SharpLink had an mNAV of 0.88, according to Strategic Ethereum Reserve. That means the company was valued at a 19% discount relative to its crypto holdings. Eventually, SharpLink could issue its own debt, mirroring Strategy, Bernstein analysts wrote. Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,780, down 5.3% over the past 24 hours. In a Myriad prediction market, just 7% of respondents believe that SharpLink will hold more Ethereum than BitMine Immersion, which currently has the largest ETH treasury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. Governor Warjiyo revealed that the digital rupiah will be supported by “digital central bank securities,” tokenized versions of government bonds, known locally as Surat Berharga Negara (SBN). This approach effectively combines the security of a central bank-issued currency with the stability of an asset-backed digital token, creating what BI officials describe as a “national stablecoin.” Bank Indonesia's new framework aligns with its broader digital finance agenda, which focuses on expanding innovation and acceptance, strengthening industrial structures, and maintaining financial stability. 🇮🇩 Bank Indonesia has successfully completed the first phase of its digital Rupiah project#DigitalRupiah #Indonesiahttps://t.co/eG515hcDNt The system aims to enhance market liquidity by making bond settlement faster and more transparent while reducing transaction costs through blockchain-based automation. Indonesia's central bank says the hybrid CBDC will provide multiple advantages, including greater monetary policy control, improved payment efficiency, and enhanced security. The central bank's plan to issue a bond-backed CBDC could help counter the growing influence of private digital currencies while preserving national monetary sovereignty. Notably, the rollout will occur in phases, starting with a wholesale digital rupiah for interbank transfers before expanding to a retail version for the public. The project's design emphasizes interoperability across digital platforms, ensuring that the digital rupiah can integrate seamlessly with existing payment systems and international standards such as ISO 20022. Unlike Singapore's Project Orchid or Hong Kong's e-HKD, which prioritize programmability and private collaboration, Indonesia's CBDC directly incorporates stablecoin-style asset backing to ensure long-term stability. Beyond policy innovation, the digital rupiah comes amid rapid growth in Indonesia's crypto sector. The country recorded over 475 trillion rupiah (around $30 billion) in crypto transactions by late 2024, a 352% increase from the previous year, with more than 21 million traders now participating. Notably, Indonesia secured the seventh position in Chainalysis's 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no better time to engage with technology than now. Chris Lyons, the president of Web3 Media at a16z crypto, has taken the stage at the AFROTECH™ Conference 2025 in Houston, which is reaching students, founders, technologists, and creators from all walks of life. He encouraged attendees to embrace today's advancements in tech. Drawing from his roots in the music industry, where he once worked as a sound engineer, he references Soulja Boy as a prime example of embracing technology. The rapper used music production software Fruity Loops, now known as FL Studio, to release his debut hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” which was created using the program's stock sounds, notes VICE. “But by having the software and having the equipment makes things 10 times easier for more people to have access to go put out their work,” he continued. To no surprise, AI will play a major role in shaping the future across industries and will create a new bottom line, Lyons projects. As a result of this, he believes there's no better time than now to be involved. Honestly, I feel like there's no better time to be into technology … and to leverage these tools because you have companies like Runway, for example, that make it so that you don't even have to know how to code … You can literally just prompt an idea that will eventually turn into your next iPhone app or your next mobile web product. People are looking for people who know how to use the tools to get ahead as opposed to thinking through the old school days of ‘I have a startup and in order for me to actually build this company, I'm going to need five software engineers,' when literally you can have one person and three lines of code get 10 steps ahead,” he said. This will be key in the next wave of innovation and ensuring we are not left out of opportunities in wealth building and ownership. Obviously, it's within the technology industry,” Lyons explained. And so, making sure that we're keeping ourselves connected as a community as we're sharing the game, I consider it a free game,” he continued. It's not too late to be a part of the movement.

The design of cryptographic hash functions is crucial for ensuring the security of digital information. In this context, cellular automata (CAs) have emerged as a promising tool due to their inherent parallelism, determinism, and simplicity. However, traditional CAs may not fully meet the requirements for cryptographic hash functions in terms of randomness, collision resistance, and avalanche effect. To address these challenges, we propose a design of cryptographic hash functions based on improved cellular automata. Our approach involves refining the rules of CAs to enhance their cryptographic properties. By incorporating random chaotic rules and optimizing parameters, we create a hash function that exhibits excellent performance in terms of randomness, collision resistance, and avalanche effect. Our design leverages these advantages to provide a robust and efficient cryptographic hash function that is suitable for a wide range of applications. The rapid adoption of cloud auditing, blockchain systems, and distributed storage technologies has revolutionized data management for enterprises, yet simultaneously intensified security demands. While these innovations mitigate the challenges of massive data maintenance, their dependence on third-party cloud service providers (CSPs) introduces critical vulnerabilities – CSPs frequently fail to deliver guaranteed data integrity or sufficient privacy safeguards. This paradox underscores the indispensable role of cryptographic hash functions as foundational security primitives. As the cornerstone of modern cryptography, cryptographic hash algorithms operate through deterministic one-way transformations that generate fixed-length digests from variable-length inputs. Their design mandates three non-negotiable properties: ‌Computational Irreversibility‌: Preimage resistance ensuring infeasibility of deriving original inputs from hash outputs; ‌Collision Resistance‌: Practical impossibility of identifying distinct inputs producing identical digests; ‌Avalanche Effect‌: Microscopic input alterations trigger drastic output deviations (> 50% bit-flipping). These properties collectively enable critical security functionalities: ‌Data Fingerprinting‌: Unique hash digests authenticate information integrity in blockchain transactions and cloud audits; ‌Tamper Evidence‌: Avalanche-driven sensitivity detects minimal unauthorized modifications in stored records; ‌Protocol Enforcement‌: Irreversibility secures password hashing and digital signature schemes against brute-force attacks. However, emerging threats like message extension exploits and adaptive collision attacks expose limitations in current hash designs (e.g., SHA-2/3 families). Furthermore, escalating data volumes in cloud-blockchain ecosystems exacerbate computational overheads, demanding hash algorithms that reconcile rigorous security with time/space efficiency. Addressing these challenges through novel hash constructions – particularly for post-quantum resilience and parallel processing optimization – has become an urgent research priority. Sustained advancements in this domain will directly determine the trustworthiness and scalability of next-generation decentralized infrastructures. The foundational work in cryptographic hash functions stems from early designs such as ‌MD4‌ (Rivest, 1990)1 and ‌MD5‌ (Rivest, 1992)2, which introduced efficient message-digest algorithms for integrity verification. Subsequent standards like ‌FIPS 180‌ (NIST, 1993–2002)3,4,5 formalized the SHA family, while ‌RIPEMD-160‌ (Dobbertin, 1996)6 improved collision resistance through dual parallel pipelines. Merkle's work (1990)7 explored the interplay between DES and hash functions, and Wolfram (2002)8 later proposed cellular automata as a theoretical basis for cryptographic primitives. These early efforts laid the groundwork for analyzing hash function security and scalability. The vulnerabilities of classical hash functions have been extensively studied. Boer and Bosselaers (1991)9 demonstrated attacks on MD4's final rounds, while Dobbertin (1996)10,11 pioneered collision attacks on MD4 and MD5. Wang et al. (2004–2005)12,13,14,15 revolutionized cryptanalysis by breaking MD5, SHA-0, and SHA-1 using differential collision techniques. Subsequent refinements by Liang and Lai (2005)16 and Sasaki et al. (2007)17 optimized attack efficiency. Stevens (2013)18 further advanced SHA-1 attacks via joint local-collision analysis. Lee J(2012)19 exploits two backward queries to the underlying primitive to find a collision for the JH compression function, though iteration significantly enhances its collision resistance in the random permutation model. Li W.(2017)20 evaluating its cryptographic robustness against potential vulnerabilities and performance implications for IoT applications. These studies highlight the critical need for robust collision resistance in hash designs. Modern research focuses on post-quantum and chaos-based paradigms. Karthik and Bala (2019)21 proposed a provably secure keyless hash framework, while Ayubi et al. (2023)22 and Alawida et al. (2020–2021)23,24 leveraged chaotic maps, DNA sequences, and finite automata for entropy enhancement. Quantum-inspired designs like Li et al.'s (2023)25 quantum walk-based hash and Guo et al.'s (2022)26 MDPH security proof address future threats. Kanso and Ghebleh (2015)27 introduced chaotic substitution-permutation networks, demonstrating resistance to differential attacks. These innovations prioritize adaptability to evolving cryptographic threats. Parallel architectures aim to optimize throughput for big data and cloud applications. Yang et al. (2019–2022)28,29 designed compressive parallel structures and multi-iterative frameworks for high-speed hashing. Je et al. (2015)30 and Nouri et al. (2014)31 implemented chaotic shuffle-exchange networks and Chebyshev-Halley methods for parallelism. Meysam(2016)32 proposes a novel keyed parallel hashing scheme leveraging a new chaotic system to enhance cryptographic security and processing efficiency. Wang et al. (2011)33 utilized coupled map lattices, while Kevin and Robert (2017)34 optimized tree-based modes. Salvatore et al. (2016)35 proposed a cuckoo hashing pipeline for throughput scalability, emphasizing hardware-friendly implementations. Liu H.(2021)36 proposes a novel chaos-based hash function enhanced by parallel impulse perturbation, leveraging chaotic dynamics to improve cryptographic security and collision resistance in hash algorithms. Hash functions are integral to diverse applications. Yang et al. (2015)37 enhanced cancelable fingerprint encryption via hash-based salting, while Guesmi et al. (2016)38 and Ye et al. (2016)39 integrated SHA-2 and chaotic diffusion for secure image encryption. Teh et al. (2019–2020)40,41 developed chaos-based keyed and unkeyed hashes for IoT devices. Rajeshwaran and Anil (2019)42 employed cellular automata for lightweight cryptographic hashing. Bertoni et al.'s sponge construction (2007)43 and Biham-Dunkelman's HAIFA model (2007)44 generalized iterative frameworks for flexibility in application-specific designs. Beyond attacks, broader security principles have been explored. Lucks (2005)45 advocated failure-friendly design to mitigate catastrophic breaches, while Khushboo and Dhananjoy (2019)46 analyzed MGR hashes for statistical robustness. Li et al. (2021)47 exposed vulnerabilities in authenticated data structures, and Zhang et al. (2021)48 reformed SHA-2 message expansion for pipeline efficiency. Sponge functions (Bertoni et al., 2007)43 and Merkle-Damgård variants (Merkle, 1990)7 remain pivotal in formalizing indifferentiability and domain extension. Proposed a new application of cellular automata-based parallel hash engines with dynamic stochastic diffusion (short for CPHDSD). By optimizing chaotic rules and dynamic parameter selection, it simultaneously enhances collision resistance, avalanche effect, and computational efficiency. The parallel nature of CAs enables multithreaded processing, significantly accelerating hashing speed in big data scenarios while maintaining a compact structure suitable for resource-constrained environments. Demonstrated CPHDSD's exceptional security through million-scale experiments: Collision Resistance‌: No collisions detected, with minimum/maximum Hamming distance approaching the theoretical optimum (256). Avalanche Effect‌: Critical parameters achieved theoretical optima within 3–7 steps, outperforming mainstream algorithms (MD5, SHA-family, etc. Information Entropy‌: Average entropy over 3.9, exceeding SHA3 and state-of-the-art literature results, with output distribution approaching perfect randomness (hexadecimal character error < 0.085%). The proposed hash algorithm employs a parallel compression framework, reducing theoretical computation time (2368*T) to 30%−70% of comparable algorithms. Experiments show its time growth follows a near-logarithmic curve, delivering superior efficiency over traditional serial architectures (e.g., SHA-family) and other parallel schemes for large-file processing. This positions the parallel hash algorithm as an optimized solution for cloud storage and blockchain applications requiring high-throughput hashing. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. “Proposed algorithm” presents our core technical contribution - a novel cryptographic hash function that simultaneously achieves enhanced collision resistance, computational efficiency, and implementation compactness. “Algorithm analysis”, which provides a comprehensive performance evaluation through both theoretical security analysis and empirical benchmarking against existing standards. “Conclusion and future work” concludes with a synthesis of our key findings, discusses practical implications for security systems, and outlines promising directions for future research in hash function optimization. To comprehensively address the design of parallel hash functions based on cellular automata (CAs), the following core principles and interdisciplinary knowledge must be clarified. These concepts form the theoretical backbone for understanding the integration of CAs into cryptographic systems. ‌Cellular Automata (CA) are discrete computational models first proposed by John von Neumann in the 1950 s and later advanced by scholars such as John Conway and Stephen Wolfram. Their core definitions and characteristics are as follows: A cellular automaton is a dynamic system defined over a discrete, finite-state cellular space, evolving through local rules across discrete time steps. Cell: The basic unit of a CA, distributed on a discrete spatial grid (e.g., 1D, 2D, or nD Euclidean space). Lattice: The regular grid structure housing cells, which can be 1D, 2D, or multidimensional. State: Each cell holds a finite set of discrete states (e.g., 0/1, alive/dead). Neighbors: Cells directly adjacent to a given cell (e.g., von Neumann or Moore neighborhoods). Rule: State updates depend on a cell's current state and its neighbors' states, governed by deterministic local rules. Discreteness: Time, space, and states are inherently discrete. Locality: State transitions rely only on a cell's immediate neighbors. Synchrony: All cells update states simultaneously at each time step. Determinism: Given current states, the next state is uniquely defined. Homogeneity & Uniformity: Identical rules govern all cells, arranged in regular patterns. Cellular automata are widely used to simulate complex systems, including traffic flow modeling, crowd evacuation dynamics, biological systems (e.g., morphogenesis), and physical phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics). To sum up, cellular automata are discrete dynamic models based on simple local rules, enabling the emergence of complex global behavior through localized interactions. Their versatility in simulating real-world systems and theoretical significance in computational universality make them a cornerstone of complexity science. Parallel hashing is a strategy that accelerates hash computations by leveraging multiple computing resources simultaneously, such as multi-core processors, GPUs, or distributed computing nodes. Traditional hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 or MD5) typically follow a sequential processing model, where data is handled block by block. In contrast, parallel hashing improves efficiency in large-scale data processing by dividing tasks and executing them concurrently. The essence of parallel hashing lies in splitting input data into independent subtasks, each processed by distinct computing units. For example, in distributed systems, data may be partitioned and assigned to multiple nodes. Each node computes the hash for its allocated data chunk, and the final hash value is generated through merging or cascading operations. Key challenges in this architecture include designing effective data partitioning strategies, synchronizing parallel tasks, and ensuring consistency in the final result. Parallel hashing is critical in scenarios requiring high-speed hash computations: Blockchain Technology: In consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW), parallel hashing accelerates hash collision searches for candidate blocks. Big Data Storage: Distributed file systems (e.g., IPFS) use parallel hashing to rapidly verify the integrity of massive datasets. Real-Time Secure Communication: High-throughput network environments benefit from parallel computation to speed up hash operations during TLS handshake processes. Despite its performance advantages, implementing parallel hashing faces several challenges: Data Dependencies: Certain hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-3) have inherent sequential dependencies, making parallelization difficult without algorithmic modifications or hardware enhancements. Load Balancing: Uneven data partitioning may leave some computing units idle, reducing overall efficiency. Synchronization Overhead: Communication and coordination between nodes can introduce latency, particularly in distributed environments. To sum up, parallel hashing overcomes the performance limitations of traditional sequential hashing by harnessing modern parallel computing hardware. However, its design must balance algorithmic characteristics, hardware architecture, and application-specific requirements. With advancements in heterogeneous computing (e.g., quantum computing or compute-in-memory architectures), the optimization potential for parallel hashing will continue to expand. 1, the diagram depicts an iterative framework for parallel hashing, where multiple 512-bit data blocks are processed simultaneously through independent hashing units. At each stage, groups of data blocks undergo concurrent execution of the compression function H, demonstrating true parallelism in the initial processing phase. This architecture allows simultaneous hash computations across all blocks without sequential dependencies, maximizing throughput during the primary transformation step. The iterative nature emerges as intermediate results from parallel processing are systematically integrated into subsequent stages. After the initial parallel H operations, outputs are strategically combined through layered merging phases, creating chained dependencies that feed back into the workflow. This hybrid approach maintains parallel efficiency for raw data processing while introducing controlled sequential linkages for result consolidation, enabling both high-speed computation and coherent hash value generation across iterations. Here's the step-by-step process to analyze CA rules using entropy. Generate a random binary initial configuration (e.g., a single 1 in the center, surrounded by 0 s). Define a finite lattice (e.g., 100 cells with periodic boundary conditions). Evolve the CA for multiple time steps (e.g., 1000 iterations). Record the spatial configuration at each time step. Count the frequency of each block pattern (e.g., “000”, “001”, …, “111”). For\(\:\:k=1\): Measures entropy of single-cell states (simpler but less sensitive). ‌Compute the mean entropy\(\:\:\stackrel{{\vee}}{H}\) over a sliding window of\(\:\:{N}_{step}\) (e.g., 100 steps): ‌Class 1 (Uniform)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\to\:0\) as entropy collapses (all cells identical). ‌Class 2 (Periodic)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\) oscillates periodically (e.g., entropy peaks and troughs align with cycle length). ‌Class 3 (Chaotic)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\) remains high and fluctuates irregularly. ‌Class 4 (Complex)‌: Moderate entropy with intermittent peaks (structured chaos). ‌Class 2‌: Fourier transform of\(\:\:H\left(t\right)\) reveals dominant frequency (periodicity). ‌Rule 30 (Class 3)‌:\(\:\:H\left(t\right)\) remains near\(\:\:{log}_{2}\left(8\right)=3\)(maximum entropy for k = 3). Fourier spectrum shows sharp peaks at specific frequencies. ‌Visual Inspection‌: Cross-check entropy results with spacetime diagrams. ‌Lyapunov Exponent‌: Class 3 rules exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents (sensitive dependence on initial conditions). Here's a classification of the 256 elementary cellular automata rules based on their behavioral characteristics, organized by Stephen Wolfram's widely accepted taxonomy. Wolfram's classification divides CA rules into ‌4 classes‌ based on their long-term dynamical behavior: ‌Characteristics‌: Evolves to a static, uniform state (all cells identical). ‌Characteristics‌: Forms stable or oscillating periodic patterns. ‌Characteristics‌: Exhibits pseudorandom, disordered patterns with no long-term structure. ‌Characteristics‌: Produces localized structures and long-range correlations; capable of universal computation. The classification schema for hash functions delineates four distinct behavioral categories: the first two categories are classified as deterministic (Class I & II), the third category exhibits stochastic properties (Class III), while the fourth demonstrates non-uniform pseudorandom characteristics (Class IV)46. Through rigorous analysis, the hash algorithm exclusively selects candidates from the third category due to its optimal entropy profile. Class III rules primarily include the following entries: The rules within Class III undergo systematic arrangement in ascending numerical order, followed by combinatorial selection of 16 candidates fulfilling strict equilibrium criteria (balanced 4-zero/4-one configurations across all 8-cell neighborhood permutations). These rules are subjected to cryptographically secure permutation to yield a restructured rule table (Table 1), ensuring stochastic distribution while preserving entropy constraints. A deterministic bijection is subsequently established between the shuffled indices\(\:\:{Q}_{j}\left(\text{j}\in\:\{\text{0,1},\dots\:,15\}\right)\) and their corresponding cellular automaton transition functions. This mapping protocol facilitates reproducible rule retrieval during iterative hash compression stages, enabling: state-space traversal optimization, nonlinear Boolean operation embedding, avalanche-compliant entropy diffusion. Given a key, perform SHA3 calculation on the key and generate the corresponding hash value. To ensure the security, a new key can be periodically replaced. Step 3 Automatic Iteration of Cellular Automata. 0f11f610fc4231452844d064a24f0c6419f7757ca62e849c0a3473a 3c5ba6f2143547c90cfc99 5fb652c008a0f65b9c54af3663b 7bc1bfc6fdac25b1cab5df26 generated by the key ‘CA', for the first message block, select\(\:\:{Q}_{0}=Rule105\), for the second message block, select\(\:{\:Q}_{f}=Rule75\), for the third message block, select\(\:\:{Q}_{1}=Rule45\), and so on, until all message blocks are processed. Divide\(\:{\:m}_{j}\) into 16 32-bit message words\(\:{\:MW}_{i}\:\left(i=0,\:1,\:\cdots\:,\:15\right)\), For message x, we define two variable-parameter permutation functions as follows: Parameters\(\:\:\alpha\:,\beta\:,\gamma\:,\delta\:\) are undetermined, and\(\:ROT{L}_{y}\left(x\right)\) is a y-bit loop left-shift operation function. To obtain better resistance to differential attacks, the values of\(\:\:\alpha\:,\beta\:,\gamma\:,\delta\:\) should be mutually prime; therefore, the differential attack becomes increasingly difficult and difficult to continue. \(\:\stackrel{-}{x}\) is the reverse operation of x, \(\:{TEMP}_{k}\) is the intermediate link variable state at the k-th iteration, consisting of 8 registers\(\:\:A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H\). For each message block\(\:{\:m}_{j}\), conduct 64 rounds of iteration in the following iteration mode: The specific iteration process can be described as follows: In this process, the input of each round of iteration\(\:{\:TEMP}_{k}\) comes from the output results of the previous round and message block\(\:{\:m}_{j}\) iteration compression. The initial link variable\(\:{\:TEMP}_{0}\) is presented in Table 3. As stated previously, a secure hash function must possess strong collision resistance and produce an output that exhibits uniform distribution and sensitivity to slight changes. This chapter delves into the performance of the CPHDSD algorithm in terms of the following aspects: random message testing, character distribution, resistance to statistical attacks, avalanche resistance, collision resistance, information entropy, and efficiency. The local hardware configuration includes a multi-core processor (‌Intel Core i5-13400) with clock speeds exceeding 2.5 GHz, complemented by 32 GB RAM and solid-state storage exceeding 500 GB capacity. Discrete or integrated graphics units support parallel computation tasks, while network interfaces enable standard connectivity protocols. The software stack operates on a modern 64-bit OS (Windows/Linux kernel-based), utilizing Python 3.8 + with scientific computing libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow). Virtualization tools and development frameworks ensure cross-platform compatibility. Security patches and driver versions align with 2023 industry standards for stability testing. Hash seven randomly selected words using CPHDSD. The differences between these seven messages are subtle. Table 4 presents the hash values of these seven messages after processing with CPHDSD as well as the Hamming distance between them and the first message. square wave representation of seven hash values. It can be observed from Fig. 2 that the hash output of the seven messages is extremely irregular, and there is no discernible correlation between them. This is a collision-resistant hash function, which means that attackers find it difficult to find two different messages; thus, the Hamming distance between the hash values of these two messages is zero. In theory, as the number of experiments increases, the distance between two randomly generated n-bit hash values approaches\(\:\:\frac{n}{2}\). In the seven experiments in Table 4, it was demonstrated that several groups of very similar messages with different hash values had Hamming distances fluctuating at approximately 256. After one million non-repetitive experiments using the CPHDSD algorithm, no hash-value collision phenomenon was discovered, with minimum and maximum Hamming distances of 204 and 310, respectively. This suggests that the CPHDSD algorithm satisfies the requirements for resisting birthday attacks. Confusion and diffusion are two fundamental attributes that must be emphasized in the design of most hash functions. Conversely, diffusion requires that the value of each input bit influences the intermediate variable and each output bit as much as possible. In this study, one million unique messages were randomly generated, and the CPHDSD algorithm was used to calculate their hash values. Given the ability of CPHDSD to represent each 512-bit hash value as 128 hexadecimal characters, the total distribution of all hexadecimal characters among one million hash values was computed. Distribution of hexadecimal characters in 1,000,000 hash outputs. In theory, a hash function with desirable diffusion properties should exhibit an overall uniform distribution of hexadecimal characteristics33. A statistical analysis attack is a common type of attack on hash functions. To withstand such attacks, a suitable hash function should produce pseudorandom and unpredictable hash values. In theory, the probability of “0” and “1” in the output hash value should be maintained at 50% each, and the probability of each bit being reversed should be 50% once the input is modified. This section evaluates the anti-statistical attack properties of CPHDSD as follows: a random input is selected, a single bit of the input is randomly flipped, and CPHDSD hashing is performed on both the inputs. After performing 1,000,000 such comparisons, the results are shown in Fig. Information entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory that refers to the uncertainty of various possible events in information sources. C. E. Shannon borrowed the concept of thermodynamics and referred to the average amount of information after eliminating information redundancy as information entropy. The formula for calculating information entropy is as follows49,50,51: In this equation,\(\:\:\text{H}\left(x\right)\) represents the information entropy of message x and\(\:\:p\left({x}_{i}\right)\) represents the output probability function. Different left-shift numbers\(\:\:{\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}({\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}=\text{1,2},\cdots\:,31)\) may have a certain impact on the fluctuation of information entropy. Consequently, this study conducted the following research. The information entropy extracted from different combinations of\(\:\:32\times\:32\times\:32\times\:32=1048576\) for various messages is shown in Fig. Information entropy under the combination of different loop left shift operations. After 10 tests, when\(\:\:\left({\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}\right)=\left(\text{13,14,31,29}\right)\), the comprehensive entropy value under different inputs was the highest (approximately 3.9403). Therefore, the left-shift values of\(\:\:{\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}\) for different circuits of CPHDSD in this study were all set to this value. 6, the avalanche effect analysis graphs demonstrate CPHDSD ‘s cryptographic robustness through two key metrics: (1) Hamming Distance Distribution (left plot) shows the number of flipped output bits when a single input bit is modified. The near-perfect Gaussian distribution centered at 256 bits (50% of 512-bit output) with standard deviation ~ 11.3 validates the algorithm's strong diffusion properties, matching theoretical expectations for an ideal hash function. (2) Bit Flip Probability Heatmap (right plot) reveals each output bit's Likelihood of flipping across 10,000 trials. The near-uniform 0.5 probability (red dashed baseline) across all bit positions and minimal inter-bit correlations (coolwarm color distribution) confirm output bit independence - a critical requirement for thwarting differential cryptanalysis. Together, these visualizations empirically verify SHA3-512's adherence to strict avalanche criteria. Comparison of four key avalanche performance parameters. 7, this log-log plot illustrates the theoretical collision probability of CPHDSD as a function of sample size. The blue curve follows the formula\(\:\:P\approx\:1-{e}^{-{k}^{2}/\left({2}^{n+1}\right)}\), where\(\:\:n=512\), demonstrating that reaching 50% collision probability (red dashed line) requires approximately\(\:\:{2}^{256}\) samples (green vertical line), aligning with its 256-bit security strength against birthday attacks. Diagonal red values (1.0) indicate self-correlation, while off-diagonal near-zero coefficients (mean absolute correlation < 0.01, annotated) confirm strong bit independence, a critical property for avalanche effect compliance. Coolwarm colormap highlights deviations within ± 0.05, validating cryptographic robustness. To comprehensively analyze hash function efficiency, the following methodological framework should be adopted: ‌Scalability Analysis‌: Measure wall-clock execution time across logarithmically spaced message sizes(\(\:{2}^{10}-{2}^{30}\) bytes) using high-resolution timers. Comparative Benchmarking‌: Conduct tests against reference implementations of SHA-256, BLAKE3, and XXH3 under identical hardware conditions (CPU microarchitecture/RAM specs/OS kernel). ‌SmallCrush(\(\:{10}^{6}\)samples)‌: Quick detection of major biases in uniformity/independence. Crush(\(\:{10}^{9}\)samples)‌: Extended evaluation of avalanche propagation and \(\:{2}^{32}\)-periodicity. BigCrush‌(\(\:{10}^{12}\)samples)‌: Final validation against long-range correlations using: Comparative analysis against NIST SP800-22 benchmarks for cryptographic primitives. Results will be visualized through: Log-log plots of time complexity vs. message size, speedup ratios normalized to SHA-256 baseline, empirical distribution functions vs. theoretical uniformity. Key observation that can be drawn from the first subgraph (throughput analysis of 100 MB data) are: XXH3 demonstrates dominant performance (≈ 50 GB/s at 16 threads), outperforming even BLAKE3 by 3.3×. CPHDSD shows theoretical maximum throughput (≈ 80 GB/s) but exhibits diminishing returns beyond 8 threads. Serial algorithm SHA3-512 remains flat (≈ 300 MB/s) due to non-parallelizable design. SHA-256 displays sublinear scaling − 4× speedup from 1→16 threads rather than ideal 16×. Modern non-crypto hashes (XXH3/BLAKE3) achieve > 45 GB/s throughput, making them 60–80× faster than traditional cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) at thread counts ≥ 8. Key observation that can be drawn from the second subgraph(speedup comparison of parallel algorithms) are: CPHDSD‌ approaches perfect linear scaling (Amdahl's law limit). ‌SHA-256‌ reveals fundamental parallelism limitations in Merkle-Damgård construction. ‌XXH3‌ vs. ‌BLAKE3‌: XXH3's simpler mixing function enables better scaling despite lower peak throughput. Performance patterns that can be drawn from the third subgraph (thread efficiency heatmap) are: Hybrid algorithms like ‌XXH3‌ maintain high efficiency through: NUMA-aware memory access patterns, Lock-free thread synchronization and SIMD-optimized processing lanes. Dimensional analysis that can be drawn from the fourth subgraph (3D performance projection) are listed in Table 5: Critical trends can be summarized as:‌ For high-performance computing workloads prioritizing throughput, ‌XXH3‌ emerges as the primary recommendation due to its optimal balance between computational velocity and algorithmic stability, particularly in distributed systems. ‌CPHDSD‌ serves as a viable alternative exclusively in environments with fixed hardware topologies where its hardware-aware optimizations can be fully leveraged. In security-critical applications requiring cryptographic robustness, ‌BLAKE3‌ is strongly advised - delivering FIPS-compliant integrity guarantees while maintaining 85% of XXH3's throughput efficiency through SIMD-accelerated tree hashing. Legacy system architects should adopt ‌Ref28‌ as a drop-in replacement for SHA-256, achieving 3.2× higher parallel scaling efficiency without compromising backward compatibility. Notably, ‌SHA-256‌ demonstrates prohibitive latency penalties (> 800ms/GB beyond 10 MB payloads) and should be deprecated for modern data processing pipelines, while ‌SHAKE256‌ exhibits critical thread contention issues (scaling efficiency < 35% at ≥ 8 threads) rendering it unsuitable for concurrent workloads. These selections are validated through empirical scaling laws and memory hierarchy profiling across heterogeneous architectures. This analysis demonstrates how modern non-cryptographic hashes fundamentally redefine performance expectations in data processing systems. When testing hash functions, TestU01 evaluates their output for statistical randomness by treating hashed data as pseudorandom sequences52. It applies rigorous batteries of tests (e.g., uniformity, independence, pattern detection) to identify weaknesses in the hash function's distribution properties. The performance of the CPHDSD algorithm will subsequently be evaluated across three key dimensions: randomness, key space, and statistical complexity‌. The TESTU01 test suite is divided into three different types of test sets: Small Crush, Crush, and Big Crush, which are used to evaluate varying quantities of random numbers or hash values. The Small Crush test set is used to evaluate approximately \(\:{2}^{35}\) hash values (corresponding to a large dataset). The Crush test set is more rigorous, used to evaluate approximately \(\:{2}^{38}\) hash values (corresponding to a very large dataset). Based on the test results from the TESTU01 test suite, CPHDSD successfully passed all tests in the Small Crush, Crush, and Big Crush test sets. These experimental results indicate that CPHDSD exhibits a high degree of randomness and statistical properties, making it suitable for applications requiring high-security hash functions. According to the actual test results of the TESTU01 test suite for the CPHDSD algorithm, the randomness verification data is as Table 9 (test environment: Intel Xeon E5-2678 v3 @2.5 GHz, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, gcc 11.4.0): All test P-values satisfy the confidence interval requirement of \(\:{10}^{-4}<P<1-{10}^{-4}\). Test Sample Size: \(\:{2}^{38}\) 512-bit hash outputs (approximately 16 TB of data). Compared to the SHA-512 algorithm, CPHDSD performs better in nonlinear transformation tests (P-value standard deviation reduced by 37%). Random number generators are utilized to produce cryptographic keys. In the proposed scheme, parameters from the following three components serve as encoding keys: Part I‌: During key generation using cellular automata, 16 parameters \(\:{\text{Q}}_{j}\) are employed, each with a complexity level of \(\:{2}^{8}\). Part II‌: For generating \(\:{\text{K}}_{k}\), 64 parameters are used, each with a complexity level of \(\:{2}^{64}\). Part III‌: The initial variables in Table 3 consist of 8 parameters, each with a computational complexity of \(\:{2}^{64}\). In practical implementation, since we aim to ensure that the implementation will not introduce any precision-related issues, we therefore assume a precision of \(\:{10}^{-14}\), a highly conservative safeguard—under which the key space would be \(\:{2}^{149}\). Evidently, the scale of this key space is sufficiently large to withstand all forms of brute-force attacks. The field of parallel hashing techniques has seen significant advancements with the integration of cellular automata (CAs). Cellular automata, known for their discrete time, space, and state, along with their local interaction rules, offer a unique framework for simulating complex systems. As research progresses, the potential applications and enhancements of parallel hashing techniques based on CAs become increasingly promising. (1) Enhancing Computational Efficiency: The inherent parallelism of cellular automata makes them well-suited for parallel computing. Future work could focus on optimizing the parallel hashing algorithms to fully exploit the computational power of modern multi-core and multi-processor systems. By fine-tuning the state update rules and neighborhood configurations, we can aim to achieve higher throughput and reduced latency in hashing operations. (2) Exploring New Hashing Algorithms: The variety of cellular automata models, such as those classified by Stephen Wolfram into stable, periodic, chaotic, and complex types, provides a rich playground for developing novel hashing algorithms. Future research could explore the use of chaotic and complex cellular automata to create hashing functions with unique properties, such as increased resistance to cryptographic attacks or improved distribution of hash values. (3) Scalability and Adaptability: As data sizes continue to grow, the scalability of hashing techniques becomes crucial. Future work should investigate methods to scale cellular automata-based parallel hashing algorithms to handle large-scale datasets efficiently. Additionally, adaptive algorithms that can dynamically adjust to the characteristics of the input data, such as its size and distribution, could further enhance performance and resource utilization. (4) Error Detection and Correction: The robustness of hashing techniques is often measured by their ability to detect and correct errors. Cellular automata, with their local interaction rules and self-organizing capabilities, might offer new approaches to error detection and correction in hashing. Future research could explore the integration of cellular automata with error-correcting codes or the development of new error-detection mechanisms specifically tailored for cellular automata-based hashing. (5) Cross-disciplinary Applications: The versatility of cellular automata extends beyond computer science, encompassing fields such as physics, biology, and sociology. Future work could investigate the application of cellular automata-based parallel hashing techniques in these domains. (6) Integration with Emerging Technologies: The rapid development of emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence, presents new opportunities for cellular automata-based parallel hashing. Future research could explore the integration of these technologies with cellular automata to create hybrid hashing systems that leverage the strengths of both paradigms. For instance, quantum cellular automata could be investigated for their potential in creating quantum-resistant hashing functions. (7) Standardization and Benchmarking: As cellular automata-based parallel hashing techniques mature, there is a need for standardization and benchmarking to ensure interoperability and comparability across different implementations. Future work could focus on developing standardized protocols and benchmarks for evaluating the performance, scalability, and robustness of these techniques. In conclusion, the future of parallel hashing techniques based on cellular automata is filled with promising prospects. By exploring new algorithms, optimizing computational efficiency, enhancing scalability and adaptability, and integrating with emerging technologies, we can push the boundaries of what is possible in this domain. The continued development and refinement of these techniques will undoubtedly contribute to advancements in various fields, from computer science to the natural and social sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Bitcoin wallet attributed to early crypto adopter Owen Gunden, reportedly holding over 10,000 BTC , has triggered alarm across the crypto market after on-chain data showed aggressive selling activity. The sale follows a major price drop for BTC earlier today, on Oct. 30. The market leader touched a daily low of $108K but has since then rebounded to $110K. The large-scale move represents roughly 25.9% of his total holdings, indicating a significant shift from cold storage to an exchange. Gunden, considered one of Bitcoin's original holders, appears to be taking profits amid BTC's pullback from its ATH seen earlier in October. It is important to note that October was the strongest month for Bitcoin this year. Major exchanges recorded more than $300 billion in Bitcoin spot volume this month and Binance accounted for $174 billion alone, according to analyst Darkfost. On Oct. 29, all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively lost $471 million, according to SoSoValue. While Gunden's selling suggests a wave of profit-taking, Bitcoin scarcity on exchanges like Binance continues to deepen. While one major holder appears to be offloading coins, broader on-chain metrics show others accumulating aggressively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market's recent price uptick continues to fuel bullish sentiment. Interestingly, investors are rotating into DeepSnitch AI, saying its crypto analytics ecosystem could become one of the best crypto presale buys in the next bull market. DeepSnitch is helping retail investors keep up with crypto whales via advanced market analytics, a factor that investors say positions DSNT for a 500x return. SwissBullion.eu just made it a lot easier for crypto users to buy real gold and silver. The European bullion dealer now takes Ethereum (ETH) and XRP on top of Bitcoin and the usual stablecoins (USDT, USDC), which means you can move straight from your wallet into hard assets without touching a bank. For anyone stacking metals or looking to park profits in something tangible, this is a big quality-of-life upgrade. DeepSnitch ($DSNT) has already pulled in over $480K, and it's built around one simple promise: giving regular traders the same real-time edge whales have. Its five AI engines run 24/7, tracking market shifts, whale transfers, and sketchy contract moves before they blow up on anyone's radar. Basically, it's a pack of tireless bots feeding you alpha straight from the blockchain. If you've ever wished you could front-run the next big move instead of chasing it, this is the kind of tool that might actually make that happen. Using DeepSnitch will be much different from other crypto analytics ecosystems. You don't have to read long charts thanks to its all-in-one AI dashboard, which turns market activity into clear and actionable insights. DeepSnitch also places heavy emphasis on safety and trust. Its smart contract audits by Coinsult and SolidProof have further reinforced user trust. The platform also offers staking activities, allowing token holders to earn variable APY rewards, thus incentivizing network participation while encouraging long-term growth. Still in stage 2 of its presale, DSNT is currently priced at just $0.02073, an attractive entry point for what many investors say is one of the top new crypto ICOs. Layer Brett focuses on providing a technologically sound ecosystem that will boost the development of community-based initiatives. Layer Brett offers lightning-fast transactions, thus powering trading and staking activities in its ecosystem. Staking rewards on Layer Brett are very high thanks to the efficiency provided by its L2 chain. Additionally, token buyers can participate in staking mechanisms, earning up to 590% APR. Already, many have rushed to the Layer Brett presale, buying over $4.4 million worth of tokens. Analysts say Layer Brett is positioned to attract investors from popular meme ecosystems like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. This would make it one of the best crypto presale buys, although given its advanced presale, it may not have the same potential as DeepSnitch AI does. The cross-border payment sector is set to change as Remittix nears its official launch. Remittix is a new ecosystem that helps solve the issue of fiat-to-crypto payments. Despite the popularity of DeFi networks, many individuals and businesses struggle to access easy cross-border payment facilities. Thankfully, Remittix is bringing a simple solution that will allow users to complete payments into over 30 different fiat accounts. Remittix will also bring a transparent and low-fee structure, allowing users to pay less for access to a reliable payment service. Its presale continues to progress with strong momentum as its token sale capital now nears $500k, and earliest backers have already pocketed over 37% gains. DeepSnitch AI has emerged as one of the top new crypto ICOs that could offer parabolic gains in 2026. Investing in presales could be risky, but they also come with the advantage of early entry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One recovery phrase now governs three incompatible blockchains, and MetaMask's multichain bet trades convenience for correlated risk. MetaMask spent years as the default gateway to Ethereum, the browser extension that turned “connect wallet” into muscle memory for millions of users. Now Consensys is betting that same reflex can work across blockchains. In late May, MetaMask flipped the switch on native Solana support, letting its 30 million monthly active users manage SOL and SPL tokens without installing Phantom or any other Solana-first wallet. If it lands, MetaMask will become the first primary wallet to natively support Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. These three ecosystems have historically required separate apps, seed phrases, and mental models. Artemis data from June showed that Solana's monthly active addresses matched those of every other layer-1 and layer-2 network combined. Phantom, the Solana-native incumbent with 15 million monthly active users (MAUs) and $25 billion in user assets, had already made the opposite move, adding support for Ethereum and Bitcoin throughout 2024. The product now offers a unified portfolio view across Ethereum and Solana, with swaps and bridges built directly into the interface. Users can import existing Solana wallets using the same Secret Recovery Phrase that governs their Ethereum keys, collapsing what used to be a multi-app juggling act into a single session. The risk is less discussed but harder to ignore. A single seed phrase now controls secp256k1 keys for EVM chains and ed25519 keys for Solana, with Bitcoin's key derivation next in line. An extension bug earlier this year that caused MetaMask to write excessive data to SSDs on some Chromium setups didn't help the reliability narrative. Consensys shipped a fix, but the episode underscored how extension-level failures can erode trust faster than feature announcements build it. These tools enable gas sponsorship, transaction batching, and session-style permissions, which compose the software layer that lets wallets hide seed phrases entirely and execute multi-step flows without repeated approvals. The result is what the industry calls “invisible wallets,” where users interact with apps without ever thinking about keys, gas, or chain IDs. It's a compelling vision, but EIP-7702 also opens new avenues for phishing. Malicious dapps can request broad permissions that let them act on behalf of users, and distinguishing legitimate requests from scams becomes the wallet's job. MetaMask's security alerts and how aggressively it surfaces warnings around delegate permissions will matter as much as the UX improvements themselves. If MetaMask surfaces Solana dApps, stablecoin bridges, and memecoin swaps in the default view, millions of EVM-native users will sample Solana not because they researched the ecosystem but because the path of least friction pointed them there. Daily active addresses on Bitcoin routinely range from 700,000 to 1 million, and ordinals plus inscriptions have turned BTC into something more than a savings asset. A native Bitcoin tab inside MetaMask would let Ethereum and Solana users experiment with Bitcoin-based collectibles or Lightning payments without switching contexts, and it would give Bitcoin-first users a reason to try stablecoin swaps or DeFi protocols on faster chains. The strategic question is whether distribution alone can shift ecosystem gravity. MetaMask's 30 million MAUs dwarf Phantom's 15 million, but Phantom owns mindshare among Solana users and has spent years building tooling around NFTs, token launches, and social discovery. If MetaMask converts even 10% to 18% of its user base into active cross-chain participants within the first few weeks, it could mean several million people suddenly browsing Solana dapps from an Ethereum wallet. It's not a winner-take-all outcome but reframes the competitive landscape. Phantom will likely double down on power features and community-driven discovery, leaning into what made it the default for Solana natives in the first place. MetaMask is betting that “good enough” cross-chain UX plus account abstraction rails will be more valuable than specialized depth. The SEC sued Consensys in June 2024, alleging that MetaMask Swaps and staking features generated more than $250 million in fees without proper broker registration. Consensys is contesting jurisdiction, and the case hasn't killed momentum, but it adds a layer of uncertainty to every product expansion. Each new chain, swap route, and revenue stream invites fresh scrutiny. Meanwhile, OKX Wallet operates as a full-fledged super-app, supporting 100+ chains and smart account features, demonstrating what's possible when regulatory constraints are lighter. Coinbase Smart Wallet took a different path entirely, using passwordless flows and embedded wallets to push past 1 million accounts created over the summer, all on Base, all EVM, no Solana or Bitcoin in sight. Coinbase targets users who don't know they're using a wallet, arguably the real endgame for mainstream adoption. The wallet wars have shifted from key management to defaults. If MetaMask's Bitcoin integration ships before year-end, 2026 will open with a single interface that treats Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin as tabs in the same browser rather than separate universes.

The Ant Group affiliate says it has not issued any token on any blockchain

Unauthorised projects had been issuing fraudulent tokens using the Jovay name on major blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain and Solana, Ant Digital Technologies said on Wednesday via Jovay's official social media account.

The company said it had not issued any token on any blockchain and urged investors to remain vigilant against crypto tokens claiming to be associated with Jovay.

The incident highlights the ongoing prevalence of cryptocurrency scams, even as the digital-asset sector gains mainstream traction. Since late 2022, Hong Kong has been working to regulate the rapidly expanding industry while trying to attract related businesses.

Ant Digital Technologies, which provides blockchain-based services and began operating independently last year, is the technology arm of Ant Group, which runs China's largest mobile payment service, Alipay.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The MetaMask airdrop narrative is heating up again after fresh reports confirmed that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been brought on to lead Consensys' initial public offering (IPO). With over 100 million MetaMask users worldwide and persistent chatter around a MetaMask ICO and MASK token, investors are now asking one burning question. Consensys, led by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, has hired JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to manage its IPO. 🚨 JUST IN: MetaMask maker Consensys selects JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as lead underwriters for its IPO, per Axios. Earlier this year, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Consensys over MetaMask's staking features, removing one of the final barriers before a potential listing. This will further strengthen MetaMask's integration with on-chain finance. So far, there's no official MetaMask ICO, and none confirmed to be coming. This reward campaign allows users to earn points for actions such as swapping tokens, bridging assets, and staking directly in MetaMask. The points system has quickly become a talking point among DeFi users, offering rewards such as Linea tokens, fee discounts, and potential eligibility for a MASK airdrop. While a few domain names, such as claim.metamask.io and gift.metamask.io, have intensified community speculation, Consensys hasn't confirmed any official airdrop timeline or token details. MetaMask's 10 million unique user base gives it unprecedented reach, and a token release (especially alongside ConsenSys' IPO) could ignite a wave of retail participation. Analysts expect that if a MASK token hits the market, Metamask price volatility could mirror early UNI or ARB surges, as users rush to claim, stake, and trade their rewards.
