                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a key voice in Washington on intelligence matters, is now facing mounting pressure to launch a thorough investigation into secretive government projects following whistleblower testimony about covert UAP retrieval operations. Acting National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Marco Rubio faces growing demands to investigate the secretive US activities allegedly linked to unidentified flying objects. This scrutiny is fueled by remarks he previously made that highlighted the fear of retribution among intelligence officials who act as informants. In the clip, first shown on NewsNation, Rubio is seen discussing several whistleblowers who allege they have direct knowledge of top-secret government initiatives related to unidentified aerial phenomena. Marco Rubio previously said that multiple whistleblowers had shared information with him about highly classified UFO programs and were afraid for their safety, fearing retaliation or harm from within the U.S. military and intelligence community. Rubio confirmed receiving sensitive information from various individuals who reached out to the Senate Intelligence Committee during his time as its chair. 'We say there are people that have come forward to share information with our committee over the last couple of years', Rubio said. Citing the apprehension felt by the sources who approached him, Rubio explained that he had to be cautious when speaking publicly about their claims. The post stated, 'He bears a direct responsibility to investigate these allegations, ensure whistleblowers are protected, and expose any covert UFO programs operating outside lawful oversight', the post read. 'I will say, I find most of these people at some point or maybe even currently have held very high clearances in high positions within our government...', he stated. He then posed the question, 'So you do ask yourself, what incentive would so many people with that kind of qualification have to come forward and make something up?' Furthermore, Rubio's admission that numerous whistleblowers have emerged, some allegedly fearing retribution, has increased demands for more robust protections for informants across the intelligence and defence communities. These newly surfaced remarks from Rubio are consistent with earlier statements he made this year concerning the upcoming UFO Revolution documentary. Specifically, in an interview quoted by Entertainment Weekly, Rubio shared that unidentified objects were spotted hovering over American' restricted nuclear facilities'. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reveals that UFOs have been observed flying over restricted U.S. nuclear facilities which are not from our world.Marco Rubio claims people have lost their lives speaking out about these things.The upcoming documentary The Age of Disclosure will… pic.twitter.com/KqBfWrqGBp Because he previously championed 'serious inquiry, not sensationalism', many now regard his expanded authority as essential for bringing the truth to light. Advocates for transparency regarding UAPs contend that Rubio's dual appointment grants him the necessary power and responsibility to ensure accountability. This viral X post, along with corroborating testimony from former intelligence personnel like David Grusch, has fueled renewed speculation about whether specific parts of the US defence sector have managed UFO programs outside of proper legal scrutiny. Rubio has remained silent regarding the surge of public pressure. All eyes are on Marco Rubio, a central figure in national security, and whether he will move past mere acknowledgement to spearhead a formal inquiry into the explosive allegations that have captivated the legislative branch and the American people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immediately after stepping inside the Montvale Hotel's room 310, Jennifer Von Behren said she sensed a female spirit . Fellow paranormal researcher Kika Morelan took out a vintage audio recorder that's no longer in production and routinely sells on eBay for over $1,000. Morelan said this Panasonic DR60 can pick up the voices of spirits. If there is someone here with us, can you please say hello?” Morelan said while recording, pausing a beat before continuing. Founded by  Morelan two decades ago, the Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group can get as many as five calls a day come October – their busy season. Morelan, 63, estimates she has conducted at least 200 investigations . The Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group has an official business license and general liability insurance. Von Behren, 48, is not officially part of the Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group, but she has accompanied Morelan and the other three members on investigations when she can for the past 10 years. We  are paranormal researchers who investigate anything mysterious, paranormal, unnatural thing using equipment, since we're not psychics.” Being a medium is like taking the five senses and “kicking them up a notch,” Von Behren said. A Coeur d'Alene mother to three boys, she described herself as a “serial entrepreneur,” having owned shops, selling “telepathy decks” of cards and hosting one-on-one “spirit readings” professionally. She said she can tell how many ghosts are in a building just from seeing a picture of it. “Yeah, so, real people that really do this stuff, most of us want to help people, and then this is like a fun side thing,” Von Behren said about touring “haunted” locations. “And it does help people, too… because then they understand why things are going bump in the night. Is it something that needs to go away? “Most of the calls we get are people that have issues with the paranormal and they have nobody else to talk to, because everyone is going to think they're crazy,” she said. “So we listen a lot of times. They just need somebody to listen – and, we can handle things over the phone with the distant readings.” You believe or you don't – we don't care one way or the other,” Morelan said. That didn't stop them from getting giddy about a walkthrough of one of Downtown Spokane's iconic hotels – The Montvale. Built in 1899 by Spokane Judge John W. Binkley, The Montvale functioned as an apartment building, a brothel and a youth hostel until Expo ‘74 before shutting down for 30 years. Under developer Rob Brewster, the hotel reopened in 2005, and today, the ground floor is occupied by pubs and cafes while the upper two floors are hotel rooms. Room 310 was the first stop, picked by Montvale manager Zachary Neighbors because of complaints from guests. There was no clear response after Moreland started recording , but Von Behren said the ghost was answering the questions. Morelan unloaded her backpack of other ghost detection tools – an electromagnetic field detecting call bell, music box, light and two flashlights, unscrewed just far enough to turn off but be turned back on by the slightest touch. It is not immediately apparent whether a woman named Caitlin was actually killed in the streets in front of the hotel. Von Behren said that the ghost likes to “mess with the T.V.” and make things move to “freak people out” in room 310, along with the room next to it. The bell rang intermittently as she spoke. In room 203, Von Behren and Morelan repeated the procedure. Von Behren said that this room was haunted as well, a male ghost reporting that he had died of a heart attack. Neighbors said he didn't know if anybody had died in the room. The Montvale basement is largely used for storage. There is also a dimly lit corner, home to dozens of pipes and a standalone chair, never moved by Neighbors because “I feel like it is somebody's.” Sure enough, Von Behren said there were two men around the chair. Morelan set up her equipment, and the flashlights flickered on and off as Von Behren said that the ghosts were drinking buddies in life. One seemed to be a smuggler from the prohibition era, she said, the other a flirty bartender. There are rumors that alcohol was smuggled through underground tunnels in Spokane during the prohibition, though historian John Fahey told the Inlander over 20 years ago that while there were utility tunnels under downtown buildings, it is unlikely they were used for transporting alcohol. Morelan and Von Behren found a fourth ghost in a dark stairwell in the basement as well, one that Von Behren said touched her hair. Neighbors also said that he has experienced the sensation of cobwebs on his head in the stairwell before, only to find that there is nothing there. This ghost was skittish, and Von Behren said it wouldn't play with the toys. The Historic Davenport hotel has long been regarded one of the must-visit haunted locations in Spokane for paranormal enthusiasts. “This is where I met Bing Crosby,” Von Behren said, standing outside the Davenport's Marie Antoinette Ballroom. It was his ghost she met, of course, along with Al Capone's. Crosby grew up in Spokane and began his professional music career partially in what is now the Bing Crosby Theater in 1925, but he also played with his band “The Musicaladers” at the hotel early on. It is unclear whether Al Capone himself ever visited the city. An employee at the hotel, Archie Gonia, 25, was also murdered on site in 1973, left beaten and strangled on floor 12. “So you get to see the history of the buildings, you get to see cool things like basements.” While many believers in the paranormal might agree that old buildings tend to house a spirit or two, as far as recent memory serves, ghost hunters have never toured the tower. Two ghosts were in the basement of the building, standing among archived newspapers and files, according to Von Behren. When Von Behren entered the storage room, she said that it felt like water had been there before. Flashlights set up by Morelan flashed a few times, and the music box played briefly, though the electromagnetic field devices could be impacted by the basement's pipes, she said. Tenants live in some spaces of the building, and walking through the residential staircase, Von Behren said that there were two ghosts. One, an agitated drunk man slumped in a corner, and another, a man who had been shot in the head. “She's, like, sitting on the floor trying to play with everything, and she says, ‘This is fascinating. Downtown Spokane is a hotspot for ghosts who like to party, Von Behren said. Ghosts are everywhere, though, she and Morelan said. She says that they distract from the paranormal activity, and so the Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group is not welcoming new members. Anyone interested in ghost hunting can get started on their own, though, Morelan said. Von Behren said that she will lead public investigations because she knows “how to protect the entire group.” Spirits can be dangerous, after all. Gifts processed in this system are tax deductible.
