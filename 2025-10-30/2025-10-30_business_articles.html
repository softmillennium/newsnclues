                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is heading into its latest earnings report as the laggard of the Magnificent Seven this year, and investors are looking for some key updates that could spark new momentum. Specifically, Wall Street wants to know more about its AI ambitions and how it plans to position itself against stiff competition from other Big Tech players like Microsoft and Alphabet. AWS, retail margins, and any lingering concerns over the impact of tariffs will also be on investors' radar. Investors will be listening for any details that CEO Andy Jassy and the company offer about Amazon's grocery business in light of a recent reboot. In June, a memo obtained by Business Insider showed that Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go were being united under a single "One Grocery" operation eight years after Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global automakers are once again bracing for production disruptions due to a potential shortage of automotive semiconductor chips, this time sparked by the Dutch government amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. Honda Motor became the first known automaker this week to reduce production due to the problem that involves chips from Netherlands supplier Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese company Wingtech Technology Co. The industry was hopeful that a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Asia would provide some relief, but no resolution on the chips issue has been announced. Volkswagen on Thursday reportedly said it has until at least next week before its supplies impact production, while other major automakers have said they are monitoring the situation around the clock, attempting to mitigate disruptions. "The chip situation from Nexperia, we have a cross-functional 'war room' in the building where I'm sitting that has this as [a] primary job," Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told investors during a quarterly call Thursday. Such "war rooms" have become a regular practice in the automotive industry amid supply chain disruptions, which have become more common since the Covid pandemic rattled production and deliveries of many parts, including chips, starting in 2020. Several automotive industry insiders confirmed to CNBC that war rooms have been established in their companies, as they look into alternative purchasing methods. They included working with major suppliers in an attempt to find alternative sources as well as buying on the open market. China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm in Europe's auto industry. German automakers are especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as "Tier 1s," and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said this week that carmakers were close to closing production lines because of the chip shortage, which comes four years after a shortage of such parts amid the coronavirus pandemic. "This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation," ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement. The chips affected are legacy semiconductors used in basic vehicle functions such as windshield wipers and window controls — parts that lack sufficient alternative sources, according to S&P Global Mobility. A Wingtech spokesperson on Thursday condemned the Dutch government's actions, saying the company "will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so." "Only by restoring full control and ownership rights to the company's rightful shareholders and management, and by ceasing political interference in corporate governance, can the Dutch government begin to repair the damage to its reputation, de-escalate international tension, and safeguard its own and European economic security," the spokesperson said via an emailed statement. Honda's production cuts impacts include all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. "We are currently managing an industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue, making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts and meet the needs of our customers," Honda said Thursday in an emailed statement, calling it a "fluid" situation. Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley last week said the chip problem was at the forefront of conversations when he made a trip to Washington, D.C, earlier this month. He called it a "political issue," saying the company is working with the U.S. and China administrations to resolve it. A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry," said Farley, adding that automakers have gotten "really good" at maximizing component purchases such as chips following the crisis in 2021. General Motors CEO Mary Barra made similar comments last week, calling it an "industry issue" that will hopefully be resolved soon. "While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. Other automotive executives from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and more have also shared similar thoughts with investors and the media. "This is a politically induced situation ... which means that the solution to this, or the resolution to this, resides in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, in this case, with Europe kind of caught in the middle," Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said Wednesday during an earnings call.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are looking for: Wall Street is also looking at other key revenue numbers: AWS growth will be a major focus for investors once again, as the company faces intensifying pressure from cloud competitors Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week. Revenue at AWS is projected to expand 18.1% year over year, which is about the same growth rate as the second quarter. Google's cloud revenue accelerated 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%. AWS stumbled last week during an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites as a result. The Amazon unit is also battling the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services. Anthropic and Google deepened their cloud partnership last week in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars, while Meta has inked hefty cloud deals with Google and Oracle in recent months. Amazon on Wednesday opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, which was first announced last December and is intended to train and run models from Claude chatbot creator Anthropic. Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025. During last quarter's earnings conference call, investors grilled Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on AWS growth and AI competition. Jassy reiterated AWS has a "pretty significant" leadership position in cloud market share, while noting that it's still "early" days in the AI industry that remains "very top heavy" with a "small number of very large frontier models." Amazon said earlier this month it planned to hire 250,000 workers to staff up for peak season, the same number as the last two years. During the third quarter, Amazon held its annual Prime Day deals event. Online spending reached $24.1 billion in the U.S. across the four-day stretch in July, according to Adobe, exceeding its estimates and representing growth of 30.3% year over year. Jassy told investors last quarter that President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies haven't dented demand or driven up prices so far this year. For the fourth quarter, analysts surveyed by LSEG are projecting sales to reach $208.1 billion, representing growth of 10.8% from a year earlier. Amazon on Tuesday initiated massive layoffs, cutting about 14,000 roles across nearly every area of the company. Once the job reductions are complete, they're expected to be the largest corporate cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roblox shares sank 10% on Thursday as the company said it expects increased capital expenditures that could pressure margins. The gaming company said it expects capital expenditures of $468 million, an increase of $158 million from prior guidance. "Our operating margin could decline slightly year-over-year due to the combination of higher DevEx rates and the impact of infrastructure and safety related investments catching up with rapid bookings growth in the back half of 2025," the company said in a letter to shareholders. The gaming company's margin and spending comments overshadowed an otherwise strong third-quarter report. The company posted a loss of 37 cents per share, which beat analyst expectations for a loss of 49 cents per share. "Our third-quarter results demonstrate the tremendous progress weʼve made toward our goal of capturing 10% of the global gaming market," CEO David Baszucki said in a release. Average daily users were at 151.5 million, up 70% over the year prior, but average bookings per DAU of $12.68 missed the StreetAccount expectation of $13.24. Rising parental concerns over online gaming and platforms, plus inquiries from lawmakers, have led to a wave of child-safety regulations within the technology sector and pressure on artificial intelligence companies to do more. Roblox is facing multiple lawsuits alleging that the platform enables predators to sexually exploit and abuse underage victims. Baszucki told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Thursday that safety was the company's "top priority" and it has already put in place several security measures to protect minors on the platform. "On Roblox, there is no sharing of images, all our text is filtered, and we're really highlighting our commitment to really innovating in this space," Baszucki said. Roblox implemented age-verification software in July that uses facial scans to estimate users' ages and place them in an appropriate age group: under 13, over 13, and over 18. Those who are over 13 can then access "trusted connections," a new communication feature that allows users to chat more freely. The company also announced on Wednesday that it would join the Attorney General Alliance in launching a new child safety initiative, dubbed the Partnership for Youth Online Safety, which seeks to establish best practices for designing tech and deterring online child exploitation.

Some student-loan borrowers in public service might lose access to debt relief. On Thursday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced that it had finalized its rule to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments. "With this new rule, the Trump Administration is refocusing the PSLF program to ensure federal benefits go to our Nation's teachers, first responders, and civil servants who tirelessly serve their communities," Kent said. Share your story about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program with asheffey@businessinsider.com. A fact sheet from the Department of Education said that the final rule amends the definition of a qualifying employer "to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose." Advocates for student-loan borrowers criticized the final rule and plan to take legal action. "That's why we will soon see the Trump-Vance Administration in court," they said. Aaron Ament, president of borrower protection group Student Defense, said that the administration "is punishing public servants for their employers' perceived political views." "We will file a lawsuit in the next few days and challenge this illegal overreach," Ament said. Student-loan borrowers in PSLF previously told Business Insider that they're concerned about losing relief if their eligibility changes. "I'm so close to the finish line," Jeff Hughes said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The central bank held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the third consecutive time, having last cut rates in June. The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting the ECB's target rate of 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from last year's record high of 4%. The robust labour market, solid private sector balance sheets and the Governing Council's past interest rate cuts remain important sources of resilience," it said. It cautioned, however, that "the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions." While the euro zone inflation rate inched up to 2.2% in September, up from 2% the previous month, the rise was attributed to an increase in services prices and economists had said the central bank was likely to remain cautious about meddling with rates right now. The figure was above expectations and showed that economic activity remained resilient, despite prevailing uncertainty over business activity following U.S. trade tariffs. ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters that while the services sector continued to grow — boosted by strong tourism and a pick-up in digital services — manufacturing had been "held back by higher tariffs, still heightened uncertainty and a stronger euro." She added that the divergence between external and internal demand is "likely to persist" in the near term. "The economy should benefit from consumers spending more as real incomes rise," Lagarde noted. "From a monetary policy point of view, we are in a good place," Lagarde told CNBC's Annette Weisbach. "What a boring announcement," Mike Coop, chief investment officer of EMEA at Morningstar Wealth, told CNBC Thursday. "It does belie the fact that inflation actually has gone back to being pretty much well behaved ... so it's hardly surprising that they're not feeling in a rush to change rates," he told CNBC's "Decision Time." On top of those three things, you also have now the U.S. sucking investment out of other parts of the world, so Europe hasn't had that stimulus, that we've seen in the U.S., to support growth," he told CNBC's Karen Tso. The central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting, and it repeated this stance on Thursday. However, top ECB board members told CNBC this month that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end. Martin Kocher, European Central Bank Governing Council member and governor at Austrian National Bank, said that as long as nothing "drastic" happens, Europe is "OK." "At the moment, I think we're in a good place. So, there's no reason to change anything, as long as there are no changes that force us to do something, Kocher said, speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. "And if you take the larger picture, yes, the easing cycle is close to an end or at its end, but there's no reason to pre-commit at that stage." In a separate interview, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau said he recommended "agile pragmatism" when it comes to the path for interest rates, adding: "We are in a good position ... but a good position is not a fixed position." A majority of economists polled in mid-October by Reuters said the ECB would hold its deposit rate this year, while 45 of 79 economists polled (57%) saw no change by the end of 2026. — CNBC's Tasmin Lockwood and Leonie Kidd contributed reporting to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China agreed to pause for one year the sweeping export controls on rare earths announced on Oct. 9 that had touched off the dispute. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the rare earths agreement is a one-year deal that will be "very routinely extended as time goes by." The president said he plans to visit China in April and Xi will come to the U.S., either Palm Beach, Florida or Washington, D.C., at a later date Trump had previously threatened the slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 over its rare earths controls. The U.S. will postpone a rule announced on Sept. 29 that blacklisted majority-owned subsidiaries of Chinese companies on an entity list, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Commerce. The U.S. and China also agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports. Beijing had surprised the White House with strict export controls on rare earths ahead of the meeting between Trump and Xi, exploiting its dominance of the global supply chain to gain leverage over Washington. The U.S. is dependent on China for rare earths, which are used to produce magnets that are key inputs in weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles and other applications. China successfully used the rare earths export controls and a soybean embargo to force the U.S. to lower tariffs, Wolfe Research strategist Tobin Marcus told clients in a note. "Xi was ready for Trump in his second term and has a powerful weapon in rare earths," Piper Sandler analysts led by Andy Laperriere told clients. "Where we are is an uneasy truce in a long, still simmering trade war," Burns told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday. It is not entirely clear what China has agreed to in key areas such as agriculture and energy purchases from the U.S. and cooperation on fentanyl trafficking. Trump said Beijing has agreed to purchase large amounts of a soybeans, sorghum and other farm products. China will buy 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually over the next three years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business in an interview. But China's Ministry of Commerce simply said the two sides agreed to expand agricultural trade without providing specifics. Beijing had made promises on soybeans and fentanyl during Trump's first term, Piper Sandler analyst Laperriere said. "So it's doubtful Trump received anything in return for lowering tariffs on China," he said. Trump said China may buy a large amount of oil and gas from Alaska, but a deal still has to be reached. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will meet with Chinese officials to see if such an agreement can be worked out, Trump said. The president said he discussed the export of Nvidia chips with Xi and will speak with CEO Jensen Huang about it. "I said that's really between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator," Trump said on Air Force One. China's Ministry of Commerce said Beijing will work with the U.S. to "resolve issues related to TikTok," though no further detail was provided. Trump did not mention TikTok during his comments to reporters aboard Air Force One or in a Truth Social post about the truce with China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's call for the U.S. to resume nuclear testing after a more than 30-year pause has caught Russia's attention, with the Kremlin warning on Thursday that it would "act accordingly" if a Cold War-era moratorium on nuclear weapons' testing was broken. Ahead of his high-profile talks with China's President Xi Jinping in Asia on Thursday, Trump said he had instructed the Pentagon — rebranded as the "Department of War" — to resume nuclear testing. "The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country ... Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years. Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked by reporters for his reaction to Trump's comments on resuming nuclear tests. "Trump mentioned in his statement that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Until now, we were not aware that anyone was testing anything," Peskov told journalists, in comments translated by NBC News. "And if the Burevestnik test is somehow being referred to, it is in no way a nuclear test," he added. "All countries are developing their defense systems, but this is not a nuclear test," Peskov said. He did not provide further details on how Russia would act. Asked if this was the start of a new arms race with the West, Peskov replied, "no," but tensions over nuclear weapons have simmered for decades despite various attempts to get rival powers to cease the development, testing and modernizing of existing or new nuclear arsenals. In 1963, the Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed initially by the U.S., U.K. and Russia, banned nuclear tests in all environments except underground. China and Russia aren't known to have conducted any tests since the 1990s, either. In 2023, however, Russia rescinded its ratification of the treaty, saying it did not approve of the U.S.' attitude toward global security. Trump's announcement comes after Russia flexed its military muscle last week by testing its much-vaunted Burevestnik long-range cruise missile, which is capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. Russia boasted that the missile is "invincible," has an "unlimited range" and can evade air and missile defense systems. Trump was less than impressed by the test, saying Russia should focus instead on ending the war in Ukraine. It's likely there was some wariness in Moscow on Thursday, with the country having watched its longtime geopolitcal ally Xi Jinping hold cordial talks with Trump, with the leaders praising an apparently fruitful meeting in South Korea. Trump said he reached a 1-year agreement with China on rare earth supplies and he also cut fentanyl-linked tariffs on Beijing by half, taking overall duties on Chinese goods down to 47%. China had also "agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy," Trump stated later in a Truth Social post, adding: "In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska." The seemingly warm meeting, and tangible results, of the Trump-Xi talks will not be music to Moscow's ears, given its close relationship with China, which it prizes as one of the few powerful geopolitical and trade partners it has left after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. When it came to the more than three-and-a-half year conflict in Ukraine, Trump said the issue "did come up" and that the U.S. and China were going to work together to stop people being killed. He also signaled his fatigue with the war, however, stating, "The two sides are locked in fighting, and sometimes you've got to let them fight I guess.

In its Q3 earnings release, Google said its Gemini app has hit 650 million monthly active users, a 200 million increase since July. That still trails ChatGPT's 800 million weekly, but it's closing the gap. It's largely thanks to the arrival of Google's image editing tool — better known as Nano Banana — that became a viral hit back in August, said Josh Woodward, the VP of Google Labs who leads the Gemini app. More importantly for Google, a lot of users then started using the Gemini app for other tasks, he told Business Insider. And crucially, it's bringing in different types of users. That includes "huge growth" in the 18-34 age cohort and a shift from being heavily male-skewed to having more female users, Woodward said. Bringing in younger users is good news for Google, which has long worried about them spending more time on TikTok and other social media platforms. Gemini has also seen an international surge, said Woodward. That's not a huge surprise: One of Nano Banana's biggest viral surges was users creating 3D figurines of themselves with the image tool. For Google, bringing in users with a viral sensation like Nano Banana will often lead them to try other features and — Google hopes — keep them coming back for more. Google defines a monthly active user as someone who opens the app in either Android or iOS, or uses it on the web, and interacts with it. "I can imagine there will be metrics in the future we want to report, like how many successful tasks did we complete for a person?" "That could be dozens or hundreds in a day over time. The Gemini 2 phase has felt like a bridge between these two ideas. Google has provided glimpses of what this will look like, such as its Project Mariner agent for the browser and an "Agent Mode" that is in early testing for the app. Yet many of these early general-purpose agents still feel wonky. "There's still a lot more to do on that. I feel like where we are, almost as an industry in some ways, is these agents can do maybe three to four or five tasks with a few tool use calls," said Woodward, referring to when AI connects to external tools. "And we really want to get to a world where they can do 10-plus tasks, 10-plus tool calls, and excellent accuracy.</p>

US-China Trade War:

Watch: Trump and Xi Reach Trade Truce

US President Donald Trump emerged from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping beaming, labeling the conversation “truly great.”

But the one-year truce struck on Thursday in South Korea is likely to only stabilize relations between the world's two largest economies rather than resolve fundamental differences, with both sides buying time to further reduce dependence on each other in strategic areas. And it made clear just how much stronger China has become since Trump's first term in office.</p>

Charlie Sheen says the weight of hiding his HIV diagnosis took a greater toll on him than managing the condition itself. On Thursday's episode of "In Depth with Graham Bensinger," the actor spoke about his new memoir and shed light on his journey living with HIV. And I didn't realize that until I finally sat with Matt Lauer, and was just like, 'Here's what's going on,'" Sheen told host Graham Bensinger. The "Two and a Half Men" actor said he was "extorted" by people who knew of his diagnosis before he went public. "I was just like, 'All right, the only way to make this go away is to do what I did on the freaking 'Today' show. On live television, tell the world," Sheen said. The actor shared that the lead-up to his diagnosis was filled with a lot of uncertainty, especially after he began experiencing severe headaches. "I thought it was a brain tumor or spinal something or liver cancer or something terminal for sure, which is why I didn't want to go to the hospital. He added that his ex-wife, Denise Richards, was the one who took him to see a doctor. Sheen said getting his diagnosis was a sobering moment. You know, it's not the best news. But there was other news that could have been a lot worse, you know?" So that's a pretty big win that I'm going to take in the middle of this big loss," Sheen said. "It was like, OK, we can treat this thing, and there's like, here's all the technology for that, you know." Sheen isn't the only actor who has publicly revealed his HIV diagnosis. In 2021, actor Billy Porter told The Hollywood Reporter that he chose to reveal his diagnosis to help break stereotypes around living with HIV. There's a whole generation that was here, and I stand on their shoulders," Porter said. "I can be who I am in this space, at this time, because of the legacy that they left for me. So it's time to put my big boy pants on and talk." Other celebrities who have spoken about their HIV diagnosis publicly include Magic Johnson and "Queer Eye's" Jonathan Van Ness. When taken as prescribed, the medication can make the viral load in a person's body so low that it's undetectable. A representative for Sheen did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.</p>

According to a document outlining "Key Dates and Resources," affected employees will remain on the company payroll until December 23, receiving full pay and benefits for a period of 60 days. Severance pay is determined by the role — identified as "RIV Grade Level" — and tenure of Rivian employees, the documents said. For example, employees at "RIV Grades 1-4" can receive up to 10 weeks of pay. That includes the 8.5 weeks of pay during administrative leave. A Rivian employee who was impacted by the layoffs told Business Insider that grades 1-4 include entry- and mid-level employees. Marina Hoffman, a Rivian spokesperson, told Business Insider in an email that the band levels are similar to many public companies and that the levels "correspond to positions and responsibilities." "Affected employees are eligible for rehire and encouraged to apply to other open positions for consideration within Rivian," Hoffman wrote. Under a document titled "Employee FAQs," eligible workers will continue to receive any payouts for patent-filing awards until the December 23 separation date. Similarly, any restricted stock units — or compensation received in the form of stock — that weren't vested will be forfeited after December 23. Rivian is also offering career-transition and resume services starting Thursday. Scaringe told Business Insider in an interview the day before layoffs were announced that Rivian was at an "inflection point" and that it was the most important time in the company's history. "For us to become a company of the scale we aspire to be, which is producing many millions of cars a year, we're not going to get there with a $90,000 single flagship product," he said. Its most recent layoffs come as the EV industry faces headwinds from slowing consumer adoption and shifting federal regulations. In September, the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases came to an end, pushing automakers to come up with alternative forms of discounts. General Motors on Wednesday announced that it would lay off about 1,750 employees, citing changes in the EV market. "In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity," a GM spokesperson told Business Insider. "Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint."</p>
