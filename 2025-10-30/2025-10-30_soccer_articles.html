                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mohamed Salah put pen to paper on a new Liverpool contract earlier in the summer. However, the Reds hitman has made a dire start to the season having scored just three league goals as Liverpool's title defence lies in tatters. Salah wasn't included in the Liverpool matchday squad for Wednesday's disastrous 3-0 EFL Cup loss to Crystal Palace. Head coach Arne Slot opted to name an inexperienced XI for the welcome of the Eagles, who capitalised ruthlessly to set up a fifth round meeting with league leaders Arsenal. The result means Liverpool have lost six of their last seven competitive outings, with a 5-1 Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt the sole win in that run. However, while he has been linked with a move to Al-Ahly, the Egyptian side are not in contention to sign Salah. The Egyptian giants have a presidential election on Friday with Yasseen Mansour, the vice presidential candidate, said to be leading negotiations to sign Salah. However, former Al-Ahly winger and director of football, Sayed Abdel Hafeez, has poured cold water on any reports linking Salah with a return to his homeland. Hafeez is in contention to be part of the club's new board, but he has dismissed talk of an approach for Salah and made it clear no official has reached out to the player's camp to try and lure the forward away from Liverpool. "Mohamed Salah is a very big star and has done things that are difficult for any player in the Arab world to do. He's focusing on his professional career," Hafeez said. "Linking Salah to Al-Ahly is a media effort, and he's a player who has honoured Egyptian football and all Arabs. Salah renewed his contract with Liverpool months ago. There is no official at Al-Ahly who talked about this matter. This matter was only circulated in the media. "Slot is looking for his best XI," Hasselbaink started as he outlined the reasoning behind Liverpool's struggles. "Then, on top of that, Van Dijk is not having his best time. You have Salah, who is sulking a little bit; a, because he's not playing well and b, he's also not really the main man anymore. Normally, when Salah is open and free, he gets the ball from everyone. It is for Slot to come and make it right, and at the moment, he is struggling with that." Salah was a number of first team players who missed out for Liverpool on Wednesday night as Slot named a much-changed team for the Palace clash. Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch, Ibrahima Konate and Cody Gakpo also failed to make the matchday squad, though the quartet, and Salah, are expected to return to the side for Saturday's game against Aston Villa.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris Saint-Germain are moving swiftly to extend the contract of club prodigy Senny Mayulu. The 19-year-old midfielder who scored in the 2025 Champions League final is being monitored by Premier League giants Manchester City and Chelsea as his current contract expires in 2027. However, the French champions are finalising a contract extension that could secure the future of one of Europe's most exciting young talents. Having risen through the club's academy since 2018, Mayulu became a symbol of PSG's renewed focus on developing local talent rather than losing them early, as seen with past departures like Kingsley Coman and Moussa Diaby. At just 19 years old, Mayulu has already earned his place in coach Luis Enrique's rotation, impressing with his creativity, ambidexterity, and ability to handle pressure. The midfielder's technique and tactical maturity have drawn comparisons to Warren Zaire-Emery, another PSG academy success. With Mayulu's contract extension, PSG not only wants to secure the talent they have but also intent to retain Parisian roots in a superstar-filled squad. According to transfer specialist Nicolo Schira, PSG are now finalising a new three-year contract extension for Mayulu amid persistent interest from City, Chelsea and Tottenham. Scouts from all three English clubs have reportedly monitored his progress since late last season, viewing him as one of France's most complete young midfielders, who is equally capable of dictating tempo or breaking lines. His defining moment came in the 2025 Champions League final, when he came off the bench to score PSG's fifth goal in a 5-0 rout over Inter, becoming the youngest French player ever to score in a Champions League final at just 19 years and 14 days old. By the end of the campaign, he had also lifted his second Ligue 1 and Coupe de France titles, contributing key goals in each tournament. With his current deal running until June 2027, PSG's push for an extension is more about protection than urgency. The club want to ensure Mayulu remains untouchable amid Premier League interest, mirroring their approach with Zaire-Emery. Enrique, a long-time admirer of technically gifted and disciplined players, reportedly sees Mayulu as a cornerstone for the next phase of PSG's evolution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When VAR was introduced ahead of the 2018 World Cup, it was given the specifically vague brief of only ruling on “clear and obvious” errors in relation to: As outlined by IFAB, the International Football Association Board, VAR cannot intervene on second yellow cards which lead to a sending off. It remains to be seen if this suggestion will escape the realm of theory and be put into practice at this summer's World Cup. An official proposal is expected to be submitted ahead of IFAB's Annual Business Meeting in January. Appeals to bring second yellow cards under the remit of VAR have been lodged since the system's inception, it has been reported. However, Premier League referees chief Howard Webb tread a cautious line when discussing the prospect earlier this season. “The message we get is ‘less is more' with VAR, and we've done pretty well in aligning our delivery with that expectation,” Webb crowed to BBC Sport. “If you are talking about yellow cards that are delivered incorrectly, which could be impactful on the game, then you also have to think about wrongly not-issued yellow cards. “I understand the impact of a wrongly awarded corner that's clearly wrong—easy to see on video—and the impact of a wrongly issued yellow card. But equally there's also a feeling that VAR already exists to rectify clear errors in big situations, so we'll have those discussions and make sure to consult with the English game as well.” IFAB have been battling soccer's slowing game clock for years. Burnley's Martin Dúbravka became the first player in Premier League history to be counted out in an opening weekend defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, yet the law has scarcely been implemented in England's top flight since. Nevertheless, IFAB claim this rule change has received “positive global feedback” and are considering stretching countdowns to other aspects of the sport. Goal kicks and throw-ins could potentially be played out against a clock in the near future. Throw-ins have come under particular scrutiny in England's top flight this season. The Bees represent an extreme, but it takes an average Premier League side more than 17 seconds to prepare for each throw-in. The threat of a countdown could lower that ratio, at least in the first week after it has been introduced. Grey Whitebloom is a writer, reporter and editor for Sports Illustrated FC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Never has it been so difficult to discern what's real and fake on the internet. There has not been a better example of this than earlier this week when an incredible video of the world's first 'skyscraper stadium' in Saudi Arabia went viral on social media, gaining more than 50 million views - and coverage from news outlets across the globe. It showed a design of the Gulf state's Neom Sky Stadium, announced last year, which is expected to sit 1,000 feet above ground level, boast a capacity of 46,000 and play host to the 2034 World Cup in the Middle East. The Saudis promised 'one of a kind' stadiums when they were controversially awarded football's most prestigious event back in December. So when fans were offered their first look at the groundbreaking pitch in the clouds, they were fascinated by what they saw. No, it was made in just two minutes a couple of weeks earlier by 34-year-old Liam Hawes, from East Sussex, as he settled down for a good night's sleep in bed. A design of Saudi Arabia's 'sky stadium' fooled more than 50 million people earlier this week No, it was created by 34-year-old Liam Hawes in bed He posted the video on his 'Hypora Ultraworks' Facebook page before it gained a huge amount of traction and went worldwide. Since Liam started the account earlier this month - on which he regularly posts conceptual clips of grand designs - it has gained almost 350 million views. Yet despite such levels of popularity, the Seaford resident has not made a penny because he can't monetise content from Facebook. He told Daily Mail Sport on Thursday: 'It was crazy. Two weeks ago while I was on my phone before bed I just had the idea pop in my head. We had 13,000 people share it to start with and after that there was no containment really.' Liam did a fantastic job, and fooled media outlets across the globe. I had no idea about the Saudis' project. 'Before you know it, I've had my friends and even my mum calling saying, "Isn't that video on the news that thing you designed?" 'I was in bed before going to sleep, I was playing around with the idea of stadiums on top of skyscrapers because it's something that would be recognised around the world. 'It took literally a couple of minutes to put together. Probably two or three minutes and suddenly people think it's an official Saudi Arabian concept. The video cost about 35p to make and I did it on my phone.' While Liam's concept is a hoax, the Gulf state's plan to erect the world's first skyscraper stadium is anything but. According to the company's Facebook page, the ground will boast a capacity of almost 50,000, four training sites and offer north of 2,000 corporate and box seats. Concept designs released on the same page back in December show a futuristic, illuminated stadium squeezed into 'The Line'. One of those is the 92,760 capacity King Salman International Stadium, also yet to be constructed, where the opening game and final will be played. Other venues include the Qiddiya Coast Stadium and the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium, which will be located on a rooftop. And it was revealed earlier this month that the Saudi World Cup could too be held between the months of November and December, when temperatures are considerably lower than those of the summer months. Liam has created a host of grand designs using AI on his 'Hypora Ultraworks' Facebook account Speaking in early October, FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed football fans need to have an 'open mind' about when the sport's most highly anticipated event takes place. 'It's not just about one World Cup, it's a general reflection, even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think,' he said. 'We need to consider all these elements when we speak about national team competitions, national team release, about club competitions, and see how we can make it better for the benefit of everyone.' Kick-off times are expected to be 5pm BST, 8pm, 11pm and 2am, mirroring this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Images which emerged last year on Neom's official Facebook page showed a very different design of the sky stadium Neom Sky Stadium will boast some 46,000 seats, according to plans It will also feature more than 2,000 box seats and four 'training sites' Speaking about what the World Cup could learn from the Club World Cup, FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani admitted it was 'kick-off times'. 'We're having conversations daily with European media and other world media, in terms of what's best and which are the stadiums that you can play at 3pm. Will it be that every game will be absolutely perfect from a kick-off time, from a TV perspective? Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been confirmed as co-hosts of the 2030 tournament.

The exhibit first took shape in 2022, when Dallas was named a 2026 FIFA World Cup host city. Since then, the Perot has collaborated with Mexico City's Museo Interactivo de Economía, which is known for its interactive takes on economics, finance and sustainability. A companion exhibit at the Mexico museum will further explore the cultural and economic impact of soccer across North America. It will be open in Dallas from March 7 to Sept. 7, 2026. With over a million tickets sold for next summer's World Cup, and millions of tourists expected to pour into North Texas, Silver said the Perot aims to welcome returning and first-time visitors — and maybe convert a few non-soccer fans. “But we also think we will get some people interested who maybe weren't sports fans before because they will learn all of the work that goes on off the field.” Miriam Fauzia is a science reporting fellow at The Dallas Morning News.

Saudi Arabia declined an offer to sign Lionel Messi for a short-term stint in the Saudi Pro League before next year's World Cup, according to a senior sports official. "During the last Club World Cup, Messi's team contacted me and offered for him to play in Saudi Arabia because the MLS will stop for nearly four months," Abdullah Hammad, CEO of the Mahd Sports Academy, said during a podcast with Saudi platform Thmanyah.

International soccer stars won't be the only ones expected to perform at their best next summer.

Atlanta and other 2026 World Cup host cities will have to prove they're worthy of an international stage under the scrutiny of billions of onlookers. It's a spotlight Atlanta hasn't seen since the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games, an event that redefined downtown and the city's global image.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With two matches of a three-match camp in the books, the USWNT now faces New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo. This fall camp came after a long hiatus with a 113-day gap separating the July 2 win vs. Canada from this week's first match against Portugal on Oct. 23. GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 3) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4) DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 3/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 69/1), Eva Gaetino (Paris St-Germain, FRA; 1) Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 8/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 3/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 112/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0) MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 40/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 168/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 114/26), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 10/4), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 28/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 10/1) FORWARDS (6): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 9/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 25/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 14/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 10/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/3) In the last FIFA window, Emma Hayes gave five players their first caps – goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza. All but Rodriguez and Meza are back on this roster, which features just one first-time call-up in Kennedy Wesley. Rodriguez and Meza, who started on June 29 vs. Ireland, became the 23rd and 24th players to debut under Hayes in her 27 games at the helm, a remarkable ratio for the Olympic champion head coach. Hayes has given 28 total players their first USWNT call-ups, but she also gave a first cap to a player who did not get a first call-up under her, as Lily Yohannes earned her first call-up under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore but did not see action under Kilgore. The 24 players who have earned their first USWNT caps under Emma Hayes are: Sam Staab, Lily Yohannes, Croix Bethune, Yazmeen Ryan, Hal Hershfelt, Emily Sams, Emma Sears, Mandy McGlynn, Alyssa Malonson, Eva Gaetino, Ally Sentnor, Tara McKeown, Michelle Cooper, Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Avery Patterson, Lo'eau LaBonta, Kerry Abello, Claudia Dickey, Lilly Reale, Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza and Izzy Rodriguez. Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and joined the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window. After Trinity Rodman's withdrawal from the October camp roster due to injury, the USWNT entered camp with 25 players. With all this in mind, Hayes attended U-23 trainings to assess the players, and, with all of her U-23 teammates looking on, informed Gaetino after one of those trainings that she would be joining the senior team for the rest of camp. The 5-foot-11 central defender is in her second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Première Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame. Ater the 3-0 opening game win over Zambia at the Olympics, Hayes became the first USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals and joined Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first six matches at a major tournament. Hayes joins three other USWNT head coaches of the last eight in USWNT history who won their first major competition (Anson Dorrance – 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Pia Sundhage – 2008 Olympics, Jill Ellis – 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup). France Football, the top soccer magazine in France and one of the most reputable in Europe, has been awarding the Ballon d'Or to men's players since 1956 and to women's players since 2018, but 2024 was the first year it has given out awards to coaches of men's and women's soccer. Hayes then followed that up by winning The Best FIFA Women's Coach award. Of the players who scored those nine goals over those two games, only Rose Lavelle, who scored twice in Auckland (while wearing the captain's armband) is on this roster. The USA won 5-0 in a match that featured a highly unusual and painful to watch three own goals from one player – defender Meikayla Moore who currently plays for Calgary Wild FC in Canada – along with scores from Ashley Hatch and Mallory Pugh. In Brazil, the USA picked up a 2-0 win behind first-half goals from Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan. In England, the USA won 2-0 on goals from Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. In China, the USA won 4-0 on goals from Heather O'Reilly, Amy Rodriguez, Lindsey Tarpley and Angela Hucles. Record vs. USA: 1W-1D-19L (GF: 7; GA: 82)Head Coach: Michael Mayne (NZL) Goalkeepers (3): 21-Victoria Esson (Wellington Phoenix FC), 37-Alina Santos (University of Denver, USA) Defenders (9): 2-Kate Taylor (Dijon FCO, FRA), 3-Claudia Bunge (Melbourne Victory, AUS), 5-Meikayla Moore (Calgary Wild FC, CAN), 14-Katie Bowen (Inter Milan, ITA), 15-Grace Neville (Ipswich Town, ENG), 19-Elizabeth Anton (Kolbotn IL, NOR), 25-Mackenzie Barry (Wellington Phoenix FC), 27-Michaela Foster (Durham FC, ENG), 28-Lara Wall (Wellington Phoenix FC), 39-Rebecca Lake (Vancouver United, CAN) Forwards (5): 9-Milly Clegg (Halifax Tides FC, CAN), 16-Jacqui Hand (Kolbotn IL, NOR), 17-Gabi Rennie (Eskilstuna United DFF, SWE), 20-Indiah-Paige Riley (Crystal Palace, ENG), 34-Kelli Brown (Newcastle Jets, AUS)</p>
