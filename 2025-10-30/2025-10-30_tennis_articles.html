                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few tournaments blend elegance and energetic chaos quite like Paris. So it feels fitting that, for its 40th edition, the event has moved to La Défense Arena, Europe's largest indoor sports venue and a bold new stage for indoor tennis. If you like tennis, this is the place to be right now,” said Felix Auger-Aliassime, the No. “You can see all the players with so many matches, which is great. Situated in the heart of Paris's business district, the Arena's interior is divided by 9,000 square metres of blackout curtains, creating a sleek amphitheatre feel. Within those walls are three additional match courts, a practice court and a dedicated gym and warm-up zone for players. This is the direction we are going.” Watch Cedric Pioline talk through new era at La Défense Arena There has never been a shortage of atmosphere at France's ATP Masters 1000 event. Last year, Alexander Zverev silenced two home favourites in front of passionate Parisian crowds on his way to the title. “I just enjoy playing in front of an atmosphere. Whether it's for me — of course it's always nicer when the fans are cheering for you — but I also enjoy it when the fans are cheering against you, because there is still energy there, there is still noise,” Zverev told ATPTour.com. “Whether it's for me or for somebody else, it's always nicer to play in big stadiums than small ones. It's something you always dreamed of as a kid.” No tournament crowd in the world sounds quite like Paris. Impatient, theatrical, passionate — it's a crowd that lives each point. At La Défense, that heartbeat is multiplied. For players, it's a new kind of electricity. Still, the move wasn't made lightly. But if those moments belong to memory, they also make the move feel earned. “Life off the courts is also very enjoyable, with well-chosen activities contributing to the overall festive atmosphere.” The Tribune Bleu at La Défense Arena on Day 3. The “Tribune Bleu”, a group of die-hard French supporters is a new element of the setup. They flood the stands, lifting home players and energising the crowd with their drums and vuvuzelas. The sound swells, chants echo, and colour fills the stands in ways Bercy's tighter structure never allowed. As the ATP Tour season reaches its final stretch, that intensity gives French players a crucial boost. Last year, Ugo Humbert drew on the home energy to defeat Carlos Alcaraz en route to his first ATP Masters 1000 final. “As a tournament organiser, we always want French tennis players to be supported by the crowd because this adds value to the tournament,” Pioline told ATPTour.com. French tennis players want to play well. We saw how much the crowd cheered for him. Nicolas Mahut plays the final match of his career at La Défense Arena. At La Défense Arena, it's still unmistakably the Rolex Paris Masters. It's still that late-season drama as players chase qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals, still that mix of sweat, glamour and high-stakes tension.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our team of Tennis Channel analysts draft their 2025 WTA Finals fantasy teams.ByTENNIS.comPublished Oct 30, 2025 copy_link I chose my team because they're coming in with the most confidence and strongest recent results.Iga Swiatek: Swiatek is building momentum after winning Wimbledon and a title in Seoul, South Korea.Amanda Anisimova: The American reached both the US Open final and the Wimbledon finals, and sandwiched those big results with a pair of WTA 1000 titles in Doha and Beijing.Elena Rybakina: The former Wimbledon champion needed to win her way into Riyadh, capturing an 11th-hour title in Ningbo along with a semifinal run in Tokyo to make the WTA Finals with plenty of momentum.Jasmine Paolini: A champion at home in Rome, Paolini completes the field and adds consistency from the back of the court. Aryna Sabalenka: The US Open champ brings momentum and, as world No. 1, seeks to put an exclamation point on a great year. She arrives to Riyadh fresh and eager to take home a title she's never won.Amanda Anisimova: With her recent victory in Beijing followed by two weeks off this two-time WTA 1000 champ and two-time Slam finalist is rested, match-tough, and keen to make a statement on a medium-fast hard court, one that should fit her first-strike style like a glove.Elena Rybakina: Rybakina kicked into high gear at the last minute to clinch a spot in Riyadh. At the end of a challenging year, she is now serving big and showing the easy power and quiet intensity that make her a potential champion everywhere she goes.Jasmine Paolini: This late bloomer followed up career year in 2025 with more consistency in 2025, proving herself a worthy Top 10 player with big wins in Rome and at the Billie Jean King Cup. Back in Riyadh for a second time, she carries the experience she gained from this event last year, and the Italian is plenty capable of causing a few upsets.

Back in Riyadh for a second time, she carries the experience she gained from this event last year, and the Italian is plenty capable of causing a few upsets. Aryna Sabalenka: She's been one of the most consistent players all season, and will be hungry to go deeper than her 2024 semifinal finish this year. Her aggressive, first-strike game is well suited for Riyadh's indoor conditions.Amanda Anisimova: Since her comeback, Amanda has been extremely impressive and fearless. Elena Rybakina: When her serve is clicking, she can beat anyone. Madison Keys: She is capable of taking the racquet out of anyone's hand when she's in a rhythm on the serve and forehand. Aryna Sabalenka has a winning record against everyone in her Group, is the No. She's never played two of the three other women in her group, but got a big win over Iga Swiatek at the US Open. Her pure ball striking should translate well on these courts.Jessica Pegula has a winning record against two of the other three women in her group, including a perfect 5-0 against Jasmine Paolini. She just ended Aryna Sabalenka's 20-match winning streak in Wuhan a few weeks ago. She is a big hitter that can make every match on her terms. Bookending the year with big titles in Melbourne and Riyadh would be the perfect way to script her best season yet. Amanda Anisimova was one of the first women to arrive in Riyadh and has won 12 of her last 13 matches on Tour, including the China Open title in Beijing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A season highlighted by a singles title in her native Italy and four doubles titles, including Roland Garros, Jasmine Paolini proved she belongs in elite company. She punched her tickets in both fields at the WTA Finals once again, seeking to advance out of the group stage in Riyadh. After cementing her status as a Top 10 player in 2024, Jasmine Paolini came into 2025 with lofty expectations. Would she win her first Grand Slam after two near misses in Paris and London last year? Paolini would end up winning a major -- the French Open doubles title, with Italian countrywoman Sara Errani -- but couldn't replicate her singles success, never advancing past the fourth round at a Slam. Her season highlight came in Rome, where she defeated Coco Gauff in the final to win her second career WTA 1000 title and become the first Italian woman to win the country's premier tournament in 40 years. The 29-year-old won more matches this year than she did last year, and posted a higher winning percentage -- all while grinding through another grueling doubles schedule, one that yielded four more titles and propelled her to No. Speaking of doubles, Paolini is also in the WTA Finals doubles field (alongside Errani), punching her tickets in both fields for the second straight year. We'll be seeing plenty of Paolini in Riyadh, which is always a good thing. Best WTA Finals Result: Paolini couldn't get out of the group stage in either singles or doubles last year, winning just two of her six matches. Her lone singles victory -- a 7-6 (5), 6-4 win over Elena Rybakina -- was sandwiched between straight-set losses to Zheng Qinwen and Aryna Sabalenka. Defining Moment of 2025: The win in Rome was an especially memorable one, both for Paolini and for a tennis-loving nation that hadn't seen a female champion at this tournament in four decades. Paolini dropped just one set all tournament and, in front of Italian president Sergio Mattarella, handled Gauff with relative ease in just 89 minutes. Though she'd won a WTA 1000 title once before, in Dubai, this must be the biggest of her career to date. Defining Quote of 2025: “It doesn't seem real to me. I came here as a kid to see this tournament but winning it and holding up this trophy wasn't even in my dreams.” -- Paolini after winning the Internazionali BNL d'Italia Brad Kallet: Paolini is one of the most likable players on tour. But make no mistake about it: She's ferocious and, when locked in, can dominate anyone. Paolini proved against Swiatek that even at this relatively late stage in her career, she's developing a big-game presence. By winning eight of 11 matches, she's going back to Riyadh. 4 seed, Paolini lost round-robin matches to Zheng and Sabalenka. A season highlighted by a singles title in her native Italy and four doubles titles, including Roland Garros, Jasmine Paolini proved she belongs in elite company. She punched her tickets in both fields at the WTA Finals once again, seeking to advance out of the group stage in Riyadh.</p>

The good thing is, I keep going up and play bigger tournaments against even better players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Austria's Tagger followed suit shortly after, winning her first pro title in Spain this April. In the final, she defeated soon-to-be breakout star Lois Boisson. Tagger continued her clay-court dominance by capturing the 2025 French Open girls' singles title, going from unseeded to champion without dropping a set. So, it's little surprise that with both making their first WTA main-draw appearances this week via wild card -- Tagger in Jiujiang and Pohankova in Chennai -- they each earned first-round victories in their WTA debuts. Tagger defeated China's Zhu Chenting on Tuesday, while Pohankova ousted former Top 100 player Nao Hibino to reach the second round in Chennai. Tagger went one better Wednesday, upsetting world No. 89 Elisabetta Cocciaretto in straight sets for her first Top 100 win. It was my first win against a top 100 player, which feels amazing. It was a lot of fun to play against her.” The victory adds to a growing list of achievements for the young Austrian, who has also gained notoriety in tennis circles for her one-handed backhand, which has drawn comparisons to the one displayed by her coach, 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone, in her own playing days. Tagger is one of just eight women ranked inside the top 300 of the PIF WTA Rankings to feature a one-handed backhand. She is 32-8 across all levels this season, with three ITF titles -- two at the W75 level -- in addition to her junior Grand Slam. In addition to her Wimbledon junior title, she reached the girls' doubles semifinals at the French Open, partnering with none other than Tagger herself. The pair fell in two tightly contested sets to eventual champions Eva Bennemann and Sonja Zhenikhova. Overall, Pohankova is 8-4 across all levels in 2025, with two ITF quarterfinals and two wins over top 200 opponents as she aims to return to, and then surpass, her career-best ranking of No. Rankings aside, both players are looking to build on their WTA win totals in the coming days. And who knows, perhaps a maiden WTA title is on the horizon for one, or both.</p>

Alexander Bublik is one of the game's most creative shotmakers, always finding new ways to entertain fans with his impressive racquet skills. But how will he handle “an impossibly small racquet” in the latest Lexus ATP Head2Head Challenge?



Bublik faces series host Natalie Pike in three lighthearted and entertaining battles while at the Rolex Paris Masters. One round even forces Bublik to hold the mini racquet with his non-dominant hand. Can his touch and timing still hold up?



Just when it seems the tasks cannot get any tougher, the final round takes it to a whole new level with what might be the tiniest racquet you will ever see. Watch the video below to find out who wins!
