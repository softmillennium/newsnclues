                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The waiving of sanctions on Milorad Dodik followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president. Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia's integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.” Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump's Washington. Coming three weeks before Dayton's 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration's decision was especially dispiriting. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment. The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska's National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska's installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month. Since Trump's return to the White House, Dodik's overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months. In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.” Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich's firm, signed a contract with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a contract with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year's work, plus a bonus if Zell's firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act website. This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik's cause. Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, called for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.” Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump's one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump's famous MAGA hats. “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra's recent public tirade against a Canadian political envoy over an anti-tariff advertisement shows undiplomatic behaviour, Gary Mason writes.Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press If U.S. President Donald Trump's goal in selecting a top diplomat to station in Canada was to find someone who embodied the pure arrogance of his administration, who would give new life to the old epithet, "ugly American,” he found his man in Ambassador Pete Hoekstra. He is a third-rate bully who imagines that any of us who exist outside of the U.S. are inferior – people who should be grateful for the privilege of doing trade with his country. If a non-American were to fall at his feet in gratitude for accepting their business card, Mr. Hoekstra would think this was quite justified and the way things should work. Trump's bizarre outrage over Ontario's anti-tariff ad is a symbol of his presidency What you need to know about Ontario's anti-tariff ad According to witnesses, Mr. Hoekstra was upset over an ad that Ontario ran in the U.S., which featured former president Ronald Reagan speaking in favour of free trade over protectionist tariffs. Mr. Trump had initially responded to the ad in positive terms, saying he'd do the same if he were Ontario. He then threatened to impose an additional 10-per-cent tariff on Canada. The Government of Ontario released this TV ad which was broadcasted in the U.S. that uses a recording of Ronald Reagan to argue against tariffs. Earlier, the Ambassador had said any trade deal won't be finalized for some time now, because “Canada burned the bridges.” One can argue whether the ad was a good idea at a sensitive time in negotiations with the U.S. Even after a deal is signed, whenever that might be, there are no guarantees the President won't rip it up in a fit of pique about some imagined offence. Is this now our fate as a nation, to walk on eggshells around Mr. Trump until he's gone? To live in fear of saying or doing the wrong thing? One thing we should definitely be doing is calling out the boorish behaviour of an American diplomat in Canada. It was only in September that Mr. Hoekstra was saying that he couldn't understand why politicians in this country were reacting in such a hostile manner to the Trump-imposed tariffs. He warned that Canadian politicians using phrases like “trade war” were treading on “dangerous” grounds. ‘We feel betrayed': Laid off for years, Stellantis workers in Brampton confront a grim new reality Mr. Hoekstra has wondered aloud about how we'd feel if a U.S. group took out ads in Canada attacking a policy of our federal government. To which I say: I wonder how Americans would feel if a Canadian prime minister referred to their president as “premier” and talked about making the U.S. our 11th province? He is not here to nurture a relationship that's been as good as any two countries in the world have enjoyed in the last century. He is here to lecture, berate, and tell us how great America is and how much lesser the rest of us are. Even if he were inclined to, I'm sure he'd worry about what his boss would think – in Trumpland, you don't apologize for anything. Pete Hoekstra is an embarrassment as America's representative in Canada. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The Department of Justice is charging Congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh and five others with conspiracy to impede a U.S. law enforcement officer and impeding a U.S. law enforcement officer. Abughazaleh is running in the Democratic primary against incumbent Rep. Jan Schakowsky. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. “I have been charged in a federal indictment sought by the Department of Justice,” Abughazaleh posted on X. “This political prosecution is an attack on all of our First Amendment rights. Prosecutors allege that on September 26, the six people indicted were among a crowd of protesters attempting to prevent a federal agent from entering an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, Illinois. Abughazaleh says they are being charged “for exercising our First Amendment rights.” “This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks out against them.” “ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” Abughazaleh said in the video. The Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to intimidate anyone who opposes its fascist agenda. Just this month, administration officials made multiple threats against Democratic lawmakers. After U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins stated that federal agents who violate state laws can be prosecuted, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom (D), Attorney General of California Rob Bonta, Pelosi, and Jenkins, stating, in part, “We urge you and other California officials to publicly abandon this apparent criminal conspiracy, to stop threatening law enforcement, and to prioritize the safety of your citizens.” We just sent them a letter: Stand down or face prosecution. He then shared his initial post and wrote, “Careful, @GovPritzker – this applies to you too.” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem made a similar threat this month. In response to Garcia's announcement, Noem posted on social media that the website would be “a pipeline that will funnel information on American law enforcement directly into the hands of anarchists, domestic terrorists, and cartel members.” She continued, “I am working with @AGPamBondi to ensure that ANY individual who doxxes, threatens, or assaults our law enforcement officers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Noem has also equated filming law enforcement — which is protected by the First Amendment — with violence. “You'll be hearing regular updates directly from me about this case and how we can use our constitutional rights to resist authoritarianism,” she continued. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump. Elizabeth Weill-Greenberg is an independent journalist and founder of The Carceral Report.</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. “It's all hands on deck and we have to fight. This is the only way,” says Leanne Betasamosake Simpson. In this episode of Movement Memos, Simpson and host Kelly Hayes discuss lessons from Simpson's book Theory of Water: Nishnaabe Maps to the Times Ahead and the ongoing struggle against ICE in Chicago, where Hayes is involved in rapid response efforts.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today we're talking about what it takes to stay human and protect each other in fascistic times — how we build networks of care, defend our neighbors, grieve, and make space for joy. We'll be hearing from Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, a renowned Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg musician, writer, and academic. We'll be exploring lessons from her most recent book, Theory of Water, and the letter she contributed to our new book, Read This When Things Fall Apart: Letters to Activists in Crisis. Leanne is also a dear friend of mine, and this conversation was very important to me. We spoke on an afternoon when my neighborhood was being hit hard by ICE, and our exchange weaved together her reflections on world-building and natural processes (like sintering) with my experiences on the ground in Chicago — resisting the violence that ICE is inflicting on our communities. You can also support the show by subscribing to “Movement Memos” on Apple or Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts, or by leaving a positive review on those platforms. Sharing episodes on social media is also a huge help. Truthout is an independent news organization, publishing stories that the craven corporate press won't touch. We are a union shop with the best family and sick leave policies in the industry, and we could not do this work without the support of readers and listeners like you. And with that, I hope you enjoy the show. Leanne Betasamosake Simpson: Thank you so much for having me, Kelly. LBS: I am a little bit tired and a little bit overwhelmed, but I'm also at a really amazing gathering of Indigenous, Pacific Islanders, South Sea Islanders, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Ngunnawal country in Australia. KH: I am so happy to hear that. I could use a little of that energy myself right now. It's been a rough day here in Chicago. ICE has been hitting my neighborhood and the surrounding area pretty hard. A lot of us have been out all morning and afternoon on ICE patrol. I took a break to come home and talk with you, and I am really grateful to have this moment of connection, across borders and other artificial divides, amid everything that's happening. So, I know some of our listeners are definitely fans of your work, and may remember our previous conversations, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and the work you do? I'm a status Indian and member of Alderville First Nation. I am Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg, which is the Eastern Ojibwe, and our homeland is the north shore of Lake Ontario, sort of between Toronto and Ottawa in Canada. So I'm a writer, I am a musician, and I work for the Dechinta Center for Research and Learning, which is an Indigenous-led, land-based post-secondary education program in the northern part of Canada. KH: Some of my listeners may remember my experience with visiting Dechinta and getting to experience just a snapshot of the curriculum that you all bring to folks, and I hope folks who missed that episode will check it out because it really was a life-changing experience for me, and I'm deeply moved by the work that you all do. I think that one of the things that's disappearing in my homeland is ice and snow as a result of this climate change that's being driven by racial capitalism and colonialism. I had the opportunity when I was working with Dechinta to spend about a month in the spring beside a lake while it was melting and witnessing this incredible transformation from a frozen snowy world to this amazing liquid gathering space where species from all different worlds, from the land, from the water, from the sky were meeting. And then I also had the same sort of reverse experience in the fall of being beside a lake while it was freezing up. And this magnificent transformation is happening in lakes and in rivers all over the northern part of the hemisphere every year. And that's an interesting starting point for a book for me, but writing the lyrics to that record and then performing it and rehearsing it and playing it for different audiences over time was a way of thinking deeply about ice as a relative, ice as a teacher. The second seed came in writing letters back and forth to the very, very brilliant Robyn Maynard in Rehearsals for Living. And in that final chapter, Robyn was sort of prompting me to think outside of the conversations and the letters that we were writing between a Black feminist and an Indigenous feminist and to sort of think in a more worldly way: how could we connect this to other places in other movements? And in my final letter, I started to think with water, because water for me became this connector to all of the living things that I share time and space with on the planet. It connects me to every single other living thing on the planet. And so water then became this invitation, I think. I need Black feminists to teach me about the Middle Passage. I need people in the far north to teach me about glaciers. I need people who live in the desert to teach me what it's like to have limited amounts of water. I need Palestinians in Gaza to teach me about what it means to have water weaponized in this moment. I need people in Detroit to teach me what it's like to suffer health consequences because the water coming from your taps is not safe. And so that was another, I think, seed—was this invitation for myself to sort of articulate what I was learning from snow and ice and water, but also to write the book in a way that I'm in no way the authority on it, not even for an Nishnaabeg people, but to write it in a way that it was an invitation. And then I think the third seed is that I had this tremendous experience of working with an elder Doug Williams from Curb Lake for over 20, 25 years. We did tons of stuff on the land with my kids and he had passed away. So I'm also in the book, there's a thread of me, not confronting grief, but processing grief, processing this idea that this anchor in my life, somebody that I would've gone to ask questions to make sure that I'm on the right track to talk about politics and ethics is now in the spirit world. I'm wondering if I can learn things directly from the land with the skills that he has passed on to me. I think for Indigenous people, when we lose an elder, we're losing kind of a body of knowledge as well. We're losing sometimes people who are closer to knowing what life was like before the violence of colonialism. But also I think this present moment that we're in is one where I find… grief is always right there, this intensification of genocide in Gaza and in Palestine and Sudan and Congo, what's going on and in Chicagoland, all of these sort of things, linked crises that seem to be coming on a daily hourly basis for me has been also an acknowledgement that there's some grief in being here again and seeing sort of all the work of elder activists and organizers being undone so quickly in the present moment. KH: So much of what you're saying really resonates with me. I've been thinking about how I often walk to Lake Michigan — it's about a twenty-minute walk from my apartment — and no matter what's happening in my life or in the city, I feel this deep connection to that timeless, living relative. It's not just comforting; it's a sense of continuum, of being bonded to something larger, of feeling its movement in relation to how I move, even how the water inside me moves. It's also a place where I feel a sense of connection to my father, who is no longer with us, but who loved the water, and had a deep bond with the natural world that he shared with me. My father was taken from the reservation and adopted by white people, like a lot of young children in that era, but he always had a deep sense of connection to the land and water, and I still feel connected to him when I'm close to the water, or when I'm in the wilderness. As I was reading your book, I found myself really thinking about my own sense of connection to water, and what it means to me, as a life force, and ancestrally, as a kind of bond to people who are no longer in this world. I also thought about the struggles for water that I've been a part of, including Standing Rock, where we said, “Water is life.” And in this particular moment, I've found the ideas you write about so helpful in reminding me to slow down and really reflect on these natural processes, these ways we relate to the land. Here in Chicago, we're living in a state of emergency right now, as are so many people across the world. But when that emergency is hyperlocal, when there's a constant sense of alarm, it's easy to lose touch with that slower rhythm, that chance to learn from the world around us. As someone who sometimes has to forcibly take my nervous system out of “go mode” — I'm always learning and relearning how to come back to a place where I can access all the parts of my heart and mind that can feel and process those lessons. Your book has been such an important resource for me in remembering how to do that — and in exploring what that journey can open up for us. Kelley talk about Antonio Gramsci's work, and in response to what you were hearing, you wrote down, “This is where we are. We don't need to be defensive about anti-fascism, but active, engaged and on the offensive.” Can you talk about this moment of realization and what you were recognizing when you wrote those words down? LBS: I think I was recognizing that world making is struggle and that in the moment that we're in, our ancestors, whether they're Indigenous or Black or people of color or people that were organizing throughout history, for something, for justice, for a better world, world making is a struggle. It's something that you have to fight for. It's not like the colonial governments, it's not like fascist governments are going to say, okay, you guys, you're right. This is a world that you want to live in. And so when I heard those words, and this would've been during the pandemic on a skidoo in my local city grooming the ski trail, I remember stopping and sort of making a note on my phone. And it seemed like it was a fight and that a lot of people around me weren't recognizing or seeing that it was going to be a fight. And this sort of feeling frozen or not knowing what to do or feeling overwhelmed or feeling all of the feelings that I think are normal when you're facing fascism are fine and probably healthy, but that's not going to get us where we need to go. So it doesn't look like one thing, but it does mean that I think we have a responsibility to be engaged and present and working towards making the lives of our neighbors and our friends and our families, our students slightly better. KH: I really identify with this feeling that you can see what's coming, when a lot of people around you aren't ready, or don't recognize the scale of the threat, or are just freezing up in the face of it. I feel like I have had a sense of what we were barreling towards, politically, for quite some time. I didn't have a blueprint of the specifics — beyond the blueprints right-wing think tanks have actually drawn up, that reflect their intentions — but the direction has been clear for some time. I think that awareness is embedded in Let This Radicalize You, which is a book that I think a lot of people are turning to, during this time, because people who weren't ready for certain conversations and confrontations a few years ago feel the urgency now. And I am grateful that those people are coming to that sense of urgency, and I really hope that more people will break the cycle of passive reaction around what's happening, and figure out what it's in their power to do in this moment. As you say, that's going to look different for everyone. But right now, I see a lot of people whose political energy is being captured and held captive behind screens on social media. It's better than being in denial, but not by much, because when our political expression remains bundled up in social media posts, and finds no other active expression, it's a form of capture. We all need to find our roles in active resistance. My own actions that day were tied to theirs, and guided by them. And that's how it should be — we should be working in concert, with everyone bringing whatever they can to the table. And on the subject of how we come together, can you talk about sintering, and your fascination with this process? So snowflakes start out as a piece of dust in the sky world. So snowflakes are travelers, they're moving through different worlds. So they're sort of like a falling shore. And I became really interested in these areas of overlap in the book because Anishinabe homelands weren't demarcated by borders, but by these zones of overlap where we would have to put more presence and more energy, more ceremony, more diplomacy into these sorts of areas that we were sharing with the Haudenosaunee or with the Wendat. And it's important to figure out how to weave ourselves into the ecosystems that we are a part of in a way that doesn't destroy ourselves and in a way that doesn't destroy the other living things that we are in network with. It finds a way of knitting or weaving itself into its new environment. And when snow sinters, as people who live in places where you have to shovel snow, it lands from the sky and it's often fluffy. And if you wait and don't shovel your sidewalk right away the next day you've got a harder job because the snow has sintered, it's become saggier, it's bonded to each other, it's heavier, and it has a staying power on trails and pathways in the spring much longer than the unpacked snow. So sintering became a way of thinking about how we belong to the places that we find ourselves in. But it was interesting to me to be thinking about snow as this relative and as this kind of provocateur that I live with that's endangered a little bit right now because of climate change, wondering what I could learn about the embodied practice of this part of the water cycle that's going on around me all the time that I may not be attentive to. Because in contemporary modern life, it's easy to not spend time at the shore. It's easy just to turn on the faucet and hope that you're drinking clean water for many of us. So I wanted to think about sintering as a practice that is coming from the land that I'm a part of, think of it as a teaching, think of it as a practice thinking of how I take care of the ones that are around me in a way that doesn't destroy them and in a way that doesn't destroy me so that we can build stronger networks. And so I see what you're doing, what you've done today, this morning before you came as a practice of sintering as well, the ICE patrol, the mutual aid networks that have become so important. KH: I love what you're saying about ICE patrol as a kind of sintering, because what you said about how snow is so much harder to move once the snowflakes have had time to bond themselves together — that really connects with what we are experiencing here in Chicago. They have tear gassed neighborhood after neighborhood, but people are becoming more bonded to each other in the face of that threat, and showing collective courage in the streets. We are learning how to resist ICE, while also trying to protect the privacy and dignity of our neighbors, and to keep everyone as safe as possible, while also taking the risks that we sometimes feel called to take, out of love and solidarity. I'm also thinking about our connection to snow, as it gets colder in Chicago, because I think the reality of what this moment demands of us might feel a little intimidating to some of us, in terms of patrolling and holding our ground in the cold. And I hope it helps folks to think about sintering, and how we can be like snowflakes, during this Chicago winter — bonded to each other, and much harder to move. There is no centre or centring in the creation and maintenance of a network.” Can you elaborate on this? They're not very good at that, but I think lots of different cultures were and are good at that. So the first part of it is recognizing that we are not building a planet, we're just figuring out how to live with the cycles and the ecosystems that already exist. And I think that the way that the planet functions ecologically has a lot of knowledge for how to live. And so sintering would be an example of that. It's also within Nishnaabeg thought, if I think of my homeland, I don't think of my homeland as this state or country that has a fence around it that I guard. My body is just a hub made up of different relationships. And because the planet is very diverse, people in all different kinds of geographies and cultures hold particular kinds of knowledge that I think benefit us all in terms of figuring out the diverse ways that we can knit or weave ourselves into the planet in a way that brings forth more life. And so this is, I think, similar to what abolitionists, Black feminists… there's lots of different ways into this same sort of thinking. And so it seemed like, again, an invitation to bring diverse experiences, diverse thinking, diverse knowledge systems to together towards this enormous task of making worlds that don't destroy the planet. KH: I love this idea of trying to weave or knit ourselves into the world that is, rather than trying to invent something altogether separate — as though our reality is wholly defined by us or exists in a vacuum. I think the wisdom you're sharing here is especially important for organizers who want to exist in opposition to that extractive mentality of separateness — because we always need to consider how life is already happening, what relationships make it possible, and how we can weave ourselves and our visions into that fabric, rather than trying to project our vision over those realities. I know you have a sense of what we're up against here in Chicago right now, because I was lucky enough to spend some time with you when you were in the city recently for a book event. I was actually late for dinner after your event because an organizing meeting ran long, and it was the end of a very long day — but I made it, and I was so happy to see you. During that dinner, you heard from me and some of our friends here about what's been happening — the raids, the random kidnappings, the tear gas, thousands of people across Chicagoland being disappeared — and the seemingly recreational violence of federal agents, as our bodies and communities are used as props and stages for the production of fascist propaganda. LBS: I think that my Nishnaabeg culture and ethics has taught me to think very carefully about going into other communities. And so it's weird when you're doing book launches because you're supposed to be promoting the book and you're supposed to be engaged in conversation with somebody else towards promoting the book. But I think what my Nishnaabeg culture says is the first thing is to be very attuned to the audience and to the community that you've been invited into. And so I thought I went, actually, I thought of you, Kelly, and I went when I got to Chicago to walk along the lake, to ground myself and to think about what was happening in Chicagoland and to think about the kind of environment that I wanted to create in the so-called talk, like what does this audience need in this moment? And it became really clear to me that that audience in that moment did not need an academic yelling at them about fascism, but needed me to have a calm voice, needed me to speak slowly, needed me to share the parts of the book that were beautiful and lovely, and that would allow a little bit of space for them to maybe take a breath and maybe relax and maybe we could center sort of together. So I spent a long time with this book, particularly going into the U.S. thinking about which passages to share, how to share them. And so people who are stressed and who are fighting very hard, I think in that moment when they're giving an hour of their very precious time to come and listen to you, might need something specific. So I think that that was the first thing is being very present, for me, and doing a lot of listening to what people were experiencing and the ways that they were organizing. When you're on ICE patrol, when you are taking care of your comrades that have experienced that recreational violence where just acknowledging the energy, the strength, the courage, the sheer number of hours it takes to be able to do what you're doing with very few resources and not enough people. You weren't at home doing self-care that day. And so I think that being able to see that light, being able to see what collectively you were doing in the face of this enormous fascist violence made me think that my ancestors would be very, very proud of the work that you were doing and the work that you are doing, that you are the ones that are leading the way that you are doing the hard work of world building because not only are you confronting this violence, but you're embodying the alternative through your practices of care, through your practices of mutual aid. And so I just had a tremendous amount of Nishnaabeg respect and I had just a huge sense of pride. I felt very strongly that my ancestors, that our ancestors would be very, very proud of the actions and the embodied politics that you collectively were doing in this moment. That really means more than I can say. I'm deeply honored to be in community with the folks who keep showing up and doing everything they can to defend their neighbors and look out for each other. And it means so much to hear you say that your ancestors, and our ancestors, would be proud of this work. I think ICE patrol doesn't appeal to some people because it can be very uneventful. When we do our school patrols, for example, I've never seen anything happen other than parents picking up their children — and that's a good day. It's a task where there isn't necessarily any experience of direct confrontation with what you're opposed to, and there's usually no spectacle or visibility involved. You have to be able to put aside your ego, or any need for gratification, and actually feel heartened if it's a dull morning or afternoon. Then you have days like today, when we're patrolling the neighborhood, and the alerts are coming in constantly, and we can't keep track of how many people have been kidnapped. There was a moment this afternoon when one of our ICE watchers was in trouble, and I rushed to their location. I found their car in an alley, abandoned, with the keys still inside. And that's also a reality of this work. Sometimes they get angry about our vigilance and the ways it interferes with their violence — and they try to give us a black eye, whether that means arresting a person who's filming or observing them, or throwing a tear gas canister at people on a residential street. So, that uncertainty, that probability of just walking, or riding your bike, or driving, and observing, and also, the possibility of real danger — I think it's hard for some people to connect with that. But there are ways of reducing risk, and that's not to say that anyone who has been harmed or arrested has done anything wrong. But we do find that people are more likely to be arrested when they're alone, and that maintaining a distance of 10 feet between ourselves and federal agents is helpful, so there are some safety practices that can help mitigate some of the risks people face while ICE watching. It's not a risk-free activity, but people who get trained up are definitely better positioned to make informed, autonomous choices about how to engage with risk. I have actually been trained multiple times, because ICE tactics are evolving, and I am always interested in what new people, who are just now joining the fray, are being told about how to engage with the situation right now, because right now is different than six months ago, or even six weeks ago. The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Organized Communities Against Deportations, and groups like PUÑO, in Pilsen, and Protect Rogers Park, in my area, have been developing best practices around ICE watch since the first Trump administration. That work is grounded in the traditions of cop watching, which is a legacy of the Black Panther Party. Whether that's figuring out how to find and help people who've been arrested, how to support the families of people who've been detained, or how to comfort each other. I have a friend who's a street medic who was still coughing the last time I saw them, because earlier that day, when they heard people were being tear gassed, they ran toward the scene to help people. And I think that's the spirit a lot of people in Chicago are moving with right now — a spirit I hope people in other cities, who are preparing for similar conditions, can internalize. It's something I'm proud of in our communities, and yeah… I'm honored to hear that you're proud of it too. KH: I would love to talk a bit about Read This When Things Fall Apart: Letters to Activists in Crisis. I was so grateful for your contribution to this book, which is really a care package for activists and organizers who are struggling in these times — and really, who the hell isn't? In fact, as I raise the topic on this show, I am cognizant of how hard it can be to engage with, and I want to caution our listeners that we are about to talk about supporting people who have experienced sexual assault — so please take care of yourselves as you listen. You wrote a letter to an activist or organizer who has been assaulted. This is a letter that I know we all wish weren't needed, because we are striving to create spaces where people are keeping each other safer, and where bodily autonomy is respected, and yet, we know that our good intentions do not exempt us from experiencing or encountering harms that are replicated across our societies. Well, thank you for asking me about my letter and thank you also for putting together this phenomenal book. You gave me a copy when I was in Chicago, and it's just so precious and I think it's going to be really, really important for all of us in the times that we're living in. My letter comes from an experience that I had of being sexually assaulted two years ago, again, in a situation where it was I guess very unexpected. And I think because I've done a lot of work supporting students who are disclosing in my classrooms, I've taught a lot about how to make safer spaces, whether that's in classrooms or in our Indigenous communities. It took me almost 12 hours to even realize what had happened. And the lucky part of it, I think for me, is that I had enough privilege in my life at this stage of my life where I was able to get into a crisis counselor right away, and I was able to work with her on a weekly basis for three months. I was shocked at how much it undid me for so long. And so when you asked me to write a letter, the first thing that I thought of was, I'm not writing this letter. But then over time I kept thinking about this. And I also thought of my privilege and how lucky I was to be able to, for the first time in my life, I think, feel my feelings and go through the process of healing with support because frankly, most people, particularly Indigenous people, don't have that privilege. I didn't want to make things worse for people. The idea of me just sharing this story and writing this letter felt like I was opening myself up to more vulnerabilities. But I think it was one of those things that was incredibly important to me because of the person that I want to be and how I want to live in the world. I knew that you would be careful and attentive in the editing process, and I knew that you wouldn't let me say anything that was going to cause more harm to other people. So I think that I was also in this situation with you where the container that you set up enabled me to be able to write this, which is also I think a kind of privilege. But I somehow thought that because I knew all about sexualized violence and sexual assault, that it wasn't going to happen to me. And so my hope was that in writing this letter sort of to myself in those moments, that it would resonate to other people who were living through this and also open up an opportunity to continue the conversation around it. KH: Well, I'm really honored that you felt this project was the right place, and a safe place, to lean into that vulnerability. And what you're saying about being aware of a threat, and thinking so deeply about it, and caring for and worrying about other people, but still moving through the world as though this thing won't happen to you — it resonates in a profound way. There are things we can't protect ourselves from, and most of us don't move through the world fully reconciled to those realities, because it's just too much. But I am so glad that, through this letter, to some unknown friend or co-struggler you haven't met yet, you were able to reach back through time, and talk to the Leanne who didn't believe themself yet. I hope that was healing for you, and I believe it will be healing for people who turn to that page in the book because they are trying to process a similar experience. I can also really relate to your hesitancy. I think part of that is the format — the fact that this book is a bundle of letters. I knew I could tell the parts of that story that felt important, and leave some things out, and that the letter would still be what it needed to be. Because the details of how I wound up in that particular mindset aren't the point, and they're also not unique to that moment in any way. The point is how I found my way back, and how I fell in love with people and the world again — and I was grateful to share that aspect of things with people. I'm sure people will be helped by it. The way you and Robyn took so many important ideas and so much deep analysis of an apocalyptic moment and wove them into a heartfelt exchange between two people who were really reaching for each other — in the way I think we all need to be reaching for each other — I think that spirit lives in this project, too. If books have a family tree, I think this one is definitely related to Rehearsals. LBS: And I think that you've done something really brilliant in the editorial approach with your book in that I felt like my self-determination was really respected and really honored. And I think that it comes from the letter writing as a format, but also it came from some of the editorial decisions that you made so that I didn't feel the pressure to add in more details or to tell this backstory or to say things that I wasn't comfortable saying, sort of like what you just said about your letter. And I think that that has created a book where, because you don't give all of the context in the letters that when I'm reading through it, I insert my own situation into wanting to leave an organization or wanting to leave a movement or leaving a movement. And that I think then becomes a container of space where I can engage with the letters in a deeply personal way. And so I think that there's something that you've achieved here for all of us through this little weird book. And I think that that will also sort of be a living legacy for all of us who publish things. That there is… If you care deeply for your writers and you respect their self-determination and you sort of deviate a little bit from standard editorial practices, I think that what you generate becomes really powerful in a way that I sort of standard books and standing standard publishing practices can't create. I am really grateful to everyone who engaged with this process, including all of our writers, and Sophia Hussain, at AK Press. And I am grateful to have the web of relationships that made this book possible. Most of us wrote our letters for Read This When Things Fall Apart months before Donald Trump was reelected. I think many of us understood the political trajectory we were on, at that time, but so much has happened since then. In my conversations with people who contributed to the book, I have been asking, if you were writing another letter for the book today, what would you want to communicate to an activist in crisis, right now? LBS: I think one of the things that I would want to write as someone who's not living in the U.S. is sort of a, hey guys, we need to be paying attention to how quickly things can change, how quickly fascists can seize power, how organized they already are in the places that we are living outside of the U.S., and how quickly the tables can turn. And so one of the gifts I think of the organizers and activists right now in Chicago is you are generating the knowledge that not only you guys need in its moment, but in you're generating the knowledge and the skills and demonstrating what we need to be doing now for what's coming. Another letter that I think I would want to write is just, again, in witnessing what you guys are doing, is how to show up for your community even though you're tired, even though you don't feel well, even though you're riddled with anxiety, even though you need a self-care day. Because I see, I think I got a little bit of a sense at our dinner of how exhausted people who are on the front lines on ICE patrol are, how few of us there are, how we need much bigger systems of care and support. But I also sort of see you guys showing up anyway and there's a certain set of skills that I think organizers and activists develop in order to be able to show up even though they're not feeling like a hundred percent. KH: I think that's a letter we'd all like to read. And on that note, I want to say something to everyone who's deeply exhausted and overworked right now. I think one of the keys to surviving and sustaining ourselves in these times is remembering that the heightened state we get into — that state of agitation, of stress, of constantly feeling like the other shoe is about to drop — we can't live indefinitely in that physical and psychological condition. Recently, I was out in the woods with some of my fellow organizers, just on a brief excursion — an opportunity to reset my senses, to reset my nervous system a little. To be someplace where the dirt smells different than it does in my neighborhood, because there's more life in it. Today, for me, it meant taking a break from my work in the streets to have this wonderful conversation with you, Leanne — one I'm so much better for having, even though it's hard to step away from the work in front of us sometimes. The rhythm of the struggle can feel like a constant, rapid drumbeat, but our own rhythm, as individuals, has to slow down sometimes. And that's okay, because we're not alone in this. Nothing stopped happening because I came home for an hour, and when I go back out, someone else will go home. At the end of this month — on the day this episode will air, I think — Maya Schenwar and I are hosting a gathering called Struggle Hour. It's like a happy hour for disgruntled activists and organizers. It's a place to experience fellowship and catch up with people. We'll eat pizza, have a drink or two, and maybe do some karaoke. And it does honestly feel absurd to me to be planning something like this right now — and also completely necessary. So I hope everyone who's dealing with this kind of strain right now is making some space — to smell the dirt, to see the colors changing in the trees, maybe to have some pizza and a drink, or wear a Halloween costume. Whatever it is, make some space for everything that's human about us. We can't starve those parts of ourselves right now. As we wrap up today, Leanne, is there anything else you'd like to share with, or ask of, the audience right now? LBS: I have a new record that's coming out on October 24, so very soon it will be on all the streaming platforms. There's a lot of struggle in the record. There's a lot of politics in the record. I hope it's the kind of thing that the organizers can put on at Struggle Hour in your Halloween costumes and find some joy and some fun, because I really agree with you, Kelly, that's the fuel that's going to keep our fights and our movements going. We have a long road ahead and we're going to have to find ways of making space for that joy. It's called Live Like the Sky because our ancestors live in the sky world and there's a lot of good ways of living that are embodied there. And I am sure our listeners are going to benefit from your insights as well. LBS: Miigwech for the visit, Kelly, it is a really beautiful way to begin my day here. KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees. “I think it's very problematic,” Van Hollen told the Associated Press. The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people – sometimes for hours – on deportation flights dating to 2020. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the Wrap's use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints. “When an organization like DHS doesn't want transparency, it's because they don't want people to know what they're doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency. “ICE's use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said. The DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, previously said that ICE's practices “align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards”. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the Wrap despite multiple requests, and it is not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations. “ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability.</p>

Both sides have taken some of their biggest guns off the table, but this appears closer to a truce than a durable peace setting stable boundaries for China's relations with the US. That is very different to what China hawks in Congress were hoping when Trump came to power, and will set alarm bells off on both sides of the aisle. One of the difficulties has been that Trump's strategic objectives in launching the trade war were not articulated – the balance between protecting traditional US manufacturing, ring-fencing modern technology-based industries critical to US national security, punishing Chinese trade practices, or more broadly generally overpowering China as a competitive threat, were fudged. Gradually the battle morphed in some US administration minds from a trade war into a geopolitical trial of strength between the two world's superpowers, a trial that left the whole world awaiting its outcome. As a result it has been a turbulent six months, involving undulating tariffs, export curbs, threats, counter-threats, deferral and monopolies inquiries, interspersed with five rounds of trade talks ranging though Madrid, London, Geneva, Stockholm and Kuala Lumpur, culminating in two hours of direct talks between Trump and Xi, the first meeting between the two men since 2019. Through most of the crisis US tariffs on Chinese goods have averaged 55%. That was well below the effective total embargo level of 145% that Trump once threatened, but still high enough to pose a severe stress test to the resilience of the Chinese economy, a test it has passed. What emerged from Thursday's meeting will require time to digest. In reality this is only a framework agreement and, as Canada is discovering, such agreements have the potential to unravel at a moment's notice. Beijing has agreed to do more to control the export of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that has triggered a crisis of overdose deaths in North America, the supposed cause of 20% tariffs. He has also suspended expanded restrictions on export controls. On Trump's account, fears that he was about to abandon Taiwan were also misplaced. More importantly over the past six months both sides have learned about the other's leverage and vulnerabilities, including which trade weapons work best. Those who predicted China would spill into a crisis will have been sobered by a stock market that has risen by 34% in dollar terms, double the rise for the S&P 500 index. China's trade surplus is likely to be larger than last year's. Meanwhile US inflation figures, driven by tariffs, crept up to a politically perilous 3%. Chinese restrictions on buying US soya beans, a $12bn (£9.1bn) market, were also effective. It sent politically critical US midwest farming interests towards penury as Brazil filled the market gap. Above all, after a US commerce department rule-change in September, which by some accounts added 10,000 Chinese firms to Washington's list of sanctioned companies, Beijing massively retaliated by expanding the scope of its export controls on rare earths, the elements essential for hi-tech manufacturing including cars, batteries and military equipment. The vast controls, announced on 9 October and due to have come into force in November worldwide, underscored the US failure to shed its supply chain reliance on China's near monopoly on refining these rare-earth products. In a laughably hypocritical bid to rally the world against this China “bullying”, Jamieson Greer, America's trade representative, on 15 October complained: “China's announcement is nothing more than a global supply-chain power grab.” America discovered that bullies could be bullied back, something it might have foreseen. The truce is only for a year, but that may be to China's advantage. Equally importantly, China hopes it will be seen by other countries as the responsible and restrained global power not seeking confrontation, but strong enough to withstand US coercion. At a minimum the clash in leadership cultures is total.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia on Oct. 30 bombed the Sloviansk Thermal Power Plant in Donetsk Oblast killing two people and injuring others, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Normal people do not fight like this, and there must be an appropriate reaction of the world to such a Russian war," he said in a post on social media. It is unclear whether the power plant, with a capacity of 830 megawatts and located just outside Sloviansk, is currently operational and generating power. Russian forces launched a mass missile and drone attack against Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight on Oct. 30. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 592 out of the 653 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones, and 31 out of 52 missiles launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Two soldiers working at a draft office in the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast have been injured, after a man shot them while being mobilized, the regional recruitment center said on Oct. 30. The incident comes amid bubbling tensions in Ukrainian society around forced mobilization, a necessary measure to keep Ukrainian units on the battlefield manned and replenished. The man was being escorted by draft officers, together with a representative of the police, to the recruitment center, where — upon a check for any illegal items on his person — he pulled out a Soviet-era Tokarev pistol and let off several rounds, the center posted on Facebook. A Russian drone attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy injured at least four, including the manager of a local television station, local authorities said on Oct. 30. The Russians carried out the strike with an Italmas long-range drone on Oct. 30, hitting a gas station, Mayor Artem Kobzar wrote on Telegram. "Rescue workers were at the scene, surveying the area, dismantling damaged structures, and ensuring fire safety," Sumy Emergence Service said. Four civilians were injured, including the Head of Sumy Channel, Maksym Tkachov. "Maxym Tkachov is currently in the hospital with through-and-through wounds to his legs. The Russian plane, flying without a filed flight plan and with its transponder turned off, did not violate Polish airspace and was escorted out of the zone of responsibility, Poland's military said. The incident follows a similar case from Oct. 28, when two Polish jets intercepted and escorted another Russian Il-20 aircraft over the Baltic Sea. "Every day, Polish soldiers stand watch over the nation's skies with unwavering dedication," the Polish military said on X. Emergency power outages were imposed on "all oblasts of Ukraine" due to yet another overnight mass Russian missile and drone attack targeting energy infrastructure, killing three people, and injuring at least 27 others, local authorities reported on Oct. 30. Russian forces struck multiple thermal power plants in various regions of Ukraine, DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, said. Following the strikes, energy workers immediately began damage assessment and recovery operations," DTEK said. Three energy workers were injured in previous attacks. Based on the intensity of attacks for the past two months, it is clear Russia is aiming for the complete destruction of Ukraine's energy system," CEO of DTEK, Maxim Timchenko, said. Ukraine has closed its embassy in Havana and is "downgrading" diplomatic ties due to the high number of Cuban citizens recruited to fight Russia's full-scale war, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha announced Oct. 29. "Our vote is not against the Cuban people — we respect their right to live in prosperity. It is against the inaction of Cuba's authorities in response to massive recruitment of Cuban citizens to the Russian occupation army," Sybiha wrote on X. Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that at least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine. At least seven people were killed, and 57 people were injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 30. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 592 out of the 653 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones, and 31 out of 52 missiles launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. One person was killed, and thirteen others were injured in other attacks over the previous day, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. In Vinnytsia Oblast, a seven-year-old child was killed and four others injured during the mass attack, according to local authorities. Critical infrastructure, residential buildings, and vehicles were also damaged. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and seven others injured in strikes throughout the day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and four people were injured due to Russian strikes, according to local authorities. Russia has lost around 1,140,860 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 30. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,305 tanks, 23,514 armored fighting vehicles, 65,993 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,089 artillery systems, 1,531 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,232 air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 75,707 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

MOSCOW, October 30. /TASS/. Russia's tests of the Burevestnik missile, which features a nuclear-powered propulsion system, do not fall under the category of nuclear weapons tests restricted by international treaties, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified during a briefing, commenting on US President Donald Trump's recent statements and his directive to the Pentagon to carry out American nuclear weapons tests.

"If [Trump] in some way refers to the Burevestnik tests as a nuclear test carried out by another country, that is in no way accurate. All nations continue to advance the development of their defense systems, but this does not constitute a nuclear test," the Kremlin spokesman emphasized.

Previously, US President Donald Trump announced that he had instructed the Pentagon to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing. However, he did not specify the nature of the tests or whether they would involve detonating nuclear warheads.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vladimir Putin unveils Russia's new technological weapons; Israel and Hamas strive to uphold a shaky ceasefire in Gaza; and Donald Trump strikes a trade deal with South Korea during his Asia tour. This is what experts describe as a "doomsday weapon" due to its enormous destructive power, Izvestia writes. Poseidon's entry into service will mark a quantum leap in the development of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, experts note. The vehicle's main feature is its unlimited range, and its nuclear power unit allows it to stay underwater for extended periods. It is comparable in size to a small submarine but is a fully robotic vehicle with a unique ability to carry out combat duty stealthily along with traditional strategic nuclear forces, military expert Dmitry Kornev said. "The move to include Poseidon in Russia's nuclear triad establishes a new system of strategic deterrence. This factor, along with the deployment of other advanced weapons such as the Burevestnik cruise missile, cannot be ignored by our partners amid preparations for talks on strategic weapons. The creation of systems like Poseidon may become an additional incentive for Washington to resume negotiations and develop new rules of the game," Kornev stated. According to unofficial data, the flagship submarine may be launched soon. Each submarine of this class is expected to carry at least six underwater vehicles, ensuring that fleets remain on continuous combat duty. Earlier, armed radicals attacked Israeli soldiers near the city of Rafah, killing a service member. With tensions rising, Hamas expanded efforts to locate the bodies of Israeli hostages, and Egyptian personnel with heavy equipment entered Gaza. Roman Yanushevsky, editor-in-chief of Israel's Channel 9 website, told Izvestia that Hamas' statements about "a sudden discovery" of bodies could not be accidental, as they largely reflected the movement's domestic political game. According to Yanushevsky, what made Hamas do it was pressure from mediators and Israeli strikes. "It's absolutely clear that Hamas was well aware of where the hostages' bodies were hidden. Israel believes that Palestinian militants are buying time, while they have access to about ten hostage graves in the enclave, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. In addition, US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he supports the logic of retaliatory strikes. Still, according to US media, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not yet held a detailed discussion of retaliation options with the US leadership. Despite rising violence in the Palestinian enclave, the likelihood of a full-fledged resumption of hostilities remains low, Middle East expert Leonid Tsukanov told Izvestia. "Both parties are interested in preserving the fragile truce, which is why they are willing to maintain a kind of balance, limiting themselves to short-term retaliatory strikes," the expert said. On the other hand, he noted that Israel's retaliatory actions far exceeded Palestinian attacks in scale and level of destruction, which could eventually set the stage for new, longer clashes in Gaza. Seoul and Washington have finalized an agreement on Seoul's $350 billion investment in the US economy to conclude a trade deal, Kim Yong-beom, South Korean presidential chief of staff, told reporters after a meeting between the two countries' presidents, Lee Jae Myung and Donald Trump. Until recently, Hyundai and Kia automakers were at a disadvantage, facing a 25% tariff compared to the 15% imposed on their Japanese and European competitors, Olga Belenkaya, head of macroeconomic analysis at Finam, noted. She believes that ahead of his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Trump aimed to improve relations with US allies in the region. Along with holding trade talks, Trump once again pledged to resolve the Korean conflict, noting that Seoul and Pyongyang have been technically at war since 1953. The US president expressed regret that he had been unable to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his Asia tour but added that he would continue to pursue a settlement. Trump's visit will not significantly alter relations between South Korea and the United States, which rest on Seoul's substantial military, political, and economic dependence on Washington, Ilya Dyachkov, associate professor at the Department of Oriental Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, stressed. Seoul remains a loyal US ally, largely constrained in its choices but determined to protect its interests, primarily economic ones, the expert said: "US pressure will strongly influence the position of South Koreans. If the pressure is intense enough, Seoul will have to concede, but it won't be pleased and will certainly try to minimize its losses." The BRICS group is prepared to welcome all Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members as partner states, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told Izvestia. Meanwhile, too many members could dilute the group's agenda and lead to a conflict of interests. At the BRICS summit in Russia's Kazan in October 2024, the country's President Thongloun Sisoulith expressed a desire to join BRICS, even though Vientiane has not yet submitted an official request. Meanwhile, Laotian Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone noted that BRICS has great importance for the entire region as it demonstrates significant achievements in economic development. Myanmar, which borders two BRICS founding members, China and India, also continues to reaffirm its interest. In my opinion, the dilution of BRICS' agenda is more dangerous, as it could discourage countries," Pavel Shaternikov, junior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, stressed. November 1 will be a fateful date for the United States. As the government shutdown has been going on for 29 days, millions of Americans are about to face a new reality, while 42 million people will lose vital food aid under a government program, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports. "Congressmen are urgently demanding Trump step in and adopt at least some budget. Both Trump and Democrats are using the expiration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as a bargaining chip, Pavel Koshkin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, told Vedomosti. Trump is unwilling to miss this opportunity because the stakes are high, it's about securing congressional seats in the next midterm elections," Koshkin emphasized. The expert explained that Trump was taking considerable risk, but Republicans were sometimes better at influencing public opinion than Democrats. Still, Democrats have been more successful in promoting their claim that Trump is responsible for the possible suspension of the food aid program, Vladimir Pavlov, researcher at the Institute for International Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, remarked. He did not rule out, however, that the administration would try to avoid suspending SNAP to prevent a notable decline in voter support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 30 that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to work with Washington toward ending Russia's war against Ukraine following their meeting in South Korea. While Beijing has maintained that it is neutral in the war, it continues supplying Moscow with dual-use goods and purchasing Russian oil, which provides crucial revenue for the Kremlin's war effort. "We talked about (Russia's war against Ukraine) for a long time," Trump told reporters. According to Trump, he discussed Beijing's purchases of Russian oil with Xi, but did not elaborate on the details. The president previously imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, a move that disrupted some energy exports to China and India. Last year, the U.S. Congress passed a law ordering ByteDance, a China-based company that owns the popular video platform, to sell TikTok's U.S. assets. Trump described his meeting with Xi as "amazing" and the outcomes as "outstanding," adding that Washington and Beijing reached a one-year trade agreement. Since returning to the office, the U.S. president has heavily relied on tariffs and secondary tariffs — or the threat of them — as a tool of foreign policy, using them to pressure both Beijing and Moscow. On Sept. 5, Trump criticized growing cooperation between Moscow, Beijing, and New Delhi after a summit in Tianjin, writing that "it looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest China." From Dec. 5, 2022, until the end of September 2025, China bought 47% of Russia's crude exports, followed by India with 38%, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Earlier, Trump vowed to impose secondary tariffs on China for buying Russian oil. He canceled their planned meeting in Hungary before imposing sanctions on Russia's energy giants. On Oct. 25, Trump said he would not meet Putin unless there was "a clear path to a peace agreement" between Russia and Ukraine, as he is "not going to be wasting (his) time." Russian drone attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy injured at least 4, including the head of local television, local authorities said on Oct. 30. "We agree the sides are locked in fighting... but (Xi) is going to help us, and we're going to work together on Ukraine," U.S. President Donald Trump said. The Russian plane, flying without a filed flight plan and with its transponder turned off, did not violate Polish airspace and was escorted out of the zone of responsibility, Poland's military said. The far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), whose leader has argued against aid to Ukraine, lost nearly a third of its seats in parliament, according to the latest results. Air raid alerts were issued across the entire county overnight, with Ukraine's Air Force tracking Shahed-type drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. "Because of the tremendous destructive power, I hated to do it, but had no choice!" Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis."</p>

Phillip/The Associated Press The Toronto Blue Jays are leaving Dodger Stadium with a 3-2 series lead over the reigning world champs, as Canada's team is now just one win away from its first World Series title since 1993. Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. made Fall Classic history with back-to-back solo homers to open Wednesday's Game 5, while Trey Yesavage struck out 12 in a momentous outing as the Jays clubbed the Dodgers 6-1. Now the World Series leaves the City of Angels and returns to Toronto, where it will be decided as early as Friday night. Yesavage threw seven innings in his first road postseason start, allowing three hits and one run, without walking anyone, while mixing his fastball, slider and splitter. “Hollywood couldn't have made it this good,” said Yesavage, adding to his meteoric ascension this year through the minors to the World Series. “Being a part of this, I'm just very blessed.” Yesavage oozed poise, like when he bobbled a ground ball hit to the mound, but calmly scooped it and creatively shoveled the ball to Guerrero at first base like a pro quarterback. When the Japanese superstar Ohtani did get his bat on a Yesavage slider, Jays right fielder Addison Barger nabbed it with a diving catch. The Blue Jays led all night, starting with a shocking few minutes in their first two at-bats. Schneider and Guerrero each crushed homeruns off lefty Blake Snell, both sending fastballs sailing over the left field wall. It was the first time in World Series history that teammates have crushed back-to-back blasts to begin a game. Just three pitches into the contest, Toronto already had a 2-0 lead, and a ‘Lets go Blue Jays' chant pierced the silence inside Dodger Stadium. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits a home run in the first inning of Game 5 on Wednesday.Harry How/Getty Images The single Los Angeles run came from an Enrique Hernández homer which briefly woke a sellout crowd of 52, 175 that included celebs like Leonardo DiCaprio and Charlize Theron. Daulton Varsho scored Toronto's third run, as he tripled in the fourth inning and then came home thanks to an Ernie Clement sacrifice fly. Snell lasted 6 2/3 innings for the Dodgers, allowing six hits, three runs, and four walks against seven strikeouts. Yesavage celebrates after a double play to end the seventh inning.Luke Hales/Getty Images Kevin Gausman will start Game 6 for Toronto on Halloween night.

In return, the American president said he was reducing tariffs and signalled that there would soon be progress on a wider deal. Tit-for-tat export restrictions had shaken global markets all year, as the world's two biggest economies ratcheted up tariffs. The presidents met at Busan airport for almost two hours. The meeting was shoehorned into their busy schedules as Mr Trump prepared to fly home, and as Mr Xi flew in for a major summit of Pacific leaders. He listed the previous stumbling blocks and described how they had been resolved. China, he said, had agreed to buy “tremendous” amounts of soybeans; he was cutting a 20 percent tariff imposed because of fentanyl shipments to 10 percent because Beijing had said it would work to cut supplies; and an aide said China had promised not to impose export controls on rare earths for a year. Mr Trump said he would visit Mr Xi in China in April, and that the Chinese president would come to the US soon afterwards. Regional experts had worried that talks could get bogged down on Taiwan. But Mr Trump said the topic never came up, although they did discuss Ukraine. “We discussed working together to see if we could get that war finished,” he said, adding that China was a major buyer of Russian oil. Prior to the talks, officials squabbled about who would stand where and when inside a building marked “base operations.” Mr Xi stood impassive as his American counterpart said he believed an agreement was close. After posing for photographs, they sat down with their aides. Through a translator, Mr Xi said it was not surprising that they were sometimes at odds. “We do not always see eye to eye with each other and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,” he said, before opening the door for agreement. Mr Xi arrived in South Korea after a show of strength at home – called a plenum, a gathering of the Chinese Communist Party – where his officials put strengthening the nation's manufacturing base at the heart of their five-year plan. That marked a direct challenge to Mr Trump and his push to rebalance global trade, so that China focuses more on consumption rather than production. China, after the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Xi, said that it hoped the US would “earnestly abide” by a nuclear weapons testing ban.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US president said Washington must respond to rival powers ‘on an equal basis' Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to immediately begin testing of the US nuclear arsenal on Thursday, hours after Russia announced it had tested a nuclear-capable underwater drone. Mr Trump made the announcement as he travelled to his high-stakes summit with China's Xi Jinping. “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Mr Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. Mr Trump is on the final day of a week-long trip to Asia. Top of their agenda will be trade tensions, but Xi is also expected to raise regional security questions and push the US to weaken its stance on protection for Taiwan. On Sunday, Putin announced that Russia had tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik missile, which can also carry nuclear payloads. On Thursday morning he went further, ordering a new nuclear stance at home. “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he posted. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. “Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!</p>
