                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She also announced an $11.5 million donation to the fight world hunger and climate change. Billie Eilish has never been shy about speaking her mind, but at WSJ Magazine‘s 2025 Innovator Awards, she put her money where her mouth is while calling out the world's billionaires — some of whom were in the room. Before Eilish took the stage, the late-night host also announced that the guest of honor had raised a whopping $11.5 million for organizations addressing food insecurity and climate change through her ongoing Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour. The Meta owner was in attendance to support his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, who was honored Wednesday night for her philanthropy work as head of CZI. “No hate, but give your money away, shorties,” she added. In addition to opening up about touring life and revealing that she almost scrapped one of her biggest hits to date from album Hit Me Hard and Soft, the two-time Oscar winner told the publication about her passion for the environment. “You can literally make all the same s–t with sustainable materials, and people just aren't doing it,” she said of the fashion industry in particular. “The main thing that I've learned in working with so many companies and making my own merch and my perfume is that everyone can actually do it. Eilish's $11.5 million donation will be funneled into her Changemaker Program, which benefits organizations working to address world hunger and environmental issues. Beyond raising money through her tour, the singer also provides plant-based food options at her shows, uses biodegradable confetti during her set, sells merch made out of recycled cotton and encourages fans to bring reusable water bottles and take public transport to the venues at which she plays. She's also previously called out wastefulness in the music industry specifically. “I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable,” Eilish told Billboard in 2024. “And then it's some of the biggest artists in the world making f–king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Looks like Taylor Sheridan isn't done with Paramount just yet. Despite news breaking over the weekend that Sheridan would soon be moving on and relocating his TV and Film deal to NBCUniversal, he's first going to tackle what is meant to be a major tentpole blockbuster for the studio. Paramount announced the “Call of Duty” movie would be in the works early last month and is developing it with game maker Activision. “Call of Duty” is one of the most successful video game franchises of all-time, being the best selling game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years and selling over 500 million copies globally across its many iterations. For as prolific as Sheridan has been on the TV front, his movie output has been slow in comparison. His last feature was the 2021 forest fire drama starring Angelina Jolie “Those Who Wish Me Dead,” which fizzled at the box office. Stefano Sollima, who also directed the sequel to Sheridan's other script “Sicario” as well as “Without Remorse,” was at one point attached to direct a “Call of Duty” movie, but it never materialized. When the “Call of Duty” movie was announced at Paramount, Puck reported that Activision before selling the rights to Paramount had rejected a pitch from Steven Spielberg to adapt it. The look of the “Call of Duty” games have probably already borrowed enough from Spielberg's oeuvre to justify him also directing an adaptation. Sheridan has one other feature script in the works, “F.A.S.T.,” which is set at Warner Bros. and is being directed by Ben Richardson. As was reported over the weekend, Sheridan will strike a new deal for film with NBCUniversal once his film deal is meant to expire with Paramount early next year, but he's locked up for TV until 2028.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After landing the rights to turn one of the world's biggest video games into an epic movie, Paramount has now landed two A-list filmmakers to develop it. Sources tell Deadline that Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and Peter Berg have joined Paramount and Activision to develop and produce a Call of Duty movie, with Paramount distributing a live-action feature film. The pic will be designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what players love about the games, a series of first-person shooters centered on military campaigns, while expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences. Berg will produce with his team, and Sheridan is also producing alongside David Glasser. Sheridan and Berg are lifelong friends and previously worked together on projects including Hell or High Water, which received four Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Sheridan. Deadline has been hearing since the summer that Paramount was eyeing these two as collaborators but Sheridan was still deciding whether he would write the script or just produce. In recent weeks he felt the need to do both and will now team with Berg. Whether it's Berg's acclaimed Lone Survivor or Sheridan's hit Paramount+ series Lioness, both filmmakers have shown how to deliver the goods in the genre. 1 bestselling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years with more 500 million copies sold globally. Berg series credits include Painkiller and American Primeval. He wrote, directed and produced The Mosquito Bowl, an epic World War II drama for Netflix based on Buzz Bissinger's bestselling book, which recently wrapped production. He is also executive producing a Friday Night Lights reboot. Through Film 47, Berg continues to helm major commercial campaigns. He is represented by WME and David Matlof. Sheridan, who made news this past week when he signed a massive five-year deal with NBCUniversal that will see him exit Paramount in 2019, has long list of Paramount-based TV credits including creating the hit series Yellowstone as well as Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, 1883, 1923, Lioness and Landman; the second season of Landman premieres next month. He currently has numerous projects in various stages of development and production including F.A.S.T., an original thriller starring Brandon Sklenar and directed by Ben Richardson, set for release with Warner Bros in April 2027. He is repped by CAA and LBI Entertainment. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Starring Lee Byung-hun as a paper-processing expert who hatches a dark scheme to become the only standing specialist in his field, “No Other Choice” won the International Audience Award at Toronto. As of earlier this week, the film is also up for three Gotham Awards: Best International Feature, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Outstanding Lead Performance for Lee. But as announced on Thursday, October 30, Park Chan-wook will next receive an SFFILM tribute in San Francisco, at SFMOMA, on November 20 with an in-person conversation and screening of “No Other Choice.” The event will take place at the Phyllis Wattis Theater. “With ‘No Other Choice,' Director Park returns to the satirical tone seen in ‘Sympathy for Lady Vengeance' and ‘Stoker.' He spent 20 years making this film, a dark comedy about a man desperate to rejoin the workforce at any cost,” said Jessie Fairbanks, SFFILM's director of programming. Executive director Anne Lai added, “With the roots of our organization firmly planted in bringing international films to audiences here in the Bay, it is a deep honor to welcome and celebrate Park Chan-wook. The tribute is part of the SFFILM arts organization's annual screening series, SFFILM Presents, which gives early, exclusive access to first-run films to Bay Area audiences. The SFFILM Presents series also features award and tribute programs, including SF Honors and the Sloan Science in Cinema Prize, which this year will go to Guillermo del Toro for “Frankenstein” on Wednesday, November 12. “No Other Choice” opens in theaters from Neon on December 25.

In December 2022, Moss debuted a face tattoo — the word “Lover” under her left eye — which she later removed. “Since rehab, I've been on a journey of self-discovery. I've spent a lot of time in Bali, surrounded by nature, reading alone or spending time with like-minded people — and learning to love myself again while finally being free from my former life,” she told Glamour UK shortly after getting the facial ink. “Yes, it was impulsive, but after years of being so controlled, it was my way of expressing that I am free.

She later revealed in a TikTok video that she got the face tattoo to “rebel so hard away from an industry that made her sad all the time.” Moss has been open about her struggles with addiction and mental health. In January 2024, she posted an emotional video on TikTok revealing her battle with substance abuse, telling followers she was “crying while being vulnerable.” “It's like I've suddenly taken on board all my life lessons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ella Emhoff stunned in a totally sheer dress on Wednesday night. In a total departure from her go-to menswear vibe, the former first daughter attended the WSJ Innovator Awards in New York City wearing a black lace gown from Helsa with nothing underneath but a visible black thong. Slung over her shoulder was the GG Emblem shoulder bag from Gucci with black leather Jimmy Choo Staz Pumps to match. During her time in the public eye, Emhoff has made her mark with a personal style that sticks strongly in the borrowed-from-the-boys camp. A lover of designers like Thom Browne and Proenza Schouler, the 26-year-old often reaches for tailored separates, menswear styles, and a jeans and blazer combination that would make Diane Keaton proud. As such, her choice of a feminine, lace, see-through dress that leaves little to the imagination was a head-turner. Emhoff has been out and about quite a bit this month, most recently in attendance at the WWD Honors the night before. Earlier in the day, she also hit the carpet at the Town & Country Philanthropy Summit, dressed down with a pair of straight-leg jeans and another checked blazer. While Emhoff did enter sheer outfit territory during the 2021 Met Gala, it was with strategically placed crystal embellishments and a pair of oversized paper bag waist pants. Could this lace look be a shift in Emhoff's signature style?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's fair to say that Billie Eilish does well for herself. Her third studio album has received a two-times platinum certification from RIAA with 2 million copies sold. She will also be donating $11.5 million from the tour to various organizations and charities. The proceeds will benefit organizations and projects that support food equity, climate justice, reducing carbon pollution, and conducting crucial environmental work in combating the climate crisis. While accepting the award in a room of affluent figures — including Mark Zuckerberg, who has a net worth of more than $225 billion — Eilish wondered aloud about why people who have the resources to help others often fail to do so. “People need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country. After a light round of applause from the audience that also hosted creative figures like Spike Lee and Questlove, Eilish continued: “Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me.

It's live as a lot of the coverage is had, and it's hard to build the kind of portfolio that we have.” Initially, Langley approached Sheridan about a film deal, but the conversation expanded to include television and streaming in August when it became clear he was having serious doubts about reupping his TV deal with the new Paramount.” At some point, NBCUniversal and Sheridan will make that film (and eventually series) deal official, but for now, Wall Street can rest easy knowing that it isn't fake news.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The revived Paramount Television Studios is taking shape. “As we move forward in this new incarnation of Paramount Television Studios, we must make changes to position our business for growth and success,” Thunell said in the email, which you can read in full below. That structure includes department heads in areas such as Creative, Production, Business Affairs & Legal, Finance & BA, with some functions, including Talent & Casting and Corporate, handled though Paramount Pictures under whose umbrella PTVS sits. Since there were senior executives in those fields on both the Skydance and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios side, combining the teams has resulted in departures, along with an arrival of a Netflix VP. One area where the top executives from both sides are staying on is Creative. Skydance Television's EVP, Head of Development Shelley Zimmerman  and EVP, Head of Current Carolyn Harris will assume the same roles at Paramount TV Studios. Meanwhile, Keith Cox, President of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, will continue to oversee the series under his purview, including the slate of Taylor Sheridan, and Emily In Paris. Years ago, when he was at Paramount Network, Cox bought Yellowstone in the room and has remained a main liaison for the prolific creator who will be based at PTVS until his overall deal comes to an end in December 2028 and Sheridan moves to NBCUniversal. Zimmerman, Harris and Cox will all report to Thunell. Both Goldberg and Thunell come from Skydance — where she was CCO and he was President of Television — with several executives on Thunell's team there transitioning to PTVS. In addition to Zimmerman and Harris, that includes Drew Brown, EVP, Physical Production for Skydance TV, who has been named Head of Production for PTVS, reporting to Thunell. Executives from Paramount Global will lead PTVS' Legal and Business Affairs operations. Virginia Lazalde-McPherson, who a couple of months ago was promoted to Chief Acquisitions Officer for Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, will serve as Head of BA. She has held Head of BA positions at Showtime and YouTube Originals. Lance McPherson, EVP, Deputy General Counsel and Head of Business & Legal Affairs for Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, will become EVP, Legal Affairs for PTVS. Arturo Reyes, EVP and Global Head of Production Finance at Skydance, will become Head of Production Finance for PTVS, reporting to Rauch. Leaving is Candice Brancazio, CFO, Paramount Media Networks, Showtime/MTVE Studios. Matt Hengemuhle also is departing his role as SVP, Financial Planning & Analysis but will remain at Paramount, transitioning to the Direct to Consumer business. Also stepping down is Shauna Phelan, EVP, Head of Live-Action Series, Films & Talent, Nickelodeon and Awesomeness TV, who has held leadership positions across the two divisions for seven years. It is unclear whether a dedicated PTVS executive will succeed her in overseeing the slate, which includes the newly ordered by Netflix Victorious spinoff Hollywood Arts, or will that be a group effort. “Going forward, we remain committed to creating high-quality content for kids, teens and families — building on our incredible IP, championing new ideas, and operating as one unified team,” Thunell said. “We believe this structure will encourage on-screen talent to work more seamlessly across our Features and Television Series,” Thunell said. As a result, Trevor Rose, EVP, Head of Global Talent and Content Development for Showtime/MTVE, will be leaving the studio but staying at Paramount in the TV Media group that includes CBS, CBS Studios and the cable entertainment networks. Other Paramount Pictures executives who will expand their purviews to include PTVS oversight include COO Courtney Armstrong, CFO Mark Badagliacca, EVP Human Resources Talia Robinson, and EVP Global Communications & Media Relations Brooke Robertson. “I know these are a lot of changes, but I am confident this new structure will strengthen collaboration, streamline decision-making, and super-charge our growth,” Thunell said about the new structure while also thanking the departing executives. Since the new Paramount TV Studios incarnation's launch, it has landed its first series greenlights, from Paramount+ for the limited series 9/12 starring Jeremy Strong, which originated at Skydance, and from Netflix for Hollywood Arts. It also got a Season 2 renewal for Dexter: Resurrection. Additionally, the studio signed its first talent deal, a first-look pact with Jessica Biel's Iron Ocean, which stemmed from initial conversations at Skydance Television. And it will be the TV home of the Duffer brothers when they come to Paramount from Netflix in April for a big four-year exclusive film, TV and streaming deal. PTVS, which focuses on streaming projects, is functioning alongside Paramount's other major TV production entity, CBS Studios. Over the last few months, we've brought together teams from Skydance, MTV Entertainment Studios, Showtime, Awesomeness, and Nickelodeon into one studio focused on making world-class television series. As we move forward in this new incarnation of Paramount Television Studios, we must make changes to position our business for growth and success. Our studio has an enviable roster of senior executive talent, and after spending time with everyone, I've made key leadership decisions to ensure we achieve our ambitious goals. Drew is a seasoned executive who has been instrumental in some of Skydance's biggest shows including Reacher for Prime Video. ·                     With this change, Keri Flint, EVP and Head of Global Production for MTVE/Showtime, will be stepping down. Keri has been with the company for more than two decades, and in that time, she has been an incredibly valued member of our team. ·                     COO Courtney Armstrong, CFO Mark Badagliacca, EVP Human Resources Talia Robinson, and EVP Global Communications & Media Relations Brooke Robertson are expanding their respective purviews to encompass PTVS, in addition to their current roles at Paramount Pictures. Placing these leaders across the entire studio is an important first step in achieving this goal. Bringing a wealth of experience and top-notch relationships, I'm excited to partner with Virginia in this new role. ·                     Lance McPherson will transition from his role as EVP, Deputy General Counsel and Head of Business & Legal Affairs to EVP, Legal Affairs. He will oversee all legal efforts for our studio going forward. ·                     Jeff Hegedus  is stepping down from his role as EVP, TV Business & Legal Affairs for Skydance. I thank him for his leadership and dedication during long tenure at Skydance. ·                     Mel Rauch will be joining the team as Head of Finance. Previously, Mel was at Netflix, where she served as VP of EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) Content Finance & Strategy. I worked closely with Mel at Netflix for many years, where she was beloved as a creative problem solver and trusted business partner. ·                     Reporting into Mel will be Arturo Reyes, who will transition from his current role as EVP and Global Head of Production Finance at Skydance into his new role as Head of Production Finance for PTVS. ·                     Candice Brancazio, CFO, Paramount Media Networks, Showtime & MTVE, and Matt Hengemuhle, SVP, FP&A, will be exiting their respective roles, with Matt taking on a new remit in our Direct to Consumer business. We're grateful for their leadership and contributions and we will be announcing a new FP&A lead for our studio soon. ·                     Trevor Rose will depart from his role as EVP, Head of Global Talent and Content Development for Showtime/MTVE and is moving to a leadership role in our TV Media group. We believe this structure will encourage on-screen talent to work more seamlessly across our Features and Television Series. ·                     Shauna Phelan, EVP, Head of Live Action Series, Films & Talent, Nickelodeon and Awesomeness TV will be stepping down. Thankfully, Shauna is not going far, as we are in discussions with her about working with us as a producer on some of our most important titles. Going forward, we remain committed to creating high-quality content for kids, teens and families — building on our incredible IP, championing new ideas, and operating as one unified team. I know these are a lot of changes, but I am confident this new structure will strengthen collaboration, streamline decision-making, and super-charge our growth. In the coming weeks, we will continue the integration process, spending time on creative and business strategy under our new leadership team —more on that work soon. Please join me in wishing them the very best. Thank you, as always, for your passion, resilience, and commitment. I cannot wait for all that we will accomplish together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the first night, months ago, Prim thought she would just head down to see what the protests were all about. She left her job as a nursing assistant, still in her scrubs and N95 mask, and drove to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Macadam Street in South Portland, where demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies had started to flare up. Prim went to cross, and was almost immediately shot at. Rubber bullets, pepper balls, and other projectiles whizzed by. From across the street, two black-clad protesters yelled at her. Come to us!” Stumbling and ducking, she made her way over. They told her the rules: ICE is over there. She doesn't use her real name in interviews, or even on the street (Prim is one of several pseudonyms). Prim the nursing assistant didn't know anything about the concept of “black bloc,” where protesters dress in nondescript black clothing to hide their identities. Prim the street medic wears it every night, attempting to conceal her identity from a government that has made it explicitly clear that she is an enemy of the state. For the past 10 years, the core of many of America's myriad protest movements has been dedicated activists who promote an ethos of “anti-fascism,” a nebulous term that has been used in opposition to police violence, brutal immigration policies, and widespread oppression of minority groups like the LGBTQ community. Antifa, as the right describes it, does not exist. On September 22, the Trump administration issued a decree that designated “antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization, claiming it is a “militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government.” Three days later, the administration issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, a sweeping document that links anti-fascist organizing with several instances of political violence, including the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and lays out an extremely broad framework potentially allowing federal law enforcement to prosecute any entity deemed to be supportive of that ideology. Now, anti-fascist activists around the country say that the two proclamations have ratcheted up pressure they've felt for years, making street-level organizing more dangerous than ever before. The ICE agents that clash with protesters in Portland, she says, are barely trained and quickly resort to violence. They fire rubber bullets at protesters' heads and slip rock-hard marbles into the hoppers of their pepper-ball guns. They're often joined by a motley assortment of right-wing agitators — big-rig drivers who menace crowds on the street, right-wing “journalists” who try to infiltrate groups of protesters and dox them online, and the dregs of street gangs like the Proud Boys who show up spoiling for fights.

He knows there's a good chance I don't make it out of this.” Portland's protests, for the time being, are persisting in the face of Trump's new proclamation and ICE's heightened use of force. But in other parts of the country, NSPM-7's effects have driven organizing networks completely underground. Anti-fascist networks have always had a strong security culture — encrypted messaging apps are the norm, and people are guarded with their identities — but the administration's broad declaration of “antifa” as terrorists has pushed those practices into overdrive. “This shit is not new, it's just more overt now,” says Ned, an Appalachian anarchist who is dedicated to arming marginalized communities, like queer and trans people, with firearms. But while online chatter may be more reserved, he says his actual work — hosting range days for queer and trans people to learn to shoot, and distributing information on how to 3D print weapons from scratch at home — is busier than ever. “Direct action has been driven even further underground,” Ned says. While the everyday activities of most anti-fascist activists are still overwhelmingly peaceful, the Trump administration has capitalized on every instance of political violence and used them to usher in new crackdowns and waves of propaganda. In early October — as the president was busy claiming that activist “thugs” were turning cities like Portland into “war zones” —  the administration hosted a rouges' gallery of far-right influencers and media figures at the White House to give them a forum to decry “antifa,” using them to further push its message that the group was a national threat. In Texas, for instance, shootings at two ICE facilities prompted a swift and total crackdown, demolishing fragile networks of activists and bringing a new wave of federal charges. Discords, group chats, and social media accounts were scrubbed overnight, as the FBI raided houses. One source told me that even innocuous, long-standing groups like local Food Not Bombs chapters started wiping data and battening down the hatches, fearing that the federal crackdown wouldn't stay contained to those accused of an actual crime. “People got scared, and they haven't really come back,” said Corey Lyon, a local journalist who has covered protests throughout Texas. In a shocking weaponization of the justice system, Georgia Attorney General Christopher Carr used a 2017 statute passed after the Dylann Roof shootings to arrest and charge dozens of protesters with “domestic terrorism,” holding them in pre-trial detention for lengthy periods and snarling them in a legal web of denied bail, compounding charges, and jurisdictional chaos. Carr then went after the activists' support networks, bringing RICO charges against a local bail fund and several other community organizers. President Trump has clearly learned from these tactics, floating the idea of slamming George Soros and various networks of left-wing nonprofits with RICO charges based on their connections to protests. In Georgia, many of the charges, and many of the cases entirely, have been dropped or shot down by rational judges. From his bedroom, he heard officers discussing whether or not to throw a flash bang grenade through the front door. The point of all this, Kautz says, is to create fear. Because giving in to that fear is just defeat. In Portland, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and many other cities, plenty of activists aren't keeping their heads down. Some protesters have taken to showing up in whimsical costumes: inflatable frogs, chicken suits, giant foam hot dogs, and more. Many of these protests are peaceful, especially the ones that draw large crowds of everyday Americans upset with Trump's increasingly authoritarian administration. But there are always men in uniforms with guns. “We can't predict what is going to happen,” Prim, the medic in Portland, says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peacock, the streaming service of Comcast's entertainment unit NBCUniversal, narrowed its third-quarter loss to $217 million compared with $436 million in the year-ago period. Green Bay Packers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers: How to Watch 'Sunday Night Football' Online Without Cable for Free What 'Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy' Gets Right About Queerness and Psychopathy “The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower sports programming costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year period and a decrease in other sports programming costs for our domestic television networks, mainly reflecting lower sports volumes compared to the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in sports costs for our international networks,” the company said. Revenue for the Studios unit increased 6 percent to $3 billion, “primarily due to higher content licensing revenue,” Comcast said.” Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios, partially offset by the timing of when content was made available by our film studios. Theatrical revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from an increased number of releases in the current quarter, including the successful release of Jurassic World Rebirth.” Theme parks were a key growth driver of the latest period. Revenue jumped 18.7 percent to $2.71 billion “primarily due to higher revenue at domestic theme parks, driven by the successful opening of Epic Universe in May.” Adjusted EBITDA for theme parks rose 13 percent to $958 million, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset a 22 percent increase in operating expenses, which was primarily due to operating costs associated with Epic Universe. “Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction and transaction-related costs associated with the proposed separation of Versant, as well as other operating and administrative expenses related to our investment portfolio,” the company disclosed. For the year to date, it recorded $277 million in such costs. Comcast is run by chairman and CEO Brian Roberts and president Michael Cavanagh, who will in the new year be elevated to the role of co-CEO. Cavanagh, in prepared remarks on the company's earnings call, spent some time leaning into sports as a key driver of its media business post-Versant spin. Each property adds value across our entire media ecosystem, driving NBC distribution, helping Peacock attract and retain subscribers, and powering our advertising business,” Cavanagh said. In the core cable systems business, total domestic broadband customer net losses came to 104,000 in the latest quarter, total domestic wireless line net additions were 414,000 and total domestic video customer net losses hit 257,000. “In Content & Experiences, we're building momentum across NBC and Peacock as we head into one of the most exciting stretches of live sports in our history, including robust NBA coverage, which just began last week,” Roberts said. Cavanagh also discussed the reported interest in Warner Bros. “You can expect that any view we would have about other media assets that could be complementary to our existing media business would be of the same sort. “So I think in light of that, what we'd be looking for and what we're going to look like post-divest and spin, I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that's out there.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

It's been fully two years since Hollywood indulged itself with a movie that was mostly about how goddamn scary bears are—ah, Cocaine Bear, were we ever so young?—and apparently it's that time once again. Variety reports that Mia Goth, Zach Galifianakis, and Dan Stevens have signed on for a new bear-adjacent revenge movie titled Hey Bear, about a woman (Goth, fresh off a more sympathetic take toward potentially lethal Creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein) who decides to take deadly revenge on a bear after it kills her husband (Stevens), and then, instead of being euthanized, is simply transferred to another national park.

While that's interesting enough, the really noteworthy thing about the film is that it's being directed by Jonathan Krisel, who made a name for himself as one of the primary creative voices—including serving as director—on both Portlandia and Galifianakis' show Baskets. Krisel's been on the verge of breaking into film for years at this point, having been attached to a Sesame Street movie that was first floated back in 2019, and a Detective Pikachu sequel that never seemed to get off the ground. Now, he's apparently doing “Grizzly Man if it was fictitious and the Grizzly Man's wife decided she was going to kill that fucking bear,” having spent the intervening years since his last big Hollywood push working on shows like Moonbase 8 and The English Teacher.

Hey Bear will serve as an obvious reunion for Krisel and Galifianakis, who's playing a “socially awkward park ranger” who ends up accompanying Goth's Claire on her quest for bear assassination. Written by regular Nathan Fielder collaborator Carrie Kemper (fresh off both The Curse and The Rehearsal), the film is being described as a “coming of rage” comedy, centered on Goth's character coming out of her shell through the power of murder, which is the sort of clever phrasing that we're going to be mildly, irrationally angry about for the rest of the week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alice Yaxley is standing by her fiancé through one of the most challenging moments of their lives.The 24-year-old model, who is expecting her first child with “Made in Chelsea” star Sam Vanderpump, opened up about how emotional it was to watch his health battle unfold on television. In a TikTok video shared Tuesday, Yaxley admitted she broke down after watching the latest episode. “I don't usually watch Made in Chelsea because it cringes me out,” she said while making fresh orange juice. “But I did watch last night because it was a very emotional one from Sam. Sam Vanderpump might just have four or five years to live if he doesn't find an organ donor. They were dormant in his body until he got the flu in December and, coupled with asthma, his organs struggled to cope. The 28-year-old “Made in Chelsea” star, who is the nephew of reality icon Lisa Vanderpump, revealed on Monday's episode that he has been diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. The condition, he shared, could limit his life expectancy to only four or five years without a transplant. “There is no hope of my liver getting better,” Vanderpump told fellow cast member Ollie Locke on the E4 show, as shared by Daily Mail. “He said I wouldn't be having this call with you if I thought you could make it through the next four or five years. They're sending me for a liver transplant assessment, so yeah.” Vanderpump was born with two rare conditions: congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver and polycystic kidney disease. They remained dormant until a flu infection in December triggered organ failure. Earlier this year, Vanderpump shared that he “nearly died” after his liver and kidneys failed, leading to sepsis. Vanderpump's openness about his illness has inspired public support and renewed attention on organ donation. “You may have seen in tonight's episode that Sam Vanderpump needs an organ transplant,” the post read. “Our thoughts are with Sam and his family as they face this news. We hope that his courage in speaking out will inspire others.” The post continued, “Thousands of people are currently waiting for a life-saving transplant. “Hopefully I'll remain that way until it's time for surgery.” Leur histoire met en lumière l'importance cruciale du don d'organes. En lisant l'article, je me suis demandé comment fonctionne exactement le processus d'allocation des greffons pour les personnes en attente, surtout avec la récente baisse des dons évoquée. J'ai trouvé un article très détaillé, “UK Transplant: A Practitioner's Insight into Decreased Donor Allocation and the Waiting List for Members”, qui offre un point de vue interne fascinant sur les défis actuels. Est-ce que quelqu'un sait si ces contraintes logistiques et cette augmentation des critères de sélection, comme décrit ici https://uktransplant.org/uk-transplant-decreased-donor-allocation-waiting-list-members-insider-view, ont un impact direct sur les temps d'attente pour des maladies rares comme celle de Sam ?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watching the current White House and its various lackeys/minions/catspaws attempt to wrestle with “memes,” as an artistic format, has been a little bit like watching a dog try to aim and fire a machine gun: Bizarre, darkly amusing in a sick sort of way, and ultimately likely to end in tragedy. We've been tracking, for instance, the Trump administration's recent embrace of Halo—truly, the hottest gaming property of 2005—in its latest stab at convincing the nation's gym teachers and gym teacher-minded folk that working for ICE would be a cool thing to do. Tolkien and Lord Of The Rings are insanely complicated. (And have only been muddied further by Jackson's films, which simplify some of Tolkien's more nuanced ideas about morality by doing things like excising one of his most important chapters in favor of more time spent on big, setpiece battles between good and evil.) Whole books have been written about how Tolkien's Catholic conservatism, his contempt for bullies, his “guy born in 1892” takes on race, his overall disdain for any of the trappings of modernity, etc., add up to a fantasy universe that both the left-wing and the right-wing have seen themselves in, and tried to take exuberant grip of, over the years. Vance are massive Tolkien fans, and have both “honored” the Professor by naming tech and investment companies—which he likely would have loathed to the very core of his being—after words he invented.) None of which makes it any less gross to see poor Dominic Monaghan get his face plastered on a virtual ICE recruitment poster trying to sell the idea that America is some idyllic Shire, in desperate need of protection via an army of masked goons who live in mortal fear of inflatable frogs. Of course, the irritation is, presumably, part of the point: Laying claim to fictional heroes who can't do inconvenient things like tell ICE to go fuck itself when it invokes them is an easy way to both annoy people who are pretty sure Merry and Pippin would look at the various bullies and cowards currently populating the administration for like five seconds before telling them to go kick rocks, and to convey some clout into the minds of those who are convinced that fielding an army of masked thugs dragging people out of their homes makes themselves “the good guys” in this looming “great battle of our time” that they're all apparently obsessed with. DHS media reps have previously stated that the new ads are a deliberate pivot to trying to target the things that Vance was really into when he was like 16, specifically, saying, “We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, Lord of the Rings, or any other medium.” Why TV keeps failing to tame The Stand By Zack Handlen October 27, 2025 | 7:00am</p>
