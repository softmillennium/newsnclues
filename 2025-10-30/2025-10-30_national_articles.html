President Trump says he's cutting tariffs on Chinese imports by 10% after meeting with Xi Jinping in Busan, citing progress on trade, fentanyl and rare-earth exports. The Senate once again rejected President Donald Trump's tariffs, this time on a global scale. Lawmakers in the upper chamber went three for three with resolutions meant to terminate Trump's use of emergency powers to enact steep tariffs on foreign countries. Earlier this year, Trump declared through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act that he would enact a base 10% tariff on countries across the world. He argued in his executive order at the time that "national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits" as a reason to pull the trigger on the tariffs. The Senate for a third time rebuked President Donald Trump's usage of emergency powers to enact tariffs, this time for countries across the globe. Since then, senators have grumbled about the tariffs and made moves to terminate his usage of emergency powers throughout the year. And it's the second time that this particular resolution from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has been considered in the Senate. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., were expected to vote for the resolution but missed their chance. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., leaves a Senate Democratic meeting at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, Oct. 3, 2025. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., to strike down Trump's global tariffs. Those same lawmakers all voted against the previous two resolutions, too. The other tariff-minded legislation would end Trump's emergency powers to enact 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods and 35% tariffs on Canadian goods. But they likely won't go anywhere in the House, which previously voted to reject undermining Trump's tariff policy until next year. Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., arrives for a vote at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, June 28, 2025. Meanwhile, Trump announced that after a "truly great" meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would lower his fentanyl tariffs on China by 10%. "There is enormous respect between our two countries, and that will only be enhanced with what just took place," Trump said on Truth Social. "We agreed on many things, with others, even of high importance, being very close to resolved." Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday the victims of sexual abuse by grooming gangs needed action, not another inquiry, as Opposition Leader Kemi Badenoch pressed for a national inquiry. The Court of Appeal for northern Norrland confirmed to Fox News Digital that the defendant, an Eritrean national and illegal immigrant, Yezied Mohamed, was sentenced to three years in prison for raping the 16-year-old girl from the northern town of Skellefteå, on Sept. 1, 2024. The ruling prompted swift condemnation from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who released a video promising stricter deportation laws. "No one should have to worry about meeting their attacker or rapist on the street," Kristersson said. "Those who commit serious crimes in Sweden and are not Swedish citizens must leave the country." Nearly two years after Sweden formally applied to join NATO, its membership now hinges on convincing one country, Viktor Orbán's Hungary to formally ratify its bid to join the military alliance. Kristersson pledged to introduce "the toughest legislation in all the Nordic countries," stating that any crime resulting in more than a fine could lead to deportation. "With these new, stricter rules, six times as many people are expected to be deported. We are going further than any government has ever done before." Migration Minister Johan Forssell echoed the prime minister's sentiment in a video he posted on X, calling the case unacceptable. "The victim's right to safety must always outweigh the perpetrator's right to stay in Sweden," he said. "Next year I will present new legislation that will make Sweden the toughest country in the Nordic region when it comes to crime-related deportations." "We also need to review the international conventions that, until now, have made it harder to carry out necessary deportations. Yezied Mohamed was not tried at this court but at the Court of Appeal for Northern Norrland. The District Court initially acquitted him, accepting that a rape had occurred but finding insufficient evidence that he was the perpetrator. It ruled that while the offense was serious, it was not "of such an exceptionally grave nature" to justify deportation under refugee protections. One judge dissented, arguing he should be expelled. The decision sparked global attention after social media posts claimed Mohamed avoided deportation because the rape "lasted less than ten minutes." While no specific timeframe appears in the judgment, the court confirmed that duration was one factor in its assessment. "The judges themselves determined which aspects of the crime were relevant and whether those were sufficiently severe to justify deportation," Peterson said. "That's what makes this ruling so controversial." Elon Musk shared a tweet that garnered nearly 10 million views criticizing Sweden's court system's leniency towards migrants. A post by Swedish commentator Evelina Hahne, viewed nearly 10 million times and shared by Elon Musk, accused Swedish courts of leniency toward migrants and reignited a nationwide debate over crime and immigration. Peterson said the case highlights a broader issue: Sweden's difficulty deporting migrants even after serious convictions. "In Sweden it's very difficult to deport migrants, even those convicted of serious crimes," he said. "This case became symbolic because people feel it shows how the system protects offenders more than victims." He noted similar cases, including the 2016 murder of Elin Krantz, a young woman killed by an Ethiopian man with a residence permit, and recent reports of rapes in elderly care homes involving foreign-born workers. A police car in Stockholm, Sweden on May 1, 2021. "Only after the right-wing coalition took power in 2022 did meaningful reforms begin to take shape," Peterson said. "Before that, the issue was considered too politically sensitive." Sill, he says, "Sweden did not join a Danish-Italian initiative within the European Union to reform the European Convention on Human Rights, which critics say limits the ability to deport convicted offenders. Denmark, Italy and Austria signed on — Sweden did not." As public anger mounts, Sweden's government faces pressure to implement tougher policies. Judge Viktorsson told Fox News Digital the court followed existing law and precedent, "but the power to change deportation standards lies with lawmakers."

Video shows federal officers detaining a female activist after she crossed a restricted line outside the ICE building in Portland, Oregon, Saturday. A Portland police commander testified Wednesday that federal forces deployed by President Donald Trump escalated tensions during protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building, intensifying violence rather than curbing it. Franz Schoening delivered the testimony during a federal bench trial examining whether Trump had legal grounds to deploy the National Guard to Portland — an action city officials argue was unnecessary and inflammatory. Schoening described instances in which federal agents fired tear gas at who he called nonviolent demonstrators, saying the actions were "startling." The ICE facility had been a focal point of protests since June. He said that state and federal law prohibit police agencies from using the tactics that federal officers have taken, including the deployment of tear gas and other munitions. Portland police officers, he added, were themselves hit by tear gas and forced to retreat. Federal agents, including members of the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol and the police, attempt to keep protesters back outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility Oct. 5, 2025, in Portland, Oregon. Schoening recounted a larger Oct. 18 protest where a federal agent allegedly launched a munition — either smoke or tear gas — that bounced off the facility's driveway and landed on the roof, where other agents were stationed. Those agents responded by firing additional rounds into the crowd. "We didn't see any violent conduct or behavior that would have precipitated that use of force," Schoening testified. "It appeared to be triggered by the federal officer's deployment of that munition.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) (AP Photo/Jenny Kane) Portland attorney Caroline Turco said the evidence would show that the protests were largely peaceful and did not justify National Guard intervention. "This case is about whether we are a nation of constitutional law or martial law," Turco said in opening statements. U.S. Border Patrol Agents detain a demonstrator during a protest outside the ICE headquarters in south Portland, Oregon, on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2025. In a trial brief, the Trump administration accused Portland authorities of being "unhelpful and at times hostile," and claimed the city's police repeatedly failed to support federal agents. "The record is replete with evidence of the PPB failing to provide assistance when federal officials have requested it," DOJ attorneys wrote.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) It also argues the Trump administration can call out the National Guard because the president has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces in Portland and has characterized the protests as a "rebellion" or presenting a "danger of rebellion" — both cited as justifications under federal law for National Guard deployment. The non-jury trial is expected to last three days and will include testimony from federal officials. Local police maintain they have made arrests when necessary while also respecting First Amendment rights. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pamphlets line the door to the health clinic at King Middle School in Portland, Maine, on April 18, 2008. PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — A network of medical clinics that serves low-income residents in Maine said it will shut down its primary care operations on Friday because of Trump administration cuts to abortion providers. Maine Family Planning operates 18 clinics in the state and says abortions are a relatively small percentage of its overall services, which also include cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing and contraception. The move to defund abortion providers is driving patients away from their doctors in Maine, said George Hill, president of Maine Family Planning. The network saw more than 600 patients in its primary care practices last year, Hill said. “Telling those patients we can't see them anymore has been devastating, especially knowing that some of them will find it too difficult to get a new provider and may just forego care,” Hill said. Maine Family Planning serves many of the poor and rural areas of the state and typically receives about $1.9 million in Medicaid reimbursements per year, the network said in a statement. The network said it notified its patients of the coming primary care closures about a month ago. The network has about 8,000 patients in total. Maine Family Planning fought the halting of Medicaid dollars in federal court, but it suffered a setback in August when a federal judge ruled against restoring funding during the network's ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration. The network appealed to a higher court, and that legal fight is still ongoing. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, called the loss of funding for Maine Family Planning “part of a larger strategy to shut down clinics even in states like Maine that protect the right to abortion.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The waiving of sanctions on Milorad Dodik followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president. Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia's integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.” Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump's Washington. Coming three weeks before Dayton's 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration's decision was especially dispiriting. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment. The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska's National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska's installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month. Since Trump's return to the White House, Dodik's overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months. In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.” Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich's firm, signed a contract with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a contract with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year's work, plus a bonus if Zell's firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act website. This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik's cause. Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, called for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.” Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump's one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump's famous MAGA hats. “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said.</p>

Since President Donald Trump's second term began, his administration's approach to China has been arguably the toughest aspect of its foreign policy to parse. If there was something of an emerging consensus, it was that Trump has been willing to confront China on trade and economic issues — though through its effective weaponization of rare earth mineral supply chains, the nation has proved tougher to pressure via trade than most other countries on the receiving end of Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he has been less interested in competing militarily and geopolitically with China, a competition that has consumed much of Washington — including his own first-term administration — in recent years. Heading into Trump's meeting on Thursday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Semafor's Ben Smith predicted the occasion would “end Washington's decade of China hawks.” The fear among many was that Xi would exploit Trump's desperation for a trade deal for concessions on the geopolitical questions he knows Trump is less interested in. In particular, Xi is reportedly seeking a statement from Trump formally opposing Taiwan's independence. (The current US position is that it does not support a unilateral move toward Taiwan independence. That might not seem like a major distinction, but this is a conflict where subtleties like this can have enormous consequences.) Before the meeting, one Trump aide told NBC News that “everyone is holding their breath” to hear what he would say about Taiwan. In the talks that Trump rated a “12 out of 10,” the two leaders reached a truce of sorts of trade issues: Trump said he would reduce tariffs on China by 10 percentage points, while Xi agreed to resume US soybean purchases, lift restrictions on rare earths exports, and promised to crack down on Chinese exports of chemicals that are used to make fentanyl. Well, sure — for all issues but the small matter of nuclear war. Just minutes ahead of the meeting with Xi, Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing that he had ordered the resumption of nuclear testing: China is building up its arsenal, but it won't be even with the US in five years under even the most dire Pentagon estimates. The Department of Energy, not Defense, is responsible for nuclear testing. No country, other than North Korea, has actually detonated a nuclear weapon since the 1990s. It's possible Trump was referring to Russia's recent test of a nuclear-capable and nuclear-powered torpedo. Trump didn't answer a reporter's question about the announcement in Korea, and the White House has not yet responded to Vox's request for clarification. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 suggested that the US should “indicate a willingness to conduct nuclear tests in response to adversary nuclear developments if necessary.” But this announcement is not motivated by technical necessity; the US and other nuclear states have a number of ways of testing the reliability of their arsenals without actually detonating them. If Trump actually means a return to active nuclear testing — detonating warheads — that would be a major escalation that could prompt reciprocal moves from Russia and China. There will be some sighs of relief in both Washington and Taipei that Trump did not “sell out” Taiwan's autonomy for a deal on soybeans. That doesn't mean the issue — the most likely flashpoint that could cause a US-China military conflict — is likely to go away. Trump may not be interested in war with China, but war with China could still be interested in him. Trump has said he does not believe Xi will attack Taiwan, despite the island being the “apple of his eye,” and that may well be true given how daunting an all-out amphibious invasion could be with or without US involvement. But China's moves to ramp up pressure on the country — which Beijing considers a rebellious province — seem more plausible. Under legislation passed in 1979, the US is obligated to take measures to help Taiwan resist any use of force to change its status, but subsequent administrations have long been coy about whether this would mean actually using military force to protect Taiwan from invasion — a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” Joe Biden came about as close as any president ever had to abandoning this policy, saying on four separate occasions that he believed the US was obligated to defend Taiwan, though administration officials always walked these statements back. Trump has not said anything like that, which Jason Hsu, a former Taiwanese legislator and who is currently a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, told me may actually be for the best. “We need to get ourselves together and bolster our self-defense.” When I visited Taiwan last year, just prior to the US election, I found officials and ordinary citizens fairly optimistic about what a potential second Trump administration would mean for them. During his first term, Trump broke precedent by speaking directly with Taiwan's president. And he increased arms sales, including some systems that the Obama administration had withheld. Trump's first term secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, later called in 2022 for the US to formally recognize Taiwan's independence. Also just ahead of Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting, CBS reported that the US military's Indo-Pacific Command had given an order for a “show of force” operation to deter Chinese aggression in the South China Sea — though it's unclear if the US operation will actually be carried out. Still, overall, the administration has signaled that preparing for military confrontation with China is not a major issue. The Pentagon's forthcoming national security strategy is expected to downgrade Chinese competition, to place it below border security and Western Hemisphere issues. “I think the Biden administration was strategic, but not ambiguous,” Zack Cooper, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies US-China competition, told Vox. “The Trump administration is ambiguous, but maybe not very strategic.” Given what we know about Trump's attitude toward the use of military force — he prefers quick, decisive strikes against weaker targets like Iran, the Houthis, or alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that don't have any capacity to retaliate or get the US involved in a protracted conflict — it's hard to imagine him getting embroiled in a conflict with China. “In a Taiwan scenario, if you bomb China, they're going to bomb you back,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow at Defense Priorities. Kavanagh, who advocates a policy of dialing back the US defense buildup in Asia, said that as Taiwan manages its own relations with Beijing and prepares for potential military conflict, “I think it's really important to assume that the US won't come.” The next few years of history in Asia may hinge on just how much Xi is willing to test that unpredictability. ﻿A new strategy to stop business elites from bending the knee.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel has received the remains of what Hamas earlier said were two deceased hostages held in Gaza. If confirmed, that would leave the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza. The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago. Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing's going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.” Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains. On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.” This story has been updated with additional development.</p>

Health and science journalist Max Lugavere joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss surgeon general nominee Dr. Casey Means, her background and why he believes she is qualified. A virtual confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump's surgeon general pick Dr. Casey Means has been postponed because she went into labor. Her opening remarks for the hearing expected on Thursday had been prewritten. "Our nation is angry, exhausted, and hurting from preventable disease. Rates of high blood pressure, many cancers, autoimmune conditions, type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, dementia, neurodevelopmental challenges, and youth suicide have all increased in the past two decades," the prepared remarks, obtained by Fox News, said. President Donald Trump has picked Dr. Casey Means to be his nominee for surgeon general. "This public-health crisis is touching every American family. It strains our federal budget and dims hope for millions," she planned to say. As the nation's doctor, the surgeon general is a leader for Americans and health officials on public health issues. If confirmed, Means will represent an administration that has already transformed the public health landscape by calling for increased scrutiny of vaccines, the nation's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs. President Donald Trump has picked Dr. Casey Means to be his nominee for surgeon general. Means, a Stanford-educated physician who rose to popularity as a wellness influencer after becoming disillusioned with traditional medicine, was expected to share a vision for ending chronic disease by targeting its root causes, an idea that aligns with the Make America Healthy Again message of her close ally Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She has no government experience, and her license to practice as a physician is inactive, The Associated Press reported, adding that it was not immediately clear when the hearing would be rescheduled. "Everyone's happy for Dr. Means and her family," said Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary for the Health and Human Services Department. "This is one of the few times in life it's easy to ask to move a Senate hearing." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman with an umbrella passes the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is drifting around its record heights on Thursday, as Wall Street sifts through mixed developments on everything from the U.S.-China trade war to profits for Big Tech behemoths. The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% and edged a bit further from its all-time high set on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 179 points, or 0.4%, as of 12:54 p.m. Eastern time. Stocks were also mixed in Europe and Asia, coming off a much anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed his talk with China's leader, Xi Jinping, as a “12” on a scale of zero to 10, and Trump said he would cut tariffs on China. Plus, stocks had already run to records earlier this week on expectations for potentially big improvements coming out the Trump-Xi talks. “The result was fine, but fine isn't good enough given the expectations going in,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “The results were more like small gestures instead of a grand bargain.” Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Meta Platforms dropped 10.2%, cutting into what had been a 28.4% jump for the year so far. Companies across the industry have been on an investment spree to build out their artificial-intelligence capabilities, and the concern is whether it will all pay off. Microsoft sank 2.9% even though it reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Analysts pointed to how it also expects to spend more on investments in 2026 than in 2025, while growth for its Azure business may have fallen a bit short of some investors' expectations. On the winning side of Big Tech was Alphabet. Shares of Google's parent company climbed 4% after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter easily topped analysts' expectations. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill tumbled 15.6% after the restaurant chain pointed to all the pressures weighing on its customers, particularly younger ones and those who aren't making high incomes. Chipotle cut its forecast for an important underlying measure of sales growth this year, as CEO Scott Boatwright said that households making less than $100,000 are dining out less often because of concerns about the economy and inflation. He pointed specifically to 25- to 35-year-old customers, who are feeling the weight of unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower growth with respect to inflation, and he said he thinks restaurants across the industry are seeing something similar. Eli Lilly, meanwhile, rose 3.8% after delivering stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It rose 1.1% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Visa also helped lift the Dow after adding 3.2% following its own better-than-expected profit report. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady as traders continue to pare expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate in December. That's after Fed Chair Jerome Powell admonished markets the day before, saying a December cut “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” But officials have also said they may have to halt cuts if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level,  because lower rates can worsen inflation. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up by less than 0.1% after the Bank of Japan likewise held rates steady. AP Business Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A three-star general left the Pentagon earlier this month due to “sustained tensions” with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine. Lt. Gen. Joe McGee retired early from his post on the Joint Staff's Strategy, Plans, and Policy team, CNN reported, citing anonymous sources. The general's stalled promotion has also been a source of tension. McGee was said to be nominated by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the Joint Staff, a three-star officer who assists the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “General McGee is retiring, and the War Department is grateful for his service,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner. In his former role, McGee advised Caine on military strategies involving risk assessment and crisis contingency planning. Navy Adm. Alvin Holsey, who headed U.S. Southern Command, announced his retirement earlier this month after reportedly disagreeing with Pentagon leadership over the Caribbean drug strikes. He will retire in December, just one year into his job. During his address to top military leaders late last month, Hegseth talked about enforcing merit-based standards across the department and eliminating its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. He also boasted about firing multiple senior officials since taking office in January. “I have fired a number of senior officers since taking over — the previous chairman, other members of the Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders, and other commanders,” Hegseth said at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the sports world's most intriguing start-up companies is renewing its long-term partnership with its first-ever major professional sports league partner. The IMAX-esque experience allows Cosm's customers to watch live sporting events on its unique 87-foot-diameter, 12L+ LED screens that have gone viral for offering a first-of-its-kind experience for fans. The two entities are now set to work together into 2030 and beyond. The NBA makes a splash on return to China. “Our ambition is to give another option for fans that might be out of the marketplace or their favorite team is on the road, or they haven't been able to get to those courtside seats or lower bowl seats,” said Jeb Terry, Cosm's president and CEO, in an interview with CNN Sports. “And that's why it was really an obvious opportunity from the beginning. Because not only is that the innovative spirit of the league, the tech-forward approach, but the same way we approach it by leveraging technology to augment that fan experience and give more optionality, so fans can just lean in and celebrate wherever they are, whether they're in-market, out-of-market, wherever that may be.” The extended partnership will allow Cosm to produce and distribute live NBA games at Cosm's venues for at least the next five years. That means Cosm will be able to send its in-house production team, which is responsible for the unique views provided to viewers at their domes, to key national TV games, events from next year's All-Star Weekend, the playoffs and NBA Finals. Teddy Kaplan, NBA vice president and head of new media partnerships at the league, said working with Cosm has been a no-brainer for his team from the start. Kaplan was on a ski trip to Park City, Utah, in 2022 when he got the opportunity to visit Cosm's headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. He diverted from that vacation for a bit to see what the company was working on and was introduced to Cosm's experience center for the first time, which gave him an idea of what the finished domes would be like. He added, “Our fans are young, tech-savvy, diverse, and they push us to be innovative. And as you'll see, across our portfolio of distribution points, we're always looking for ways to innovate the way fans watch our game, whether it's alt streams, whether it's via virtual reality, whether it's with our social partners. Cosm is the perfect piece in our broader network here.” Michael Jordan disapproves of ‘load management' in today's basketball and 3 things you missed from Tuesday's NBA action That kind of high-profile partner gave Cosm – at that point about a year-and-a-half from opening its first location near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – much needed legitimacy as it entered into discussions with other leagues and broadcast companies that hold the rights to sporting events aired in the US. “When you're building companies, there's always these pivotal moments along the way. Then you have to work on getting market adoption, and there's a lot of ways to do that with our business,” Terry said. And so, having the NBA as our first, it was a great moment for our company to announce it … and then get that word of mouth trending within the industry and then pushing that forward. And so, you look to have all these credible moments along the way in this growth phase. The next move for Cosm is scaling up into more locations. Three more locations have been announced in Detroit, Cleveland and Atlanta. “We like to use the stat that 99% of our fans will never make it to an NBA game, and that's in the US. And when you think about sitting courtside, basically 100%, right?” Kaplan said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in the White House, and the Republican justices were very concerned that the executive branch was claiming “highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.” To keep the executive in check, the Republican justices invented a legal doctrine, known as “major questions,” which was supposed to prevent the president or his subordinates from enacting new policies with “vast ‘economic and political significance'” — at least without getting very specific authorization from Congress first. Flash forward to the present, and these same Republicans are about to reveal whether this major questions doctrine was an honest effort to allocate power among the three branches of US government, or whether it was simply something they made up to stymie a Democratic president from enacting his agenda. Selections — both of which challenge the ever-shifting tariffs that Trump has imposed on US imports. In both cases, the challengers argue that various provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), the law Trump relied upon when he instituted his tariffs, do not actually permit those tariffs to exist. Several of these statutory arguments, as numerous federal judges have now concluded, are quite strong. The tariffs, in other words, are clearly a matter of “vast economic and political significance.” Trump's tariffs also appear to divide more traditional, fiscally conservative Republicans from the president's MAGA loyalists. At a Federalist Society conference on executive power last spring, numerous speakers criticized the tariffs and questioned their legality. One of many Republicans who joined briefs opposing the tariffs is former Sen. John Danforth (R-MO), an early mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas. The major questions doctrine itself is the culmination of a decade-long project by many Republican lawyers and judges to limit executive power. Admittedly, many of the same Republican judges and advocates also embraced other legal theories seeking to expand presidential authority — the most notable is the unitary executive theory, which Trump has wielded aggressively to take control of federal agencies that are supposed to have a degree of independence from the president. Selections and its sister case, in other words, are a loyalty test for the Republican justices. Similarly, if they want to demonstrate their loyalty to the current leader of their political party, the Republican justices will need to write an opinion that simply cannot be squared with their Biden-era decisions. The IEEPA permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” By law, however, the president may only use this power to “deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.” So it's tough to see how trade deficits qualify as unusual or extraordinary. Additionally, the plaintiffs point out that there is a separate federal law governing when the president may impose tariffs to deal with trade deficits. This law only permits tariffs of up to 15 percent, and it stipulates that they must expire after 150 days. This limited grant of authority, they argue, displaces any power to impose tariffs targeting trade deficits that the president would otherwise have under IEEPA. Trump's lawyers, for what it is worth, have plausible rebuttals to at least some of these arguments. But any uncertainty about how to read IEEPA should be resolved by the major questions doctrine, which says that courts should avoid reading federal laws to give the executive powers of “vast ‘economic and political significance'” if at all possible. The major questions doctrine is very new, and has only ever been used against one president: Biden. But in 2014, the Republican justices did apply an early version of it to a hypothetical EPA regulation, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. That case also provides a pithy, one-sentence summary of this brand new legal doctrine: “We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance. In Biden v. Nebraska (2023), for example, the Republican justices struck down a student loan forgiveness plan that was clearly authorized by an act of Congress. Nevertheless, the Republican justices deemed the Biden administration's student loans plan — which they estimated would cost “between $469 billion and $519 billion” — to be too ambitious to exist. The “economic and political significance” of such a plan, they concluded, “is staggering by any measure.” But if the rule is that a presidential administration may not create a new policy that involves hundreds of billions of dollars, then Trump's tariffs obviously must fall. Trump's own lawyers claim that his new import taxes will “reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years.” More reliable sources, like the Budget Lab at Yale, estimate that Trump's import taxes will “raise about $2.5 trillion over 2026-35.” That's five times the amount of money at stake in Nebraska. They argue, for example, that the doctrine should not apply to policies that are enacted by an order from the president himself, rather than a Cabinet secretary or some other official that works for the president. They also claim, quoting from an opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that “the major questions canon has not been applied by this Court in the national security or foreign policy contexts.” It's hard to rebut these arguments, because the major questions doctrine is not law — or, at least, it is not law in the sense that it derives from any particular statute or constitutional provision. So there's no legal provision that anyone can read to determine how the major questions doctrine should apply in, say, the national security context. As Thomas wrote in a recent concurring opinion, “judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply,” because those courts “lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis.” These doctrines often lead to what Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called “Calvinball jurisprudence,” where the rules change based on the justices' personal preferences or some other extra-legal factor. In any event, if it was legitimate for the Republican justices to make up a brand new legal rule that they could use to sabotage Biden, then it must be equally legitimate for those same justices to make up arbitrary limits on their new rule, limits that conveniently allow a Republican president to do whatever he wants. ﻿A new strategy to stop business elites from bending the knee.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The countdown is on keep food on the table for about 42 million Americans who receive SNAP grocery assistance. The Department of Agriculture says debit cards that people use to buy food won't be replenished in November due to the government shutdown. Michelle Lujan Grisham, center, announces the state will provide $30 million in emergency food assistance to residents to temporarily backfill SNAP benefits during a news conference outside a grocery store in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martinez talks about state efforts to temporarily backfill SNAP benefits during a news conference outside a grocery store in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. With federal SNAP food assistance set to run dry this weekend amid the protracted U.S. government shutdown, Louisiana, New Mexico and Vermont became the latest states Wednesday to announce help for low-income households that rely on the funds to eat. They join states from New York to Nevada in scrambling to find ways to get food to people who are increasingly anxious and will otherwise go hungry without their normal monthly payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Jeff Landry backed a bipartisan measure to allow most of the state's nearly 800,000 SNAP recipients to receive their full monthly benefit amount. “Our priorities are specific, we're going to protect the most vulnerable population in Louisiana — which is our kids, disabled and elderly,” Landry said. But officials said that while program details are still incomplete, the effort will likely exclude “able bodied” adults who aren't caring for children or don't share a household with elderly or disabled members — about 53,000 recipients. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Wednesday that her state will provide $30 million in emergency food assistance to residents through EBT cards, backfilling SNAP benefits temporarily. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. New Mexico held a two-day special legislative session at the outset of the shutdown to shore up food banks and pantries with $8 million in new funding, along with $17.5 million in SNAP-related costs to offset cuts under President Donald Trump's spending and tax cut bill. The emergency funding is expected to last about 10 days, while Democratic state House Speaker Javier Martínez said the Legislature is positioned to approve more if necessary because “children going without basic food staples is an emergency.” Lujan Grisham said state officials are aware that 10 days isn't enough but they are prepared to deal with the issue for as long as they can. “We're not going to let food insecurity creep into this state,” she said. Phil Scott and Democratic legislative leaders approved using $6.3 million in state funds to cover 15 days of SNAP benefits and provide $250,000 to food banks. The Legislature had previously put $50 million aside for such emergencies. Some, like Rhode Island, say they will funnel reserve federal welfare funds directly onto the debit cards issued to people who buy groceries with SNAP. Other states such as Alabama, Texas, Kansas and Florida have not acted. In Nebraska, the state Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement Tuesday announcing it would pause SNAP benefits the next day. It said it is “actively coordinating with food banks, nonprofit partners, and community organizations,” and listed area food banks for those seeking help. Leaving people to fend for themselves will mean the most vulnerable — like children and the elderly — will go hungry, said Tashara Leak, a registered dietitian and nutritional researcher and professor at Cornell University. She also serves on New York State Council on Hunger and Food Policy that routinely meets with New York's governor. “The panic is already starting,” Leak said, adding families with limited resources are “already rationing food in preparation to not receive benefits on Nov. 1.” Despite the best efforts of states, local governments and food charities, it won't be enough to cover what the federal government does under SNAP. Even states with fat budget surpluses couldn't cover the SNAP tab much beyond November. Recently, a group of Democratic state officials filed suit, asking a judge to require the Trump administration to keep funding SNAP benefits. They say that the government is required to use one contingency fund, which has around $5 billion, for that purpose and that another larger reserve fund of about $23 billion is also available. Delays in benefits are nearly certain for most beneficiaries whose debit cards are replenished early in the month — even in states that are planning to pay for benefits or if a judge orders the federal government to load the cards immediately. The legal filing asserted that in California, for instance, there will be a one-day delay in benefits available for every day after Oct. 23 that the process of putting money on cards hasn't begun. That means that if a judge orders the program to continue on Thursday, the first cards would likely not be ready until around Nov. 10. Beneficiaries often stock up on groceries at the start of the month, and stores often hold sales then that encourage shoppers to do so. “We're about to find out how much this program matters, in ways that people hadn't realized,” Bosso said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump commented on his “truly great meeting” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and announced several important revelations on Thursday aboard Air Force One. Now every year we'll renegotiate the deal,” Trump said on Air Force One. As a result, China will halt export controls on rare earth materials. The export controls initially went into effect on Oct. 9 but will now be delayed a year, after reaching an agreement at the summit. Rare earths are a vital part of U.S. manufacturing, necessary for products including turbines, electric vehicles, smartphones, medical imaging equipment, submarines, and satellites. The president also revealed that China intended to buy “American energy.” He teased that a “large-scale” deal involving Alaskan oil and gas could be in the works. It would mark a significant pivot in China's importing of U.S. energy, which fell to practically zero over the summer as tensions increased between the U.S. and China. “China also agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy,” Trump said in his post. “In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska. Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out.” “The agreements reached today will deliver Prosperity and Security to millions of Americans,” Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada could reshape the electric vehicle landscape in North America by removing its tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, a move that would open a new market for Chinese auto companies and narrow export opportunities for American manufacturers. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced earlier this week that he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. The Wire China reported that Canada is considering scrapping its tariffs on Chinese EVs amid rising tensions between President Donald Trump and Carney. Canada followed the United States last year in imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs, as part of an effort to protect domestic manufacturing and curb China's dominance in the market. In response to the tariffs, China placed levies on Canadian canola oilseeds and related products. There's no reason why consumers outside of the U.S. wouldn't want to buy those products.” China has led the world in the EV market, offering electric and hybrid vehicles at lower prices and with more advanced features than U.S. automakers. Abuelsamid said the administration's strategy could limit U.S. automakers' ability to compete in global markets. For example, Abuelsamid said consumers in Japan would not buy a Ford F150, which has nothing to do with tariffs, but vehicles such as that do not work in places such as Tokyo. Abuelsamid noted that in North America, several Chinese-made vehicles have been available in Mexico for many years, with those brands capturing 20% of the new vehicle market there. There are several Chinese-made EVs available in Mexico, including BYD's Dolphin Mini, which costs from $21,000 to $23,000. The Chinese EVs are an attractive product for consumers in Mexico due to their affordability. If Canada opens its doors to Chinese EVs, it provides those companies with another “foothold” in the North American market, Abuelsamid said. Trump recently suspended trade talks with Canada and has threatened to place higher tariffs on Canadian goods after the country ran ads featuring President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. If a deal occurs, McDonald said Canada would encourage China to invest in the Canadian market by manufacturing there. Trump just finished a weeklong Asia trip, during which he has been signing trade agreements with multiple Asian nations on critical minerals and rare earths. Trump also met with Xi to discuss trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump was in a positive mood after his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded on Thursday. Neither Trump nor any representative from his delegation reportedly shared much with the media after the meeting and before departing South Korea. While aboard Air Force One, Trump spoke to reporters but did not announce a trade deal with China, as he did after meeting with leaders of other countries on his Asia trip. However, he did call the conversation productive and said that the U.S. and China did “come to conclusion on many points” after the approximately hour and 40-minute bilateral talk. Trump was complimentary about Xi and the meeting, saying it was “amazing.” The president categorized it as a “12” on a scale of one to 10, according to reports. “Zero, to 10, with 10 being the best, I'd say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One. “A lot of decisions were made … and we've come to a conclusion on very many important points.” Geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have been high lately, with the two engaged in a trade war amid Trump's decision to increase tariffs earlier this year. The decrease will go into effect immediately, Trump said. He said his meeting with Xi was a “great success” and “great honor” and that there were tentative plans for Trump to visit China again in April, with Xi then planning a visit to the U.S. “sometime after that” either in Washington, D.C., or Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, left, takes the ball from starting pitcher Blake Snell (7) as he's removed from the game during seventh inning Game 5 World Series playoff MLB baseball action against the Toronto Blue Jays in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Blake Snell thinks bad luck had about as much to do with his Game 5 struggles as the Toronto Blue Jays. “Luck plays in baseball, too,” he said. The two-time Cy Young Award winner gave up two home runs on his first three pitches, then faltered again late in a 6-1 loss Wednesday night that put the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers on the brink of a Fall Classic defeat. Snell allowed back-to-back homers to Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the first back-to-back leadoff homers ever in a Series game. “First pitch of the game, 97 (mph) fastball up and in, he hits it 98, it goes out,” Snell said of Schneider. Vlad, yeah, that's just a bad pitch.” “I just think they're ambushing a fastball,” he said. Snell overcame the early trouble only to give up a leadoff triple to Daulton Varsho in the fourth on a ball hit 75.6 mph. “I'm not one to make excuses or anything close to that, but that's pretty unlucky,” he said. Snell couldn't finish the seventh inning. Still, the sellout crowd of 52,175 stood to applaud. Edgardo Henriquez replaced Snell and walked Guerrero. Addison Barger, who singled and moved up on Snell's pair of wild pitches, scored on Henriquez's wild pitch, making it 4-1. He's going to come after you, he's going to challenge you,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. Snell gave up five runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings, struck out seven and walked four on 116 pitches. “I think that early on they were just on the fastball, and you got to sort of adjust if that's the case.” Snell began strongly in his first postseason with the Dodgers, who signed him to a $182 million, five-year deal last winter. Snell had an 0.86 ERA in his first three starts. In the NL Division Series, Snell allowed one hit in six shutout innings and struck out nine as the Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 to take a 2-0 series lead. He allowed one baserunner in eight shutout innings and struck out 10 while facing the minimum, something no one had done in the postseason since Don Larsen's World Series perfect game in 1956. Before that, Snell had allowed just two runs in 21 innings and struck out 27 batters. On Wednesday, Snell got no help from a stone-cold Dodgers' offense that managed just one run and four hits. Shohei Ohtani was hitless with a strikeout. Will Smith and Mookie Betts struck out twice, while Freddie Freeman had three strikeouts. Betts and Tommy Edman faltered in the first couple innings on potential ground-ball double plays, forcing Snell to work longer. “But, yeah, giving up bases and not converting outs when you have an opportunity to convert outs, that came back to bite us.”</p>
