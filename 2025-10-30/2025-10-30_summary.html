            The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on a kleptocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was removed this month as president of the Serb territory within Bosnia and Herzegovina for chipping away at the US-brokered peace deal that ended bloody ethnic violence in the Balkans in the 1990s.
    


            The waiving of sanctions on Milorad Dodik followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.
    


            Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.
    


            Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia's integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”
    


            Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump's Washington.
    


            “What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It's setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King's College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton's 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration's decision was especially dispiriting.
    


            The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.
    


            The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska's National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska's installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.
    


            Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in July 2017 for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.
    


            Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.
    


            Since Trump's return to the White House, Dodik's overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.
    


            In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”
    


            Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich's firm, signed a contract with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.
    


            Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a contract with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year's work, plus a bonus if Zell's firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.
    


            This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik's cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president, said Dodik's removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”
    


            Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, called for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”
    


            Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump's one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump's famous MAGA hats.
    


            Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”
    


            US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”
    


            “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”

U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra's recent public tirade against a Canadian political envoy over an anti-tariff advertisement shows undiplomatic behaviour, Gary Mason writes.Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press

If U.S. President Donald Trump's goal in selecting a top diplomat to station in Canada was to find someone who embodied the pure arrogance of his administration, who would give new life to the old epithet, "ugly American,” he found his man in Ambassador Pete Hoekstra.

There hasn't been an American diplomat posted here in 100 years who has been as unlikeable, as obnoxious, as egotistical as Mr. Hoekstra. He is a third-rate bully who imagines that any of us who exist outside of the U.S. are inferior – people who should be grateful for the privilege of doing trade with his country. If a non-American were to fall at his feet in gratitude for accepting their business card, Mr. Hoekstra would think this was quite justified and the way things should work.

Trump's bizarre outrage over Ontario's anti-tariff ad is a symbol of his presidency

What you need to know about Ontario's anti-tariff ad

This mentality, this world view, can be the only explanation for Mr. Hoekstra's undiplomatic behaviour in Canada.

This week, the Ambassador delivered a loud, expletive-laced tirade at a political envoy from Ontario at a business event in Ottawa, according to multiple reports. The target of his aggression was David Paterson, the province's trade representative in Washington, D.C. According to witnesses, Mr. Hoekstra was upset over an ad that Ontario ran in the U.S., which featured former president Ronald Reagan speaking in favour of free trade over protectionist tariffs.

Mr. Trump had initially responded to the ad in positive terms, saying he'd do the same if he were Ontario. But then he did a 180, saying the ad was “fake” and an attempt to influence the U.S. Supreme Court, which will be deciding the fate of his tariff program. He then threatened to impose an additional 10-per-cent tariff on Canada.

The Government of Ontario released this TV ad which was broadcasted in the U.S. that uses a recording of Ronald Reagan to argue against tariffs. The ad has angered Mr. Trump and the U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra.

Government of Ontario

Mr. Hoekstra, being the puppet that he is, decided to go up one side of Mr. Paterson and down the other over the supposedly terrible thing Ontario had done. Earlier, the Ambassador had said any trade deal won't be finalized for some time now, because “Canada burned the bridges.” 

This is madness, all of it. 

One can argue whether the ad was a good idea at a sensitive time in negotiations with the U.S. But the fact is, if it wasn't this ad, it would have been something else with Mr. Trump. Even after a deal is signed, whenever that might be, there are no guarantees the President won't rip it up in a fit of pique about some imagined offence. Canada drops its tariff on Chinese EVs? Poof. There goes our trade deal. Is this now our fate as a nation, to walk on eggshells around Mr. Trump until he's gone? To live in fear of saying or doing the wrong thing?

One thing we should definitely be doing is calling out the boorish behaviour of an American diplomat in Canada. 

Can you imagine if this was a Canadian envoy in Washington, upbraiding, in a public setting, someone from the Trump administration, or a Republican official of any kind? Mr. Trump would have that Canadian in a twin-prop and across the border the next day. They'd be persona non grata. But when an American official does it, it's a badge of honour in Trumpland. 

It was only in September that Mr. Hoekstra was saying that he couldn't understand why politicians in this country were reacting in such a hostile manner to the Trump-imposed tariffs. He warned that Canadian politicians using phrases like “trade war” were treading on “dangerous” grounds. He couldn't spare a thought for the thousands of Canadians being thrown out of jobs because of the tariffs.

‘We feel betrayed': Laid off for years, Stellantis workers in Brampton confront a grim new reality

Mr. Hoekstra has wondered aloud about how we'd feel if a U.S. group took out ads in Canada attacking a policy of our federal government. To which I say: I wonder how Americans would feel if a Canadian prime minister referred to their president as “premier” and talked about making the U.S. our 11th province?

Mr. Hoekstra isn't here as a diplomat. He is not here to nurture a relationship that's been as good as any two countries in the world have enjoyed in the last century. He doesn't care about that. He is here to lecture, berate, and tell us how great America is and how much lesser the rest of us are.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has urged Mr. Hoekstra to pick up the phone and apologize to Mr. Paterson. Even if he were inclined to, I'm sure he'd worry about what his boss would think – in Trumpland, you don't apologize for anything.

Pete Hoekstra is an embarrassment as America's representative in Canada. And the sooner he is gone, the better.

The Department of Justice is charging Congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh and five others with conspiracy to impede a U.S. law enforcement officer and impeding a U.S. law enforcement officer.

Abughazaleh is running in the Democratic primary against incumbent Rep. Jan Schakowsky. Oak Park Trustee Brian Straw and 45th Ward Democratic committeeperson Michael Rabbitt were also charged in the indictment, along with Catherine Sharp, the chief of staff to Alderman Andre Vasquez and a candidate for the Cook County Board.

The indictment was unsealed yesterday.

“I have been charged in a federal indictment sought by the Department of Justice,” Abughazaleh posted on X. “This political prosecution is an attack on all of our First Amendment rights. I'm not backing down, and we're going to win.”

Prosecutors allege that on September 26, the six people indicted were among a crowd of protesters attempting to prevent a federal agent from entering an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, Illinois.

In the Department of Justice (DOJ) press release announcing the indictments, the agency shared a link to a four-minute video which shows a large crowd of people surrounding a black vehicle, with some banging on it. Several people are at the front of the vehicle, pushing it with their hands.

The indictment states that the six indicted “and others” broke one of the vehicle's side mirrors and the rear windshield wiper, and etched “pig” into the vehicle. The video does not depict any of these actions.

At about the three-minute mark, a protester yells, “Pepper spray!” The protesters disperse, with some coughing, and the vehicle — which has a pink stuffed animal on its roof — drives through the gates.

(The Carceral Report is not sharing the video as DOJ linked to it in its press release, stating, “If you recognize other individuals in the video who may be impeding law enforcement, you are encouraged to contact the FBI Chicago Field Office.”)

Abughazaleh says they are being charged “for exercising our First Amendment rights.”

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment,” she said in a video posted to X. “This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks out against them.”

In September, the Trump administration launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” in Chicago — and were met with fierce resistance by residents.

“ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” Abughazaleh said in the video.

The Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to intimidate anyone who opposes its fascist agenda.

Just this month, administration officials made multiple threats against Democratic lawmakers.

After U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins stated that federal agents who violate state laws can be prosecuted, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom (D), Attorney General of California Rob Bonta, Pelosi, and Jenkins, stating, in part, “We urge you and other California officials to publicly abandon this apparent criminal conspiracy, to stop threatening law enforcement, and to prioritize the safety of your citizens.”

Blanche posted the letter to X, writing: “California politicians want to arrest federal agents for enforcing federal law. We just sent them a letter: Stand down or face prosecution. No one threatens our agents. No one will stop us from Making America Safe Again.”

He then shared his initial post and wrote, “Careful, @GovPritzker – this applies to you too.”

Blanche was previously President Donald Trump's personal attorney. Last year, he defended Trump in his criminal trial in New York. Trump was convicted on all 34 counts.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem made a similar threat this month. Rep. Rob Garcia (D-California) announced plans to create a website to track and document incidents of misconduct committed by ICE agents.

In response to Garcia's announcement, Noem posted on social media that the website would be “a pipeline that will funnel information on American law enforcement directly into the hands of anarchists, domestic terrorists, and cartel members.”

She continued, “I am working with @AGPamBondi to ensure that ANY individual who doxxes, threatens, or assaults our law enforcement officers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Noem has also equated filming law enforcement — which is protected by the First Amendment — with violence.

Abughazaleh closed her video with a call to action and solidarity, saying, “we have to unite and stand up for humanity, our rights and everyone terrorized by Trump's lawless secret police.”

“You'll be hearing regular updates directly from me about this case and how we can use our constitutional rights to resist authoritarianism,” she continued. “As scary as all of this is, I have spent my career fighting America's backslide into fascism. I'm not going to stop now.”

            Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after Hurricane Melissa tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.
    


            Torrential downpours and forceful winds have already unleashed widespread destruction along the storm's path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.
    


            Melissa is now headed for Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, where it won't make landfall but will bring quick-hitting bursts of strong winds and rain as soon as late Thursday afternoon.
    


            Authorities in Bermuda have closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting Bermuda's main island with St. David's Island – in preparation. All schools and ferries will also be shut on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda's national security minister, according to Reuters.
    


            The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and left widespread power outages in its wake, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands.
    


            Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.
    


            At least 30 people are known to have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.
    


            The island of Jamaica took the heaviest battering, with Hurricane Melissa making landfall there on Tuesday at its strongest – as a Category 5 storm – and estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).
    


            Alfred Hines, 77, who lives in Jamaica's Montego Bay, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes' time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”
    


            Authorities have yet to reach the worst-affected areas. So far, four bodies have been found in St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday.
    


            Three people also died during storm preparations, but the government has not provided a death toll since the hurricane battered the island on Tuesday.
    


            Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information said in a statement.
    


            Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government said.
    


            Overall, the country's infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of local government and community development.
    


            A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.
    


            Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.
    


            This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction, and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba's eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated. In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.
    


            More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.
    


            Meanwhile, the highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 23 deaths due to severe flooding and landslides. Twenty of these deaths, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.
    


            Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the Associated Press the storm killed his entire family.
    


            “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.
    


            The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was deploying £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was ﻿ready to offer immediate humanitarian aid to people in Cuba affected by the hurricane, in a post on X Thursday. On Wednesday, senior State Department officials pledged a “robust” US response to the massive storm.
    


            China's ambassador to Cuba shared a video on social media on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.

            The Kremlin's constant nuclear boasts may have finally struck a chord in the White House, with President Donald Trump ordering the resumption of US nuclear weapons tests.
    


            “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Trump wrote in a post on social media Thursday.
    


            It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system. His announcement came shortly before a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, but he indicated China had not prompted his decision, telling a reporter later Thursday that “it had to do with others.”
    


            Trump's order came just hours after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, visiting a military hospital in Moscow, dropped his latest nuclear bombshell. Sitting alongside the chief doctor and a carefully selected cast of Russian servicemen wounded on the front lines of the brutal war in Ukraine, Putin claimed that another “invincible” Russian weapon had been successfully tested.
    


            This time it was the Poseidon – an experimental nuclear-powered underwater torpedo which military analysts suggest may have a range of more than 6,000 miles (9,650 km) and which Putin revealed has now been test-launched for the first time.
    


            “The Poseidon's power significantly exceeds that of our most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile,” the Russian president told his already war-scarred audience. “It is unique in the world,” he added, while intercepting the weapon would be “impossible.”
    


            Putin mentioned, almost as an aside, that the long-anticipated and massive Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, popularly referred to as the “Satan 2,” will also soon be deployed – a low-key announcement of the arrival of what has been widely dubbed the world's deadliest nuclear weapons delivery system.
    


            It's the second time in a week that Putin has boasted of new weapons of mass destruction poised to join Russia's already formidable nuclear arsenal. The US and Russia agreed to limit their arsenals of nuclear arms under the New START treaty, which came into force in 2011. Under the agreement, both countries had seven years to meet defined limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons they can have. The treaty, however, is due to expire in February 2026.
    


            Just days before the Poseidon announcement, the Kremlin strongman announced that Russia had successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik – or Storm Petrel – claimed by its military to be capable of flying at subsonic speeds, using nuclear fuel, for virtually unlimited time and distance.
    


            Of course, there are serious technical doubts about the practicality of weapons that depend on notoriously unreliable, not to mention toxic, nuclear power. Their deployment, if it happens at all, is likely to be a long, long way off.
    


            For its part, the Kremlin sees its nuclear saber-rattling less as a direct military threat and more of a diplomatic tool: a cost-effective and immediate way of getting the US and the West at large to take notice; to give Moscow what it wants in Ukraine, and to focus minds on the potential existential threat that a provoked or denied Russia could pose.
    


            The Kremlin already feels both of those things over Ukraine: provoked most recently by the debate over whether or not to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, which would put targets in and around Russia's biggest cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg under threat; and denied by the failure of Washington to force Ukraine and its European backers to accept Moscow's maximalist terms to end the fighting in Ukraine.
    


Putin claims successful test of long-range nuclear-powered cruise missile amid diplomatic breakdown



            Certainly, the timing of the latest threats, as diplomatic progress with the United States has stalled, has been less than subtle.
    


            But for the Kremlin, the response from the White House has been unexpected.
    


            As Trump – frustrated by the Kremlin's consistent refusal to immediately end its war in Ukraine – hinted at canceling a planned Budapest summit with Putin, before imposing sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies, the Russian president made sure he was pictured overseeing what he insisted were “planned” nuclear triad drills in which long-range missiles were test-launched from land, sea and air.
    


            It was a classic bit of Kremlin nuclear saber-rattling theater, but seemed to elicit little US response.
    


            Days later, the Burevestnik cruise missile tests were announced by Putin dressed, somewhat unusually, in a military uniform. But even that was waved off by a dismissive White House.
    


            “And I don't think it's an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday, on his way to Asia for a three-stop tour that included a landmark meeting with Chinese leader Xi.
    


            “He ought to get the war ended, a war that should have taken one week is now in its fourth year, that's what he ought to do instead of testing missiles,” Trump added.
    


            But by ignoring that advice and then immediately announcing the testing of the nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo, potentially capable of wreaking radioactive destruction on entire coastal regions of the United States, the Kremlin may have inadvertently edged the White House into that decision to resume nuclear weapons tests of its own.
    


            It may be a lesson in the hazards of mixing loose talk with nuclear weapons in an increasingly volatile world. And what may have been intended by the Kremlin as a way of bolstering its arguments over Ukraine, has possibly plunged us all into new, dangerous and unpredictable era.

“It's all hands on deck and we have to fight. This is the only way,” says Leanne Betasamosake Simpson. In this episode of Movement Memos, Simpson and host Kelly Hayes discuss lessons from Simpson's book Theory of Water: Nishnaabe Maps to the Times Ahead and the ongoing struggle against ICE in Chicago, where Hayes is involved in rapid response efforts.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today we're talking about what it takes to stay human and protect each other in fascistic times — how we build networks of care, defend our neighbors, grieve, and make space for joy. We'll be hearing from Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, a renowned Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg musician, writer, and academic. Leanne is the author of eight books and a member of Alderville First Nation. We'll be exploring lessons from her most recent book, Theory of Water, and the letter she contributed to our new book, Read This When Things Fall Apart: Letters to Activists in Crisis.

Leanne is also a dear friend of mine, and this conversation was very important to me. We spoke on an afternoon when my neighborhood was being hit hard by ICE, and our exchange weaved together her reflections on world-building and natural processes (like sintering) with my experiences on the ground in Chicago — resisting the violence that ICE is inflicting on our communities.

It's an urgent conversation about water as a relative and teacher, and about surviving, organizing, and staying connected through the violence and uncertainty of fascistic times.

KH: Leanne, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Leanne Betasamosake Simpson: Thank you so much for having me, Kelly. Hi.

KH: How are you doing today, friend?

LBS: I am a little bit tired and a little bit overwhelmed, but I'm also at a really amazing gathering of Indigenous, Pacific Islanders, South Sea Islanders, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Ngunnawal country in Australia. And so I am actually spending my days surrounded by care, so that's pretty awesome. So I'm grateful for that.

KH: I am so happy to hear that. I could use a little of that energy myself right now. It's been a rough day here in Chicago. ICE has been hitting my neighborhood and the surrounding area pretty hard. A lot of us have been out all morning and afternoon on ICE patrol. I took a break to come home and talk with you, and I am really grateful to have this moment of connection, across borders and other artificial divides, amid everything that's happening.

So, I know some of our listeners are definitely fans of your work, and may remember our previous conversations, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and the work you do?

LBS: Sure. My name is Leanne Betasamosake Simpson. I'm a status Indian and member of Alderville First Nation. I am Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg, which is the Eastern Ojibwe, and our homeland is the north shore of Lake Ontario, sort of between Toronto and Ottawa in Canada. I started out as an academic, but I quit a tenure-track position over 20 years ago now to base my life and my writing and my thinking and my practice in community. So I'm a writer, I am a musician, and I work for the Dechinta Center for Research and Learning, which is an Indigenous-led, land-based post-secondary education program in the northern part of Canada.

KH: Some of my listeners may remember my experience with visiting Dechinta and getting to experience just a snapshot of the curriculum that you all bring to folks, and I hope folks who missed that episode will check it out because it really was a life-changing experience for me, and I'm deeply moved by the work that you all do. Your most recent book, Theory of Water, began with poetry and song and the observation of ice. Can you talk about why you wrote this book and how it evolved?

LBS: Yeah. I think that one of the things that's disappearing in my homeland is ice and snow as a result of this climate change that's being driven by racial capitalism and colonialism. And so I wanted to spend time thinking alongside ice and snow. I had the opportunity when I was working with Dechinta to spend about a month in the spring beside a lake while it was melting and witnessing this incredible transformation from a frozen snowy world to this amazing liquid gathering space where species from all different worlds, from the land, from the water, from the sky were meeting. And then I also had the same sort of reverse experience in the fall of being beside a lake while it was freezing up. And this magnificent transformation is happening in lakes and in rivers all over the northern part of the hemisphere every year. The sounds were incredible, the knowledge was incredible, and that sort of experience became the basis for the record Theory of Ice. And that's an interesting starting point for a book for me, but writing the lyrics to that record and then performing it and rehearsing it and playing it for different audiences over time was a way of thinking deeply about ice as a relative, ice as a teacher.

And I really, really loved that. So that was the first seed of Theory of Water. The second seed came in writing letters back and forth to the very, very brilliant Robyn Maynard in Rehearsals for Living. And in that book we were pen pals, we were dorky, nerdy pen pals writing through the pandemic, talking about the different communities that we were from, how our movements were linked, how they were different. And in that final chapter, Robyn was sort of prompting me to think outside of the conversations and the letters that we were writing between a Black feminist and an Indigenous feminist and to sort of think in a more worldly way: how could we connect this to other places in other movements? And in my final letter, I started to think with water, because water for me became this connector to all of the living things that I share time and space with on the planet.

It connects me to every single other living thing on the planet. And we all have experience with water. We all start in water in our parents. It's where we learn what it feels like to be safe. Different cultures, different groups of people, different communities have different experiences with water. And so water then became this invitation, I think. I need Black feminists to teach me about the Middle Passage. I need Pacific Islanders to teach me about the Pacific Ocean. I need people in the far north to teach me about glaciers. I need people who live in the desert to teach me what it's like to have limited amounts of water. I need Palestinians in Gaza to teach me about what it means to have water weaponized in this moment. I need people in Detroit to teach me what it's like to suffer health consequences because the water coming from your taps is not safe.

And so that was another, I think, seed—was this invitation for myself to sort of articulate what I was learning from snow and ice and water, but also to write the book in a way that I'm in no way the authority on it, not even for an Nishnaabeg people, but to write it in a way that it was an invitation. And then I think the third seed is that I had this tremendous experience of working with an elder Doug Williams from Curb Lake for over 20, 25 years. He was a tremendous impact on me. He was hilarious. We were great friends. We did tons of stuff on the land with my kids and he had passed away. So I'm also in the book, there's a thread of me, not confronting grief, but processing grief, processing this idea that this anchor in my life, somebody that I would've gone to ask questions to make sure that I'm on the right track to talk about politics and ethics is now in the spirit world.

And so I'm wondering if I can still learn things without having this mentor? I'm wondering if I can learn things directly from the land with the skills that he has passed on to me. And I think I'm also, I think the grief is maybe just bigger than just one person. I think for Indigenous people, when we lose an elder, we're losing kind of a body of knowledge as well. We're losing sometimes people who are closer to knowing what life was like before the violence of colonialism. But also I think this present moment that we're in is one where I find… grief is always right there, this intensification of genocide in Gaza and in Palestine and Sudan and Congo, what's going on and in Chicagoland, all of these sort of things, linked crises that seem to be coming on a daily hourly basis for me has been also an acknowledgement that there's some grief in being here again and seeing sort of all the work of elder activists and organizers being undone so quickly in the present moment. So I think that that thread of grief is also, or that seed of grief is also in the book as well. 

KH: So much of what you're saying really resonates with me. I've been thinking about how I often walk to Lake Michigan — it's about a twenty-minute walk from my apartment — and no matter what's happening in my life or in the city, I feel this deep connection to that timeless, living relative. It's not just comforting; it's a sense of continuum, of being bonded to something larger, of feeling its movement in relation to how I move, even how the water inside me moves. It's also a place where I feel a sense of connection to my father, who is no longer with us, but who loved the water, and had a deep bond with the natural world that he shared with me. My father was taken from the reservation and adopted by white people, like a lot of young children in that era, but he always had a deep sense of connection to the land and water, and I still feel connected to him when I'm close to the water, or when I'm in the wilderness.

As I was reading your book, I found myself really thinking about my own sense of connection to water, and what it means to me, as a life force, and ancestrally, as a kind of bond to people who are no longer in this world. I also thought about the struggles for water that I've been a part of, including Standing Rock, where we said, “Water is life.” And in this particular moment, I've found the ideas you write about so helpful in reminding me to slow down and really reflect on these natural processes, these ways we relate to the land.

Here in Chicago, we're living in a state of emergency right now, as are so many people across the world. But when that emergency is hyperlocal, when there's a constant sense of alarm, it's easy to lose touch with that slower rhythm, that chance to learn from the world around us.

As someone who sometimes has to forcibly take my nervous system out of “go mode” — I'm always learning and relearning how to come back to a place where I can access all the parts of my heart and mind that can feel and process those lessons. Your book has been such an important resource for me in remembering how to do that — and in exploring what that journey can open up for us.

Early in the book, you talk about a moment when you were listening to Robin D.G. Kelley talk about Antonio Gramsci's work, and in response to what you were hearing, you wrote down, “This is where we are. We don't need to be defensive about anti-fascism, but active, engaged and on the offensive.” Can you talk about this moment of realization and what you were recognizing when you wrote those words down?

LBS: I think I was recognizing that world making is struggle and that in the moment that we're in, our ancestors, whether they're Indigenous or Black or people of color or people that were organizing throughout history, for something, for justice, for a better world, world making is a struggle. It's something that you have to fight for. It's not like the colonial governments, it's not like fascist governments are going to say, okay, you guys, you're right. We made a mistake. This is a world that you want to live in. We have to build that world, we have to make that world and that work is struggle. It's very, very, very, very difficult, but it's necessary work. It's work that I feel like I have to be involved in somehow in order to be able to live with myself and to be living and breathing in a way that is aligned with my own values.

And so when I heard those words, and this would've been during the pandemic on a skidoo in my local city grooming the ski trail, I remember stopping and sort of making a note on my phone. And it's not that I hadn't heard that before, but it just resonated. It just landed in this way where it seemed clear to me what was coming. And it seemed like it was a fight and that a lot of people around me weren't recognizing or seeing that it was going to be a fight. It was going to be the fight of our lives in a lot of ways, I think. And this sort of feeling frozen or not knowing what to do or feeling overwhelmed or feeling all of the feelings that I think are normal when you're facing fascism are fine and probably healthy, but that's not going to get us where we need to go.

We have to fight and fight can look different for different people because we all have different gifts. We are parts of different communities, we have different tolerances for risk, we have different responsibilities. So it doesn't look like one thing, but it does mean that I think we have a responsibility to be engaged and present and working towards making the lives of our neighbors and our friends and our families, our students slightly better. So I think that, I don't know, it's not groundbreaking, but it was the way I think that Robin's words landed on me in that moment where I was like, this is serious. And it's all hands on deck and we have to fight. This is the only way.

KH: I really identify with this feeling that you can see what's coming, when a lot of people around you aren't ready, or don't recognize the scale of the threat, or are just freezing up in the face of it. I feel like I have had a sense of what we were barreling towards, politically, for quite some time. I didn't have a blueprint of the specifics — beyond the blueprints right-wing think tanks have actually drawn up, that reflect their intentions — but the direction has been clear for some time. I think that awareness is embedded in Let This Radicalize You, which is a book that I think a lot of people are turning to, during this time, because people who weren't ready for certain conversations and confrontations a few years ago feel the urgency now. And I am grateful that those people are coming to that sense of urgency, and I really hope that more people will break the cycle of passive reaction around what's happening, and figure out what it's in their power to do in this moment. As you say, that's going to look different for everyone. 

But right now, I see a lot of people whose political energy is being captured and held captive behind screens on social media. Everything is a reaction. Everything is a fleeting expression in a digital space, if it's expressed at all. And that's not going to save us. It's better than being in denial, but not by much, because when our political expression remains bundled up in social media posts, and finds no other active expression, it's a form of capture. We need a jailbreak from that containment. We all need to find our roles in active resistance. 

Not everyone can be on a frontline. I recently wrote a piece that included the story of a disabled woman who ran communications during a day of critical mobilization against ICE in my area. That person was essential. My own actions that day were tied to theirs, and guided by them. And that's how it should be — we should be working in concert, with everyone bringing whatever they can to the table.

And on the subject of how we come together, can you talk about sintering, and your fascination with this process? What is sintering, and what can we, as people struggling to make change, learn from it?

LBS: Sintering is something that snowflakes do. So snowflakes start out as a piece of dust in the sky world. They fall through the atmosphere and attract water droplets that freeze and accrete and build these sort of crystallized forms of snowflakes. So snowflakes are travelers, they're moving through different worlds. They start in the sky world, they attract a water world, and then eventually they land on the earth. So they're sort of like a falling shore. And I became really interested in these areas of overlap in the book because Anishinabe homelands weren't demarcated by borders, but by these zones of overlap where we would have to put more presence and more energy, more ceremony, more diplomacy into these sorts of areas that we were sharing with the Haudenosaunee or with the Wendat. And so that sort of sets out a really different way of organizing life. When you think of sitting on the shore of the lake in Chicago, you become very aware that you're sharing space with birds and fish and insects and humans and all different kinds of life in that moment.

And it's important to figure out how to weave ourselves into the ecosystems that we are a part of in a way that doesn't destroy ourselves and in a way that doesn't destroy the other living things that we are in network with. So I think when that snowflake created in the sky world becomes the shore with the water world and then falls to the land, the first thing that it does is it physically sinters or rounds the edges to bond with its neighboring snowflakes. It finds a way of knitting or weaving itself into its new environment. It finds a way of belonging. And when snow sinters, as people who live in places where you have to shovel snow, it lands from the sky and it's often fluffy. And if you wait and don't shovel your sidewalk right away the next day you've got a harder job because the snow has sintered, it's become saggier, it's bonded to each other, it's heavier, and it has a staying power on trails and pathways in the spring much longer than the unpacked snow.

So sintering became a way of thinking about how we belong to the places that we find ourselves in. And I think there's lots of organizers and lots of communities, lots of people that are very good at sintering already. But it was interesting to me to be thinking about snow as this relative and as this kind of provocateur that I live with that's endangered a little bit right now because of climate change, wondering what I could learn about the embodied practice of this part of the water cycle that's going on around me all the time that I may not be attentive to. Because in contemporary modern life, it's easy to not spend time at the shore. It's easy to not think about snowflakes. It's easy just to turn on the faucet and hope that you're drinking clean water for many of us. So I wanted to think about sintering as a practice that is coming from the land that I'm a part of, think of it as a teaching, think of it as a practice thinking of how I take care of the ones that are around me in a way that doesn't destroy them and in a way that doesn't destroy me so that we can build stronger networks.

And so I see what you're doing, what you've done today, this morning before you came as a practice of sintering as well, the ICE patrol, the mutual aid networks that have become so important. These are all kinds of systems of care. And I think ultimately that's what Indigenous governance and indigenous politics is about. That's the big difference. These are just systems of taking care of people and land and plants and animals and water. 

KH: I love what you're saying about ICE patrol as a kind of sintering, because what you said about how snow is so much harder to move once the snowflakes have had time to bond themselves together — that really connects with what we are experiencing here in Chicago. The more time we spend with our neighbors, the more we learn from each other, the more we see each other showing up in the streets, and trust each other — when we gesture toward the whistles around our necks — the stronger we become, and the harder we are to move. ICE agents have terrorized our communities. They have tear gassed neighborhood after neighborhood, but people are becoming more bonded to each other in the face of that threat, and showing collective courage in the streets. We are learning how to resist ICE, while also trying to protect the privacy and dignity of our neighbors, and to keep everyone as safe as possible, while also taking the risks that we sometimes feel called to take, out of love and solidarity. And when people do take those risks, and experience harm, our connections facilitate care in that context.

I'm also thinking about our connection to snow, as it gets colder in Chicago, because I think the reality of what this moment demands of us might feel a little intimidating to some of us, in terms of patrolling and holding our ground in the cold. And I hope it helps folks to think about sintering, and how we can be like snowflakes, during this Chicago winter — bonded to each other, and much harder to move.

In Theory of Water, you write: “The land and the waters, the universe, hold all the knowledge we need to make other worlds. World building is difficult global work. It is sacrifice, both collective and individual. It requires difference and diversity. There is no centre or centring in the creation and maintenance of a network.” Can you elaborate on this? 

LBS: So I think that I started to think within Nishnaabeg thought about how we make worlds. And I think the first thing that I realized is that we don't have to make a world, the world, the planet already exists. Our job is to fit into the ecosystems in a way that doesn't destroy the planet. And that's very tricky for capitalists and fascists. They're not very good at that, but I think lots of different cultures were and are good at that. So the first part of it is recognizing that we are not building a planet, we're just figuring out how to live with the cycles and the ecosystems that already exist. And I think that the way that the planet functions ecologically has a lot of knowledge for how to live. And so sintering would be an example of that. It's also within Nishnaabeg thought, if I think of my homeland, I don't think of my homeland as this state or country that has a fence around it that I guard. 

It's a series of relationships with plants, with animals, with humans, with water, with air, with the land, with beings that are very, very different from myself. I'm very different than beavers or than bears or than moose or than wild rice. But I have to foster and nurture and maintain a relationship across that difference because we're sharing time and space. And so I started to think of the planet in a deeply relational way that is a network. And so, Nishnaabeg homelands are not the center of the network. We're just a part of the network. Leanne isn't the center of the network. My body is just a hub made up of different relationships. And because the planet is very diverse, people in all different kinds of geographies and cultures hold particular kinds of knowledge that I think benefit us all in terms of figuring out the diverse ways that we can knit or weave ourselves into the planet in a way that brings forth more life. And so this is, I think, similar to what abolitionists, Black feminists… there's lots of different ways into this same sort of thinking.

Ruth Wilson Gilmore has a saying, that we have to change everything, which is very much true because I think that the societies that have colonized us, or that are holding us in the forms that we're in right now, have not knit themselves into the ecosystems that they're a part of. They've extracted resources out of those relatives and out of those ecosystems for the benefit of a very few rich white men. And so it seemed like, again, an invitation to bring diverse experiences, diverse thinking, diverse knowledge systems to together towards this enormous task of making worlds that don't destroy the planet.

KH: I love this idea of trying to weave or knit ourselves into the world that is, rather than trying to invent something altogether separate — as though our reality is wholly defined by us or exists in a vacuum. This mentality of separateness, as you're saying, is the mentality of billionaires and fascists, which is really tied to the billionaire drive to colonize space — the way Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos imagine that we can just transplant the experience of being human anywhere, rather than reckoning with the countless relationships between ourselves and the creatures and elements of the natural world that make our existence possible. They only understand that webwork of relationships as a site of extraction.

I think the wisdom you're sharing here is especially important for organizers who want to exist in opposition to that extractive mentality of separateness — because we always need to consider how life is already happening, what relationships make it possible, and how we can weave ourselves and our visions into that fabric, rather than trying to project our vision over those realities.

I know you have a sense of what we're up against here in Chicago right now, because I was lucky enough to spend some time with you when you were in the city recently for a book event. I was actually late for dinner after your event because an organizing meeting ran long, and it was the end of a very long day — but I made it, and I was so happy to see you. During that dinner, you heard from me and some of our friends here about what's been happening — the raids, the random kidnappings, the tear gas, thousands of people across Chicagoland being disappeared — and the seemingly recreational violence of federal agents, as our bodies and communities are used as props and stages for the production of fascist propaganda.

I'm wondering if you have any Nishnaabeg wisdom to offer to people who are trying to hold the line in their communities right now — here in Chicago, and in other cities being subjected to the Trump administration's fascist violence?

LBS: I think that my Nishnaabeg culture and ethics has taught me to think very carefully about going into other communities. And so it's weird when you're doing book launches because you're supposed to be promoting the book and you're supposed to be engaged in conversation with somebody else towards promoting the book. But I think what my Nishnaabeg culture says is the first thing is to be very attuned to the audience and to the community that you've been invited into. And so I thought I went, actually, I thought of you, Kelly, and I went when I got to Chicago to walk along the lake, to ground myself and to think about what was happening in Chicagoland and to think about the kind of environment that I wanted to create in the so-called talk, like what does this audience need in this moment? And it became really clear to me that that audience in that moment did not need an academic yelling at them about fascism, but needed me to have a calm voice, needed me to speak slowly, needed me to share the parts of the book that were beautiful and lovely, and that would allow a little bit of space for them to maybe take a breath and maybe relax and maybe we could center sort of together.

So I spent a long time with this book, particularly going into the U.S. thinking about which passages to share, how to share them. I thought a lot about my voice because voice sound is an instrument and it goes inside people. And so people who are stressed and who are fighting very hard, I think in that moment when they're giving an hour of their very precious time to come and listen to you, might need something specific. So I think that that was the first thing is being very present, for me, and doing a lot of listening to what people were experiencing and the ways that they were organizing. I think that the second thing that was, I think, important was to just see the light that you all were embodying in those moments.

When you're on ICE patrol, when you are taking care of your comrades that have experienced that recreational violence where just acknowledging the energy, the strength, the courage, the sheer number of hours it takes to be able to do what you're doing with very few resources and not enough people. So I think being able to see the sacrifice, the exhaustion, the overwhelm, the anxiety, all of those things, but also seeing that that wasn't stopping people, you all were at the meeting for hours and hours and hours. You weren't at home doing self-care that day. So you have this ability to push through and to meet that moment. And so I think that being able to see that light, being able to see what collectively you were doing in the face of this enormous fascist violence made me think that my ancestors would be very, very proud of the work that you were doing and the work that you are doing, that you are the ones that are leading the way that you are doing the hard work of world building because not only are you confronting this violence, but you're embodying the alternative through your practices of care, through your practices of mutual aid.

And so I think that… I am stumbling right now because I saw you guys as warriors, but I think that word is kind of contaminated with kind of bro heteropatriarchy mentality. But I think that's what I saw. I saw these people who are leading the way who are actually generating the knowledge and the skills that we all need in this moment. And so I just had a tremendous amount of Nishnaabeg respect and I had just a huge sense of pride. I felt very strongly that my ancestors, that our ancestors would be very, very proud of the actions and the embodied politics that you collectively were doing in this moment.

KH: Thank you. That really means more than I can say. I'm deeply honored to be in community with the folks who keep showing up and doing everything they can to defend their neighbors and look out for each other. And it means so much to hear you say that your ancestors, and our ancestors, would be proud of this work.

I think ICE patrol doesn't appeal to some people because it can be very uneventful. When we do our school patrols, for example, I've never seen anything happen other than parents picking up their children — and that's a good day. We're there in case ICE shows up, and we hope they don't. It's a task where there isn't necessarily any experience of direct confrontation with what you're opposed to, and there's usually no spectacle or visibility involved. You have to be able to put aside your ego, or any need for gratification, and actually feel heartened if it's a dull morning or afternoon.

Then you have days like today, when we're patrolling the neighborhood, and the alerts are coming in constantly, and we can't keep track of how many people have been kidnapped. There was a moment this afternoon when one of our ICE watchers was in trouble, and I rushed to their location. I wasn't far away, but by the time I got there, they were gone. I found their car in an alley, abandoned, with the keys still inside. Some people nearby, who had seen what happened, told us that ICE had taken that volunteer.

And that's also a reality of this work. Sometimes ICE gets tired of being watched. Sometimes they get angry about our vigilance and the ways it interferes with their violence — and they try to give us a black eye, whether that means arresting a person who's filming or observing them, or throwing a tear gas canister at people on a residential street. It's a lot. 

So, that uncertainty, that probability of just walking, or riding your bike, or driving, and observing, and also, the possibility of real danger — I think it's hard for some people to connect with that. But there are ways of reducing risk, and that's not to say that anyone who has been harmed or arrested has done anything wrong. But we do find that people are more likely to be arrested when they're alone, and that maintaining a distance of 10 feet between ourselves and federal agents is helpful, so there are some safety practices that can help mitigate some of the risks people face while ICE watching. And people should know that. It's not a risk-free activity, but people who get trained up are definitely better positioned to make informed, autonomous choices about how to engage with risk. 

I have actually been trained multiple times, because ICE tactics are evolving, and I am always interested in what new people, who are just now joining the fray, are being told about how to engage with the situation right now, because right now is different than six months ago, or even six weeks ago.

I also want to say how proud I am of the people who built the training templates and the infrastructure for this work in Chicago. I am not one of those people. I am a student of that work, and a participant. The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Organized Communities Against Deportations, and groups like PUÑO, in Pilsen, and Protect Rogers Park, in my area, have been developing best practices around ICE watch since the first Trump administration. That work is grounded in the traditions of cop watching, which is a legacy of the Black Panther Party. 

And yeah, I am really proud of all of the work people have done, and that people are doing — and all of the care that work entails. Whether that's figuring out how to find and help people who've been arrested, how to support the families of people who've been detained, or how to comfort each other. I have a friend who's a street medic who was still coughing the last time I saw them, because earlier that day, when they heard people were being tear gassed, they ran toward the scene to help people. When there's tear gas in the street, the self-preserving thing to do is to get the hell away from there, but this person had skills they knew were needed at the scene, so they moved toward the threat, instead of away from it. And I think that's the spirit a lot of people in Chicago are moving with right now — a spirit I hope people in other cities, who are preparing for similar conditions, can internalize. It's something I'm proud of in our communities, and yeah… I'm honored to hear that you're proud of it too.

[musical transition]

KH: I would love to talk a bit about Read This When Things Fall Apart: Letters to Activists in Crisis. I was so grateful for your contribution to this book, which is really a care package for activists and organizers who are struggling in these times — and really, who the hell isn't? Your letter deals with a very serious topic, and a really difficult one. In fact, as I raise the topic on this show, I am cognizant of how hard it can be to engage with, and I want to caution our listeners that we are about to talk about supporting people who have experienced sexual assault — so please take care of yourselves as you listen. You wrote a letter to an activist or organizer who has been assaulted. This is a letter that I know we all wish weren't needed, because we are striving to create spaces where people are keeping each other safer, and where bodily autonomy is respected, and yet, we know that our good intentions do not exempt us from experiencing or encountering harms that are replicated across our societies. We know that sexual violence occurs in our movements, and that it is a horribly destructive force. Can you talk about why you chose to write a letter to an activist who has been assaulted, and what you want people in that situation to understand?

LBS: Yes. Well, thank you for asking me about my letter and thank you also for putting together this phenomenal book. You gave me a copy when I was in Chicago, and it's just so precious and I think it's going to be really, really important for all of us in the times that we're living in. My letter comes from an experience that I had of being sexually assaulted two years ago, again, in a situation where it was I guess very unexpected. And I think because I've done a lot of work supporting students who are disclosing in my classrooms, I've taught a lot about how to make safer spaces, whether that's in classrooms or in our Indigenous communities. I've done a lot of research, I've read a lot of books, I'm old. I wasn't expecting this to happen to me, and it undid me. I froze in the moment. It took me almost 12 hours to even realize what had happened.

I fell apart. And the lucky part of it, I think for me, is that I had enough privilege in my life at this stage of my life where I was able to get into a crisis counselor right away, and I was able to work with her on a weekly basis for three months. I was shocked. I don't even know why I was shocked, but I was shocked that it had happened to me. It was hard for me to believe that it had happened to me. I was shocked at how much it undid me for so long. And I think on the spectrum of sexual assault, it was on the sort of inappropriate touching end of things, and it undid me. And so when you asked me to write a letter, the first thing that I thought of was, I'm not writing this letter. 

This is something that is too close to me. It's too personal, it's too intimate. It makes me feel gross and shameful, although I know it's not my shame. But then over time I kept thinking about this. I kept thinking about how sexual and gender violence is ubiquitous in our societies, how it's a tool of fascism, how it's been a tool of colonialism, how it's a tool of heteropatriarchy, how it's designed to bring our families down. It's designed to contaminate our intimate relationships. And I also thought of my privilege and how lucky I was to be able to, for the first time in my life, I think, feel my feelings and go through the process of healing with support because frankly, most people, particularly Indigenous people, don't have that privilege. And so I decided to write the letter and it was really, really, really difficult because I don't know, I felt like I didn't want to make any mistakes.

I didn't want to make things worse for people. The idea of me just sharing this story and writing this letter felt like I was opening myself up to more vulnerabilities. But I think it was one of those things that was incredibly important to me because of the person that I want to be and how I want to live in the world. And I was really grateful to do it actually with… I couldn't think have done it with anybody but you, Kelly, because I knew a couple of things. I knew that the book would be the perfect container for this letter. I knew that I trusted you. I knew that you would be careful and attentive in the editing process, and I knew that you wouldn't let me say anything that was going to cause more harm to other people. So I think that I was also in this situation with you where the container that you set up enabled me to be able to write this, which is also I think a kind of privilege.

And so the letter that I wrote was really, kind of to myself in that moment, in those first few hours after where I couldn't believe myself, where I couldn't believe that this was happening where I somehow I didn't even realize. But I somehow thought that because I knew all about sexualized violence and sexual assault, that it wasn't going to happen to me. This realization that despite our best efforts, we can't protect ourselves from this because it's so ubiquitous. And so my hope was that in writing this letter sort of to myself in those moments, that it would resonate to other people who were living through this and also open up an opportunity to continue the conversation around it.

KH: Well, I'm really honored that you felt this project was the right place, and a safe place, to lean into that vulnerability. I'm honored by your trust, and by your friendship. And what you're saying about being aware of a threat, and thinking so deeply about it, and caring for and worrying about other people, but still moving through the world as though this thing won't happen to you — it resonates in a profound way. There are things we can't protect ourselves from, and most of us don't move through the world fully reconciled to those realities, because it's just too much. But I am so glad that, through this letter, to some unknown friend or co-struggler you haven't met yet, you were able to reach back through time, and talk to the Leanne who didn't believe themself yet. I hope that was healing for you, and I believe it will be healing for people who turn to that page in the book because they are trying to process a similar experience. It's a beautiful intervention, and I think it's going to be really important to people.

I can also really relate to your hesitancy. I remember when I was working on Let This Radicalize You with Mariame Kaba, and she suggested that I tell a particular story in that book — and I immediately said no. It was a story about a time when I felt like I was done with movement work, when I wanted to walk away, and I was adamant that I didn't want to tell that story.

But that story is in this book, because this project felt different. I think part of that is the format — the fact that this book is a bundle of letters. I felt a sense of freedom around what did and didn't have to be said. I knew I could tell the parts of that story that felt important, and leave some things out, and that the letter would still be what it needed to be. Because the details of how I wound up in that particular mindset aren't the point, and they're also not unique to that moment in any way. The point is how I found my way back, and how I fell in love with people and the world again — and I was grateful to share that aspect of things with people.

And I also knew I wouldn't have to fight with an editor about what was or wasn't included, because the editor was me. I knew I could shape what I wanted to share, with an eye towards being helpful, as a very personal communication.

I'm so glad you felt that way, too — and about something so personal. I'm sure people will be helped by it.

And I'm also grateful for Rehearsals for Living, which was a huge source of inspiration for Read This When Things Fall Apart. The way you and Robyn took so many important ideas and so much deep analysis of an apocalyptic moment and wove them into a heartfelt exchange between two people who were really reaching for each other — in the way I think we all need to be reaching for each other — I think that spirit lives in this project, too. If books have a family tree, I think this one is definitely related to Rehearsals.

LBS: And I think that you've done something really brilliant in the editorial approach with your book in that I felt like my self-determination was really respected and really honored. And I think that it comes from the letter writing as a format, but also it came from some of the editorial decisions that you made so that I didn't feel the pressure to add in more details or to tell this backstory or to say things that I wasn't comfortable saying, sort of like what you just said about your letter. And I think that that has created a book where, because you don't give all of the context in the letters that when I'm reading through it, I insert my own situation into wanting to leave an organization or wanting to leave a movement or leaving a movement. And that I think then becomes a container of space where I can engage with the letters in a deeply personal way.

And so I think that there's something that you've achieved here for all of us through this little weird book. And as much as it is weird, it's also brilliant in the sort of ethics and the decisions that you made editorially and in putting this project together. And I think that that will also sort of be a living legacy for all of us who publish things. That there is… If you care deeply for your writers and you respect their self-determination and you sort of deviate a little bit from standard editorial practices, I think that what you generate becomes really powerful in a way that I sort of standard books and standing standard publishing practices can't create.

KH: I am so touched and honored to hear that, I think I'm gonna cry. I am really grateful to everyone who engaged with this process, including all of our writers, and Sophia Hussain, at AK Press. As Mariame says, “Everything worthwhile is done with other people,” and this book is a reflection of that. And I am grateful to have the web of relationships that made this book possible.

[musical interlude]

Most of us wrote our letters for Read This When Things Fall Apart months before Donald Trump was reelected. I think many of us understood the political trajectory we were on, at that time, but so much has happened since then. You don't live in the United States, but unfortunately, the impacts of this administration are global, as is the march of fascism. In my conversations with people who contributed to the book, I have been asking, if you were writing another letter for the book today, what would you want to communicate to an activist in crisis, right now?

LBS: I think one of the things that I would want to write as someone who's not living in the U.S. is sort of a, hey guys, we need to be paying attention to how quickly things can change, how quickly fascists can seize power, how organized they already are in the places that we are living outside of the U.S., and how quickly the tables can turn. This sort of fascist violence, even if it's not in power in the particular states that we're living in, is bubbling under the surface. And so one of the gifts I think of the organizers and activists right now in Chicago is you are generating the knowledge that not only you guys need in its moment, but in you're generating the knowledge and the skills and demonstrating what we need to be doing now for what's coming. So I think that would be one of the letters that I would want to write from sort of witnessing the work that you guys are doing.

Another letter that I think I would want to write is just, again, in witnessing what you guys are doing, is how to show up for your community even though you're tired, even though you don't feel well, even though you're riddled with anxiety, even though you need a self-care day. Because I see, I think I got a little bit of a sense at our dinner of how exhausted people who are on the front lines on ICE patrol are, how few of us there are, how we need much bigger systems of care and support. But I also sort of see you guys showing up anyway and there's a certain set of skills that I think organizers and activists develop in order to be able to show up even though they're not feeling like a hundred percent. So I think that would be actually, that's a letter I would like to read. I don't know if I can write that one, but that would be a letter I would like to read.

KH: I think that's a letter we'd all like to read. And on that note, I want to say something to everyone who's deeply exhausted and overworked right now. I think one of the keys to surviving and sustaining ourselves in these times is remembering that the heightened state we get into — that state of agitation, of stress, of constantly feeling like the other shoe is about to drop — we can't live indefinitely in that physical and psychological condition.

So we have to very deliberately create space to feel something else. Recently, I was out in the woods with some of my fellow organizers, just on a brief excursion — an opportunity to reset my senses, to reset my nervous system a little. To be someplace where the dirt smells different than it does in my neighborhood, because there's more life in it. To be surrounded by the changing colors of the season. To breathe in all of that complexity and remember that all of that is a part of me too — that all of it nourishes me, and that we have these places to come back to, to remember all the parts of ourselves.

And that means remembering the parts of us that need laughter. It means making time for joy. Today, for me, it meant taking a break from my work in the streets to have this wonderful conversation with you, Leanne — one I'm so much better for having, even though it's hard to step away from the work in front of us sometimes. Because we have to remember the other things that matter, alongside the emergencies. The things that still have to happen — for our own sakes, and for each other's. The rhythm of the struggle can feel like a constant, rapid drumbeat, but our own rhythm, as individuals, has to slow down sometimes. And that's okay, because we're not alone in this. We are not responsible for carrying everything. Nothing stopped happening because I came home for an hour, and when I go back out, someone else will go home. This is how we endure, together.

And please, don't stop having fun. I know that word might sound strange amid everything that's happening. But we still need to laugh and sing and dance. At the end of this month — on the day this episode will air, I think — Maya Schenwar and I are hosting a gathering called Struggle Hour. It's something we've done before. It's like a happy hour for disgruntled activists and organizers. It's a place to experience fellowship and catch up with people. This one's Struggle Hour: Halloween Edition, so local activists will be coming by, some will be in costume. We'll eat pizza, have a drink or two, and maybe do some karaoke. And it does honestly feel absurd to me to be planning something like this right now — and also completely necessary.

Because we can't lose those parts of ourselves that need to be silly, that need to laugh, that need to sing together. We need that, too. So I hope everyone who's dealing with this kind of strain right now is making some space — to smell the dirt, to see the colors changing in the trees, maybe to have some pizza and a drink, or wear a Halloween costume. Whatever it is, make some space for everything that's human about us. We need the wholeness of ourselves intact. We can't starve those parts of ourselves right now. So please, whatever nourishes you, ask yourself if you are getting enough of it, and if not, what you can do about that.

As we wrap up today, Leanne, is there anything else you'd like to share with, or ask of, the audience right now?

LBS: I have a new record that's coming out on October 24, so very soon it will be on all the streaming platforms. There's a lot of struggle in the record. There's a lot of politics in the record. I hope it's the kind of thing that the organizers can put on at Struggle Hour in your Halloween costumes and find some joy and some fun, because I really agree with you, Kelly, that's the fuel that's going to keep our fights and our movements going. We have a long road ahead and we're going to have to find ways of making space for that joy. The record is called Live Like the Sky. It's called Live Like the Sky because our ancestors live in the sky world and there's a lot of good ways of living that are embodied there.

KH: Well, I am so excited to hear the album, and I am so grateful to you for making time to talk with me today, Leanne, it's always so good to think alongside you and to get to spend some time with you. And I am sure our listeners are going to benefit from your insights as well.

LBS: Miigwech for the visit, Kelly, it is a really beautiful way to begin my day here. Thank you.

Group of 11 Democratic senators has raised concerns about use of Wrap full-body restraints on US deportation flights

A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

“I think it's very problematic,” Van Hollen told the Associated Press. “They want to keep the public in the dark.”

The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people – sometimes for hours – on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and six others.

The Wrap is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the Wrap's use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

“When an organization like DHS doesn't want transparency, it's because they don't want people to know what they're doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.

In addition to the letter, Representative Delia Ramirez told AP in a statement that she was working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the Wrap.

“ICE's use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.

The DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the Wrap. The DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, previously said that ICE's practices “align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards”.

The AP found that the DHS has paid the manufacturer of the Wrap, Safe Restraints Inc, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the Wrap despite multiple requests, and it is not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE's use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the US used the Wrap and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

“The brutal, inhumane tactics of ICE continue to jeopardize people's lives across the country,” Ramirez said. “ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability. That can't go on.”

Outcome appears closer to truce than durable peace but outline of broader diplomatic relationship is visible

Five key takeaways from Trump-Xi meeting

When Donald Trump launched his trade war against China in April, threatening tariffs as high as 145%, the Chinese government said it would never bow to blackmail and vowed to “fight to the end”.

The question now is whether the consensus reached between Trump and Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday means that the fight really has come to an end, and if so on whose terms.

Trump rated it as a 12 out of 10 meeting.

Both sides have taken some of their biggest guns off the table, but this appears closer to a truce than a durable peace setting stable boundaries for China's relations with the US. Nevertheless the outline of a broader long-term diplomatic relationship is visible, with announced reciprocal visits by each leader within a year. That is very different to what China hawks in Congress were hoping when Trump came to power, and will set alarm bells off on both sides of the aisle.

One of the difficulties has been that Trump's strategic objectives in launching the trade war were not articulated – the balance between protecting traditional US manufacturing, ring-fencing modern technology-based industries critical to US national security, punishing Chinese trade practices, or more broadly generally overpowering China as a competitive threat, were fudged. Gradually the battle morphed in some US administration minds from a trade war into a geopolitical trial of strength between the two world's superpowers, a trial that left the whole world awaiting its outcome.

As a result it has been a turbulent six months, involving undulating tariffs, export curbs, threats, counter-threats, deferral and monopolies inquiries, interspersed with five rounds of trade talks ranging though Madrid, London, Geneva, Stockholm and Kuala Lumpur, culminating in two hours of direct talks between Trump and Xi, the first meeting between the two men since 2019.

Through most of the crisis US tariffs on Chinese goods have averaged 55%. That was well below the effective total embargo level of 145% that Trump once threatened, but still high enough to pose a severe stress test to the resilience of the Chinese economy, a test it has passed.

What emerged from Thursday's meeting will require time to digest. In reality this is only a framework agreement and, as Canada is discovering, such agreements have the potential to unravel at a moment's notice. Moreover, in examining trade deals it is normally said the devil lies in the detail, but with a Trump trade deal the devil often lies in the lack of detail.

Much of it amounts to a return to the status quo. China has agreed to defer for at least a year the potentially crippling new restrictions on the export of rare-earth materials. China will once again buy US soya beans. Beijing has agreed to do more to control the export of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that has triggered a crisis of overdose deaths in North America, the supposed cause of 20% tariffs. In return Trump has agreed to halve that 20% levy, taking the average of US tariffs down to 45%, still higher than India. He has also suspended expanded restrictions on export controls.

Trump, on the plane home from South Korea, was evasive about the US role in loosening licence applications for shipments of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips to China, saying the subject of the new most powerful chip, the Blackwell, did not come up, and it was a matter for China and Nvidia. National security hawks in Washington will be watching.

The terms for the Chinese firm ByteDance's divestment of TikTok America will be announced separately, including the size of ByteDance's continuing stake, and control of the algorithm.

On Trump's account, fears that he was about to abandon Taiwan were also misplaced. The subject did not feature, he said implausibly.

More importantly over the past six months both sides have learned about the other's leverage and vulnerabilities, including which trade weapons work best. For the US it will be disturbing the extent to which China was able to divert US-bound exports to other mainly Asian markets once the US tariffs struck. Those who predicted China would spill into a crisis will have been sobered by a stock market that has risen by 34% in dollar terms, double the rise for the S&P 500 index. China's trade surplus is likely to be larger than last year's. Meanwhile US inflation figures, driven by tariffs, crept up to a politically perilous 3%.

Chinese restrictions on buying US soya beans, a $12bn (£9.1bn) market, were also effective. It sent politically critical US midwest farming interests towards penury as Brazil filled the market gap.

Above all, after a US commerce department rule-change in September, which by some accounts added 10,000 Chinese firms to Washington's list of sanctioned companies, Beijing massively retaliated by expanding the scope of its export controls on rare earths, the elements essential for hi-tech manufacturing including cars, batteries and military equipment.

If implemented fully, it would give China the ability to restrict the production around the world of all kinds of productsthat depend on only a small trace of rare earths sourced from China. The vast controls, announced on 9 October and due to have come into force in November worldwide, underscored the US failure to shed its supply chain reliance on China's near monopoly on refining these rare-earth products.

In a laughably hypocritical bid to rally the world against this China “bullying”, Jamieson Greer, America's trade representative, on 15 October complained: “China's announcement is nothing more than a global supply-chain power grab.” America discovered that bullies could be bullied back, something it might have foreseen.

By one account, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessant, examining the imminence of the precipice, persuaded Trump that the price of confrontation was proving too high, leading the two sides to the mutual withdrawal this week.

The truce is only for a year, but that may be to China's advantage. It buys Xi time to push China further ahead in the technologies of the future, including green technology and manufacturing, the field it now dominates, and the centrepiece of the new five-year economic plan.

Equally importantly, China hopes it will be seen by other countries as the responsible and restrained global power not seeking confrontation, but strong enough to withstand US coercion. At a minimum the clash in leadership cultures is total. Xi is an exponent of the war of position, and Trump the war of manoeuvre in which instinct triumphs over consistency or strategy. For the moment the positional warrior is winning, or at least not losing.

Hi, this is Chris York reporting from Kyiv on day 1,344 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

Russia on Oct. 30 bombed the Sloviansk Thermal Power Plant in Donetsk Oblast killing two people and injuring others, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

"This is exclusively terror. Normal people do not fight like this, and there must be an appropriate reaction of the world to such a Russian war," he said in a post on social media.

It is unclear whether the power plant, with a capacity of 830 megawatts and located just outside Sloviansk, is currently operational and generating power.

Russian forces launched a mass missile and drone attack against Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight on Oct. 30.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 592 out of the 653 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones, and 31 out of 52 missiles launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Seventy-nine strikes were recorded at 20 locations.

Last updated 7:50 p.m. Kyiv time.

Two soldiers working at a draft office in the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast have been injured, after a man shot them while being mobilized, the regional recruitment center said on Oct. 30.

The incident comes amid bubbling tensions in Ukrainian society around forced mobilization, a necessary measure to keep Ukrainian units on the battlefield manned and replenished.

The man was being escorted by draft officers, together with a representative of the police, to the recruitment center, where — upon a check for any illegal items on his person — he pulled out a Soviet-era Tokarev pistol and let off several rounds, the center posted on Facebook.

A Russian drone attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy injured at least four, including the manager of a local television station, local authorities said on Oct. 30.

The Russians carried out the strike with an Italmas long-range drone on Oct. 30, hitting a gas station, Mayor Artem Kobzar wrote on Telegram.

"Rescue workers were at the scene, surveying the area, dismantling damaged structures, and ensuring fire safety," Sumy Emergence Service said.

Four civilians were injured, including the Head of Sumy Channel, Maksym Tkachov.

According to the Institute of Mass Information (IMI), at the time of the attack, Tkachov had already refueled his car.

"Maxym Tkachov is currently in the hospital with through-and-through wounds to his legs. He also has a concussion," IMI said.

Two Polish MiG-29 fighter jets intercepted a Russian Il-20 reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on the morning of Oct. 30, the Polish Armed Forces' Operational Command said.

The Russian plane, flying without a filed flight plan and with its transponder turned off, did not violate Polish airspace and was escorted out of the zone of responsibility, Poland's military said.

The incident follows a similar case from Oct. 28, when two Polish jets intercepted and escorted another Russian Il-20 aircraft over the Baltic Sea.

The Ilyushin Il-20 is a Soviet-era reconnaissance aircraft designed for electronic surveillance, still in use by the Russian Armed Forces.

"Every day, Polish soldiers stand watch over the nation's skies with unwavering dedication," the Polish military said on X.

Emergency power outages were imposed on "all oblasts of Ukraine" due to yet another overnight mass Russian missile and drone attack targeting energy infrastructure, killing three people, and injuring at least 27 others, local authorities reported on Oct. 30.

Russian forces struck multiple thermal power plants in various regions of Ukraine, DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, said.

"The attacks caused fires at the facilities and resulted in damage to power plant equipment. Following the strikes, energy workers immediately began damage assessment and recovery operations," DTEK said.

According to DTEK, this marks the third major attack on the company's thermal power plants in a month. Three energy workers were injured in previous attacks.

"This attack is a bad blow in our efforts to keep power flowing this winter. Based on the intensity of attacks for the past two months, it is clear Russia is aiming for the complete destruction of Ukraine's energy system," CEO of DTEK, Maxim Timchenko, said.

Last updated 10:32 p.m. Oct. 20 Kyiv time.

Ukraine has closed its embassy in Havana and is "downgrading" diplomatic ties due to the high number of Cuban citizens recruited to fight Russia's full-scale war, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha announced Oct. 29.

The announcement came the same day that Ukraine voted against a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly to end the U.S. embargo against Cuba.

"Our vote is not against the Cuban people — we respect their right to live in prosperity. It is against the inaction of Cuba's authorities in response to massive recruitment of Cuban citizens to the Russian occupation army," Sybiha wrote on X.

"Thousands of them have signed contracts, joining the ranks of soldiers directly engaged in combat operations on Ukrainian soil."

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that at least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.

At least seven people were killed, and 57 people were injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 30.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 592 out of the 653 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones, and 31 out of 52 missiles launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Seventy-nine strikes were recorded at 20 locations.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, two people were killed and at least 27 people, including seven children, injured during the mass attack. One person was killed, and thirteen others were injured in other attacks over the previous day, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov.

In Vinnytsia Oblast, a seven-year-old child was killed and four others injured during the mass attack, according to local authorities. Critical infrastructure, residential buildings, and vehicles were also damaged.

A 36-year-old woman was injured in Boryspil, Kyiv Oblast, as a result of the drone attack, local authorities reported, adding that a fire broke out in a home, and residential buildings were damaged.

In Kherson Oblast, 12 people were injured in various Russian strikes over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.

Two people were injured in Kharkiv Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said.

In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and seven others injured in strikes throughout the day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.

In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and four people were injured due to Russian strikes, according to local authorities.

Russia has lost around 1,140,860 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 30.

The number includes 960 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,305 tanks, 23,514 armored fighting vehicles, 65,993 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,089 artillery systems, 1,531 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,232 air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 75,707 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

MOSCOW, October 30. /TASS/. Russia's tests of the Burevestnik missile, which features a nuclear-powered propulsion system, do not fall under the category of nuclear weapons tests restricted by international treaties, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified during a briefing, commenting on US President Donald Trump's recent statements and his directive to the Pentagon to carry out American nuclear weapons tests.

"If [Trump] in some way refers to the Burevestnik tests as a nuclear test carried out by another country, that is in no way accurate. All nations continue to advance the development of their defense systems, but this does not constitute a nuclear test," the Kremlin spokesman emphasized.

Previously, US President Donald Trump announced that he had instructed the Pentagon to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing. However, he did not specify the nature of the tests or whether they would involve detonating nuclear warheads.

MOSCOW, October 30. /TASS/. Vladimir Putin unveils Russia's new technological weapons; Israel and Hamas strive to uphold a shaky ceasefire in Gaza; and Donald Trump strikes a trade deal with South Korea during his Asia tour. These stories topped Thursday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the testing of the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater vehicle during a meeting with service members undergoing treatment at the Central Military Clinical Hospital. This is what experts describe as a "doomsday weapon" due to its enormous destructive power, Izvestia writes.

Poseidon's entry into service will mark a quantum leap in the development of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, experts note. The vehicle's main feature is its unlimited range, and its nuclear power unit allows it to stay underwater for extended periods. It is comparable in size to a small submarine but is a fully robotic vehicle with a unique ability to carry out combat duty stealthily along with traditional strategic nuclear forces, military expert Dmitry Kornev said.

"The move to include Poseidon in Russia's nuclear triad establishes a new system of strategic deterrence. This factor, along with the deployment of other advanced weapons such as the Burevestnik cruise missile, cannot be ignored by our partners amid preparations for talks on strategic weapons. The creation of systems like Poseidon may become an additional incentive for Washington to resume negotiations and develop new rules of the game," Kornev stated.

The vehicle is currently undergoing underwater trials involving the Belgorod submarine, Kornev added. Serial deployment will follow. The Khabarovsk-class nuclear submarines will serve as the main Poseidon carriers. According to unofficial data, the flagship submarine may be launched soon. Each submarine of this class is expected to carry at least six underwater vehicles, ensuring that fleets remain on continuous combat duty.

 

Israel's security cabinet is weighing all options in case the Hamas movement breaches the Gaza ceasefire, Dmitry Gendelman, advisor to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Izvestia. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) resumed compliance with the ceasefire deal after conducting strikes on the Palestinian enclave on October 28. Earlier, armed radicals attacked Israeli soldiers near the city of Rafah, killing a service member. With tensions rising, Hamas expanded efforts to locate the bodies of Israeli hostages, and Egyptian personnel with heavy equipment entered Gaza.

Palestinian security expert Muhammed al-Masri notes that new developments following the deployment of Egyptian search and rescue teams to Gaza show that the parties cannot break the ceasefire and restart military operations, especially since the teams have entered the enclave as mediators implementing the first phase of the deal.

Meanwhile, Israel has accused Hamas of staging the discovery of hostages' bodies to impress international observers. Roman Yanushevsky, editor-in-chief of Israel's Channel 9 website, told Izvestia that Hamas' statements about "a sudden discovery" of bodies could not be accidental, as they largely reflected the movement's domestic political game. According to Yanushevsky, what made Hamas do it was pressure from mediators and Israeli strikes. "It's absolutely clear that Hamas was well aware of where the hostages' bodies were hidden. It's not a ceasefire breach yet, but it's a step that can lead there," he said.

Israel believes that Palestinian militants are buying time, while they have access to about ten hostage graves in the enclave, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. In addition, US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he supports the logic of retaliatory strikes. Still, according to US media, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not yet held a detailed discussion of retaliation options with the US leadership. The measures on the table include sanctions on Hamas, namely a significant restriction of humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip, the resumption of full-scale military operations, and the redrawing of the "yellow line" that allows the IDF to control only half of Gaza.

Despite rising violence in the Palestinian enclave, the likelihood of a full-fledged resumption of hostilities remains low, Middle East expert Leonid Tsukanov told Izvestia. "Both parties are interested in preserving the fragile truce, which is why they are willing to maintain a kind of balance, limiting themselves to short-term retaliatory strikes," the expert said. On the other hand, he noted that Israel's retaliatory actions far exceeded Palestinian attacks in scale and level of destruction, which could eventually set the stage for new, longer clashes in Gaza.

 

Seoul and Washington have finalized an agreement on Seoul's $350 billion investment in the US economy to conclude a trade deal, Kim Yong-beom, South Korean presidential chief of staff, told reporters after a meeting between the two countries' presidents, Lee Jae Myung and Donald Trump.

Under the October 29 deal, $200 billion will be directly invested in the US economy, while the remaining $150 billion will go toward cooperation in shipbuilding led by the South Koreans, Vedomosti writes.

According to Kim Yong-beom, the deal reached by Trump and Lee will cut US tariffs on South Korean cars to 15%. Until recently, Hyundai and Kia automakers were at a disadvantage, facing a 25% tariff compared to the 15% imposed on their Japanese and European competitors, Olga Belenkaya, head of macroeconomic analysis at Finam, noted. She believes that ahead of his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Trump aimed to improve relations with US allies in the region.

Along with holding trade talks, Trump once again pledged to resolve the Korean conflict, noting that Seoul and Pyongyang have been technically at war since 1953. The US president expressed regret that he had been unable to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his Asia tour but added that he would continue to pursue a settlement.

Trump's visit will not significantly alter relations between South Korea and the United States, which rest on Seoul's substantial military, political, and economic dependence on Washington, Ilya Dyachkov, associate professor at the Department of Oriental Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, stressed. Seoul remains a loyal US ally, largely constrained in its choices but determined to protect its interests, primarily economic ones, the expert said: "US pressure will strongly influence the position of South Koreans. If the pressure is intense enough, Seoul will have to concede, but it won't be pleased and will certainly try to minimize its losses."

 

The BRICS group is prepared to welcome all Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members as partner states, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told Izvestia. Everything depends on the positions those countries' authorities adopt, the diplomat added. This year, this status was granted to Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Laos and Myanmar are also seeking to join BRICS, and even the pro-US Philippines is considering such a move.

Meanwhile, too many members could dilute the group's agenda and lead to a conflict of interests. This is why it is the partner state category that is most likely to be broadened. Among the remaining ASEAN members, Laos is showing the most interest in cooperation with BRICS. At the BRICS summit in Russia's Kazan in October 2024, the country's President Thongloun Sisoulith expressed a desire to join BRICS, even though Vientiane has not yet submitted an official request. Meanwhile, Laotian Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone noted that BRICS has great importance for the entire region as it demonstrates significant achievements in economic development. Myanmar, which borders two BRICS founding members, China and India, also continues to reaffirm its interest.

A gradual accession of ASEAN countries to BRICS is boosting the group's political weight as a representative of the Global South, strengthening its positions in the emerging multipolar world, said Yelena Burova, senior researcher with the Center for Vietnamese and ASEAN Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of China and Contemporary Asia.

However, the current tense international situation could hinder the group's expansion. Many countries of the Global South prefer to remain cautious, wary of possible difficulties in relations with the West.

"The countries that hold a pro-Western stance on the international stage could obstruct the effective development of BRICS, but we saw at some point that their influence on potential members was overestimated, as was the case with Indonesia. In my opinion, the dilution of BRICS' agenda is more dangerous, as it could discourage countries," Pavel Shaternikov, junior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, stressed.

 

November 1 will be a fateful date for the United States. As the government shutdown has been going on for 29 days, millions of Americans are about to face a new reality, while 42 million people will lose vital food aid under a government program, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports.

"Three days left before a budget apocalypse hits the US," the newspaper quoted American studies expert Malek Dudakov. "Congressmen are urgently demanding Trump step in and adopt at least some budget. However, he seems more interested in touring abroad than addressing domestic crises that cannot be resolved anyway," he added.

Both Trump and Democrats are using the expiration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as a bargaining chip, Pavel Koshkin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, told Vedomosti. According to him, Democrats typically blame Republican fiscal hawks for trying to cut funding for social programs such as SNAP. However, now conservatives and Trump are trying to shift the narrative and place the blame on the liberals. "It is a form of manipulation aimed at winning the information war around the government shutdown. Trump is unwilling to miss this opportunity because the stakes are high, it's about securing congressional seats in the next midterm elections," Koshkin emphasized. The expert explained that Trump was taking considerable risk, but Republicans were sometimes better at influencing public opinion than Democrats.

Still, Democrats have been more successful in promoting their claim that Trump is responsible for the possible suspension of the food aid program, Vladimir Pavlov, researcher at the Institute for International Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, remarked. He did not rule out, however, that the administration would try to avoid suspending SNAP to prevent a notable decline in voter support.

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 30 that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to work with Washington toward ending Russia's war against Ukraine following their meeting in South Korea.

While Beijing has maintained that it is neutral in the war, it continues supplying Moscow with dual-use goods and purchasing Russian oil, which provides crucial revenue for the Kremlin's war effort.

"We talked about (Russia's war against Ukraine) for a long time," Trump told reporters.

"We agree the sides are locked in fighting, and sometimes you have to let them fight — crazy — but (Xi) is going to help us, and we're going to work together on Ukraine. Not a lot more we can do."

According to Trump, he discussed Beijing's purchases of Russian oil with Xi, but did not elaborate on the details. The president previously imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, a move that disrupted some energy exports to China and India.

After the meeting, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also announced that Beijing has approved a deal regarding the social media app TikTok. He said he expects the agreement to advance in the coming weeks, but did not provide further details.

Last year, the U.S. Congress passed a law ordering ByteDance, a China-based company that owns the popular video platform, to sell TikTok's U.S. assets.

Trump described his meeting with Xi as "amazing" and the outcomes as "outstanding," adding that Washington and Beijing reached a one-year trade agreement.

"We have a deal now," Trump said. "Every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. We've settled all the rare earth issues."

Since returning to the office, the U.S. president has heavily relied on tariffs and secondary tariffs — or the threat of them — as a tool of foreign policy, using them to pressure both Beijing and Moscow. 

On Sept. 5, Trump criticized growing cooperation between Moscow, Beijing, and New Delhi after a summit in Tianjin, writing that "it looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest China."

From Dec. 5, 2022, until the end of September 2025, China bought 47% of Russia's crude exports, followed by India with 38%, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

Earlier, Trump vowed to impose secondary tariffs on China for buying Russian oil.

The U.S. president has recently grown frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He canceled their planned meeting in Hungary before imposing sanctions on Russia's energy giants. 

On Oct. 25, Trump said he would not meet Putin unless there was "a clear path to a peace agreement" between Russia and Ukraine, as he is "not going to be wasting (his) time."

A source attributed the explosion to someone trying to send a part of a grenade launcher by mail.



Russian drone attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy injured at least 4, including the head of local television, local authorities said on Oct. 30.

"We agree the sides are locked in fighting... but (Xi) is going to help us, and we're going to work together on Ukraine," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Gunvor, which is registered in Cyprus and headquartered in Switzerland, was founded in 1997 by Gennady Timchenko, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Swedish billionaire Torbjörn Törnqvist.

The Russian plane, flying without a filed flight plan and with its transponder turned off, did not violate Polish airspace and was escorted out of the zone of responsibility, Poland's military said.

The far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), whose leader has argued against aid to Ukraine, lost nearly a third of its seats in parliament, according to the latest results.

The Consulate remains in close contact with the family of the deceased and is assisting with the repatriation of the body to Ukraine, the ministry added.

Air raid alerts were issued across the entire county overnight, with Ukraine's Air Force tracking Shahed-type drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonic Kinzhal missiles.

"Because of the tremendous destructive power, I hated to do it, but had no choice!" Trump said. "Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within five years. Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis."



Ukraine is "downgrading" diplomatic ties with Havana due to "the inaction of Cuba's authorities in response to massive recruitment of Cuban citizens to the Russian occupation army," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

An Illinois jury convicted a former sheriff's deputy of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old woman, inside her home.

Former Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Grayson was initially charged with first-degree murder. The Peoria County jury opted to convict him of second-degree murder, a lesser charge with a lower prison sentence.

The Toronto Blue Jays are leaving Dodger Stadium with a 3-2 series lead over the reigning world champs, as Canada's team is now just one win away from its first World Series title since 1993.

Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. made Fall Classic history with back-to-back solo homers to open Wednesday's Game 5, while Trey Yesavage struck out 12 in a momentous outing as the Jays clubbed the Dodgers 6-1.

The Jays stole two of three games during the trip to Dodger Stadium. Now the World Series leaves the City of Angels and returns to Toronto, where it will be decided as early as Friday night.

Yesavage threw seven innings in his first road postseason start, allowing three hits and one run, without walking anyone, while mixing his fastball, slider and splitter. His dozen strikeouts set a new single-game MLB record for a rookie pitcher in the World Series. 

The 22-year-old starter with the rare over-the-top release struck out every member of the Dodgers starting lineup at least once. He punched out LA's finest swinging and missing, from Shohei Ohtani to Freddie Freeman, Will Smith and Mookie Betts. 

Starter Trey Yesavage set a record for strikeouts by a rookie in the World Series with 12 as he led the Toronto Blue Jays to a 6-1 victory and a 3-2 lead in the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

“Hollywood couldn't have made it this good,” said Yesavage, adding to his meteoric ascension this year through the minors to the World Series. “Being a part of this, I'm just very blessed.”

Yesavage oozed poise, like when he bobbled a ground ball hit to the mound, but calmly scooped it and creatively shoveled the ball to Guerrero at first base like a pro quarterback.

“Historic stuff. When you talk about that stage and his numbers, getting ahead of a lot of hitters, tons of swing-and-miss,” said Jays manager John Schneider. “Kind of blown away at what he did.”

When the Japanese superstar Ohtani did get his bat on a Yesavage slider, Jays right fielder Addison Barger nabbed it with a diving catch.

The Blue Jays led all night, starting with a shocking few minutes in their first two at-bats.

Schneider and Guerrero each crushed homeruns off lefty Blake Snell, both sending fastballs sailing over the left field wall. It was the first time in World Series history that teammates have crushed back-to-back blasts to begin a game. 

Just three pitches into the contest, Toronto already had a 2-0 lead, and a ‘Lets go Blue Jays' chant pierced the silence inside Dodger Stadium.

“George kind of always preaches you always be ready for the fastball first pitch leading off the game,” said Schneider, who was batting leadoff in place of the injured designated hitter George Springer. “George has done it for numerous years, and I got to take some advice when I can get it.”

The single Los Angeles run came from an Enrique Hernández homer which briefly woke a sellout crowd of 52, 175 that included celebs like Leonardo DiCaprio and Charlize Theron. But that momentum was short-lived.

Daulton Varsho scored Toronto's third run, as he tripled in the fourth inning and then came home thanks to an Ernie Clement sacrifice fly.

Snell lasted 6 2/3 innings for the Dodgers, allowing six hits, three runs, and four walks against seven strikeouts.

Toronto added more runs after Snell left. Addison Barger scored on a wild pitch, and Andrés Giménez on an RBI single from Bo Bichette.

Every man in the Blue Jays starting lineup reached base in Wednesday's game. As a team, Toronto had nine hits.

Seranthony Dominguez was the first out of the Jays' bullpen, then Jeff Hoffman came in to close out the last game of the season at Dodger Stadium. Now Toronto hosts Game 6 on Friday, and if needed Game 7 on Saturday.

Kevin Gausman will start Game 6 for Toronto on Halloween night. The Dodgers will counter with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a rematch of the pitching duel from Game 2, when the Japanese ace took the night with a dazzling nine-inning outing.

Donald Trump claimed victory in trade talks with Xi Jinping on Thursday, securing concessions on rare earths elements, soybean sales and fentanyl, as he flew out from South Korea after their summit.

In return, the American president said he was reducing tariffs and signalled that there would soon be progress on a wider deal.

“It was an amazing meeting. He is a great leader,” Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew home to Washington where he is due to host a Halloween party later on Thursday.

“A lot of important decisions were made.”

The meeting in South Korea was the first between Mr Trump and Mr Xi since 2019 and came at the end of the president's whirlwind trip of Asia.

Along the way, he claimed important progress on winning investment for the US, but his sternest test came with his final meeting.

Tit-for-tat export restrictions had shaken global markets all year, as the world's two biggest economies ratcheted up tariffs.

The presidents met at Busan airport for almost two hours. The meeting was shoehorned into their busy schedules as Mr Trump prepared to fly home, and as Mr Xi flew in for a major summit of Pacific leaders.

World markets breathed a sigh of relief at its conclusion — Chinese stocks climbed to a decade high and the yuan currency to a near one-year peak.

Mr Trump rated the meeting a 12 out of 10. “The whole relationship is very, very important,” he said.

A full trade deal could follow, he added.

“I think pretty soon,” he said. “We have not too many major stumbling blocks.”

He listed the previous stumbling blocks and described how they had been resolved.

China, he said, had agreed to buy “tremendous” amounts of soybeans; he was cutting a 20 percent tariff imposed because of fentanyl shipments to 10 percent because Beijing had said it would work to cut supplies; and an aide said China had promised not to impose export controls on rare earths for a year.

Mr Trump said he would visit Mr Xi in China in April, and that the Chinese president would come to the US soon afterwards.

Regional experts had worried that talks could get bogged down on Taiwan. Beijing wants Washington to change its ambiguous language on the autonomous island to say that it would oppose the territory's independence.

But Mr Trump said the topic never came up, although they did discuss Ukraine.

“We discussed working together to see if we could get that war finished,” he said, adding that China was a major buyer of Russian oil.

In a readout after the meeting, Beijing said China and the US “have good prospects for cooperation in areas such as combating illegal immigration and telecom fraud, anti-money laundering, artificial intelligence, and responding to infectious diseases.”

“The world today faces many challenges, and China and the US can jointly demonstrate their responsibility as major powers and work together to accomplish more significant, practical, and beneficial things for both countries and the world,” it added.

The meeting was over in an hour and 40 minutes but the pressure of the moment was evident in their two delegations. Prior to the talks, officials squabbled about who would stand where and when inside a building marked “base operations.”

Mr Xi stood impassive as his American counterpart said he believed an agreement was close.

“We'll have a great understanding,” said Mr Trump. “We've always had a great relationship.”

After posing for photographs, they sat down with their aides.

Through a translator, Mr Xi said it was not surprising that they were sometimes at odds.

“We do not always see eye to eye with each other and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,” he said, before opening the door for agreement.

“I always believe that China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.”

Mr Xi arrived in South Korea after a show of strength at home – called a plenum, a gathering of the Chinese Communist Party – where his officials put strengthening the nation's manufacturing base at the heart of their five-year plan.

That marked a direct challenge to Mr Trump and his push to rebalance global trade, so that China focuses more on consumption rather than production.

For his part, Mr Trump delivered his own shows of force just before the summit.

In a Truth Social post, he appeared to order the Pentagon to resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time in three decades, saying it would put the US on an “equal basis” with Russia and China.

China, after the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Xi, said that it hoped the US would “earnestly abide” by a nuclear weapons testing ban.

SEOUL, October 30. /TASS/. The Chinese and US negotiating teams have reached a basic consensus on how to resolve key trade and economic issues between the two countries, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at a meeting with US President Donald Trump in South Korea's Busan.

"Our two trade and economic teams have reached a basic consensus on the resolution of key problems of our concern and have made an encouraging progress," he said.

According to Xi, China and the United States can help each other to achieve success and mutual prosperity. "For years, I have been repeatedly saying that China and the United States should be partners and friends," He said.

The US leader said earlier that he hopes that this meeting will yield an agreement on conditions for further trade between the countries. He also said that he intended to lower additional tariffs on Chinese goods, which had been introduced over fentanyl smuggling.

GYEONGJU, South Korea—U.S. President Donald Trump announced a series of trade deals Thursday after a meeting with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and said he agreed to reduce tariffs on China in exchange for other economic concessions.

“I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after he departed Busan, South Korea, following the nearly two-hour-long meeting with Xi.

Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to immediately begin testing of the US nuclear arsenal on Thursday, hours after Russia announced it had tested a nuclear-capable underwater drone.

Mr Trump made the announcement as he travelled to his high-stakes summit with China's Xi Jinping.

“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Mr Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

“That process will begin immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Mr Trump is on the final day of a week-long trip to Asia.

He is due to meet Xi in the South Korean city of Busan on Thursday morning before flying home to Washington.

Top of their agenda will be trade tensions, but Xi is also expected to raise regional security questions and push the US to weaken its stance on protection for Taiwan.

Hours earlier, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, announced the successful test of Poseidon.

The project was announced in 2018, as part of a package of weapons designed as a deterrent to the West.

“There is nothing like this in the world in terms of the speed and the depth of the movement of this unmanned vehicle — and it is unlikely there ever will be,” he said.

Poseidon is one of six super-weapons unveiled ahead of the invasion of Ukraine.

On Sunday, Putin announced that Russia had tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik missile, which can also carry nuclear payloads.

Mr Trump slammed the test at the time, saying Russia would be better advised to work on peace in Ukraine.

On Thursday morning he went further, ordering a new nuclear stance at home.

“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he posted.

“This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office.

“Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”

President Trump says he's cutting tariffs on Chinese imports by 10% after meeting with Xi Jinping in Busan, citing progress on trade, fentanyl and rare-earth exports.

The Senate once again rejected President Donald Trump's tariffs, this time on a global scale.

Lawmakers in the upper chamber went three for three with resolutions meant to terminate Trump's use of emergency powers to enact steep tariffs on foreign countries. While the previous two were geared toward specific tariffs on Brazil and Canada, the latest would end tariffs on countries around the world.

Earlier this year, Trump declared through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act that he would enact a base 10% tariff on countries across the world. He argued in his executive order at the time that "national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits" as a reason to pull the trigger on the tariffs.

Since then, senators have grumbled about the tariffs and made moves to terminate his usage of emergency powers throughout the year.

And it's the second time that this particular resolution from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has been considered in the Senate.

The first go-round saw the resolution narrowly defeated 49-49, not because of partisan will but because of absences on the day of the vote. At the time, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., were expected to vote for the resolution but missed their chance.

Fast-forward to October, and McConnell joined a foursome of Republicans, including himself and Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., to strike down Trump's global tariffs. Those same lawmakers all voted against the previous two resolutions, too.

The other tariff-minded legislation would end Trump's emergency powers to enact 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods and 35% tariffs on Canadian goods.

But they likely won't go anywhere in the House, which previously voted to reject undermining Trump's tariff policy until next year.

Meanwhile, Trump announced that after a "truly great" meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would lower his fentanyl tariffs on China by 10%. That brings the total level of duties on the country down to 47% from 57%.

The reduction comes after China agreed to help stymie the flow of chemicals into the U.S. that are used to create the dangerous narcotic and to ease export controls on rare earth minerals, which manufacturers in the U.S. rely on to create a variety of goods and electronics.

"There is enormous respect between our two countries, and that will only be enhanced with what just took place," Trump said on Truth Social. "We agreed on many things, with others, even of high importance, being very close to resolved."

A Swedish appeals court's decision not to deport a convicted rapist because his assault on a 16-year-old girl was not deemed "exceptionally grave" has ignited outrage, fueling a backlash against Sweden's justice system.

The Court of Appeal for northern Norrland confirmed to Fox News Digital that the defendant, an Eritrean national and illegal immigrant, Yezied Mohamed, was sentenced to three years in prison for raping the 16-year-old girl from the northern town of Skellefteå, on Sept. 1, 2024. The court acknowledged that while the crime was serious, it did not meet the threshold for deportation because of its nature and short duration.

The ruling prompted swift condemnation from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who released a video promising stricter deportation laws. "No one should have to worry about meeting their attacker or rapist on the street," Kristersson said. "Those who commit serious crimes in Sweden and are not Swedish citizens must leave the country."

In a written response to Fox News Digital, Judge Lars Viktorsson said the court considered both the nature and duration of the act, noting there was no use of weapon, and there wasn't intercourse, and that "the duration of the incident had been short." "It is true that the duration of the rape was of significance in the assessment of the matter of deportation," Viktorsson stated, "However, the nature of the offense was at least as significant."

Kristersson pledged to introduce "the toughest legislation in all the Nordic countries," stating that any crime resulting in more than a fine could lead to deportation. "With these new, stricter rules, six times as many people are expected to be deported. We are going further than any government has ever done before."

Migration Minister Johan Forssell echoed the prime minister's sentiment in a video he posted on X, calling the case unacceptable. "The victim's right to safety must always outweigh the perpetrator's right to stay in Sweden," he said. "Next year I will present new legislation that will make Sweden the toughest country in the Nordic region when it comes to crime-related deportations."

"We also need to review the international conventions that, until now, have made it harder to carry out necessary deportations. . . . This is about justice, and about giving victims the dignity and closure they deserve," he stated.

The District Court initially acquitted him, accepting that a rape had occurred but finding insufficient evidence that he was the perpetrator. After an appeal, the Court of Appeal overturned that ruling, concluding that Mohamed matched the description given by the victim and a witness, and that forensic evidence placed him near the scene.

The court sentenced him to three years in prison, the minimum for rape in Sweden, and ordered him to pay 240,000 Swedish krona, about $25,600, in damages. It ruled that while the offense was serious, it was not "of such an exceptionally grave nature" to justify deportation under refugee protections. One judge dissented, arguing he should be expelled.

The decision sparked global attention after social media posts claimed Mohamed avoided deportation because the rape "lasted less than ten minutes." While no specific timeframe appears in the judgment, the court confirmed that duration was one factor in its assessment.

Swedish journalist Christian Peterson told Fox News Digital the ruling's wording — referring to the "character and duration" of the act — "became a flashpoint for public anger."

"The judges themselves determined which aspects of the crime were relevant and whether those were sufficiently severe to justify deportation," Peterson said. "That's what makes this ruling so controversial."

A post by Swedish commentator Evelina Hahne, viewed nearly 10 million times and shared by Elon Musk, accused Swedish courts of leniency toward migrants and reignited a nationwide debate over crime and immigration.

Peterson said the case highlights a broader issue: Sweden's difficulty deporting migrants even after serious convictions.

EUROPEAN LEADERS WEIGH IN ON 'LEGITIMATE' ISSUE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: 'MUST BE STOPPED'

"In Sweden it's very difficult to deport migrants, even those convicted of serious crimes," he said. "This case became symbolic because people feel it shows how the system protects offenders more than victims."

He noted similar cases, including the 2016 murder of Elin Krantz, a young woman killed by an Ethiopian man with a residence permit, and recent reports of rapes in elderly care homes involving foreign-born workers.

"Only after the right-wing coalition took power in 2022 did meaningful reforms begin to take shape," Peterson said. "Before that, the issue was considered too politically sensitive."

Sill, he says, "Sweden did not join a Danish-Italian initiative within the European Union to reform the European Convention on Human Rights, which critics say limits the ability to deport convicted offenders. Denmark, Italy and Austria signed on — Sweden did not."

As public anger mounts, Sweden's government faces pressure to implement tougher policies.

Judge Viktorsson told Fox News Digital the court followed existing law and precedent, "but the power to change deportation standards lies with lawmakers."

A Portland police commander testified Wednesday that federal forces deployed by President Donald Trump escalated tensions during protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building, intensifying violence rather than curbing it.

Portland Police Bureau Cmdr. Franz Schoening delivered the testimony during a federal bench trial examining whether Trump had legal grounds to deploy the National Guard to Portland — an action city officials argue was unnecessary and inflammatory.

Schoening described instances in which federal agents fired tear gas at who he called nonviolent demonstrators, saying the actions were "startling." The ICE facility had been a focal point of protests since June.

He said that state and federal law prohibit police agencies from using the tactics that federal officers have taken, including the deployment of tear gas and other munitions. Portland police officers, he added, were themselves hit by tear gas and forced to retreat.

Schoening recounted a larger Oct. 18 protest where a federal agent allegedly launched a munition — either smoke or tear gas — that bounced off the facility's driveway and landed on the roof, where other agents were stationed. Those agents responded by firing additional rounds into the crowd.

"We didn't see any violent conduct or behavior that would have precipitated that use of force," Schoening testified. "It appeared to be triggered by the federal officer's deployment of that munition. Our officers were in close proximity and were struck by federal munitions."

Portland attorney Caroline Turco said the evidence would show that the protests were largely peaceful and did not justify National Guard intervention.

TRUMP TEAM URGES OREGON JUDGE TO END RESTRAINING ORDER BLOCKING NATIONAL GUARD

"This case is about whether we are a nation of constitutional law or martial law," Turco said in opening statements.

The U.S. Justice Department countered that federal personnel had been targeted throughout the summer. DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton argued that "agitators have used violence and threatened violence" against officers and property.

In a trial brief, the Trump administration accused Portland authorities of being "unhelpful and at times hostile," and claimed the city's police repeatedly failed to support federal agents.

"The record is replete with evidence of the PPB failing to provide assistance when federal officials have requested it," DOJ attorneys wrote.

The administration further argues that it had been forced to reassign Department of Homeland Security agents from across the country to Portland due to the protests.

It also argues the Trump administration can call out the National Guard because the president has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces in Portland and has characterized the protests as a "rebellion" or presenting a "danger of rebellion" — both cited as justifications under federal law for National Guard deployment.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — A network of medical clinics that serves low-income residents in Maine said it will shut down its primary care operations on Friday because of Trump administration cuts to abortion providers.

Maine Family Planning operates 18 clinics in the state and says abortions are a relatively small percentage of its overall services, which also include cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing and contraception. The network said it had to cut primary care because of the administration's move to block Medicaid money from abortion providers including the much larger Planned Parenthood.

The move to defund abortion providers is driving patients away from their doctors in Maine, said George Hill, president of Maine Family Planning. The network saw more than 600 patients in its primary care practices last year, Hill said.

“Telling those patients we can't see them anymore has been devastating, especially knowing that some of them will find it too difficult to get a new provider and may just forego care,” Hill said.

Maine Family Planning serves many of the poor and rural areas of the state and typically receives about $1.9 million in Medicaid reimbursements per year, the network said in a statement. The network said it notified its patients of the coming primary care closures about a month ago. The network has about 8,000 patients in total.

Maine Family Planning fought the halting of Medicaid dollars in federal court, but it suffered a setback in August when a federal judge ruled against restoring funding during the network's ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration. The network appealed to a higher court, and that legal fight is still ongoing.


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




The Center for Reproductive Rights filed the case in federal court on behalf of the network, and said Friday it will continue to fight to restore the funding. Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, called the loss of funding for Maine Family Planning “part of a larger strategy to shut down clinics even in states like Maine that protect the right to abortion.”

            The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on a kleptocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was removed this month as president of the Serb territory within Bosnia and Herzegovina for chipping away at the US-brokered peace deal that ended bloody ethnic violence in the Balkans in the 1990s.
    


            The waiving of sanctions on Milorad Dodik followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.
    


            Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.
    


            Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia's integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”
    


            Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump's Washington.
    


            “What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It's setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King's College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton's 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration's decision was especially dispiriting.
    


            The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.
    


            The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska's National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska's installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.
    


            Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in July 2017 for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.
    


            Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.
    


            Since Trump's return to the White House, Dodik's overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.
    


            In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”
    


            Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich's firm, signed a contract with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.
    


            Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a contract with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year's work, plus a bonus if Zell's firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.
    


            This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik's cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president, said Dodik's removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”
    


            Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, called for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”
    


            Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump's one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump's famous MAGA hats.
    


            Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”
    


            US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”
    


            “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”

Trump isn't interested in war with China. But it might be interested in him.

Since President Donald Trump's second term began, his administration's approach to China has been arguably the toughest aspect of its foreign policy to parse. In part, that's because the top members of Trump's team haven't always seemed to be on the same page with each other or with the president on the question of just how confrontational to be with America's closest superpower rival.

If there was something of an emerging consensus, it was that Trump has been willing to confront China on trade and economic issues — though through its effective weaponization of rare earth mineral supply chains, the nation has proved tougher to pressure via trade than most other countries on the receiving end of Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he has been less interested in competing militarily and geopolitically with China, a competition that has consumed much of Washington — including his own first-term administration — in recent years.

Heading into Trump's meeting on Thursday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Semafor's Ben Smith predicted the occasion would “end Washington's decade of China hawks.” The fear among many was that Xi would exploit Trump's desperation for a trade deal for concessions on the geopolitical questions he knows Trump is less interested in. In particular, Xi is reportedly seeking a statement from Trump formally opposing Taiwan's independence. (The current US position is that it does not support a unilateral move toward Taiwan independence. That might not seem like a major distinction, but this is a conflict where subtleties like this can have enormous consequences.) Before the meeting, one Trump aide told NBC News that “everyone is holding their breath” to hear what he would say about Taiwan.

In the end, according to Trump, the issue did not even come up at the meeting in Korea. In the talks that Trump rated a “12 out of 10,” the two leaders reached a truce of sorts of trade issues: Trump said he would reduce tariffs on China by 10 percentage points, while Xi agreed to resume US soybean purchases, lift restrictions on rare earths exports, and promised to crack down on Chinese exports of chemicals that are used to make fentanyl.

So, has the temperature been lowered? Well, sure — for all issues but the small matter of nuclear war.

Just minutes ahead of the meeting with Xi, Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing that he had ordered the resumption of nuclear testing:

It's hard to know exactly how to interpret this announcement since most of it is inaccurate. Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States; the ongoing US nuclear modernization program is years from completion. China is building up its arsenal, but it won't be even with the US in five years under even the most dire Pentagon estimates. The Department of Energy, not Defense, is responsible for nuclear testing.

No country, other than North Korea, has actually detonated a nuclear weapon since the 1990s. It's possible Trump was referring to Russia's recent test of a nuclear-capable and nuclear-powered torpedo.

Trump didn't answer a reporter's question about the announcement in Korea, and the White House has not yet responded to Vox's request for clarification. Though the US has never ratified the global treaty banning nuclear tests, it hasn't carried one out since 1992. But there has been speculation this could change. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 suggested that the US should “indicate a willingness to conduct nuclear tests in response to adversary nuclear developments if necessary.” But this announcement is not motivated by technical necessity; the US and other nuclear states have a number of ways of testing the reliability of their arsenals without actually detonating them. Rather, it's driven by a desire to demonstrate the credibility of the US deterrent.

If Trump actually means a return to active nuclear testing — detonating warheads — that would be a major escalation that could prompt reciprocal moves from Russia and China. It's a tough move to square with his repeatedly stated desire for “denuclearization” talks with both Russia and China.

Whatever he actually intends, the timing just before a meeting billed as a deescalation of US-China tensions doesn't seem coincidental.

There will be some sighs of relief in both Washington and Taipei that Trump did not “sell out” Taiwan's autonomy for a deal on soybeans. That doesn't mean the issue — the most likely flashpoint that could cause a US-China military conflict — is likely to go away. Trump may not be interested in war with China, but war with China could still be interested in him.

Trump has said he does not believe Xi will attack Taiwan, despite the island being the “apple of his eye,” and that may well be true given how daunting an all-out amphibious invasion could be with or without US involvement. But China's moves to ramp up pressure on the country — which Beijing considers a rebellious province — seem more plausible. Those moves could range from increasing cyberattacks, to seizing one of Taiwan's smaller outlying islands, to imposing a full blockade. And these possibilities that fall short of total conquest raise the question of how the US would respond.

Under legislation passed in 1979, the US is obligated to take measures to help Taiwan resist any use of force to change its status, but subsequent administrations have long been coy about whether this would mean actually using military force to protect Taiwan from invasion — a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” Joe Biden came about as close as any president ever had to abandoning this policy, saying on four separate occasions that he believed the US was obligated to defend Taiwan, though administration officials always walked these statements back.

Trump has not said anything like that, which Jason Hsu, a former Taiwanese legislator and who is currently a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, told me may actually be for the best. “If he said, ‘Okay, America would defend Taiwan,' then that would make Taiwan relax,” Hsu said. In Taiwan's neighborhood, relaxation can be dangerous. “We need to get ourselves together and bolster our self-defense.”

At the same time, this is clearly not the Trump administration posture toward Taiwan that many were expecting. When I visited Taiwan last year, just prior to the US election, I found officials and ordinary citizens fairly optimistic about what a potential second Trump administration would mean for them. It's not hard to understand why. During his first term, Trump broke precedent by speaking directly with Taiwan's president. He dispatched two Cabinet officials to visit the country — the highest-level US official visits to the country since the 1970s. And he increased arms sales, including some systems that the Obama administration had withheld. Trump's first term secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, later called in 2022 for the US to formally recognize Taiwan's independence.

In this term, by contrast, as Trump has pursued a US-China trade deal, he has declined to approve $400 million in arms sales to Taiwan, and he told Taiwan's president, William Lai, to avoid a stopover in New York in July.

But the Pentagon is not out of the China competition game entirely. Also just ahead of Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting, CBS reported that the US military's Indo-Pacific Command had given an order for a “show of force” operation to deter Chinese aggression in the South China Sea — though it's unclear if the US operation will actually be carried out. Trump also announced on Thursday that the US would allow South Korea to access the technology needed to build a nuclear submarine, another move that China is likely to see as provocative.

Still, overall, the administration has signaled that preparing for military confrontation with China is not a major issue. The fleet of autonomous drones that the Pentagon had been building to surveil China is well behind schedule. The Pentagon's forthcoming national security strategy is expected to downgrade Chinese competition, to place it below border security and Western Hemisphere issues.

“I think the Biden administration was strategic, but not ambiguous,” Zack Cooper, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies US-China competition, told Vox. “The Trump administration is ambiguous, but maybe not very strategic.”

Given what we know about Trump's attitude toward the use of military force — he prefers quick, decisive strikes against weaker targets like Iran, the Houthis, or alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that don't have any capacity to retaliate or get the US involved in a protracted conflict — it's hard to imagine him getting embroiled in a conflict with China. Even under the most optimistic scenarios (ones that don't go nuclear), a war like that would involve the kind of losses that the US hasn't seen since World War II.

“In a Taiwan scenario, if you bomb China, they're going to bomb you back,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow at Defense Priorities.

Kavanagh, who advocates a policy of dialing back the US defense buildup in Asia, said that as Taiwan manages its own relations with Beijing and prepares for potential military conflict, “I think it's really important to assume that the US won't come.”

On the other hand, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, as the nuclear testing announcement on the eve of his summit demonstrated. The next few years of history in Asia may hinge on just how much Xi is willing to test that unpredictability.

            Israel has received the remains of what Hamas earlier said were two deceased hostages held in Gaza. The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and will be taken to the country's national forensics laboratory for identification.
    


            If confirmed, that would leave the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.
    


            “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.
    


            The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.
    


            Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.
    


            US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing's going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”
    


            The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.
    


            On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”

Health and science journalist Max Lugavere joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss surgeon general nominee Dr. Casey Means, her background and why he believes she is qualified.

A virtual confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump's surgeon general pick Dr. Casey Means has been postponed because she went into labor.

Means, 38, was appearing remotely because she was nine months pregnant with her first child.

Her opening remarks for the hearing expected on Thursday had been prewritten.

"Our nation is angry, exhausted, and hurting from preventable disease. Rates of high blood pressure, many cancers, autoimmune conditions, type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, dementia, neurodevelopmental challenges, and youth suicide have all increased in the past two decades," the prepared remarks, obtained by Fox News, said.

"This public-health crisis is touching every American family. It is robbing our children of possibility, our workforce of productivity, and our nation of security. It strains our federal budget and dims hope for millions," she planned to say.

As the nation's doctor, the surgeon general is a leader for Americans and health officials on public health issues. If confirmed, Means will represent an administration that has already transformed the public health landscape by calling for increased scrutiny of vaccines, the nation's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs.

Means, a Stanford-educated physician who rose to popularity as a wellness influencer after becoming disillusioned with traditional medicine, was expected to share a vision for ending chronic disease by targeting its root causes, an idea that aligns with the Make America Healthy Again message of her close ally Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

She has no government experience, and her license to practice as a physician is inactive, The Associated Press reported, adding that it was not immediately clear when the hearing would be rescheduled.

"Everyone's happy for Dr. Means and her family," said Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary for the Health and Human Services Department. "This is one of the few times in life it's easy to ask to move a Senate hearing."

Vice President JD Vance told a Turning Point USA audience Wednesday that Republicans shouldn't fear using federal power, arguing the left has already weaponized it in the past.

Vance was responding to a question from an audience member at the University of Mississippi, also known as "Ole Miss," who asked whether Republicans risk "abusing that power" if they use the federal government aggressively when governing.

"We cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future," Vance said. "The left is already going to do it, regardless of whether we do it. That is the takeaway of the last 40 years."

Vance sarcastically prefaced his answer by saying, "What if Joe Biden sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation to start arresting his political opponents," a dig at the criminal cases brought against former President Donald Trump over the last few years.

The Trump administration has deployed the National Guard to Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Memphis, Tenn., with plans to send troops to as many as 19 states to support immigration enforcement and fight crime.

"If Joe Biden wanted to deploy the National Guard to a red state in a place where the murder rate was twice what it is in third-world countries to actually go after murderers, that would be a great use of the National Guard," Vance continued.

"Unfortunately, I don't think Joe Biden would use it like that," the vice president added. "What I'm worried about, frankly, is what the far left already did with American law enforcement — and that is the thing we have to prevent against."

He said that preventing future misuse of federal power requires holding those responsible to account.

"And the answer to that question is, you make sure the people who did it face penalties for using the federal power against American citizens," he said. "And by the way, that's exactly what we're trying to do."

Joel Klatt reacted to the LSU Tigers firing Brian Kelly. He revealed who he thinks LSU should call to replace Brian Kelly as head coach. Joel also analyzes if the LSU head coaching job is the best coaching vacancy available. 

There are two prominent college football head-coaching jobs in the SEC now with the Florida Gators and LSU Tigers both dismissing their leaders over the last few weeks.

Lane Kiffin, who has had major success in rebuilding the Ole Miss Rebels since he took over as head coach, has been linked in the rumor mill to both the Florida and LSU jobs.

Nick Saban, however, took a page out of Lee Corso's book to essentially say, "Not so fast my friend."

The legendary college football coach suggested that the LSU and Florida jobs may not be as good as the one that Kiffin has now.

"Jobs that weren't great jobs before are now," he told On3 Sports on Wednesday. "Lane is the first name up for Florida and the first name up for LSU, but I think you can have a long debate on whether either one of those jobs is actually better than the job he has now because he has some guys over there at Ole Miss that give him pretty much whatever he wants from a roster standpoint. He may not necessarily have the same thing at Florida or LSU.

"So you look at these jobs differently now."

Kiffin was Alabama's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014 to 2016 under Saban.

Saban has been adamant about his disdain for what the college football coaching carousel has become. He put the onus on the advent of name, image and likeness with money doing most of the talking when it comes to the recent switches.

"You know, I'm not (surprised) because everybody's raising money to pay players," Saban told ESPN earlier this month. "So, the people that are giving the money think they have a voice and they're just like a bunch of fans. When they get frustrated and disappointed, they put pressure on the (athletic directors) to take action, and it's the way of the world."

Brian Kelly became the latest to get the ax after a loss to Texas A&M.

He joined Billy Napier and Penn State's James Franklin as some of the biggest names to be kicked to the curb during the season. Sam Pittman (Arkansas), Mike Gundy (Oklahoma State), Deshaun Foster (UCLA), Brent Pry (Virginia Tech) and Trent Bray (Oregon State) were also dismissed by their respective schools.

U.S. Trade Representative Amb. Jamieson Greer joins ‘Fox News Sunday' to discuss China's export limits on rare earth minerals, the global fentanyl crisis and potential next steps for the Trump team.

FIRST ON FOX: A trio of Republican senators is introducing a coordinated slate of legislation to crack down on nitazenes — a class of synthetic opioids that are little known to the public but increasingly viewed by law enforcement and health officials as potentially the next fentanyl-level crisis.

Sens. Eric Schmitt of Missouri, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania unveiled three new bills aimed at addressing the growing spread of nitazenes through law enforcement, technology and foreign policy measures. The push represents one of the most aggressive congressional efforts yet to get ahead of what experts warn could be a deadly new chapter in America's opioid epidemic.

Schmitt's Detection Equipment and Technology Evaluation to Counter the Threat of Nitazenes Act of 2025, or DETECT Nitazenes Act, directs the Department of Homeland Security to work with the Drug Enforcement Administration to develop and deploy new technology capable of detecting trace amounts of nitazenes. The bill also updates the Homeland Security Act to explicitly include nitazenes in federal efforts to identify and disrupt illicit substances.

Ricketts and Schmitt joined McCormick and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in introducing the Nitazene Control Act, which would permanently classify nitazenes as Schedule I controlled substances under federal law — the same category as heroin, fentanyl and LSD.

DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS

And in a third measure, Ricketts, Schmitt and McCormick rolled out the Nitazene Sanctions Act, which targets the Chinese supply chain behind the synthetic opioids. The bill would expand sanctions on persons and entities in Communist China that support the manufacturing of nitazenes and require the State and Justice Departments to develop a coordinated strategy to cut off the flow of precursor chemicals into the United States.

"Nitazenes could become the next fentanyl crisis if not stopped," Ricketts said. "It's already killed thousands of Europeans, and it's quickly making its way to our shores. The Nitazene Sanctions Act will unleash sweeping sanctions against those in Communist China who are helping to poison and kill Americans."

Schmitt echoed that warning. "Nitazenes are powerful synthetic opioids which overwhelmingly originate from Communist China. The Nitazene Sanctions Act will combat this deadly drug by unleashing devastating sanctions against any entity in Communist China that is manufacturing this deadly drug to poison and kill American citizens," he said.

DEA MAKES MASS ARRESTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FENTANYL AND METH BUST TIED TO SINALOA CARTEL

McCormick added that the scope of the problem should serve as a wake-up call. "The fact that nitazenes are oftentimes more deadly than fentanyl, which killed nearly 4,000 Pennsylvanians last year alone, should be a wake-up call to us all," he said. "We must target nitazenes before they become the next drug epidemic. These illicit drugs are extremely potent and difficult to detect."

Nitazenes belong to a class of synthetic opioids known as benzimidazole-opioids. First developed in the 1950s as experimental painkillers, they were never approved for medical use due to their extreme potency and risk of overdose. The most common forms are estimated to be five to nine times stronger than fentanyl, and some variants can be up to 40 times more potent, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Once obscure laboratory compounds, nitazenes began appearing around 2019 in seizures and toxicology reports across North America, Europe and beyond. Because they often contaminate counterfeit pills or powders without users' knowledge, even trace amounts can be lethal.

Recent data from the National Drug Early Warning System (NDEWS) highlight the rapid rise of nitazene-related overdoses across the country. Between January 2023 and April 2025, emergency medical services recorded 18,449 encounters tied to nitazene use — 99.4% non-fatal and 0.6% fatal — with the highest rates concentrated in the Southeast. The DEA's Houston office has also warned of a spike in fatal poisonings involving nitazenes in Houston, Austin and San Antonio.

The true scale of the crisis, however, remains difficult to measure. Many state toxicology systems and CDC overdose tracking programs do not yet distinguish nitazenes from other synthetic opioids, leaving significant blind spots in federal data.

Unlike opium-based narcotics, nitazenes and other synthetic opioids can be produced anywhere using widely available precursor chemicals. U.S. officials have warned that Chinese chemical manufacturers can easily synthesize these compounds — and that Mexican cartels could exploit their supply networks with Chinese partners to funnel nitazenes into the U.S.

Together, the three new Senate bills — the DETECT Nitazenes Act, Nitazene Control Act, and Nitazene Sanctions Act — mark a coordinated Republican effort to confront the emerging threat from multiple angles: technology, law enforcement and international pressure.

While fentanyl remains the leading driver of America's overdose epidemic, lawmakers and health officials are increasingly concerned that nitazenes could represent a new and even deadlier frontier in the synthetic-opioid crisis — one that the GOP senators say must be confronted before it spirals out of control.

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is drifting around its record heights on Thursday, as Wall Street sifts through mixed developments on everything from the U.S.-China trade war to profits for Big Tech behemoths. 

The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% and edged a bit further from its all-time high set on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 179 points, or 0.4%, as of 12:54 p.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9% from its record set the day before. 

Stocks were also mixed in Europe and Asia, coming off a much anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed his talk with China's leader, Xi Jinping, as a “12” on a scale of zero to 10, and Trump said he would cut tariffs on China. But while the talks may offer some stability for the near term, major tensions remain between the two countries. 

Plus, stocks had already run to records earlier this week on expectations for potentially big improvements coming out the Trump-Xi talks. 

“The result was fine, but fine isn't good enough given the expectations going in,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “The results were more like small gestures instead of a grand bargain.”

Also feeling the burden of high expectations were some of Wall Street's most influential stocks. 


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




Meta Platforms dropped 10.2%, cutting into what had been a 28.4% jump for the year so far. Analysts said investors were likely perturbed by how much Facebook's parent company said it's planning to spend in 2026. Companies across the industry have been on an investment spree to build out their artificial-intelligence capabilities, and the concern is whether it will all pay off. 




Microsoft sank 2.9% even though it reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Analysts pointed to how it also expects to spend more on investments in 2026 than in 2025, while growth for its Azure business may have fallen a bit short of some investors' expectations. 

On the winning side of Big Tech was Alphabet. Shares of Google's parent company climbed 4% after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter easily topped analysts' expectations.

How such companies do matters incredibly for investors. The trio of Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft alone account for 14.5% of the total value of all the companies in the S&P 500 index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts. That means they and a handful of other Big Tech stocks can easily overshadow what hundreds of other companies are doing. 

Elsewhere on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill tumbled 15.6% after the restaurant chain pointed to all the pressures weighing on its customers, particularly younger ones and those who aren't making high incomes. Chipotle cut its forecast for an important underlying measure of sales growth this year, as CEO Scott Boatwright said that households making less than $100,000 are dining out less often because of concerns about the economy and inflation. 

He pointed specifically to 25- to 35-year-old customers, who are feeling the weight of unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower growth with respect to inflation, and he said he thinks restaurants across the industry are seeing something similar. 

Eli Lilly, meanwhile, rose 3.8% after delivering stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It credited strong growth for its blockbuster Mounjaro and Zepbound drugs for diabetes and obesity, and it raised its full-year forecasts for revenue and profit. 

Sherwin-Williams was one of the biggest reasons the Dow Jones Industrial Average was doing better than other indexes, because the paint company can have a bigger influence on it than on the S&P 500. It rose 1.1% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. That was despite what CEO Heidi Petz called a “demand environment that remains softer for longer.”

Visa also helped lift the Dow after adding 3.2% following its own better-than-expected profit report. 

In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady as traders continue to pare expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate in December.

Traders are still betting on it as likely, according to data from CME Group, but no longer as a near certainty. That's after Fed Chair Jerome Powell admonished markets the day before, saying a December cut “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.”

The Fed has lowered its main interest rate twice this year in hopes of boosting the slowing job market. But officials have also said they may have to halt cuts if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level,  because lower rates can worsen inflation. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.08% late Wednesday and from 3.99% the day before Powell's warning.

In stock markets abroad, indexes fell 0.5% in France and fell by less than 0.1% in Germany after the European Central Bank decided not to move its main interest rate.

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up by less than 0.1% after the Bank of Japan likewise held rates steady.

A three-star general left the Pentagon earlier this month due to “sustained tensions” with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine.

Lt. Gen. Joe McGee retired early from his post on the Joint Staff's Strategy, Plans, and Policy team, CNN reported, citing anonymous sources. No date was provided for his resignation, but the report indicated tensions had been brewing between McGee and the Pentagon's top leadership for a while.

McGee reportedly disagreed with Hegseth and Caine over the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent airstrikes in the Caribbean region, where boats allegedly run by drug cartels have been targeted and destroyed by the United States military since early September.

The general's stalled promotion has also been a source of tension. McGee was said to be nominated by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the Joint Staff, a three-star officer who assists the Joint Chiefs of Staff. However, he was never renominated by President Donald Trump.

The Pentagon confirmed McGee's exit, while briefly criticizing CNN's reporting about the circumstances behind his departure.

“General McGee is retiring, and the War Department is grateful for his service,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner. “CNN's claims regarding his retirement are 100% fake news.”

The Washington Examiner also contacted the Joint Chiefs of Staff for comment.

In his former role, McGee advised Caine on military strategies involving risk assessment and crisis contingency planning.

There have been reports of the Trump administration pushing out other senior military officials, including former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman CQ Brown and retired Air Force General Tim Haugh, because the administration believed the officials were not aligned with Hegseth's agenda.

Navy Adm. Alvin Holsey, who headed U.S. Southern Command, announced his retirement earlier this month after reportedly disagreeing with Pentagon leadership over the Caribbean drug strikes. He will retire in December, just one year into his job.

HEGSETH PLEDGES TO RESHAPE WAR DEPARTMENT AFTER ‘DECADES OF DECAY'

During his address to top military leaders late last month, Hegseth talked about enforcing merit-based standards across the department and eliminating its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. He also boasted about firing multiple senior officials since taking office in January.

“I have fired a number of senior officers since taking over — the previous chairman, other members of the Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders, and other commanders,” Hegseth said at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. “The rationale for me has been straightforward. It's nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create or even benefited from that culture.”

Two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Busch and his wife are warning the public about an alleged life insurance scheme that they claim caused their family to lose more than $8.5 million.

Busch and his wife, Samantha, released statements Tuesday announcing that they have taken legal action against Pacific Life for allegedly "designing and promoting a series of complex indexed universal life (IUL) policies as ‘tax-free retirement plans' that were misrepresented as safe, self-funding investment vehicles."

"According to the filing, the defendants used misleading illustrations, undisclosed costs, and false promises of guaranteed multipliers and controllable charges to induce the Busches to pay more than $10.4 million in premiums, resulting in net out-of-pocket losses exceeding $8.58 million," a press release from RP Legal, which is representing the Busches, said.

Busch said in a statement provided by the firm that he had been dragged into a "financial trap."

"I never thought something like this could happen to us," he said. "These policies were sold to us as part of a retirement plan—something safe and secure that would grow tax-free and protect our family long after racing. We trusted the people who sold them, and the name Pacific Life. But the reality is far different. What was pitched as retirement income turned out to be a financial trap."

Samantha Busch echoed that sentiment, adding that their situation "makes me worry about families, retirees, and anyone trying to plan responsibly for their future who may be hearing those same promises."

"If this could happen to us, it could happen to anyone, and I want people to be aware and protect their financial future," she added. "If sharing our experience helps even one person protect their financial future, then speaking out is worth it."

IULs are a type of life insurance that allows policyholders to build cash value based on a stock market index's performance while still offering a death benefit, but their returns are limited by caps and reduced by fees, and they depend on complex formulas that can make them riskier than they appear.

The Busches claim that the policies were riskier and more complex than they were led to believe.

"This is not just an issue for celebrities or professional athletes. It is an issue for everyday Americans," attorney Robert G. Rikard said in a statement. "Across the country, teachers, small business owners, and retirees are being sold complex life-insurance contracts as if they were simple, risk-free retirement plans. The danger lies not in the product itself, but in how it's marketed and presented as guaranteed paths to retirement security. Kyle and Samantha's experience is a clear example of how easily that can happen. Our mission is to hold the industry accountable and help families recover what they have lost."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Pacific Life declined to comment on the specifics of the suit. 

"To maintain the privacy and trust of our clients, Pacific Life does not comment on the specifics of individual matters. For nearly 160 years, we have committed ourselves to fairness, integrity, and acting in the best interests of our clients – and we continue to take this responsibility very seriously. Pacific Life offers several different life insurance products, each with unique characteristics that are important to understand before making a decision. We encourage individuals to visit our website or contact their financial advisor to learn more about our products."

Emily Fertitta pleads for a bipartisan look at how the bureau has suppressed voices of dissent through its internal adjudication processes.

The FBI has a longstanding pattern of using its internal review processes to dissuade whistleblowers, a former special agent told Fox Digital.

What started in 2021 as a workplace conflict for Special Agent Valentine Fertitta snowballed into a yearslong dispute when Fertitta escalated concerns about his treatment, his wife said. 

Emily Fertitta, who also served in the bureau under the Biden administration, believes that's emblematic of a larger problem. 

"A very simple equal employment opportunity case has grown into this huge whistleblower case that has implications for everybody," she said. "National security retaliation is huge for so many whistleblowers."

After a deployment overseas, Valentine Fertitta returned home with serious injuries that limited his participation at work for the FBI. After a manager took issue with his reduced productivity, the agency blocked him from consideration of a promotion in 2021 — a decision Valentine Fertitta believed violated the FBI's policies and federal employment law, according to the family's attorney. 

"Val's supervisor at the time — this guy is just obsessed with statistics," Matthew Crotty, the Fertitta family's legal counsel said. "He was a troublemaker, really obsessed with advancing in his career." 

But that was only the beginning of Valentine Fertitta's conflict with the FBI.

Believing that his management had violated government protections against injured employees among other employment safeguards for veterans, Valentine Fertitta filed a whistleblower complaint. Not long after, he received his first-ever negative work performance review, was denied access to trainings, was asked to provide past, present and future medical records and more, according to his wife.

Exasperated, Valentine Fertitta appealed his case to the Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management (OARM) — the FBI's internal body charged with acting as a backstop against whistleblower retaliation. 

Less than a month later, the FBI opened an evaluation of his security clearance, according to their lawyer.

"The key thing is the timing," Crotty said. "Within two weeks of Val starting this OARM process, the FBI starts to investigate Val's suitability to hold a top secret security clearance."

"The way the FBI can essentially fire you without saying ‘you're fired' is to just revoke your clearance," Crotty added. 

Emily Fertitta explained that the process carries with it some punitive effects. Among them: suspension of pay during the time of review.

Emily Fertitta said the investigation also put pressure on her. As a part of the security clearance evaluation, she said the bureau asked her to testify against her husband in what was going to be a three-day interview. When she asked for legal counsel, she said the FBI denied her request. 

Emily Fertitta decided to quit the agency. She said her husband's clearance dispute is ongoing.

The Supreme Court has granted the FBI broad powers to make decisions about its employees and their security clearances, with few exceptions. That means that for their duration at the bureau, FBI agents have no external recourse to appeal a clearance dispute. Crotty said that goes for a lot of the internal review measures inside the FBI.

"It doesn't matter who's in the White House. It's a structural FBI thing. It's been going on since Hoover," Crotty said, referring to the FBI's original director. "This is an agency that makes loyalty part and parcel to its core — and if you go against it by trying any of these internal processes — [they] are going to get back at you."

"This is what lawmakers need to know," Crotty said. 

Emily Fertitta said other whistleblowers face similar opposition, pointing to public reporting provided by the FBI. 

The OARM, the body that Valentine Fertitta had appealed to shortly before his clearance evaluation began, records complaints that the FBI has received from whistleblowers who believe they've faced some sort of retribution. In the past 10 annual reports submitted to Congress, OARM has received 107 complaints. In that time, OARM identified nine cases of retaliation. 

"This is much bigger than Val and Emily. It applies to so many other people who just don't have the ability to speak up," Emily Fertitta said. 

She said the Biden administration did little to address the issue and hopes that, amid Trump's openness to retool government structures, the new administration will follow through on promises of reform.

"Congress could fix this without costing the taxpayer a dime by saying hey, if you're a reservist at the FBI, you can go to federal court — just like an Amazon worker can — you can make that claim before a federal jury in federal court. That's what needs to change," Crotty said.

"Having a couple of jury verdicts that nail the FBI on retaliation; once the FBI starts cutting checks for millions of dollars in jury verdicts, that's how stuff gets fixed," he added.

According to Crotty, the Fertitta family has a pending civil case against the FBI. That litigation faces delays amid pending internal FBI deliberations over Mr. Fertitta's security clearance, he said.

The FBI declined to comment on the Fertitta case.

            One of the sports world's most intriguing start-up companies is renewing its long-term partnership with its first-ever major professional sports league partner.
    


            The NBA and Cosm, the entertainment company that's reinventing the sports bar with what they like to call “shared reality,” announced Thursday an extended partnership to air live NBA games in Cosm's domes. The IMAX-esque experience allows Cosm's customers to watch live sporting events on its unique 87-foot-diameter, 12L+ LED screens that have gone viral for offering a first-of-its-kind experience for fans.
    


            The NBA was Cosm's first-ever league partner long before the company opened its first location in Los Angeles in 2024. The two entities are now set to work together into 2030 and beyond.

            “Our ambition is to give another option for fans that might be out of the marketplace or their favorite team is on the road, or they haven't been able to get to those courtside seats or lower bowl seats,” said Jeb Terry, Cosm's president and CEO, in an interview with CNN Sports. “So, it's really complementary, I would say, to the NBA's ambition of opening up access, giving fans more ways to celebrate the game, and providing other opportunities to lean into that action.
    


            “And that's why it was really an obvious opportunity from the beginning. Because not only is that the innovative spirit of the league, the tech-forward approach, but the same way we approach it by leveraging technology to augment that fan experience and give more optionality, so fans can just lean in and celebrate wherever they are, whether they're in-market, out-of-market, wherever that may be.”
    


            The extended partnership will allow Cosm to produce and distribute live NBA games at Cosm's venues for at least the next five years. That means Cosm will be able to send its in-house production team, which is responsible for the unique views provided to viewers at their domes, to key national TV games, events from next year's All-Star Weekend, the playoffs and NBA Finals.
    


            Teddy Kaplan, NBA vice president and head of new media partnerships at the league, said working with Cosm has been a no-brainer for his team from the start.
    


            Kaplan was on a ski trip to Park City, Utah, in 2022 when he got the opportunity to visit Cosm's headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. He diverted from that vacation for a bit to see what the company was working on and was introduced to Cosm's experience center for the first time, which gave him an idea of what the finished domes would be like.
    


            He left that meeting wowed.
    


            “I got there and I said, ‘Oh my God, this is, this is the future. This is what we need,'” Kaplan told CNN Sports.
    


            He added, “Our fans are young, tech-savvy, diverse, and they push us to be innovative. And as you'll see, across our portfolio of distribution points, we're always looking for ways to innovate the way fans watch our game, whether it's alt streams, whether it's via virtual reality, whether it's with our social partners. Cosm is the perfect piece in our broader network here.”

            The initial partnership with the NBA, agreed to in February 2023, was an important inflection point in the company's history, according to Terry.
    


            That kind of high-profile partner gave Cosm – at that point about a year-and-a-half from opening its first location near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – much needed legitimacy as it entered into discussions with other leagues and broadcast companies that hold the rights to sporting events aired in the US.
    


            “When you're building companies, there's always these pivotal moments along the way. You get the technology sorted. You're like, ‘OK, it works.' Then you have to work on getting market adoption, and there's a lot of ways to do that with our business,” Terry said.
    


            “Partnerships are paramount. They are critical to how we bring this to life with our fans. And so, having the NBA as our first, it was a great moment for our company to announce it … and then get that word of mouth trending within the industry and then pushing that forward. And so, you look to have all these credible moments along the way in this growth phase. And this was one of the big ones.”
    


            The next move for Cosm is scaling up into more locations. It currently has domes open at that initial location in Inglewood and one in Dallas. Three more locations have been announced in Detroit, Cleveland and Atlanta.
    


            That puts the company in five NBA cities and looking to expand to more, including overseas locations that could put international fans closer to professional American basketball in a way that's much cheaper and easier than flying across an ocean to get into an NBA arena.
    


            Given that Cosm is able to show its customers views that they would have to pay dearly to afford – the courtside view from the scorer's table, underneath the hoops in the front row at either end of the floor – all from the comfort of a sports bar environment, Kaplan said the hope is that NBA fans will be able to approximate that experience from the domes.
    


            “We like to use the stat that 99% of our fans will never make it to an NBA game, and that's in the US. When you go global, it's 99.99%. And when you think about sitting courtside, basically 100%, right?” Kaplan said.
    


            “And so having Cosm as a tool to bring fans closer to the game and speak to those tech-savvy fans is really perfect for us.”

If the Republican justices apply the same rules to Trump that they did to Biden, Trump's tariffs must fall.

As recently as one year ago, the Supreme Court's Republican majority was determined to reduce executive power.

Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in the White House, and the Republican justices were very concerned that the executive branch was claiming “highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.” To keep the executive in check, the Republican justices invented a legal doctrine, known as “major questions,” which was supposed to prevent the president or his subordinates from enacting new policies with “vast ‘economic and political significance'” — at least without getting very specific authorization from Congress first.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Flash forward to the present, and these same Republicans are about to reveal whether this major questions doctrine was an honest effort to allocate power among the three branches of US government, or whether it was simply something they made up to stymie a Democratic president from enacting his agenda.

On November 5, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in two cases — Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — both of which challenge the ever-shifting tariffs that Trump has imposed on US imports.

In both cases, the challengers argue that various provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), the law Trump relied upon when he instituted his tariffs, do not actually permit those tariffs to exist. Several of these statutory arguments, as numerous federal judges have now concluded, are quite strong.

But it's the Republican justices' major questions doctrine that should remove any doubt that Trump's tariffs are illegal. According to the center-right Tax Foundation, Trump's tariffs “are the largest US tax increase as a percent of GDP (0.55 percent for 2025) since 1993.” The Tax Foundation estimates that they will “raise $2.9 trillion in revenue over the next decade on a conventional basis and reduce US GDP by 0.7 percent” — and that's not counting the money Americans are losing because other countries respond to US tariffs by imposing similar trade barriers on the United States.

The tariffs, in other words, are clearly a matter of “vast economic and political significance.”

Trump's tariffs also appear to divide more traditional, fiscally conservative Republicans from the president's MAGA loyalists.

One of the primary lawyers challenging the tariffs is Michael McConnell, a former George W. Bush appointee to a federal appellate court. At a Federalist Society conference on executive power last spring, numerous speakers criticized the tariffs and questioned their legality. One of many Republicans who joined briefs opposing the tariffs is former Sen. John Danforth (R-MO), an early mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas.

The major questions doctrine itself is the culmination of a decade-long project by many Republican lawyers and judges to limit executive power. Beginning in the Obama administration, the Federalist Society's annual lawyers conference became a showcase of various proposals to limit the president's power to make policy changes without seeking new legislation from Congress — even when an existing statute seemed to authorize the president's action.

Admittedly, many of the same Republican judges and advocates also embraced other legal theories seeking to expand presidential authority — the most notable is the unitary executive theory, which Trump has wielded aggressively to take control of federal agencies that are supposed to have a degree of independence from the president. But this effort to centralize control over federal agencies in the White House happened in parallel with a broader effort to diminish the executive's power to set policy,

V.O.S. Selections and its sister case, in other words, are a loyalty test for the Republican justices. If those justices hew to the legal views they expressed during the Biden administration, or if they remain aligned with the Republican Party's traditional approach to economic policy, then they must strike down the tariffs.

Similarly, if they want to demonstrate their loyalty to the current leader of their political party, the Republican justices will need to write an opinion that simply cannot be squared with their Biden-era decisions.

The IEEPA permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” By law, however, the president may only use this power to “deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.”

The various plaintiffs challenging these tariffs make several arguments that this statutory language does not permit Trump to impose his tariffs. First, they claim that the power to “regulate” imports does not include the power to tax them, pointing to a famous 1824 Supreme Court decision that said “the power to regulate commerce” is “entirely distinct from the right to levy taxes and imposts.”

Second, the plaintiffs argue that Trump has not identified an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that can justify his tariffs. Trump claims that most of his tariffs are needed to address the US trade deficit: the fact that the United States buys more goods from foreign nations than it sells. But the United States has had a trade deficit since the mid-1970s, and Trump's own executive order announcing many of his tariffs concedes that they are “persistent” and “a feature of the global trading system.”

So it's tough to see how trade deficits qualify as unusual or extraordinary.

Additionally, the plaintiffs point out that there is a separate federal law governing when the president may impose tariffs to deal with trade deficits. This law only permits tariffs of up to 15 percent, and it stipulates that they must expire after 150 days. This limited grant of authority, they argue, displaces any power to impose tariffs targeting trade deficits that the president would otherwise have under IEEPA.

Trump's lawyers, for what it is worth, have plausible rebuttals to at least some of these arguments. They note, for example, that when Congress enacted IEEPA, the only federal appellate decision concerning whether the word “regulate” includes the power to impose tariffs concluded that it does. Courts sometimes presume that, when Congress uses a word that has an established legal meaning, it wants that word to keep that same meaning.

But any uncertainty about how to read IEEPA should be resolved by the major questions doctrine, which says that courts should avoid reading federal laws to give the executive powers of “vast ‘economic and political significance'” if at all possible.

The major questions doctrine is very new, and has only ever been used against one president: Biden. But in 2014, the Republican justices did apply an early version of it to a hypothetical EPA regulation, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. That case also provides a pithy, one-sentence summary of this brand new legal doctrine: “We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'”

Under Biden, however, the doctrine grew in scope. In Biden v. Nebraska (2023), for example, the Republican justices struck down a student loan forgiveness plan that was clearly authorized by an act of Congress. The Heroes Act, the law at issue in Nebraska, gave the education secretary broad authority to “waive or modify” student loan obligations during a national emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic “as the Secretary deems necessary.”

Indeed, the Heroes Act permitted the education secretary to act “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” that Act. So it is hard to see how Congress could have been clearer that it intended to give the secretary — not the Supreme Court — the final word on student loans.

Nevertheless, the Republican justices deemed the Biden administration's student loans plan — which they estimated would cost “between $469 billion and $519 billion” — to be too ambitious to exist. The “economic and political significance” of such a plan, they concluded, “is staggering by any measure.”

But if the rule is that a presidential administration may not create a new policy that involves hundreds of billions of dollars, then Trump's tariffs obviously must fall. Trump's own lawyers claim that his new import taxes will “reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years.” More reliable sources, like the Budget Lab at Yale, estimate that Trump's import taxes will “raise about $2.5 trillion over 2026-35.” That's five times the amount of money at stake in Nebraska.

To this, Trump's lawyers respond that the Supreme Court should simply create some new exceptions to their brand-new major questions doctrine, to make sure that the doctrine doesn't apply to Trump. They argue, for example, that the doctrine should not apply to policies that are enacted by an order from the president himself, rather than a Cabinet secretary or some other official that works for the president. They also claim, quoting from an opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that “the major questions canon has not been applied by this Court in the national security or foreign policy contexts.”

It's hard to rebut these arguments, because the major questions doctrine is not law — or, at least, it is not law in the sense that it derives from any particular statute or constitutional provision. It's merely something the Republican justices made up. So there's no legal provision that anyone can read to determine how the major questions doctrine should apply in, say, the national security context. As Thomas wrote in a recent concurring opinion, “judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply,” because those courts “lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis.”

These doctrines often lead to what Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called “Calvinball jurisprudence,” where the rules change based on the justices' personal preferences or some other extra-legal factor.

In any event, if it was legitimate for the Republican justices to make up a brand new legal rule that they could use to sabotage Biden, then it must be equally legitimate for those same justices to make up arbitrary limits on their new rule, limits that conveniently allow a Republican president to do whatever he wants.

But if that happens, there would be little doubt that the Court is placing partisanship ahead of the law. One of the cardinal principles of any system rooted in the rule of law — a principle that stretches all the way back to Aristotle — is that similar cases should be treated similarly. The president's powers cannot change simply because a different political party controls the White House.

With federal SNAP food assistance set to run dry this weekend amid the protracted U.S. government shutdown, Louisiana, New Mexico and Vermont became the latest states Wednesday to announce help for low-income households that rely on the funds to eat.

They join states from New York to Nevada in scrambling to find ways to get food to people who are increasingly anxious and will otherwise go hungry without their normal monthly payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

In Louisiana, where nearly one in five residents receive SNAP benefits, lawmakers authorized $150 million in state funding Wednesday to help avoid Saturday's expected interruption. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry backed a bipartisan measure to allow most of the state's nearly 800,000 SNAP recipients to receive their full monthly benefit amount. 

“Our priorities are specific, we're going to protect the most vulnerable population in Louisiana — which is our kids, disabled and elderly,” Landry said.

But officials said that while program details are still incomplete, the effort will likely exclude “able bodied” adults who aren't caring for children or don't share a household with elderly or disabled members — about 53,000 recipients. 

Elsewhere, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Wednesday that her state will provide $30 million in emergency food assistance to residents through EBT cards, backfilling SNAP benefits temporarily. The Democrat leads a state where 21% of the population relies on SNAP — the highest rate in the nation. Officials said the benefit would cover about 30% of what residents usually see at the start of the month.


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




New Mexico held a two-day special legislative session at the outset of the shutdown to shore up food banks and pantries with $8 million in new funding, along with $17.5 million in SNAP-related costs to offset cuts under President Donald Trump's spending and tax cut bill. 




The emergency funding is expected to last about 10 days, while Democratic state House Speaker Javier Martínez said the Legislature is positioned to approve more if necessary because “children going without basic food staples is an emergency.”

Lujan Grisham said state officials are aware that 10 days isn't enough but they are prepared to deal with the issue for as long as they can. 

“We're not going to let food insecurity creep into this state,” she said.

In Vermont, Republican Gov. Phil Scott and Democratic legislative leaders approved using $6.3 million in state funds to cover 15 days of SNAP benefits and provide $250,000 to food banks. The Legislature had previously put $50 million aside for such emergencies.




So far, state responses have been mixed. Some, like Rhode Island, say they will funnel reserve federal welfare funds directly onto the debit cards issued to people who buy groceries with SNAP. States including Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, West Virginia plan to boost funds to food pantries to help cover for low-income families needing food. Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo are both seeking to direct $30 million in state funds to cover food assistance.

Other states such as Alabama, Texas, Kansas and Florida have not acted.

In Nebraska, the state Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement Tuesday announcing it would pause SNAP benefits the next day. It said it is “actively coordinating with food banks, nonprofit partners, and community organizations,” and listed area food banks for those seeking help.

Leaving people to fend for themselves will mean the most vulnerable — like children and the elderly — will go hungry, said Tashara Leak, a registered dietitian and nutritional researcher and professor at Cornell University. She also serves on New York State Council on Hunger and Food Policy that routinely meets with New York's governor.

“The panic is already starting,” Leak said, adding families with limited resources are “already rationing food in preparation to not receive benefits on Nov. 1.”

Despite the best efforts of states, local governments and food charities, it won't be enough to cover what the federal government does under SNAP. Even states with fat budget surpluses couldn't cover the SNAP tab much beyond November. That tab nationwide totaled about $100 billion in 2024.

“There's no way for the states to be able to fill in the gap for the month of November, especially with such short notice,” Leak said.

Democrats have called on the Trump administration to release contingency funding to ensure uninterrupted SNAP payments, but it has declined to do so. 

Recently, a group of Democratic state officials filed suit, asking a judge to require the Trump administration to keep funding SNAP benefits. They say that the government is required to use one contingency fund, which has around $5 billion, for that purpose and that another larger reserve fund of about $23 billion is also available. A hearing is set for Thursday in federal court in Boston.

Delays in benefits are nearly certain for most beneficiaries whose debit cards are replenished early in the month — even in states that are planning to pay for benefits or if a judge orders the federal government to load the cards immediately.

The legal filing asserted that in California, for instance, there will be a one-day delay in benefits available for every day after Oct. 23 that the process of putting money on cards hasn't begun. That means that if a judge orders the program to continue on Thursday, the first cards would likely not be ready until around Nov. 10.

Christopher Bosso, a Northeastern University professor of public policy and political science who has published a book about SNAP, said even a delay would be deeply felt. Beneficiaries often stock up on groceries at the start of the month, and stores often hold sales then that encourage shoppers to do so.

“We're about to find out how much this program matters, in ways that people hadn't realized,” Bosso said.

President Donald Trump commented on his “truly great meeting” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and announced several important revelations on Thursday aboard Air Force One.  

Trump said the rare earth element dispute between China and the United States has been resolved. According to reports, a Trump administration official said the U.S. and China had come to “an understanding” and that China was not going to “impose the rare earth controls that they proposed. “

“We have a deal. Now every year we'll renegotiate the deal,” Trump said on Air Force One. “All of the rare earth has been settled, and that's for the world.”

As a result, China will halt export controls on rare earth materials. The export controls initially went into effect on Oct. 9 but will now be delayed a year, after reaching an agreement at the summit. Rare earths are a vital part of U.S. manufacturing, necessary for products including turbines, electric vehicles, smartphones, medical imaging equipment, submarines, and satellites. 

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce confirmed the progress between the two countries in a statement regarding the Trump-Xi summit.

“The leaders of China and the United States just met in Busan, South Korea, and discussed in depth issues such as China-U.S. economic and trade relations, agreeing to strengthen cooperation in economic and trade fields,” read the statement. “China is willing to work with the United States to jointly safeguard and implement the important consensus reached at the meeting between the two heads of state.”

“The U.S. will suspend its 50% penetration rule on export controls, announced on Sept. 29, for one year,” the Commerce Ministry spokesperson noted. “China will suspend its related export control measures announced on Oct. 9 for one year and will study and refine specific plans.”

Trump elaborated on Thursday's meeting with Xi in a post on Truth Social. 

“Additionally, China has agreed to continue the flow of Rare Earth, Critical Minerals, Magnets, etc., openly and freely,” Trump said about rare earths.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES DECREASE ON CHINA TARIFFS AFTER ‘AMAZING' MEETING WITH XI

The president also revealed that China intended to buy “American energy.” He teased that a “large-scale” deal involving Alaskan oil and gas could be in the works. It would mark a significant pivot in China's importing of U.S. energy, which fell to practically zero over the summer as tensions increased between the U.S. and China.

“China also agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy,” Trump said in his post. “In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska. Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out.”

“The agreements reached today will deliver Prosperity and Security to millions of Americans,” Trump said.

Canada could reshape the electric vehicle landscape in North America by removing its tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, a move that would open a new market for Chinese auto companies and narrow export opportunities for American manufacturers.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced earlier this week that he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. The Wire China reported that Canada is considering scrapping its tariffs on Chinese EVs amid rising tensions between President Donald Trump and Carney.

Canada followed the United States last year in imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs, as part of an effort to protect domestic manufacturing and curb China's dominance in the market. In response to the tariffs, China placed levies on Canadian canola oilseeds and related products.

Since Trump took office, the administration has opposed policies and tax incentives imposed by the Biden administration and Democrats to boost the EV industry. At the same time, the administration has imposed sweeping tariffs on countries such as Canada and its auto industry, prompting automakers to move production into the U.S.

For instance, General Motors has announced plans to increase truck production at plants in Indiana and shift production from Mexico to the U.S.

However, Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research for Telemetry, told the Washington Examiner that if American auto manufacturers “lose more and more of their potential export markets, then the Chinese will step in with better, cheaper products. There's no reason why consumers outside of the U.S. wouldn't want to buy those products.”

China has led the world in the EV market, offering electric and hybrid vehicles at lower prices and with more advanced features than U.S. automakers.

While China has continued to expand its EV footprint globally, the Trump administration has prioritized fossil fuels and traditional energy development. Abuelsamid said the administration's strategy could limit U.S. automakers' ability to compete in global markets.

“The risk that the industry faces if they follow what the administration seems to want them to do is that they create an island of products that they can't sell anywhere else,” Abuelsamid said.

For example, Abuelsamid said consumers in Japan would not buy a Ford F150, which has nothing to do with tariffs, but vehicles such as that do not work in places such as Tokyo.

“If the U.S. automakers don't continue to develop and pursue electric vehicles, the Chinese are going to do it,” he added.

Abuelsamid noted that in North America, several Chinese-made vehicles have been available in Mexico for many years, with those brands capturing 20% of the new vehicle market there. There are several Chinese-made EVs available in Mexico, including BYD's Dolphin Mini, which costs from $21,000 to $23,000. The Chinese EVs are an attractive product for consumers in Mexico due to their affordability.

Mexico, meanwhile, is considering increasing its tariffs on Chinese cars from 20% to 50% to protect jobs.

If Canada opens its doors to Chinese EVs, it provides those companies with another “foothold” in the North American market, Abuelsamid said.

Canada's possible rollback of tariffs on Chinese EVs is a response to trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada. Trump recently suspended trade talks with Canada and has threatened to place higher tariffs on Canadian goods after the country ran ads featuring President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.

Loren McDonald, the CEO and chief analyst at the EV charging firm Chargeonomics, told the Washington Examiner that Chinese EV companies are “drooling at the opportunity to enter Canada, because then they're basically surrounding the U.S.”

He added that “over time, it's just going to wear us down, and there's going to be factories in both markets.”

McDonald noted that China has an excess of EVs, with hundreds of companies manufacturing them. These vehicles are being exported to Europe, where they are gaining popularity, particularly brands such as BYD.

He said the next step for Chinese EV companies would be to enter the next-largest market, North America.

If a deal occurs, McDonald said Canada would encourage China to invest in the Canadian market by manufacturing there.

“Canada just doesn't want to be the dumping ground” for the excess EVs, he said.

Canada has ambitious goals for EV sales, vowing to achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle sales for all new light-duty vehicles by 2035, with interim targets of at least 20% by 2026 and at least 60% by 2030.

Trump just finished a weeklong Asia trip, during which he has been signing trade agreements with multiple Asian nations on critical minerals and rare earths. Trump also met with Xi to discuss trade tensions between the two countries.

President Donald Trump was in a positive mood after his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded on Thursday. The summit lasted just under two hours and was closed to the media.

Neither Trump nor any representative from his delegation reportedly shared much with the media after the meeting and before departing South Korea. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick was seen giving a thumbs-up to media members before boarding Air Force One to return to the U.S., NBC News reported.

While aboard Air Force One, Trump spoke to reporters but did not announce a trade deal with China, as he did after meeting with leaders of other countries on his Asia trip. However, he did call the conversation productive and said that the U.S. and China did “come to conclusion on many points” after the approximately hour and 40-minute bilateral talk. He also said he would be decreasing tariffs on China by 10%.

Trump was complimentary about Xi and the meeting, saying it was “amazing.” The president categorized it as a “12” on a scale of one to 10, according to reports.

“Zero, to 10, with 10 being the best, I'd say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One. “A lot of decisions were made … and we've come to a conclusion on very many important points.” 

TRUMP AND XI SUPERPOWER SUMMIT: HERE'S WHAT'S AT STAKE

The meeting between the leaders of the world's two superpowers was the main event on Trump's Asia trip. Geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have been high lately, with the two engaged in a trade war amid Trump's decision to increase tariffs earlier this year. The president's revelation that he would decrease Chinese tariffs lowers the amount to 47%. The decrease will go into effect immediately, Trump said.

He said his meeting with Xi was a “great success” and “great honor” and that there were tentative plans for Trump to visit China again in April, with Xi then planning a visit to the U.S. “sometime after that” either in Washington, D.C., or Palm Beach, Florida.

“He's a tremendous leader of a very powerful country,” Trump said of Xi.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Blake Snell thinks bad luck had about as much to do with his Game 5 struggles as the Toronto Blue Jays.

“Luck plays in baseball, too,” he said.

The two-time Cy Young Award winner gave up two home runs on his first three pitches, then faltered again late in a 6-1 loss Wednesday night that put the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers on the brink of a Fall Classic defeat.

The Blue Jays took a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series and can steal the title away from LA with a win Friday in Game 6 in Toronto.

Snell allowed back-to-back homers to Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the first back-to-back leadoff homers ever in a Series game. Each of the first three pitches were fastballs, and Snell's next 22 pitches after that were offspeed.

“First pitch of the game, 97 (mph) fastball up and in, he hits it 98, it goes out,” Snell said of Schneider. “Pretty unlucky. Vlad, yeah, that's just a bad pitch.” 

He said he didn't think he was giving away any cues on the type of pitch he was going to throw.

“I just think they're ambushing a fastball,” he said. “They just read swings and they're ambushing, as they should and as I thought they would.”

Snell overcame the early trouble only to give up a leadoff triple to Daulton Varsho in the fourth on a ball hit 75.6 mph.

“I'm not one to make excuses or anything close to that, but that's pretty unlucky,” he said. 




Snell couldn't finish the seventh inning. He left runners on first and third after a walk, a single and two wild pitches, and the Blue Jays leading 3-1. Still, the sellout crowd of 52,175 stood to applaud.

“Yeah, just frustrated,” he said. “I felt good, I felt strong. I've been training to be ready for this and be strong. I trust me.”

Edgardo Henriquez replaced Snell and walked Guerrero. Addison Barger, who singled and moved up on Snell's pair of wild pitches, scored on Henriquez's wild pitch, making it 4-1. 

“Against a really good pitcher like him, you have to be ready to hit. He's going to come after you, he's going to challenge you,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. “There's a time to grind 'em and there's a time to be ready to hit. Just pretty cool it worked out the way it did.”

Snell gave up five runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings, struck out seven and walked four on 116 pitches.

“He gave us everything he had,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “I think that early on they were just on the fastball, and you got to sort of adjust if that's the case.”

Snell began strongly in his first postseason with the Dodgers, who signed him to a $182 million, five-year deal last winter. Snell had an 0.86 ERA in his first three starts. 

In the NL Division Series, Snell allowed one hit in six shutout innings and struck out nine as the Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 to take a 2-0 series lead.

The left-hander nicknamed “Snellzilla” was stellar in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, a 2-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. He allowed one baserunner in eight shutout innings and struck out 10 while facing the minimum, something no one had done in the postseason since Don Larsen's World Series perfect game in 1956.

The Dodgers went on to sweep the Brewers in four games and go into the World Series with a shot of momentum. 

Then Snell got shelled in Game 1, losing 11-4. He gave up five runs, including three of the nine Toronto had in the sixth inning. Before that, Snell had allowed just two runs in 21 innings and struck out 27 batters.

On Wednesday, Snell got no help from a stone-cold Dodgers' offense that managed just one run and four hits. Shohei Ohtani was hitless with a strikeout. Will Smith and Mookie Betts struck out twice, while Freddie Freeman had three strikeouts.

“We all know what we're capable of, and we haven't done it for two games,” Freeman said. “They just outplayed us.”

The defense let Snell down, too.

Betts and Tommy Edman faltered in the first couple innings on potential ground-ball double plays, forcing Snell to work longer.

“Blake pitched a heck of a ball game,” Roberts said. “But, yeah, giving up bases and not converting outs when you have an opportunity to convert outs, that came back to bite us.”

GYEONGJU, South Korea (AP) — The United States will share closely held technology to allow South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine, President Donald Trump said on social media Thursday after meeting with the country's president.

President Lee Jae Myung stressed to Trump in their Wednesday meeting that the goal was to modernize the alliance with the U.S., noting plans to increase military spending to reduce the financial burden on America. 

The South Korean leader said there might have been a misunderstanding when they last spoke in August about nuclear-powered submarines, saying that his government was looking for nuclear fuel rather than weapons. 

Lee said that South Korea's current diesel-powered submarines have limits in tracking other countries' submarine activities. If South Korea was equipped with nuclear-powered submarines, he said, it could help U.S. activities in the region.

Diesel-powered submarines have to surface regularly to recharge their batteries. But nuclear-powered submarines have superior endurance and can stay submerged for a significantly longer period.

Trump said in a separate post that the country would build its nuclear-powered submarine in the Philly Shipyard, which was bought last year by South Korea's Hanwha Group.

It was unclear what the size or cost of the sub project would be, but South Korea had said as part of talks with Trump that it had committed $150 billion to invest in America's shipbuilding capacity.


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




U.S. nuclear submarine technology is widely regarded as some of the most sensitive and highly guarded technology the military possesses. The U.S. has been incredibly protective of that knowledge, and even a recently announced deal with close allies the United Kingdom and Australia to help the latter acquire nuclear submarine technology doesn't feature the U.S. directly transferring its knowledge.




Trump's post on social media comes ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country possesses nuclear submarines, and after North Korea in March unveiled for the first time a nuclear-powered submarine under construction. It is a weapons system that can pose a major security threat to South Korea and the U.S.

As Trump visited South Korea, North Korea said Wednesday that it conducted successful cruise missile tests, the latest display of its growing military capabilities.

Pentagon officials didn't immediately respond to questions about Trump's announcement on sharing the nuclear sub technology with South Korea.

The Department of War carried out yet another strike on an alleged drug vessel in the eastern Pacific on Wednesday, Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on X.

Hegseth said the vessel belonged to a “designated terrorist organization” and four male “narco-terrorists” were killed in the strike.

“This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” he wrote on X.

“Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel—and killed—during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. No U.S. forces were harmed in this strike. The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans. The Department of War will continue to hunt them down and eliminate them wherever they operate,” he concluded.

A video shared by Hegseth shows a boat being struck, setting it on fire and billowing black smoke.

Several different vessels have already been targeted this week, and the death toll of the strikes is more than 50 people so far. The Pentagon has not released evidence to prove there were drugs aboard these vessels, nor has it released the identities of any of the people aboard them.

Thousands of American troops are in the Caribbean, and more are being deployed, as the military targets vessels in the waters around South America. President Donald Trump suggested earlier this month that the U.S. war against drug cartels could be escalated to ground strikes.

The president said they would go to Congress to “explain exactly what we are doing” before launching land strikes, but added, “We don't have to do that.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) predicted land strikes in an interview last Sunday, though he did not comment on whether troops would be used. He said Trump would brief lawmakers on “potential future military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.”

He said the military will “kill the people that want to poison America.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Democrats have shown opposition to the strikes because they do not allow for a criminal trial. Paul said he's “been invited to no briefing” and that “a briefing is not enough to overcome the Constitution.”“We've had no evidence presented. So, at this point, I would call them extrajudicial killings,” he added on Fox News.

NEW US BOAT STRIKES IN EASTERN PACIFIC RAISES DEATH TOLL TO MORE THAN 50

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) told NBC News that the strikes amounted to “sanctioned murder,” and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) said they will “make us less safe.”

“I mean, starting a war against Venezuela over what is a law enforcement action does not make any sense,” Kelly added.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A California animal rights activist who took four chickens from a major Perdue Farms poultry plant was found guilty Wednesday of felony conspiracy, trespassing and other charges and faces several years in jail.

Zoe Rosenberg, 23, did not deny taking the animals from Petaluma Poultry but argued she wasn't breaking the law because she was rescuing the birds from a cruel situation. The trial lasted about seven weeks in Sonoma County, an agricultural area of Northern California.

The Santa Rosa jury took less than a day to find Rosenberg guilty on all counts. The activist with Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE, a Berkeley-based animal rights group, was on trial for two misdemeanor counts of trespassing, a misdemeanor count of tampering with a vehicle and a felony conspiracy charge.

Rosenberg said she does not regret what she did. 

“I will not apologize for taking sick, neglected animals to get medical care,” Rosenberg said following her conviction. “When we see cruelty and violence, we can choose to ignore it or to intervene and try to make the world a better place. I chose to intervene, and because I did, Poppy, Ivy, Aster, and Azalea are alive today. For that, I will never be sorry.”

The group named the birds and placed them in an animal sanctuary.


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




Rosenberg walked out of court wearing an ankle monitor and briefly spoke to supporters, who were holding signs that read “Prosecute Petaluma Poultry” and “Right to Rescue.” She told them she would immediately head to the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office and report animal cruelty at Petaluma Poultry.




“We're going to go now and report Petaluma Poultry and ask them to please finally give justice to these animals,” she said. 

Rosenberg's attorney, Chris Carraway, said the district attorney's office was ignoring criminal animal cruelty in Sonoma County factory farms and that he plans to appeal the verdict. 

“Sonoma County spent over six weeks and hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to protect a multi-billion-dollar corporation from the rescue of four chickens worth less than $25,” Carraway said in a statement. “No doubt, the District Attorney's office would never have spent a fraction of this time or money if the chickens had been dead in a supermarket meat case.”

Rosenberg's sentencing is set for Dec. 3, when she faces a maximum jail sentence of 4 1/2 years, Sonoma County District Attorney Carla Rodriguez said. 

Rodriguez said in a statement the verdict affirms no one is above the law.

“While we respect everyone's right to free expression, it is unlawful to trespass, disrupt legitimate businesses, and endanger workers and animals in pursuit of a political or social agenda,” she said. 

Petaluma Poultry has said that DxE is an extremist group that is intent on destroying the animal agriculture industry. The company says the animals were not mistreated.

“The jury's verdict makes it clear: personal beliefs don't justify breaking the law,” Herb Frerichs, general counsel of Petaluma Poultry, said in a statement. “DxE members admitted to planning and carrying out illegal acts — including break-ins, theft of private data, and stealing livestock — under the guise of activism and to gain publicity.”

Frerichs said the company supports the right to free speech and lawful protests, but this was not that.

Rosenberg testified she disguised herself as a Petaluma Poultry worker using a fake badge and earpiece to take the birds, and then posted a video of her actions on social media. 

Petaluma Poultry is a subsidiary of Perdue Farms — one of the United States' largest poultry providers for major grocery chains.

The co-founder of DxE was convicted two years ago for his role in factory farm protests in Petaluma.

U.S. lawmakers have tried four times since September last year to close what they called a glaring loophole: China is getting around export bans on the sale of powerful American AI chips by renting them through U.S. cloud services instead.

But the proposals prompted a flurry of activity from more than 100 lobbyists from tech companies and their trade associations trying to weigh in, according to disclosure reports.

The result: All four times, the proposal failed, including just last month.

As leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping prepare for a long-heralded meeting Thursday, the sale of U.S. technology to China is among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake. But the tough talk about China obscures a deeper story: Even while warning about national security and human rights abuse, the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies and surveillance companies, an Associated Press investigation has found.

And time after time, despite bipartisan attempts, Congress has turned a blind eye to loopholes that allow China to work around its own rules, such as cloud services, third-party resellers, and holes in sanctions passed after the Tiananmen massacre. For example, despite U.S. export rules around advanced chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024 to bolster its homegrown industry, a report from a congressional committee this month warned. 

This reluctance to act reflects the tremendous wealth and power of the tech industry, which is more visible than ever under the Trump administration. And in recent months, the president himself has struck grand deals with Silicon Valley firms that even more closely tie the U.S. economy to tech exports to China, giving taxpayers a direct stake in the profits for the first time.


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion.

Longtime Chinese activist Zhou Fengsuo said the U.S. government is letting American companies set the agenda and ignoring how they help Beijing surveil and censor its own people. In 1989, Zhou was a student leader during the Tiananmen protests, where hundreds and possibly thousands were shot and killed by the Chinese government. Zhou was arrested and imprisoned.

Now a U.S. citizen, Zhou testified before Congress in 2024, calling on Washington to investigate the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. An AP investigation in September found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China's surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known.

“It's driven by profit, and that's why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I'm extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.” 

The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance. 

They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues.

Tech companies argue that further export restrictions will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence. 

“Continuing to ban U.S. computing from commercial markets only benefits foreign competition and undercuts President Trump's efforts to create jobs, reduce the trade deficit, and grow the economy,” Nvidia said in a statement.

Nvidia has also said that it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed its H20 AI chip for police surveillance. 

Intel, which partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company as recently as last year, has said the company follows export control policies, and did not address details of its deal with the U.S. government. 

“The U.S. government's investment is a passive ownership, with no board representation, governance or information rights,” Intel said in a statement.

AMD did not respond. The White House and the Commerce and State departments also did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The AP investigation was based on dozens of open record requests, hundreds of pages of congressional testimony, lobbying disclosures and dozens of interviews with current and former Chinese and American executives, politicians, and former federal officials.

Under the cloud services loophole, Chinese companies barred from accessing cutting-edge chips can use Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services overseas instead to train their AI models. Microsoft and AWS also both advertise the capacity to store video surveillance footage on their cloud services for Chinese customers.

For example, SDIC Contech, a state-owned tech company that works with AI, sought access to AWS and Microsoft Azure big data analytics services, procurement bids show. And Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft.

Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China's two largest surveillance companies, use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad, according to marketing material on the company websites. Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure, according to a post on Hikvision's website this year. 

Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft's policies and doesn't support China's access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole.

Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn't include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed.

The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce asked for comment on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015, it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products, but most fell through. In 2024, it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success.

Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies.

“I think we've been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.” 

“What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what's behind the fact we haven't made as much progress.”

The first round of U.S. prohibitions on Chinese police came after the Tiananmen massacre and applied to “crime control and detection” equipment. They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons.

But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police. 

For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints.

In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. Smith drew parallels with IBM's sale of computing gear to Nazi Germany, which has been well documented by historians. IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.” 

Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith's proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations.

Smith's bill went nowhere.

“Money talks … When they flood certain members on strategic committees with the money, PAC money and the like, how much easier it is to listen to their narrative that somehow they're part of the reform?” said Smith.

Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee Gold Key Matching service.

In 2004, the Commercial Service invited American companies selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms in the “safety and security” market, followed by another publication later describing market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems. Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in policing trade shows, even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party. 

Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools to China's public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows. 

Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns.

“I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?'” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry.

Despite promises to nail shut Washington's revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing's surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London. He was put in charge of the office that administers U.S. export controls.

In an interview, Hirschhorn said export controls alone were an inefficient way to defend human rights.

“You can use a computer to type an order or type a love note,” he told AP. “Are you not going to sell computers to China because one out of every 10,000 of them will be used to store data about a dissident?”

In 2010, the U.S. State Department's human rights report warned of “police surveillance, harassment and detentions of activists.” Yet U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman led a mission to promote American business interests in the far-west region of Xinjiang, where authorities had arrested thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and cut internet access after deadly unrest the year before. Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment. 

That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China's central government “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems” on its website. 

A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism.

Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016.

“The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it's cameras, it's software, it's facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone's face, you blow up international trade.”

Wolf's colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered.




In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry. 

In 2021, Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden's administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf's draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China.

But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year.

The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out. 

Gulbahar Haitiwaji, an ethnic Uyghur living in France, says little has changed since she testified to Congress in 2023 urging the U.S. government to “stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people”.

Haitiwaji was arrested and detained in internment camps in Xinjiang for more than two years, after policing systems based on U.S. technology led Chinese officers to identify her as a “terrorist.” She was under constant, excruciating surveillance, with cameras watching her even in the toilet. After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year.

She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability.

“It's truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said.

Amazon is heading into its latest earnings report as the laggard of the Magnificent Seven this year, and investors are looking for some key updates that could spark new momentum.

Specifically, Wall Street wants to know more about its AI ambitions and how it plans to position itself against stiff competition from other Big Tech players like Microsoft and Alphabet. AWS, retail margins, and any lingering concerns over the impact of tariffs will also be on investors' radar.

The call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Investors will be listening for any details that CEO Andy Jassy and the company offer about Amazon's grocery business in light of a recent reboot.

In June, a memo obtained by Business Insider showed that Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go were being united under a single "One Grocery" operation eight years after Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.

The company launched a $5 private-label grocery line earlier this month aimed at luring value hunters away from Walmart and Aldi.

Wedbush has high hopes for the tech giant heading into the call, maintaining a $280 price target, up from its previous target of $250 a share.

The firm's analysts predict that it is poised for a breakout in 2026 and likely to shake off the volatility that has weighed on the stock recently. They expect Amazon to reach $99.6 billion in full-year revenue, and predict Q3 revenue of $20.1 billion.

"Heading into the print, we are most focused on AWS momentum and emerging AI monetization, rising operating margins supported by the mix shift to higher-margin revenue, capex requirements to support infrastructure and AI investments, and persistent growth within the advertising business," Wedbush analysts wrote in a preview note.

They also cited several immediate-term catalysts, including savings from automation and robotics progress, and the commercialization of Alexa's new AI capabilities.

Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito will join Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to talk about Amazon's decision this week to lay off 14,000 employees in a livestream at 2 p.m. ET. AI's role in the layoffs will be a key topic.

Got a question that you want the panel to answer? Send it to moderator Dan DeFrancesco.

Amazon said on Tuesday that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history.

It raised a big question for Wall Street: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient? Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in Thursday's Tech Memo newsletter that Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer that all-important question.

Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in Thursday's Tech Memo newsletter that Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer that all-important question. 

Revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's crucial cloud business, is the number to watch when Amazon reports this afternoon, Barr wrote.

For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to increase 18% year over year to $32.4 billion, according to Bloomberg.

UBS analysts are feeling optimistic heading into the report, although they anticipate some "noise" around operating income due to the company's recent $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC.

The bank recently raised its price target for Amazon stock from $271 to $279, maintaining its Buy rating. While analysts said that they are waiting to see investment proof points from AWS, they still see the area as a likely growth driver for Amazon, as they expect multiple headwinds to wane in the near future.

"Overall, we continue to see the potential for upside across Amazon's business segments, including e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and Kuiper / low earth orbit satellites," analysts wrote in a recent earnings preview.

Investors will want to hear more about AWS's latest AI strategy, including what it's doing to attract new customers.

Early-stage startups are skipping traditional cloud spending and heading straight to model-training tools and niche providers. These companies are Amazon's "blind spot," according to an internal document seen by Business Insider. Amazon has traditionally relied on venture capital firms to find startups that could be new clients.

AWS also hired a new vice president of security services and observability this month, a sign that the unit is trying to improve security around its AI products.

JPMorgan analysts said that while they believe Amazon has done a good job executing on retail sales and margin expansion, they're worried about its positioning in the booming generative AI space.

"There is concern around AMZN's GenAI positioning/strategy, relative gap to Azure/Google Cloud growth, & trajectory of 2H AWS growth pick-up," they said. "There is also concern around the impact of tariffs & changes to the de minimis exemption on demand & OI margins."

However, the analysts add that AWS growth acceleration will likely continue, and said that they expect AI supply chain gaps to ease, which they see as bullish for Amazon.

JPMorgan maintains an overweight rating and a $265 price target for Amazon stock.

Amazon ranks last among the Magnificent Seven tech companies — and the broader S&P 500 — when it comes to stock performance over the last five years, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli wrote in Thursday's First Trade newsletter.

Amazon's stock has returned 43% over that period, behind Meta's 168%, Alphabet's 253%, and Nvidia's mammoth 1,490%.

On Wall Street, some interpret Amazon's position on that chart as a sign that its AI strategy is struggling to compete with rivals.

BofA analysts are upbeat heading into the report, even as doubts swirl around Amazon's AI strategy.

"Given healthy retail sales, strength in Online advertising, and July AWS layoffs, we see potential for operating income upside and are 4% above Street for GAAP operating profit at $20.4bn vs $19.7bn," the analysts wrote.

The bank maintains a Buy rating on Amazon stock and a $272 price target, implying 21% upside from Wednesday's price.

Global automakers are once again bracing for production disruptions due to a potential shortage of automotive semiconductor chips, this time sparked by the Dutch government amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.

Honda Motor became the first known automaker this week to reduce production due to the problem that involves chips from Netherlands supplier Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese company Wingtech Technology Co.

The industry was hopeful that a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Asia would provide some relief, but no resolution on the chips issue has been announced.

Volkswagen on Thursday reportedly said it has until at least next week before its supplies impact production, while other major automakers have said they are monitoring the situation around the clock, attempting to mitigate disruptions.

"The chip situation from Nexperia, we have a cross-functional 'war room' in the building where I'm sitting that has this as [a] primary job," Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told investors during a quarterly call Thursday. "And every day we are pushing actions and projects to extend our period. There is a day-by-day management of what is an industrywide global issue."

Such "war rooms" have become a regular practice in the automotive industry amid supply chain disruptions, which have become more common since the Covid pandemic rattled production and deliveries of many parts, including chips, starting in 2020.

Several automotive industry insiders confirmed to CNBC that war rooms have been established in their companies, as they look into alternative purchasing methods. They included working with major suppliers in an attempt to find alternative sources as well as buying on the open market.

"Suppliers across the motor vehicle industry are working to understand the potential effects on production and supply continuity," MEMA, the largest vehicle supplier association in the U.S., said in an emailed statement. "Chips and diodes are foundational to automotive components and systems, from infotainment systems to door handles, to steering and braking. Even the absence of a single diode or chip can disrupt the manufacture of vehicles." 

The situation involving Nexperia began late last month, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.

In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that tech from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — "would become unavailable in an emergency."

China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm in Europe's auto industry.

German automakers are especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as "Tier 1s," and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said this week that carmakers were close to closing production lines because of the chip shortage, which comes four years after a shortage of such parts amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation," ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement.

The chips affected are legacy semiconductors used in basic vehicle functions such as windshield wipers and window controls — parts that lack sufficient alternative sources, according to S&P Global Mobility.

A Nexperia spokesman referred to a previous statement from the company, which summarized the ongoing situation and said it is seeking an exemption from the export restrictions and working to mitigate the impacts of the decision.

A Wingtech spokesperson on Thursday condemned the Dutch government's actions, saying the company "will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so."

"Only by restoring full control and ownership rights to the company's rightful shareholders and management, and by ceasing political interference in corporate governance, can the Dutch government begin to repair the damage to its reputation, de-escalate international tension, and safeguard its own and European economic security," the spokesperson said via an emailed statement.

Honda's production cuts impacts include all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

"We are currently managing an industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue, making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts and meet the needs of our customers," Honda said Thursday in an emailed statement, calling it a "fluid" situation.

The impacts are expected to continue to spread to other automakers if a resolution is not found.

Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley last week said the chip problem was at the forefront of conversations when he made a trip to Washington, D.C, earlier this month. He called it a "political issue," saying the company is working with the U.S. and China administrations to resolve it.

"It's an industrywide issue. A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry," said Farley, adding that automakers have gotten "really good" at maximizing component purchases such as chips following the crisis in 2021.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra made similar comments last week, calling it an "industry issue" that will hopefully be resolved soon.

"While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate," she said during the company's quarterly earnings call.

Other automotive executives from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and more have also shared similar thoughts with investors and the media.

"This is a politically induced situation ... which means that the solution to this, or the resolution to this, resides in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, in this case, with Europe kind of caught in the middle," Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said Wednesday during an earnings call.

Amazon is heading into its latest earnings report as the laggard of the Magnificent Seven this year, and investors are looking for some key updates that could spark new momentum.

Specifically, Wall Street wants to know more about its AI ambitions and how it plans to position itself against stiff competition from other Big Tech players like Microsoft and Alphabet. AWS, retail margins, and any lingering concerns over the impact of tariffs will also be on investors' radar.

The call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito will join Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to talk about Amazon's decision this week to lay off 14,000 employees in a livestream at 2 p.m. ET. AI's role in the layoffs will be a key topic.

Amazon said on Tuesday that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history.

It raised a big question for Wall Street: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient? Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in Thursday's Tech Memo newsletter that Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer that all-important question.

Revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's crucial cloud business, is the number to watch when Amazon reports this afternoon, Barr wrote.

For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to increase 18% year over year to $32.4 billion, according to Bloomberg.

UBS analysts are feeling optimistic heading into the report, although they anticipate some "noise" around operating income due to the company's recent $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC.

The bank recently raised its price target for Amazon stock from $271 to $279, maintaining its Buy rating. While analysts said that they are waiting to see investment proof points from AWS, they still see the area as a likely growth driver for Amazon, as they expect multiple headwinds to wane in the near future.

"Overall, we continue to see the potential for upside across Amazon's business segments, including e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and Kuiper / low earth orbit satellites," analysts wrote in a recent earnings preview.

Investors will want to hear more about AWS's latest AI strategy, including what it's doing to attract new customers.

Early-stage startups are skipping traditional cloud spending and heading straight to model-training tools and niche providers. These companies are Amazon's "blind spot," according to an internal document seen by Business Insider. Amazon has traditionally relied on venture capital firms to find startups that could be new clients.

AWS also hired a new vice president of security services and observability this month, a sign that the unit is trying to improve security around its AI products.

JPMorgan analysts said that while they believe Amazon has done a good job executing on retail sales and margin expansion, they're worried about its positioning in the booming generative AI space.

"There is concern around AMZN's GenAI positioning/strategy, relative gap to Azure/Google Cloud growth, & trajectory of 2H AWS growth pick-up," they said. "There is also concern around the impact of tariffs & changes to the de minimis exemption on demand & OI margins."

However, the analysts add that AWS growth acceleration will likely continue, and said that they expect AI supply chain gaps to ease, which they see as bullish for Amazon.

JPMorgan maintains an overweight rating and a $265 price target for Amazon stock.

Amazon ranks last among the Magnificent Seven tech companies — and the broader S&P 500 — when it comes to stock performance over the last five years, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli wrote in Thursday's First Trade newsletter.

Amazon's stock has returned 43% over that period, behind Meta's 168%, Alphabet's 253%, and Nvidia's mammoth 1,490%.

On Wall Street, some interpret Amazon's position on that chart as a sign that its AI strategy is struggling to compete with rivals.

BofA analysts are upbeat heading into the report, even as doubts swirl around Amazon's AI strategy.

"Given healthy retail sales, strength in Online advertising, and July AWS layoffs, we see potential for operating income upside and are 4% above Street for GAAP operating profit at $20.4bn vs $19.7bn," the analysts wrote.

"We believe Street expectations are for around 1-2% beat on US retail, AWS growth at 18-18.5% based on 3P data, and op. profit slightly above the high end of Amazon's 3Q guidance range."

The bank maintains a Buy rating on Amazon stock and a $272 price target, implying 21% upside from Wednesday's price.

Amazon is slated to post results for the third quarter after the closing bell Thursday.

Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are looking for:

Wall Street is also looking at other key revenue numbers:

AWS growth will be a major focus for investors once again, as the company faces intensifying pressure from cloud competitors Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.

Revenue at AWS is projected to expand 18.1% year over year, which is about the same growth rate as the second quarter. Google's cloud revenue accelerated 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.

AWS stumbled last week during an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites as a result. Microsoft experienced outages in its Azure cloud and 365 services on Wednesday, hours before its scheduled earnings release.

The Amazon unit is also battling the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services.

Anthropic and Google deepened their cloud partnership last week in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars, while Meta has inked hefty cloud deals with Google and Oracle in recent months.

Amazon on Wednesday opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, which was first announced last December and is intended to train and run models from Claude chatbot creator Anthropic.

Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025.

During last quarter's earnings conference call, investors grilled Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on AWS growth and AI competition.

Jassy reiterated AWS has a "pretty significant" leadership position in cloud market share, while noting that it's still "early" days in the AI industry that remains "very top heavy" with a "small number of very large frontier models."

Amazon's core retail business will also be top of mind for investors as the company gears up for the start of the holiday shopping period. Amazon said earlier this month it planned to hire 250,000 workers to staff up for peak season, the same number as the last two years.

Adobe Analytics recently projected that online holiday spending in the U.S. will jump 5.3% year over year to $253.4 billion, which is slower than last year, when online sales grew 8.7% over the same period.

During the third quarter, Amazon held its annual Prime Day deals event. Online spending reached $24.1 billion in the U.S. across the four-day stretch in July, according to Adobe, exceeding its estimates and representing growth of 30.3% year over year.

Jassy told investors last quarter that President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies haven't dented demand or driven up prices so far this year.

Amazon's third-quarter sales are expected to increase 11.9% year over year, compared with growth of 13% in the second quarter.

For the fourth quarter, analysts surveyed by LSEG are projecting sales to reach $208.1 billion, representing growth of 10.8% from a year earlier.

Amazon on Tuesday initiated massive layoffs, cutting about 14,000 roles across nearly every area of the company. Executives hinted that more cuts may be on the way in the new year as the company looks to get leaner, reduce bureaucracy and invest further in AI.

Once the job reductions are complete, they're expected to be the largest corporate cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported. Amazon laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023.

Shares of Amazon have increased 4.9% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is up approximately 24% over the same stretch.

Roblox shares sank 10% on Thursday as the company said it expects increased capital expenditures that could pressure margins.

The gaming company said it expects capital expenditures of $468 million, an increase of $158 million from prior guidance.

"Our operating margin could decline slightly year-over-year due to the combination of higher DevEx rates and the impact of infrastructure and safety related investments catching up with rapid bookings growth in the back half of 2025," the company said in a letter to shareholders.

The company's Developer Exchange Program (DevEx) lets creators exchange Robux for real money.

The gaming company's margin and spending comments overshadowed an otherwise strong third-quarter report.

Roblox's third-quarter revenue rose 48% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, while bookings surged 70% to $1.92 billion, beating LSEG estimates of $1.65 billion.

The company posted a loss of 37 cents per share, which beat analyst expectations for a loss of 49 cents per share.

"Our third-quarter results demonstrate the tremendous progress weʼve made toward our goal of capturing 10% of the global gaming market," CEO David Baszucki said in a release.

Roblox boosted booking guidance for the fiscal year to between $6.57 billion and $6.62 billion, up from its previous forecast of $5.87 billion to $5.97 billion the quarter before.

Average daily users were at 151.5 million, up 70% over the year prior, but average bookings per DAU of $12.68 missed the StreetAccount expectation of $13.24.

Rising parental concerns over online gaming and platforms, plus inquiries from lawmakers, have led to a wave of child-safety regulations within the technology sector and pressure on artificial intelligence companies to do more.

Roblox is facing multiple lawsuits alleging that the platform enables predators to sexually exploit and abuse underage victims.

Baszucki told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Thursday that safety was the company's "top priority" and it has already put in place several security measures to protect minors on the platform.

"On Roblox, there is no sharing of images, all our text is filtered, and we're really highlighting our commitment to really innovating in this space," Baszucki said.

Roblox implemented age-verification software in July that uses facial scans to estimate users' ages and place them in an appropriate age group: under 13, over 13, and over 18. Those who are over 13 can then access "trusted connections," a new communication feature that allows users to chat more freely.

The company also announced on Wednesday that it would join the Attorney General Alliance in launching a new child safety initiative, dubbed the Partnership for Youth Online Safety, which seeks to establish best practices for designing tech and deterring online child exploitation.

Some student-loan borrowers in public service might lose access to debt relief.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced that it had finalized its rule to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.

Following an executive order in March that called on the Department of Education to redefine "public service" to align with the administration's political views, the department held negotiations with stakeholders to craft the final rule. It will go into effect on July 1, 2026.

"Taxpayer funds should never directly or indirectly subsidize illegal activity," Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement, using violations of immigration law and efforts to help transgender people as examples of "illegal activity."

"With this new rule, the Trump Administration is refocusing the PSLF program to ensure federal benefits go to our Nation's teachers, first responders, and civil servants who tirelessly serve their communities," Kent said.

A fact sheet from the Department of Education said that the final rule amends the definition of a qualifying employer "to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose." In addition to immigration law violations and supporting transgender people, the department said other examples of illegal activity include patterns of discrimination and a "pattern" of state law violations.

The education secretary will determine if an employer no longer qualifies for PSLF, and employers will be provided notice and an opportunity to rebut the department's findings, the fact sheet said.

The final rule text said that although the changes "may delay or prevent loan forgiveness for a subset of borrowers, the overall design of the regulations, including advance notice, transparency around determinations, and employer recertification pathways, help prevent unexpected or retroactive harm."

Advocates for student-loan borrowers criticized the final rule and plan to take legal action. In a joint statement, advocacy groups Democracy Forward and Protect Borrowers said the rule "is a direct and unlawful attack on nurses, teachers, first responders, and public service workers across the country."

"That's why we will soon see the Trump-Vance Administration in court," they said.

Aaron Ament, president of borrower protection group Student Defense, said that the administration "is punishing public servants for their employers' perceived political views."

"We will file a lawsuit in the next few days and challenge this illegal overreach," Ament said.

Student-loan borrowers in PSLF previously told Business Insider that they're concerned about losing relief if their eligibility changes.

"I'm so close to the finish line," Jeff Hughes said. "I really hope that the program continues as is because we need some more good people out there doing good work."

The European Central Bank has kept interest rates on hold, as expected, at its latest meeting on Thursday.

The central bank held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the third consecutive time, having last cut rates in June. The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting the ECB's target rate of 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from last year's record high of 4%.

The ECB said in a statement Thursday that "inflation remains close to the 2% medium-term target and the Governing Council's assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged." "The economy has continued to grow despite the challenging global environment. The robust labour market, solid private sector balance sheets and the Governing Council's past interest rate cuts remain important sources of resilience," it said.

It cautioned, however, that "the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions."

While the euro zone inflation rate inched up to 2.2% in September, up from 2% the previous month, the rise was attributed to an increase in services prices and economists had said the central bank was likely to remain cautious about meddling with rates right now.

Expectations that the ECB would keep rates on hold were reinforced earlier Thursday when preliminary euro zone growth data showed the economy had grown 0.2% in the third quarter, from the previous three month period. The figure was above expectations and showed that economic activity remained resilient, despite prevailing uncertainty over business activity following U.S. trade tariffs.

ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters that while the services sector continued to grow — boosted by strong tourism and a pick-up in digital services — manufacturing had been "held back by higher tariffs, still heightened uncertainty and a stronger euro."

She added that the divergence between external and internal demand is "likely to persist" in the near term. "The economy should benefit from consumers spending more as real incomes rise," Lagarde noted.

"From a monetary policy point of view, we are in a good place," Lagarde told CNBC's Annette Weisbach. "Is it a fixed, good place? No. But we will do whatever is needed to make sure we stay in a good place."

After the ECB's announcement, the euro reversed earlier gains to trade 0.26% below the dollar, at $1.1571.

"What a boring announcement," Mike Coop, chief investment officer of EMEA at Morningstar Wealth, told CNBC Thursday.

"It does belie the fact that inflation actually has gone back to being pretty much well behaved ... so it's hardly surprising that they're not feeling in a rush to change rates," he told CNBC's "Decision Time."

"The bigger picture, I think, is that Europe is still adapting to the triple shocks of the removal of cheap energy, worse trade terms with the U.S. and the need to spend more on defense. On top of those three things, you also have now the U.S. sucking investment out of other parts of the world, so Europe hasn't had that stimulus, that we've seen in the U.S., to support growth," he told CNBC's Karen Tso.

The central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting, and it repeated this stance on Thursday. However, top ECB board members told CNBC this month that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end.

Martin Kocher, European Central Bank Governing Council member and governor at Austrian National Bank, said that as long as nothing "drastic" happens, Europe is "OK."

"At the moment, I think we're in a good place. So, there's no reason to change anything, as long as there are no changes that force us to do something, Kocher said, speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington.

"And if you take the larger picture, yes, the easing cycle is close to an end or at its end, but there's no reason to pre-commit at that stage."

In a separate interview, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau said he recommended "agile pragmatism" when it comes to the path for interest rates, adding: "We are in a good position ... but a good position is not a fixed position."

A majority of economists polled in mid-October by Reuters said the ECB would hold its deposit rate this year, while 45 of 79 economists polled (57%) saw no change by the end of 2026.

President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce during a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday, de-escalating a dispute over rare earths elements that had threatened to push the world's two largest economies into a full-blown trade war.

China agreed to pause for one year the sweeping export controls on rare earths announced on Oct. 9 that had touched off the dispute.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the rare earths agreement is a one-year deal that will be "very routinely extended as time goes by." The president said he plans to visit China in April and Xi will come to the U.S., either Palm Beach, Florida or Washington, D.C., at a later date

"We have a deal," Trump said. "Now, every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. But all of the rare earth has been settled, and that's for the world."

Trump said he cut tariffs effective immediately on China related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%. This reduces the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%, the president told reporters. Trump had previously threatened the slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 over its rare earths controls.

The U.S. will postpone a rule announced on Sept. 29 that blacklisted majority-owned subsidiaries of Chinese companies on an entity list, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Commerce. The U.S. and China also agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports.

Beijing had surprised the White House with strict export controls on rare earths ahead of the meeting between Trump and Xi, exploiting its dominance of the global supply chain to gain leverage over Washington.

The U.S. is dependent on China for rare earths, which are used to produce magnets that are key inputs in weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles and other applications.

China successfully used the rare earths export controls and a soybean embargo to force the U.S. to lower tariffs, Wolfe Research strategist Tobin Marcus told clients in a note.

"Xi was ready for Trump in his second term and has a powerful weapon in rare earths," Piper Sandler analysts led by Andy Laperriere told clients. "China is getting the better of the US in these recent truce negotiations."

The truce reached between the U.S. and China is not a comprehensive deal, cautioned Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to China during the Biden administration.

"Where we are is an uneasy truce in a long, still simmering trade war," Burns told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday.

It is not entirely clear what China has agreed to in key areas such as agriculture and energy purchases from the U.S. and cooperation on fentanyl trafficking.

Trump said Beijing has agreed to purchase large amounts of a soybeans, sorghum and other farm products. China will buy 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually over the next three years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business in an interview.

But China's Ministry of Commerce simply said the two sides agreed to expand agricultural trade without providing specifics.

Beijing had made promises on soybeans and fentanyl during Trump's first term, Piper Sandler analyst Laperriere said. "So it's doubtful Trump received anything in return for lowering tariffs on China," he said.

Trump said China may buy a large amount of oil and gas from Alaska, but a deal still has to be reached. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will meet with Chinese officials to see if such an agreement can be worked out, Trump said.

The president said he discussed the export of Nvidia chips with Xi and will speak with CEO Jensen Huang about it. But the discussions did not cover the most advanced Blackwell graphics processing units, Trump said. It is up to China and Nvidia to reach a deal, he said.

"I said that's really between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator," Trump said on Air Force One.

China's Ministry of Commerce said Beijing will work with the U.S. to "resolve issues related to TikTok," though no further detail was provided. Trump did not mention TikTok during his comments to reporters aboard Air Force One or in a Truth Social post about the truce with China.

President Donald Trump's call for the U.S. to resume nuclear testing after a more than 30-year pause has caught Russia's attention, with the Kremlin warning on Thursday that it would "act accordingly" if a Cold War-era moratorium on nuclear weapons' testing was broken.

Ahead of his high-profile talks with China's President Xi Jinping in Asia on Thursday, Trump said he had instructed the Pentagon — rebranded as the "Department of War" — to resume nuclear testing.

"The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country ... Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years. Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked by reporters for his reaction to Trump's comments on resuming nuclear tests."Trump mentioned in his statement that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Until now, we were not aware that anyone was testing anything," Peskov told journalists, in comments translated by NBC News. "And if the Burevestnik test is somehow being referred to, it is in no way a nuclear test," he added."All countries are developing their defense systems, but this is not a nuclear test," Peskov said.

He added that the U.S. has the right to make "sovereign decisions" but reiterated Russian President Vladimir Putin's position that "if someone abandons the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly." He did not provide further details on how Russia would act.

Asked if this was the start of a new arms race with the West, Peskov replied, "no," but tensions over nuclear weapons have simmered for decades despite various attempts to get rival powers to cease the development, testing and modernizing of existing or new nuclear arsenals.

In 1963, the Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed initially by the U.S., U.K. and Russia, banned nuclear tests in all environments except underground. The treaty was a precursor to the current Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which has been ratified by 178 states. The U.S. officially stopped testing nuclear weapons in 1992. China and Russia aren't known to have conducted any tests since the 1990s, either.

In 2023, however, Russia rescinded its ratification of the treaty, saying it did not approve of the U.S.' attitude toward global security. However, Russia did not clarify on whether or not it would resume its nuclear testing.

The suspicion and threat around countries modernizing existing nuclear weapons, and developing new ones, has remained a live risk as geopolitical tensions mount between nuclear powers, and countries who have not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty and are developing nuclear weapons, like India and Pakistan.

Trump's announcement comes after Russia flexed its military muscle last week by testing its much-vaunted Burevestnik long-range cruise missile, which is capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads.

Russia boasted that the missile is "invincible," has an "unlimited range" and can evade air and missile defense systems.

Trump was less than impressed by the test, saying Russia should focus instead on ending the war in Ukraine.

It's likely there was some wariness in Moscow on Thursday, with the country having watched its longtime geopolitcal ally Xi Jinping hold cordial talks with Trump, with the leaders praising an apparently fruitful meeting in South Korea.

The meeting came after Trump had appeared to turn against Moscow in recent weeks, cancelling talks with Putin amid frustration with Russia's unwillingness to consider a ceasefire with Ukraine. Meanwhile, the White House leader hailed "amazing" talks with X, with "agreement on many issues."

Trump said he reached a 1-year agreement with China on rare earth supplies and he also cut fentanyl-linked tariffs on Beijing by half, taking overall duties on Chinese goods down to 47%.

China had also "agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy," Trump stated later in a Truth Social post, adding: "In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska."

Xi, meanwhile, said Beijing and Washington should be "partners and friends" as he met Trump.

The seemingly warm meeting, and tangible results, of the Trump-Xi talks will not be music to Moscow's ears, given its close relationship with China, which it prizes as one of the few powerful geopolitical and trade partners it has left after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

When it came to the more than three-and-a-half year conflict in Ukraine, Trump said the issue "did come up" and that the U.S. and China were going to work together to stop people being killed. He also signaled his fatigue with the war, however, stating, "The two sides are locked in fighting, and sometimes you've got to let them fight I guess. Crazy."

Russia did not comment on the talks on Thursday although CNBC has asked the Kremlin for a response on the meeting.

Nano Banana is bearing fruit for Gemini.

In its Q3 earnings release, Google said its Gemini app has hit 650 million monthly active users, a 200 million increase since July. That still trails ChatGPT's 800 million weekly, but it's closing the gap.

Why the jump in interest? It's largely thanks to the arrival of Google's image editing tool — better known as Nano Banana — that became a viral hit back in August, said Josh Woodward, the VP of Google Labs who leads the Gemini app.

More importantly for Google, a lot of users then started using the Gemini app for other tasks, he told Business Insider.

And crucially, it's bringing in different types of users.

"We're seeing a very big demographic shift in the app," he said in an interview.

That includes "huge growth" in the 18-34 age cohort and a shift from being heavily male-skewed to having more female users, Woodward said. Bringing in younger users is good news for Google, which has long worried about them spending more time on TikTok and other social media platforms.

Gemini has also seen an international surge, said Woodward. That's not a huge surprise: One of Nano Banana's biggest viral surges was users creating 3D figurines of themselves with the image tool.

"That started in Thailand," said Woodward. "There was an influencer who did it, and suddenly it jumped to Vietnam and Indonesia, and it was off to the races."

For Google, bringing in users with a viral sensation like Nano Banana will often lead them to try other features and — Google hopes — keep them coming back for more. That's why Woodward says Google is looking closely at the stickiness that comes from these moments.

Google defines a monthly active user as someone who opens the app in either Android or iOS, or uses it on the web, and interacts with it. However, it ignores very basic queries, such as a user setting a timer, Woodward said.

"I can imagine there will be metrics in the future we want to report, like how many successful tasks did we complete for a person?" said Woodward. "That could be dozens or hundreds in a day over time. That's what we're really geared at."

To reach that point, Google needs to transform Gemini from an assistant to an operator. The Gemini 2 phase has felt like a bridge between these two ideas. Google has provided glimpses of what this will look like, such as its Project Mariner agent for the browser and an "Agent Mode" that is in early testing for the app. Yet many of these early general-purpose agents still feel wonky.

"There's still a lot more to do on that. I feel like where we are, almost as an industry in some ways, is these agents can do maybe three to four or five tasks with a few tool use calls," said Woodward, referring to when AI connects to external tools. "And we really want to get to a world where they can do 10-plus tasks, 10-plus tool calls, and excellent accuracy. So we're on that journey overall."

It wasn't a traditional pitch meeting. There were no slides, no product demo. There wasn't even a clear explanation of what the founders were trying to build. But for investor Oren Zeev's decision-making process, none of that was necessary. 

"I just liked them, I just wanted to be close to them," said Zeev. "So I wrote a small check – a 'relationship investment,' I called it."

The year was 2013, and Zeev, a former general partner with the venture capital arm of Apax Partners (which now operates primarily as a private equity firm), was working as a de facto angel investor. He didn't like to call himself an angel investor because he tended to write checks that were larger than those doled out by other wealthy individuals who put their own capital into startups at the time. But he made an exception for Ariel Cohen and Ilan Twig. Shortly after an informal pitch meeting with two founders, Zeev decided to invest $50,000 in their startup – despite the yet-to-be-defined company not even having a product Zeev could fully understand.

Cohen and Twig's nebulous idea turned into StreamOnce, an early enterprise collaboration player that got snapped up by a larger enterprise collaboration player called Jive Software not long after its inception. It was a minor financial success – both for the founders and for Zeev. But it helped sow the seeds for another, more monumental venture for all three: A business travel platform called TripActions which Cohen and Twig founded in 2015, and which changed its name to Navan in early 2023.

Navan, which ranked No. 39 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, priced its initial public offering on Wednesday night and begins trading Thursday on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "NAVN." The corporate travel and expense software company raised $923 million, pricing the deal at the midpoint of its IPO range, $25 per share, and valuing the company at over $6 billion.

Just like with StreamOnce, Zeev's involvement with Navan started with an informal meeting, a quick decision, and an early check. But unlike his prior investment in the duo's first venture, Zeev has led Navan's seed and A rounds, plus participated in all of the company's subsequent equity rounds. Upon its IPO, that investment will turn into a more than $1 billion stake in Navan, where Zeev will remain on the board.

"It's a first for me," says Zeev, referring to the dollar amount of his return on a single startup. 

The Navan exit, while uniquely gargantuan, isn't a one-off for Zeev. It's more of a blueprint. The investor, who evolved from a traditional venture capitalist to an angel investor (albeit on a larger-than-usual scale) to a so-called solo GP – an investor who raises money from limited partners but acts alone – has spent years perfecting his lone wolf approach to venture capital, helping to define a new category of investor, which may end up being particularly well-suited to today's environment.

"The advantage you have as a solo GP in this fast-moving market is you can make a decision at the meeting," said Kyle Stanford, director of U.S. venture research at financial data provider Pitchbook. 

Zeev's track record as a solo GP has been written about in the past. But now, on the eve of his biggest success to date, it's worth revisiting how and why the self-proclaimed "One Man Venture Capitalist" has operated alone.  

Born and raised in the Israeli coastal city of Haifa in 1964, Zeev studied electrical engineering at the Technion university, located in his hometown. After working for an IBM chip design group – also in Israel – he then went on to receive his MBA in France. He came back to Israel in 1994, just as the local venture capital industry was starting up. Zeev wanted in. He ended up at Apax Partners as the London-based firm was entering Israel to become an on-the-ground investor in its increasingly promising startup ecosystem. 

"I don't think I was a good investor [back then]," Zeev said. "But I survived." 

Lucky for him, it was the mid-90s, and the technology sector was booming. While Zeev calls any of his wins from that early era at Apax "irrelevant" in light of the successes he has had later in his career on his own, the tailwinds at the time helped him notch a few exits (one example: he led an investment in a Bluetooth chip company called Butterfly, which was acquired by Texas Instruments for $50 million in 1999). His time at Apax was fruitful for another reason: It helped launch the next phase of his career. By the early 2000s, following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, Apax asked Zeev to relocate to Silicon Valley, where he'd long wanted to end up. 

By then, it was 2002, and unlike the boomtime era in which Zeev started out in venture, no one was doing deals. 

"In hindsight, it was very good timing because it was after the bubble burst and everyone was really shell-shocked," Zeev said. "Nobody was doing anything and it gave me an opportunity."

Zeev's very first deal after settling in Silicon Valley was buying up 40% of audiobook pioneer Audible. The startup had gone public in 1999 despite the fact that it was still way too early for digital audiobook distribution on a large scale, but had gotten delisted after the tech crash. Newly private, it had worked hard to get its strategy on more solid footing – the technology available too had evolved – but had failed to find a financial lifeline. 

"It was pretty clear they had turned the corner but everyone had taken them for dead for so long," Zeev said. "My advantage was that I viewed it with fresh eyes. And my other advantage was that nobody was doing deals, because if I'd had any kind of competition, I would have lost."

In 2003, Zeev convinced Apax to invest roughly $10 million in Audible, eventually turning that $10 million into $130 million, a coup at a time when barely any exits were taking place. (Amazon ultimately acquired Audible in 2008.)

Zeev stayed at Apax for a few more years, and had a few more exits along the way, but eventually parted ways in 2007. He had done well for himself but says he had "lost the joy" of investing. 

"In hindsight, I know that what wore me out was all of the partnership dynamics and things like that, not necessarily investing," he said. 

He decided to take some time off and enjoy his financial independence. He tried to learn golf but it wasn't his thing. He considered pursuing a PhD but decided against it. He taught high school math and took some courses at Stanford University. Nothing really scratched the itch. 

Before long, he was back to investing, this time tapping into his own pool of money. By then, he had amassed a sizable network, especially among Israeli entrepreneurs. He wrote early checks to Tipalti, a fintech startup he also helped found, the home remodeling marketplace Houzz, and Chegg, the once-darling of the edtech sector which went public at a valuation of $1.1 billion in 2013 (but whose market cap is now under $150 million).

Technically, Zeev was operating as an angel investor, as he was investing his own money on his own. But from the get-go, he did things a bit differently. "I led every single deal, and every single deal was a seven-figure-deal," Zeev said. 

A few years in, Zeev had had a few quick exits, mainly M&A deals, and he was enjoying the freedom of operating solo. But in 2015, a meeting with Peter Thiel caused him to change his modus operandi, at least in one critical way. 

"I came out of that meeting with a fund I did not know I was raising," Zeev said. 

Thiel had convinced Zeev to try taking outside funding, but also to continue operating as a solo investor. That first fund was $20 million – $18 million from Thiel and $2 million of Zeev's money. (He has been a limited partner in each of the subsequent nine funds he has raised over the last decade.) It was an experiment for both of them. For Zeev, who had by then created a more formal entity for his investments – Zeev Ventures – it was an opportunity to test whether he could really continue to operate as a solo investor even with an outside investor. 

"The answer was a clear yes," he now says.

Zeev discovered that he could outsource back office requirements like quarterly reports, capital calls, and handling distributions, to a fractional chief financial officer.

"I discovered that it's very easy to outsource," Zeev said.

To this day, Zeev doesn't have anyone on his payroll, not even a secretary. He doesn't even have an office – he takes almost all of his meetings (including the one where he decided to invest in Navan) from a coffeeshop in downtown Palo Alto called Cafe Venetia. He has an active portfolio of 50 companies, and sits on the board of 40.

"Most GPs with Oren's success have a team supporting them," says Ben Choi, managing partner with Next Legacy Partners. "For an LP, that also means that there's a team between us – other partners, junior professionals, investor relations."

Zeev has chosen to do things a bit differently with his LPs in other ways. While he charges a traditional management fee (in addition to the typical carried interest VCs earn from their fund's performance), he doesn't pocket any of the money from those fees. 

"I reinvest 100% of the management fees into the fund," said Zeev, a practice he says helps him achieve "radical alignment" with his LPs. 

For Choi, whose firm came on board as an investor in Zeev Ventures about five years ago, that kind of focus on performance – coupled with clarity of communication – has kept him a happy LP. He says Zeev has always been extremely responsive and dedicated, no small feat with $2.5 billion assets under management and 50 portfolio companies. 

"One of the things that can be challenging for a founder when you work with funds is understanding who is the decision maker," said Rami Lachter, co-founder and CEO of a Zeev Ventures portfolio company called Flare, an AI--powered software platform for the legal sector. "With Oren, he's the decision maker, he's very straightforward, and he tells you what he thinks. So it's super productive," Lachter added.

Zeev is known for his decisive nature and blunt communication style, saying he makes most investment decisions within 24 hours. But that doesn't mean all his companies follow a fast, or linear, path to an exit. 

When the Covid pandemic hit in early 2020, Navan went from growth mode to a complete standstill. What's worse, there was no definitive end in sight. The company had some tough decisions to make. Shortly after the pandemic effectively shut down business travel, Navan laid off around 300 employees, about a quarter of its workforce at the time. 

Zeev says CEO Cohen and the rest of the team made the right decisions at the time, however hard. In addition to the layoffs, they diverted resources to a product that was more focused on corporate expenses versus travel, changing the product roadmap. They also secured significant debt financing in order to stay afloat and fund the transition. (This transition is why, later in 2023, they rebranded from TripActions to Navan, an attempt to convey the move from travel to a broader category of corporate tools.) 

"I was very supportive of all of these decisions, but it was really Ariel [Navan's CEO] who navigated the ship."

Throughout his years of investing, Zeev says he's developed an effective gut feeling when it comes to meeting founders. 

"I have to like the founders, not just as people but also like them as founders and believe they can build something big," Zeev said.

In Navan's case, because he had gotten to know both co-founders via his small check in their earlier company, he knew he already liked them and that he believed in their ability to build something. He also felt that the area they were trying to innovate in, corporate travel tools, was ripe for disruption. 

"The existing travel solutions back then were crap, and all the employees hated them and were trying to go around them," he said.

But he didn't know Navan would turn into a multi-billion-dollar company, nor that it would be able to weather a storm like a global pandemic. 

"I couldn't know at that point, and I don't think they could know at that point, that Ariel would grow to be what I consider today to be a world-class leader," Zeev said.

Navan, and Zeev, waited patiently as the company steered itself back to growth. While rumors of an IPO had been circling for years, Covid and then unfavorable market conditions forced them to delay plans. (Zeev says Navan never formally kicked off an IPO process in the past, so "it's not as if we tried and failed.")

While the IPO represents a significant liquidity event for investors, founders, and employees, it doesn't mean Navan's future success in its increasingly crowded sector is achieved. The company has shown impressive growth: According to its S-1, revenue grew 33% year-over-year from $420 million to $537 million from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025. But Navan is not yet profitable. And, again, it's not the only company that has sought to disrupt the business travel and expense tools sector. 

Then again, its public offering comes at a time when not even a government shutdown has been able to slow renewed IPO activity. All of which bodes well for Zeev, who clearly has big plans for the future. 

While Zeev said he is not selling his shares as part of the initial public offering, but noted, "It's quite rare for an early-stage investor to reach proceeds of over $1 billion. But I actually don't think it will remain unique for a long time as I have several companies I expect to follow in the next few years."

US-China Trade War:

Watch: Trump and Xi Reach Trade Truce

US President Donald Trump emerged from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping beaming, labeling the conversation “truly great.”

But the one-year truce struck on Thursday in South Korea is likely to only stabilize relations between the world's two largest economies rather than resolve fundamental differences, with both sides buying time to further reduce dependence on each other in strategic areas. And it made clear just how much stronger China has become since Trump's first term in office.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and hiked its full-year outlook, as the company continued to see strong demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro.

Shares of the company rose more than 3% on Thursday.

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its fiscal 2025 revenue to come in between $63 billion and $63.5 billion, up from previous guidance of $60 to $62 billion. Eli Lilly also expects full-year adjusted profit to come in between $23 and $23.70 per share, rising from its previous outlook of $21.75 to $23 a share.

Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President Donald Trump's existing tariffs as of Thursday, but does not include his threatened levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S.

Mounjaro raked in $6.52 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 109% from the same period a year ago. That blew past the $5.51 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. 

Zepbound, which entered the market roughly two years ago, posted $3.59 billion in revenue for the third quarter. That's up 184% from the year-earlier period and slightly ahead of the $3.5 billion that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the "real star here" of the quarter is tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro. Both drugs are leading the U.S. market for obesity and diabetes, he said. 

Ricks said the quarterly beat was driven by "really strong international performance," pointing to Mounjaro's launch in China, Brazil and India earlier this year. 

"What we're seeing is a global demand for this product," he told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."

On an earnings call Thursday, Ricks said Eli Lilly gained share in the injectable obesity and diabetes market for the fifth consecutive quarter. The company's drugs account for nearly 6 out of 10 prescriptions within that class of medicines.

Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

The results come as Eli Lilly works to maintain its edge over chief rival Novo Nordisk in the booming market for a class of obesity and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s.

The company posted third-quarter revenue of $17.60 billion, up 54% from the same period a year ago. 

Sales in the U.S. jumped 45% to $11.30 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 60% increase in volume — or the number of prescriptions or units sold — for its products, primarily for Mounjaro and Zepbound. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said.

The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $5.58 billion, or $6.21 per share, for the third quarter. That compares with net income of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. 

Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $7.02 per share for the second quarter.

The results underscore Eli Lilly's strong advantage in the booming GLP-1 drug market.

The company has gained the majority market share over the last year, thanks to the strong profile of its weight loss and diabetes injections and a boost from its direct-to-consumer sales, among other efforts. Eli Lilly took another stride to boost access to Zepbound on Wednesday, partnering with Walmart to offer in-store pickup of discounted vials of the drug for cash-paying patients.

In the interview, Ricks said Eli Lilly plans to expand its direct-to-consumer and cash-pay offerings for its drugs.

The company is now betting on its closely watched experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, to solidify its dominance in the space, especially as Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers race to bring their own pills or next-generation injections to the market. 

"We've been ramping both production and planning for really a broad global rollout upon regulatory approval," Ricks told CNBC, referring to orforglipron's launch.

On Thursday, Novo Nordisk launched a rival bid for U.S. obesity biotech company Metsera, hijacking an offer from Pfizer as it races to catch up to Eli Lilly.

When asked about competition, Ricks said on the earnings call that "of course, everybody would like to be in our position, but we're focused on defending it and mostly just executing the play we have."

Shares of U.S.-listed rare earths miners rallied on Thursday after China agreed to delay the introduction of further export controls as part of an agreement reached between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Critical Metals jumped nearly 7% in the premarket, USA Rare Earth rose around 6% and Energy Fuels was up 3%. MP Materials and NioCorp Developments, meanwhile, were both seen around 3% higher.

The moves come shortly after Trump declared that the "rare earth issue has been settled" following what he described as an "amazing meeting" with China's Xi in South Korea.

As part of a broader agreement between the world's two largest economies, which included Washington cutting fentanyl-linked tariffs, China recently announced rare earths export controls would be delayed by one year.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left South Korea that his administration expects China's decision to delay these rare earths export restrictions to be "routinely extended."

China's previous rare earths restrictions, which were announced in early April, are set to remain in place, however.

Beijing on Oct. 9 had threatened to tighten export controls on rare earths and related technologies, seeking to prevent what it described as the "misuse" of rare earths minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors.

Rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table whose atomic structure gives them special magnetic properties. These elements are widely used in the automotive, robotics and defense sectors.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing roughly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and processing them.

U.S. officials have previously warned that this dominance poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

In this article

Denmark's Novo Nordisk launched a rival bid for U.S. obesity biotech firm Metsera on Thursday, hijacking an offer from Pfizer as drugmakers jostle for advantage in the fast-growing and competitive weight-loss drug market.

Novo Nordisk, the company behind blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic, bid up to $8.5 billion, including $6 billion upfront and later milestone payments. Pfizer's bid was worth $7.3 billion, including milestones.

Metsera, in a statement, said that Novo's bid was "superior" and that it had notified Pfizer, which now has four business days to negotiate. It said that the Novo offer valued Metsera at up to $77.75 per share for a total of some $9 billion.

Pfizer said in a statement that the Novo bid was "reckless" and would be bad for competition in the obesity drug market.

The move signals an aggressive turn by Novo Nordisk a week after the ouster of most of the company's board over concerns it was not moving fast enough in the obesity market, where it competes with main rival Eli Lilly.

It was also in line with new Novo CEO Mike Doustdar's pledge to build a robust pipeline of next-generation diabetes and obesity treatments, as it prepares for the patent expiry of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic.

Metsera is one of the several companies developing experimental weight-loss drugs, including one that could be taken less often than Novo and Eli Lilly's products.

"The deal would certainly help Novo improve their market position in obesity, assuming that the products can be developed successfully," Markus Manns, a portfolio manager at mutual fund and Novo shareholder Union Investment, told Reuters.

"There are some significant antitrust concerns and whether Pfizer comes back with another offer."

Pfizer said that the bid carried "substantial regulatory and executional risk".

"It is an attempt by a company with a dominant market position to suppress competition in violation of law by taking over an emerging American challenger," it said.

Novo said that the Metsera deal would provide it with the opportunity to maximize the potential of the U.S. firm's "complementary portfolio and capabilities".

The global obesity drug market is projected to reach $150 billion by the early 2030s, fueled by the rapid adoption of GLP-1 therapies from companies including Novo and Lilly.

Both Pfizer and Novo have included contingent value rights in their bids for Metsera, offering additional payments contingent upon achieving clinical and regulatory milestones.

"Novo's competitive bid continues to show that large Pharma has an interest in buying into obesity," said BMO analyst Evan Seigerman.

Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger has projected more than $5 billion in combined peak sales for Metsera's pipeline.

Shares in Metsera are up nearly 100% since January this year, rising from $26.50 per share on January 31 to $52.21 on Wednesday. Its shares jumped over 19% in premarket on Thursday.

Metsera, which went public this year and had a $5.5 billion market cap at Wednesday's close, has a portfolio of experimental obesity drugs, including MET-097i, a GLP-1 injectable, and MET-233i, which mimics the pancreatic hormone amylin.

The euro zone economy eked out 0.2% growth in the third quarter, just beating expectations, according to flash data from Eurostat on Thursday.

Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated the bloc's economy to expand by 0.1% between July and September.

The euro was up 0.16% against the dollar, at $1.1618, following the data. 

Growth in the single currency area was boosted by Spain and France, with the former reporting a 0.6% expansion in the third quarter and the latter registering 0.5% growth (significantly higher than analysts' expectations for 0.2% growth) despite a backdrop of political instability.

Germany and Italy were drags on the growth rate, however, as both countries' economies stalled.

It comes after the euro zone economy recorded 0.1% growth in the second quarter, following a 0.6% expansion in the first.

The third-quarter data — which indicates an unexpected economic resiliency — comes ahead of the European Central Bank's next monetary policy decision, due later Thursday, and removes any immediate pressure on the central bank to cut rates to stimulate the economy.

The central bank is widely expected to keep its key deposit facility rate at 2% at the meeting, having last cut rates in June. The trim came as the euro zone's annual inflation rate hit 2%, the ECB's target, though the rate of price rises has risen since, to 2.2% in September.

Despite a lackluster growth outlook, economists say the central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates again for a while.

"The ECB's rate cutting cycle appears to be over, at least for now, with firmer business activity and rising inflation leaving few doubts that the Governing Council will sit on its hands for a while yet," Matthew Ryan, head of Market Strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said in emailed comments.

Natasha May, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, cautioned that the ECB cannot afford to rest on its laurels, however.

"Recent euro zone activity data has been positive, including October's flash PMIs and this morning's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Growth surprised to the upside despite trade headwinds, and national prints suggest domestic demand remains on an uptrend," she noted in emailed comments. 

Given this, and expectations that inflation will moderate, ECB President Christine Lagarde's mantra that the central bank's policy is in a "good place" seems a sensible one, May added.

"But we should not discount the possibility that the ECB deliver a few more cuts next year. With Chinese exports to the euro zone up 15% year-on-year in September and expectations for future energy prices moving lower, disinflationary forces are gathering momentum," she said. Paired with a strong euro, May added that this could lead euro zone inflation to undershoot the ECB's forecasts next year – which already sit below the bank's 2% target. "The Governing Council cannot become complacent," she said.

Comcast clued investors into its potential M&A aspirations on Thursday. In short, executives think a deal could get done, despite recent naysaying.

Comcast is among the interested parties in a potential deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD, the owner of TNT Sports, CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. studio and other media assets, officially put itself up for sale after "receiving interest from multiple parties," WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement last week. 

Several pundits and analysts have posited that Comcast has little to no chance to do a deal from a regulatory perspective, given President Donald Trump's pointed words for Comcast CEO and controlling shareholder Brian Roberts. Others say the path forward may not be doomed.

On Thursday, alongside the company's third-quarter earnings report, soon-to-be co-CEO Mike Cavanagh shed some light on how executives view the situation (without specifically naming Warner Bros. Discovery as a potential tie-up).

"I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that's out there," said Cavanagh on Thursday.

Trump in April called Comcast and Roberts "a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting" in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. Trump has also called Roberts a "lowlife" and has referred to Comcast as "Concast."

Some equity research analysts have predicted that the Trump administration would block a Comcast acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD is still moving toward a planned separation into two publicly traded entities while it expands its strategic review.

Paramount is trying to buy the whole company, before it could split, and WBD has thus far rejected three separate offers from the David Ellison-run company.

"It is almost certain that the Trump DOJ would not allow CMSCA to buy WBD and the result would be decided in court," New Street Research analyst Blair Levin wrote in a note to clients, citing Trump's public comments about Roberts.

"We along with our cable colleagues believe [Comcast's] political standing in this administration is very low and believe CMCSA would think long and hard about whether a deal is worth the long, arduous process of creating enough goodwill to close the deal," wrote Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss.

Cavanagh reminded investors Thursday that just because the company takes a look at assets that are up for sale in the media industry, it doesn't necessarily mean a deal, or even an offer, could materialize.

"I think we've said repeatedly, and I'll say it again, that the bar is very high for us to pursue any M&A transactions, given how strongly we feel about the businesses we have, the strategies we're pursuing and the opportunities we have ahead of us," Cavanagh told investors.

Comcast's NBCUniversal is in the process of spinning off its portfolio of cable networks, including CNBC, into a new entity called Versant. 

Assuming an offer for WBD or other media assets were to come together, it would have to make strategic sense for the future NBCUniversal, which will be led by the broadcast TV network NBC and streaming service Peacock.

Many of NBCUniversal's moves to date have been to boost Peacock's place in the streaming ecosystem. The company reported Thursday Peacock had 41 million customers as of the end of last month, a subscriber base that has remained flat throughout the year.

Cavanagh noted the company would be looking for media assets that complement its post-spin NBCUniversal business.

"So in this case, it would be streaming assets and studio assets, since there are no other parks assets out there," he said. 

Warner Bros. Discovery's planned split would separate out exactly those businesses: streaming and studios in one company, which would also house streamer HBO Max, and its global networks into a another.

While Paramount's interest is in the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, negating a split, other prospective bidders have considered acquiring just some of the assets, CNBC has reported.

Cavanagh said, "in light of that, what we'd be looking for and what we're going to look like post-Versant spin," a deal isn't as far-fetched as some view it. 

In a hypothetical situation in which Comcast were to also spin off NBCUniversal, which is currently slated to remain with the company following the Versant transaction, and merge it with WBD, LightShed analyst Rich Greenfield predicted that deal could get through regulators.

Wolfe Research's Peter Supino proposed a plan under which NBCUniversal would issue new stock to WBD at an exchange ratio (eliminating Roberts' voting control over the new company) and appoint a chairman and CEO "not named Roberts." That combination could lead to a deal, he wrote in a note to clients.

"The primary problems facing a Comcast bid — financing and politics — might be solvable," Supino wrote.

While Comcast may shy away from pursuing a transaction that could be blocked by the Trump DOJ, even that may not be a dealbreaker.

In the first Trump term, his DOJ blocked AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, an earlier iteration of Warner Bros. Discovery. In June 2018, a U.S. District Court judge approved the $85.4 billion sale, ruling the government failed to prove the deal would harm consumers.

Some Comcast executives think the regulatory concerns are either overblown or, at least, far too early to ascertain, according to people familiar with the matter, who have knowledge of Comcast's strategy but spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. There's some evidence suggesting Comcast's executives may have a point.

A Comcast spokesperson declined to comment for this article.

Skydance Media received long-awaited Federal Communications Commission approval for its merger with Paramount after the CBS parent agreed to a $16 million settlement with Trump over a "60 Minutes" episode.

While a deal for WBD won't require FCC review, because Warner Bros. Discovery doesn't own a broadcaster, a takeover of this size — WBD's market capitalization is about $53 billion plus another $30 billion in debt — could still draw the scrutiny of Trump's Department of Justice.

Trump's reputation as a dealmaker suggests Comcast may be able to avoid any interference by endearing itself to the president.

Comcast is one of 37 companies donating to Trump's efforts to build a $300 million ballroom for the White House through the Trust for the National Mall.

Trump's public dislike toward Roberts and Comcast may be bloviation linked to Trump's assertions that MSNBC, currently owned by NBCUniversal, is left-leaning. It's unclear if Trump explicitly cares about Comcast or NBCUniversal owning any of the WBD assets other than CNN, which Trump has also routinely criticized.

If his primary issue with Comcast buying WBD is CNN, a divestiture or deal without the network could circumvent those issues. MSNBC will also be spun out into the Versant portfolio. 

While Roberts will still be a shareholder of Versant, MSNBC will no longer be a part of Comcast once Versant becomes its own publicly traded company at the start of 2026.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

Stellantis on Thursday issued a warning on one-off costs through the second half of the year as the embattled automaker seeks to respond to political, economic and regulatory challenges.

The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, reaffirmed its financial guidance for the second half of the year, citing continued improvement in net revenues, cash flow and operating income.

Stellantis said, however, that it expects to incur charges in the six months through to December that, once finalized, will be "largely excluded" from its operating income.

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis fell 6% on the news. The stock price is down more than 27% year-to-date.

In the U.S., shares were also down 8%.

The warning on one-off charges came despite what appeared to be a fairly positive third quarter. It's likely to be seen as a welcome boost as CEO Antonio Filosa executes his turnaround plan.

Stellantis said net revenues for the July-September period came in at 37.2 billion euros ($43.2 billion), reflecting an increase of 13% year-on-year, mainly driven by growth in its North American and European markets.

Analysts had expected third-quarter net revenues to come in at 36.58 billion euros, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.

"As we continue to implement important strategic changes in order to provide our customers with greater freedom of choice, we have seen positive sequential progress and solid year-over-year performance in Q3, marked by the return of top-line growth," Stellantis' Filosa said in a statement.

"We are also taking decisive actions to align Stellantis' resources, programs and plans to support long-term, profitable growth, including our recently announced $13 billion investment in the U.S.," he added.

Filosa told investors in a call Thursday that the U.S. is a "key priority for our success," saying the new investments are "an investment in growth."

Stellantis unveiled plans to invest in the U.S. earlier this month as part of a push to accelerate growth and expand its domestic footprint. It marked the largest U.S. investment in the firm's 100-year history, which the company said will include the launch of five new vehicles and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs.

The announcement comes amid President Donald Trump's efforts to create more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. through the use of aggressive tariffs, especially for the automotive industry. The company said the plans expand those Stellantis Chair John Elkann detailed to Trump in January.

When asked about the company's mid- to long-term profit target, which former CEO Carlos Tavares was targeting to be at least 10%, Filosa said 6% to 8% would be "reasonable," but said the company is focusing on quarterly improvements in key performance indicators, also known as KPIs.

Filosa has largely focused on regrowing the company's market share, especially in the U.S., since becoming CEO in June.

Filosa said the company is monitoring potential impacts from China's export restrictions on semiconductors made by Nexperia, which several automakers have warned of recently, including creating a cross-functional "war room" of employees working on the issue.

In this article

British oil major Shell on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.

Shell posted adjusted earnings of $5.4 billion for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of $5.05 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus. A separate, company-provided analyst forecast had put Shell's expected third-quarter profit at $5.09 billion.

The London-headquartered firm reported adjusted earnings of $6 billion over the same period last year and $4.26 billion for this year's April-June period.

"Shell delivered another strong set of results, with clear progress across our portfolio and excellent performance in our Marketing business and deepwater assets in the Gulf of America and Brazil," Shell CEO Wael Sawan said in a statement.

The company also announced another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns. The company said it marked the 16th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks.

Shell's net debt came in at $41.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $43.2 billion on a quarterly basis.

The oil major's London-listed share price finished Thursday's session up 0.2%. The stock price is up more 16% year-to-date, outperforming its industry peers.

"Numbers are solid in virtually all divisions and shows earning growth and strong cash flow generation," said Maurizio Carulli, global energy and materials analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

"Of note the robust production in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. The LNG Canada ramp up, with an initial 13 cargos in Q3, benefited the results as well. The only weak part was Chemicals, but it is a small part of the business and Shell's management is trying to find a strategic solution for it," Carulli said.

Other third-quarter highlights included:

Shell's results come as French oil major TotalEnergies reported a slight drop in third-quarter profit as oil and gas production growth helped to offset lower crude prices.

Norwegian energy firm Equinor, for its part, on Wednesday posted a steeper-than-expected drop in third-quarter profit, with adjusted operating income coming in at $6.21 billion for the July-September period.

U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with Britain's BP set to follow suit on Tuesday.

Analysts expect Big Oil's shareholder payouts to come under pressure over the coming months, with energy majors looking to tighten their belts amid a weaker crude price environment.

Charlie Sheen says the weight of hiding his HIV diagnosis took a greater toll on him than managing the condition itself.

On Thursday's episode of "In Depth with Graham Bensinger," the actor spoke about his new memoir and shed light on his journey living with HIV.

"Keeping it under wraps was a lot worse than just having it. And I didn't realize that until I finally sat with Matt Lauer, and was just like, 'Here's what's going on,'" Sheen told host Graham Bensinger. "That side of it, that was really difficult because there was a lot of nefarious behavior."

The "Two and a Half Men" actor said he was "extorted" by people who knew of his diagnosis before he went public.

"I was just like, 'All right, the only way to make this go away is to do what I did on the freaking 'Today' show. On live television, tell the world," Sheen said.

The actor shared that the lead-up to his diagnosis was filled with a lot of uncertainty, especially after he began experiencing severe headaches.

"I thought it was a brain tumor or spinal something or liver cancer or something terminal for sure, which is why I didn't want to go to the hospital. And I think I avoided it for like a day and a half, you know, and finally just had to go," Sheen said.

He added that his ex-wife, Denise Richards, was the one who took him to see a doctor.

Sheen said getting his diagnosis was a sobering moment.

"But when you get the results, when you get the news, you're like, 'Oh, OK. All right. Let's just take it, just take this in.' You know, it's not the best news. But there was other news that could have been a lot worse, you know?" Sheen said.

Although it was "really depressing," Sheen said he was "fortunate" that treatment options were available.

"I had some perspective to look at it as, OK, I thought it was going to be this, and it's not. So that's a pretty big win that I'm going to take in the middle of this big loss," Sheen said. "It was like, OK, we can treat this thing, and there's like, here's all the technology for that, you know."

In 2015, Sheen publicly revealed his HIV diagnosis in a "Today" show interview with Matt Lauer.

Back then, the actor said he paid "enough to bring it into the millions" to people who tried to blackmail him over his condition, and hoped that going public would finally put an end to it.

"That's my goal. That's not my only goal. I think I release myself from this prison today," Sheen said.

Sheen isn't the only actor who has publicly revealed his HIV diagnosis.

In 2021, actor Billy Porter told The Hollywood Reporter that he chose to reveal his diagnosis to help break stereotypes around living with HIV.

"I'm living so that I can tell the story. There's a whole generation that was here, and I stand on their shoulders," Porter said. "I can be who I am in this space, at this time, because of the legacy that they left for me. So it's time to put my big boy pants on and talk."

Other celebrities who have spoken about their HIV diagnosis publicly include Magic Johnson and "Queer Eye's" Jonathan Van Ness.

Although there is no cure for HIV, there are treatment options available. When taken as prescribed, the medication can make the viral load in a person's body so low that it's undetectable. Having an undetectable viral load means that the person cannot transmit the virus to others during sex, the CDC said.

A representative for Sheen did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping emerged from a high-stakes meeting touting agreements on tariffs and export controls that amount to a tangible de-escalation of the contentious trade war between the two superpowers.

But many details about what was achieved remain unclear, while other key sticking points in the U.S.-China trade relationship appear not to have come up at all. The overall U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports, meanwhile, will stay at a historically high level.

The agreements struck during the meeting in Busan, South Korea, do not amount to a comprehensive trade deal — though Trump claimed after the meeting that one would be ready to sign "pretty soon."

He nevertheless hailed the summit with Xi as "amazing," and rated it a 12 out of 10.

It was the two leaders' first face-to-face meeting in six years. They spoke for one hour and 40 minutes.

The top-line outcomes include an agreement by the U.S. to immediately cut fentanyl-related tariffs on China in half, to 10% from 20%.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the meeting that he believes Xi is "going to work very hard to stop the flow" of the addictive opioid fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. China has repeatedly promised to reduce fentanyl trafficking to the U.S., but has been accused by experts of not following through.

Trump did not provide additional details. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a translated statement that "both sides reached consensus on issues such as cooperation in fentanyl control," without elaborating.

Trump said that the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods will fall to 47% from 57%.

The tariff cut addresses "a key Chinese grievance," said Han Shen Lin, China director at advisory firm The Asia Group, showing that "Beijing's efforts to curb exports of fentanyl precursors, long unrecognized by Washington, are finally being acknowledged."

Trump and Beijing also confirmed that China agreed to pause recently announced export controls on its valuable rare earth minerals for one year.

Those controls were announced on Oct. 9, prompting a furious reply from Trump, who threatened to hike tariffs on China by 100% starting Saturday.

The U.S. is dropping that tariff threat, Trump confirmed on Air Force One. He added that he believes the one-year postponement of the Chinese export controls will be "routinely extended."

But the Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement says only that Beijing will suspend the measures for a year, and then "study and refine specific plans."

China also made no mention of other export control measures it had imposed earlier in the year, which remain in place.

Chinese companies control the majority of the global supply chain for rare earths, which are critical for producing a range of products from semiconductors to missiles. Beijing has ramped up restrictions on exports of critical minerals over the last two years, with a particular focus on limiting their use for military purposes by other countries.

"China's leverage in rare earths and critical minerals processing will continue to surface episodically, effectively capping any escalation in bilateral tensions," Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note Thursday.

Trump also said "tremendous amounts" of U.S. soybeans and other farm products will be purchased by China "starting immediately."

China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans. Earlier this year it halted all purchases of the staple crop for months amid the tit-for-tat tariff war, costing American farmers billions of dollars in lost revenue.

Ahead of the Trump-Xi summit, China-owned COFCO bought three U.S. soybean cargoes for December and January shipment, equating to about 180,000 metric tons of product — though experts note that is a fraction of prior years' purchases during the autumn harvest. By comparison, in October 2024 China bought nearly 6 million tons of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. For all of 2024, China bought nearly 27 million tons.

Soybeans are not specifically mentioned in the Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement, though it says both sides reached consensus on "expanding agricultural trade."

U.S. tariff investigations on China's maritime and shipbuilding industries, and Beijing's countermeasures, will also be delayed for one year, the Chinese government said after the meeting.

Trump said he will be going to China in April, followed by Xi's trip to the U.S., without specifying a timeline for his Chinese counterpart.

Multiple key issues went unaddressed in the meeting, Trump said.

On the sale of Nvidia's chips to China, Trump said the two sides had discussed "a lot of chips," but not the most advanced Blackwell chips. "They are going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips," he said.

Taiwan was not part of the discussion, Trump said.

The two leaders also avoided the subject of Chinese purchasing of Russian oil, a financial lifeline to the Kremlin as it continues to wage war in Ukraine.

"Ukraine came up very strongly," Trump said, but "we didn't really discuss the oil."'

Trump also gave no hint that he and Xi had struck a deal to keep the popular social media app TikTok from going dark in the U.S.

China's government said it would "work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok."

Global stocks were lower and gold prices rose 1.2% as investors assessed the ramifications of the trade truce, which comes after several months of economic confrontation.

While the trade truce is "welcome news," any indication of addressing underlying structural matters of concern is missing — such as China's industrial excess capacity and non-market economy practices — said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute.

That means that the truce is "fragile and tensions are certain to heat up again," Cutler added.

Before the meeting, the two leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Trump calling Xi "an old friend" with whom he has a "very good relationship," and Xi stressing that China's economic growth ambitions would not undermine Trump's vision to "Make America Great Again."

Tensions between the world's two economic superpowers have been on a boil this year. The latest escalation came this month, with Beijing  export controls and Washington threatening to ban software-powered exports to China. 

The U.S. had in recent days shared details about deals they hoped to achieve with China – from restricting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. to TikTok's divestiture from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance. Tariffs, tech curbs and rare earths were also on the table for discussion.

Heading into the meeting, Xi shook hands with Trump at the photo-op at Gimhae Air Base in Busan, urging that Washington and Beijing be "friends and partners" in his opening remarks.

Sitting across the table from Trump, the Chinese leader said it was a "great pleasure" to meet the U.S. president for the sixth time, adding that it was only "normal" for the two economic superpowers to have "frictions now and then."

"China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to Make America Great Again," Xi said, according to a readout by the Chinese foreign ministry.

That conciliatory tone marked a notable shift from Xi's meeting with the former U.S. President Joe Biden late last year, during which the speech highlighted more "inevitable competition" between the two countries, said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

While the agreement still lacks a "strong structural foundation" and could easily be reversed, both sides are likely to stick with it in the near term to signal goodwill, Su added.

Rivian, the California-based EV automaker, is putting its employees who were affected by the company's most recent round of layoffs on paid administrative leave for the next 60 days, according to documents obtained by Business Insider.

CEO RJ Scaringe told employees in an internal memo sent October 23 that the company was cutting around 4.5% of its workforce — more than 600 employees — citing "the need to profitably scale our business" and to prepare for Rivian's R2 SUV launch next year.

According to a document outlining "Key Dates and Resources," affected employees will remain on the company payroll until December 23, receiving full pay and benefits for a period of 60 days.

The pay received during the administrative leave period — about 8.5 weeks — will be deducted from the final severance pay, according to the documents.

Severance pay is determined by the role — identified as "RIV Grade Level" — and tenure of Rivian employees, the documents said. The grade levels are from 1 to 11, according to the documents.

For example, employees at "RIV Grades 1-4" can receive up to 10 weeks of pay. That includes the 8.5 weeks of pay during administrative leave. A Rivian employee who was impacted by the layoffs told Business Insider that grades 1-4 include entry- and mid-level employees.

For "RIV Grades 8-9," employees will receive seven weeks of pay, plus four weeks' pay for each year of service, which totals to 22 weeks of pay, the documents said. The Rivian employee said level 8 employees include roles such as principal engineer or director, while level 9 includes senior directors.

Grades 10 to 11, which include vice president roles, according to the source, can receive up to 28 weeks of pay.

Affected employees have from December 23 to January 1, 2026, to sign the release agreement in order to receive severance pay.

Marina Hoffman, a Rivian spokesperson, told Business Insider in an email that the band levels are similar to many public companies and that the levels "correspond to positions and responsibilities."

"Affected employees are eligible for rehire and encouraged to apply to other open positions for consideration within Rivian," Hoffman wrote.

Under a document titled "Employee FAQs," eligible workers will continue to receive any payouts for patent-filing awards until the December 23 separation date.

Similarly, any restricted stock units — or compensation received in the form of stock — that weren't vested will be forfeited after December 23. 

Rivian is also offering career-transition and resume services starting Thursday.

Hoffman declined to comment on individual severance packages.

Scaringe told Business Insider in an interview the day before layoffs were announced that Rivian was at an "inflection point" and that it was the most important time in the company's history.

"For us to become a company of the scale we aspire to be, which is producing many millions of cars a year, we're not going to get there with a $90,000 single flagship product," he said. "We need R2, we need R3. And so R2 is the critical step to get there, and if we don't make that step, if we don't launch R2, we'll stay a fairly small company."

The workforce reduction represents one of several rounds of layoffs that Rivian has conducted in the past three years. Its most recent layoffs come as the EV industry faces headwinds from slowing consumer adoption and shifting federal regulations.

In September, the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases came to an end, pushing automakers to come up with alternative forms of discounts.

General Motors on Wednesday announced that it would lay off about 1,750 employees, citing changes in the EV market.

"In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity," a GM spokesperson told Business Insider. "Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint."

With AI rolling out across industries, one question has loomed: will people lose their jobs?

Amazon kick-started an answer this week.

On Tuesday, the Jeff Bezos-owned tech giant cut 14,000 workers across its corporate workforce. Amazon said the deep cuts were the latest in CEO Andy Jassey's plan to have the firm act "like the world's largest startup."

Business Insider's tech team used internal documents to reveal how Amazon's top brass shared the news, what they told workers who were laid off, and their advice for the staff who remained.

But all eyes are now on what comes next — not just for Amazon but companies beyond Silicon Valley as artificial intelligence rattles a frozen job market.

Is AI behind Amazon's decision to lay off 14,000 employees, and will more companies follow suit with layoffs of their own?

Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito will join Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to discuss.

Do you have questions for our correspondents? Send them to moderator Dan DeFrancesco.

Kim broke news about the divisions of Amazon hit hardest by the layoffs, while Ito's latest piece explored how Amazon's full-throttle approach to layoffs could be a warning sign of more AI-related job cuts.

Kim and Ito will tackle Amazon's business case for the layoffs, look ahead to the company's earnings, and flag what white-collar workers should watch for in this new age of AI.

You can watch the discussion live here at 2 pm ET on Thursday:

                            Ripple Without XRP? The Shocking Truth About Its Future Without the Token!                        

Ripple Labs has long stood at the intersection of finance and blockchain innovation, aiming to revolutionize cross-border payments through faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions. 

As a leading fintech player, Ripple's vision extends beyond cryptocurrencies (including its native token, XRP, and stablecoin, RLUSD), focusing on transforming the global movement of money by building enterprise-grade infrastructure. 

On the corporate side, Ripple has recently accelerated its push into institutional finance. In April 2025, Ripple announced  the acquisition of the prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for about US$1.25 billion, making Ripple the first crypto-company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker.

Following the acquisition, Ripple rebranded the business as Ripple Prime in October 2025, a one-stop institutional desk offering trading, financing, clearing, and risk management across digital assets, foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income, and repo markets.

At the heart of Ripple's ecosystem are two core components: RippleNet, a network connecting banks and financial institutions for seamless international transfers, and the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain designed for speed and liquidity.

The debate really ignited when Tom Zschach, SWIFT's Chief Innovation Officer, publicly questioned whether banks would ever trust a token-based system like Ripple's. He asked: “Surviving lawsuits isn't resilience. Neutral, shared governance is. Institutions don't want to live on a competitor's rails.”

Which brings one to the central question of this article: can Ripple's technology truly succeed without relying on its native token, $XRP?

Ripple Labs operates on a unique two-tier system that separates its enterprise payment network, RippleNet, from its decentralized blockchain, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Together, they form the technological backbone of Ripple's mission to make global money movement faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

RippleNet is Ripple's enterprise-grade network that connects banks, payment providers, and financial institutions worldwide. Its goal is simple but ambitious — to replace outdated cross-border systems like SWIFT with a unified network that offers real-time, low-cost international transfers.

Initially, Ripple offered three main products under this umbrella:

Over time, Ripple consolidated these products into one cohesive platform, RippleNet, making it easier for institutions to access instant payments and liquidity services under a single network. 

This move positioned Ripple as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based innovation, attracting banks, remittance firms, and fintech companies across more than 50 countries.

RippleNet's appeal lies in its ability to streamline international settlements, replacing multi-day, multi-intermediary transactions with near-instant transfers verified on a secure network. For financial institutions, it delivers both cost efficiency and transparency, two pain points long ignored by legacy systems like SWIFT.

Complementing RippleNet is the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which is an open-source, decentralized blockchain launched in 2012. The XRPL was designed for speed, scalability, and energy efficiency, processing transactions in seconds at a fraction of the cost of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin.

At the core of the XRPL is XRP, its native digital asset. XRP serves as a bridge currency, facilitating instant currency conversion between different fiat and digital assets. Instead of banks holding pre-funded accounts across multiple countries, they can use XRP to source on-demand liquidity, allowing funds to move seamlessly across borders.

For example, if a U.S. bank needs to send money to Mexico, XRP can bridge the USD–MXN conversion instantly, cutting out intermediaries and settlement delays. Beyond payments, the XRPL also supports tokenization, enabling issuance of stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and real-world assets, expanding Ripple's use cases beyond simple money transfers

While RippleNet handles the institutional payments network, the XRPL provides the settlement and liquidity infrastructure underneath it. RippleNet facilitates the message and transaction between financial institutions, while XRP and the XRPL ensure the value is transferred quickly and efficiently.

This dual-layer design allows Ripple to serve both regulated enterprises that prefer fiat-based settlement and digital-asset innovators leveraging blockchain liquidity. It's a model that combines trust, speed, and transparency, the very principles driving Ripple's ambition to modernize global finance.

Here's a clear breakdown of how Ripple's technology stack works,  highlighting which products and platforms use XRP for liquidity and settlement, and which operate without it within Ripple's broader fintech ecosystem.

XRP was designed to act as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. In traditional international transfers, banks pre-fund accounts (nostro/vostro accounts ) in multiple countries to make sure money is available in the destination currency. That ties up capital and adds FX fees, intermediaries, and settlement delays.

XRP aims to remove that. Instead of holding pesos in Mexico, yen in Japan, rupees in India, etc., an institution can briefly convert from Currency A → XRP → Currency B. That's called on-demand liquidity. 

The argument for XRP here is:

In this model, XRP is not just “a token.” It's an efficiency play. It's supposed to cut both working capital costs and per-transaction costs in illiquid or expensive corridors.

From an economic point of view, that's powerful. If XRP is liquid enough in both currencies involved, then it behaves like a real-time global settlement asset.

Yes — and they're getting stronger. Three main alternatives are emerging:

Bottom line: Alternatives exist, and in some jurisdictions (especially dollar-heavy corridors), they may be more politically acceptable than XRP. But none of them are globally mature, neutral, and interoperable at scale today.

If you pull XRP out of the system, a few things change across speed, cost, and decentralization:

Stablecoins could reduce some of that cost in specific corridors (especially USD-heavy flows), but they don't yet solve global liquidity in all currencies.

In other words, removing XRP tends to push the model back toward trust-in-institutions instead of trust-in-protocol.

XRP as bridge asset:

In the remittance space, XRP and Ripple Labs's ODL model have targeted high-friction corridors  (e.g., between Japan and the Philippines) by converting from one fiat → XRP → another fiat, thereby avoiding large pre-funded foreign currency accounts and enabling faster settlement.

XRP as burden:

So economically, XRP is not useless, it's strategically valuable in corridors where liquidity is fragmented and capital costs are high. But it is not indispensable in corridors where stable fiat liquidity and regulatory clarity already exist.

The big question for Ripple is not “Does XRP work?” — it does, in specific scenarios, but “Will large institutions be allowed (or incentivized) to actually use XRP at scale, versus regulated stablecoins or CBDC rails?” 

That regulatory and market preference, not the tech alone, will decide whether XRP is ultimately a bridge asset or becomes a burden.

Enterprise adoption is often more about quietly solving pain points than flashy headlines. In the case of Ripple Labs and its payments network RippleNet, several banks and fintechs have adopted the technology, sometimes utilizing the token XRP, sometimes merely the connectivity layer.

These real‐world implementations matter because they move Ripple beyond mere theory. In these cases, banks are leveraging the network for faster payments, improved transparency, and lower costs, albeit in different configurations, with or without XRP.

One of the major hesitations for banks is token volatility and regulatory ambiguity. By deploying the network layer (RippleNet) and, optionally, the token (XRP), financial institutions can limit their exposure to these risks while still reaping the benefits of blockchain-based settlement.

The broader point is that banks can adopt blockchain infrastructure without necessarily adopting all aspects of the token economy. That nuance is central to enterprise uptake.

Beyond mere token speculation, Ripple's enterprise proposition combines software plus network effects in a layered way:

Essentially, Ripple offers banks “plug-in rails” to a global payment network, complemented by optional liquidity layers, which help bridge traditional finance with blockchain capabilities.

In the debate between “SWIFT vs Ripple,” trust, governance, and the token-based model are key points of contention. Tom Zschach, SWIFT's CIO, has voiced skepticism  about private token-driven networks being viable for banks.

This push-back matters: for banks, risk isn't only about technology; it's about governance, liability, and safe oversight.

The Ripple/XRP story offers broader lessons for enterprise blockchain adoption, and what kind of token-utility separation enterprises may prefer:

What is Ripple, and how does it differ from XRP?


Ripple is a fintech company that develops blockchain-based payment solutions for banks and financial institutions. XRP, on the other hand, is the digital asset (cryptocurrency) that runs on the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain that Ripple helped develop. Ripple uses XRP in some of its products to provide liquidity, but the company and the token are separate entities.




Why do some banks use RippleNet without XRP?


Many banks and payment providers use RippleNet purely for its messaging and settlement technology, which allows faster and cheaper cross-border payments without adopting XRP. They may avoid XRP due to regulatory uncertainty or internal risk policies. RippleNet was built to work both with and without XRP, giving institutions flexibility based on their compliance requirements.




What role does XRP play in Ripple's payment system?


XRP acts as a bridge currency that enables on-demand liquidity (ODL) between different fiat currencies. Instead of pre-funding accounts around the world, institutions can convert from one currency to XRP and then to another in seconds. This reduces capital costs, settlement time, and foreign exchange friction, especially in corridors where liquidity is limited.




Is RippleNet dependent on blockchain technology?


RippleNet uses some blockchain-inspired features, such as cryptographic security and distributed validation, but it is not fully dependent on blockchain for its core operations. It's more of a networked payment infrastructure that can integrate with the XRP Ledger (a true blockchain) when institutions choose to use XRP for liquidity. In short, RippleNet blends traditional financial infrastructure with blockchain efficiency, offering the best of both worlds.

RippleNet was built to work both with and without XRP, giving institutions flexibility based on their compliance requirements.

XRP acts as a bridge currency that enables on-demand liquidity (ODL) between different fiat currencies. Instead of pre-funding accounts around the world, institutions can convert from one currency to XRP and then to another in seconds. This reduces capital costs, settlement time, and foreign exchange friction, especially in corridors where liquidity is limited.

RippleNet uses some blockchain-inspired features, such as cryptographic security and distributed validation, but it is not fully dependent on blockchain for its core operations. It's more of a networked payment infrastructure that can integrate with the XRP Ledger (a true blockchain) when institutions choose to use XRP for liquidity. In short, RippleNet blends traditional financial infrastructure with blockchain efficiency, offering the best of both worlds.

         October 30, 2025
      

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has levied a fine of £200,000 (US $260,000) against a sole trader who sent almost one million spam text messages to people across the country - many of whom were already struggling with debt.

According to an ICO press release, Bharat Singh Chand of Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, was behind an operation that used a "SIM farm" - capable of sending thousands of texts in quick succession - promoting "debt solutions" and "energy-saving grants."

The ICO says that the spam campaign targeted people "at greater risk of harm," particularly those facing financial hardship. Many of the spam messages made promises to "freeze interest and charges" or "write off debts."

An example message read:

When recipients replied "YES" to the SMS message - perhaps in desperation or confusion - they were called back by individuals pretending to work for a company calling itself "The Debt Relief Team."

In all 966,449 unsolicited messages were said to have been sent between December 2023 and July 2024, with no way for recipients to opt out.

The ICO says that in reality, "The Debt Relief Team" was not a legitimate company, and that Chand used false business names and used unregistered mobile numbers in an attempt to avoid detection.

Chand came to the ICO's attention following intelligence it gathered through several previous investigations, including one against a Daniel George Bentley (also known as Daniel George), who is said to have sent texts on behalf of Chand and provided advice about using a SIM farm. Bentley's operation is said to have sent over 2.5 million unlawful texts promoting loans and credit services.

UK regulations forbid organisations from sending marketing texts unless the recipient has given specific, informed consent - or if there is an existing customer relationship. In this case, the ICO says it found no evidence of either.

“These text messages not only caused a nuisance to many thousands of recipients, but were clearly targeted at people who are at greater risk of harm; such as those facing financial hardship," said Andy Curry, head of investigators at the ICO. "Chand showed blatant disregard of the law and attempted to mislead the ICO during our investigation. We've taken action to protect the public from the stress and misery these messages can cause."

Cases like these highlight a growing problem with small-scale but highly automated text spam operations. These "micro-spammers" are cheap, mobile, and difficult to trace — but rely upon the same tactics seen in larger fraud and phishing schemes.

For legitimate businesses, the message is clear: SMS text marketing remains lawful, but only if it is transparent, and permission has been properly granted and documented. Even sole traders are expected to maintain compliance records proving how and when consent was obtained.

In addition, the ICO stresses that hiding or disguising the sender's identity is itself an offence under the UK's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).

And clearly, deliberately targeting financially vulnerable people with fake debt-relief offers is even harder to excuse as it preys on distress.

Whether you are a multinational or a one-man band with a SIM farm, the same rules apply: get consent, be honest about who you are, and stop sending junk messages.

And if you receive a spam text message forward it to the UK's spam reporting service at 7726. Chand's spam campaign resulted in 19,138 complaints according to the ICO.

Chand has appealed the ICO's decision.

JPMorgan said Thursday it had debuted a new blockchain-based tool that streamlines distribution and servicing of alternative investment funds as the bank pushes deeper into tokenization.

The platform, dubbed Kinexys Fund Flow and developed by the bank's digital asset arm Kinexys by JPMorgan, aims to give fund managers, transfer agents and distributors a shared, real-time view of investor activity while reducing manual reconciliation and cutting delays in capital movement.

The first live transaction with the tool involved multiple J.P. Morgan business lines: Asset Management, the Private Bank and Kinexys Digital Assets. Fund administrator Citco also participated.

This is the latest step in JPMorgan's broader push to apply blockchain tech and tokenization for traditional finance, a trend that's gaining traction among major financial institutions. The bank has been an early mover, developing JPM Coin in 2019 and launching its blockchain unit, Onyx, in 2020. That division, now integrated under Kinexys, conducted blockchain-based repo trades, cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlements with partners including BlackRock and Siemens.

The bank plans a broader rollout of Kynexis Fund Flow in early next year, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

The hypothetical hypercar is loaded with nods and homages to the brand's past and present

FERRARI'S latest release may be making history, but it isn't something enthusiasts can own in the real world.

The world's first digital-only hypercar debuts with awkward timing considering current trends and fads.

On Saturday, Ferrari unveiled the F76, the world's first exclusively digital hypercar that can be owned as a non-fungible token, better known as an NFT.

Arguing that the car “has taken [Ferrari's] passion for innovation to the next level” due to its lack of a tangible existence, the NFT was distributed exclusively to members of the brand's “ultra-exclusive Hyperclub program.”

The brand describes the NFT as “one of the digital assets of the initiative created” to support the Scuderia racing division's third consecutive victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans on the back of the 499P and participation in the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship.

By doing so, Scuderia and the main brand are “allowing clients to experience this journey alongside the official team.”

Ferrari is further justifying the F76's existence by calling it a “design manifesto which aims to prefigure the shapes of Ferraris of the future.”

The brand claims its creation was headed by its in-house styling center under its Senior Vice President Flavio Manzoni's stewardship.

The F76 also pays tribute to the brand's first triumph at Le Mans in 1949, achieved by co-drivers Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon in a Ferrari 166 MM Barchetta.

The hypothetical hypercar features what Ferrari calls a “double-fuselage layout designed to achieve absolute purity in airflow management,” which also creates two theoretically functioning cockpits in a likely homage to Chinetti and Selsdon.

Whereas Chinetti and Selsdon had to take turns controlling their winning 166 MM Barchetta, albeit briefly before the latter exited the race due to illness, the F76 would have each drivers' “synchronized through drive-by-wire technology” were it a tangible vehicle. 

In between these cockpits is a channel for airflow which “transforms the body itself into a wing – maximizing ground effect and stability at speed.”

On either side of each fuselage are vertical cuts which are a nod to the F80 concept car's striking design.

Ferrari also pays respect to its past with the inclusion of hideaway headlights on the front end, reminiscent of the iconic and innovate F40 and the brand's other offerings from the 70s and 80s.

Hyperclub members were given a unique privilege to customize and specially design their own F76s, a process which Ferrari claims it has completed “over three years as part of the Hyperclub initiative.”

Ferrari's Hyperclub “groups 100 of its most exclusive clients, with a passion for endurance races” per Reuters.

Ferrari has both not explained any real sense of how the NFT creates values for its purchasers, nor exactly how much the brand charged its Hyperclub members to customize and own one.

While the NFT market's peak in 2022 saw exclusive digital images being sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, these values have plummeted in the years since.

However, the exclusivity of this NFT's nature and it being an official concept car design render from Ferrari could potentially see it fetch similar or even higher prices on an open market, should one ever appear there.

While other automakers have pushed NFTs onto their customers, these have typically come alongside a tangible vehicle rather than in place of one, such as Acura and Porsche.

Although the Prancing Horse could eventually make the F76 a reality, it for now holds the title of the world's first, and currently only, digital and hypothetical hypercar.

Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein initiated coverage on Ethereum treasury company SharpLink Gaming (ticker: SBET) on Thursday with an outperform rating and a $24 price target by the end of 2026 — implying approximately 75% upside potential from its Oct. 29 closing price of $13.61.

Modeled after bitcoin treasury firm pioneer Strategy, SharpLink has built its playbook around long-term ETH accumulation and staking to earn sustainable yield. "We expect SBET to emerge as a compliant-first-institutional focused investment vehicle to access ETH as an investment and yield-generating asset," the analysts led by Gautam Chhugani said in a note to clients.

Bernstein values SharpLink at a 15% premium to its Ethereum treasury net asset value, citing its capacity to generate a 3.4% compound annual growth rate yield over the next 10 years through staking, accretive ETH or share purchases, and other onchain strategies.

The analysts described SharpLink as a "leading Ethereum treasury company," holding 860,299 ETH — about 0.7% of the total supply — with a net asset value of $3.6 billion. However, Tom Lee-chaired BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum DAT by holdings, with over 3.3 million ETH ($12.5 billion), according to its latest disclosures.

They also noted SharpLink's alignment with the broader Consensys ecosystem, founded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, who also serves as SharpLink's Chairman, and highlighted its management's institutional experience, including recent co-CEO hire Joseph Chalom, formerly BlackRock's head of strategic ecosystem partnerships.

Bernstein said the company's collaboration with Consensys — particularly through Linea and its planned $200 million ETH deployment on the Ethereum Layer 2 network — positions SharpLink to benefit from additional yield through staking, restaking, and liquidity programs.

SharpLink's shares currently trade at a 19% discount to its treasury value, but continued ETH accumulation, share buybacks, and debt scaling could close the gap over time, according to the analysts. As global interest rates decline, Bernstein expects investors to increasingly seek exposure to Ethereum yields, positioning SharpLink as a key institutional vehicle in that shift.

SBET was down 3.6% in early market trading on Thursday at $13.13, according to The Block's SharpLink price page, having plunged 83% since its summer peak alongside the broader DAT market collapse. Nevertheless, it remains up 71% year-to-date.

Predicting Ethereum to hit $25,000 by 2035

The analysts said that valuing Ethereum as a tech stack is a "flawed approach," as its objective is to maintain security of the tokenized economy, and not maximize revenue. They expect ETH's value to follow the growth of economic assets secured on the chain and value ETH as a reserve asset of the network.

They project Ethereum-native tokenized assets, including stablecoins on both Layer 1 and Layer 2s, to scale from around $172 billion today to $5 trillion by the end of 2035. They also reiterated their prediction that ETH's price will grow from less than $4,000 today to $15,000 by 2030 and $25,000 by 2035 — implying a 20% 10-year compound annual growth rate for ETH.

Analysts at investment firm Bernstein initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming with an “outperform” rating on Thursday, saying the Ethereum treasury firm's shares could nearly double as the Federal Reserve lowers borrowing costs.

Bernstein analysts issued a price target of $24 per share for SharpLink, representing an 80% increase from current prices. The firm's shares recently changed hands around $13.08, after peaking at $124.12 earlier this year, according to Yahoo Finance.

“We expect SBET to emerge as a compliant-first-institutional focused investment vehicle to access Ethereum as an investment and yield-generating asset,” the analysts wrote. “As we head into a lower rate regime, we expect significant investor appetite for SBET's ability to deliver a sustainable Ethereum yield over the industry Ethereum staking yield.”

Like Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, SharpLink seeks to grow the amount of cryptocurrency that it owns per diluted share to maximize value for shareholders. SharpLink currently owns 859,400 Ethereum that was recently worth $12.65 billion.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can be natively staked, allowing anyone to earn rewards by participating in the process of validating transactions. That's one factor making Ethereum “ideal for a digital assets strategy,” they wrote, along with the asset's robust liquidity.

“Ethereum's sustainable native staking yield (and other blockchain based yield opportunities) allows a digital asset treasury model to build sustainable operating earnings from the core treasury strategy over and above the capital market funded acquisitions,” they wrote.

Bernstein highlighted SharpLink's management team, including its Chairman, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who also created Consensys, the firm behind MetaMask. (Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

SharpLink's management team is “strongly aligned with the Ethereum ecosystem,” the analysts noted. Earlier this week, SharpLink signaled it would eventually deploy $200 million worth of its Ethereum holdings into Ethereum layer-2 Linea, which Consensys created. 

The company said that would allow them to generate enhanced yield, which includes rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services through a process known as restaking.

“This will likely enable them to generate incremental yield from multiple sources,” Bernstein analysts wrote. “Over the long term, we believe, SBET's differentiation could result in more sustainable economics and greater ability to tap institutional debt and equity markets.”

‘Significantly Undervalued'

Although SharpLink can grow its Ethereum holdings sustainably through staking and associated activities, a common tool among its competitors hasn't been consistently available.

Most treasury firms grow the amount of crypto that they own per share by issuing common equity. When a company's shares trade at a premium relative to its crypto holdings, the move allows firms to grow their holdings by capitalizing on the difference.

Oftentimes, this premium is referred to as mNAV, or multiple-to-net asset value. Some view this metric as indicative of investors' faith in a company's vision for delivering on its strategy, whether that involves Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets.

Bernstein's price target indicates a 15% premium to its crypto holdings, reflecting an ability to generate yield at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% over the next decade. It also captures 2.4% yield from Ethereum and 1% from Ethereum and share purchases, they wrote.

On Thursday, SharpLink had an mNAV of 0.88, according to Strategic Ethereum Reserve. That means the company was valued at a 19% discount relative to its crypto holdings.

“We believe the premium to SBET's ETH NAV is justified, driven by its ability to use leverage and ETH staking yields,” the analysts wrote, while acknowledging that market sentiment could also play a role and lead to fluctuations in SharpLink's share price.

The company's stock price plummeted 70% earlier this year after a registration-of-shares filing was deemed effective by the SEC. At that point, investors that funded the company's pivot away from gambling marketing had the opportunity to sell their shares.

Last month, SharpLink repurchased one million shares for $32 million, saying it believed its common stock was “significantly undervalued” in the market. In August, the company said it had gained approval to repurchase up to $1.5 billion worth of common shares.

Eventually, SharpLink could issue its own debt, mirroring Strategy, Bernstein analysts wrote. The Bitcoin-buying firm has historically issued convertible debt as a way to accumulate more of the asset and effectively take on leverage.

“We expect SBET to continue to deploy share buybacks to fill the discount gap,” they wrote. “We [then] expect SBET to gradually scale its debt strategy, as SBET share value stabilizes relative to its Ethereum NAV.”

Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,780, down 5.3% over the past 24 hours. It is up 13.5% year-to-date.

In a Myriad prediction market, just 7% of respondents believe that SharpLink will hold more Ethereum than BitMine Immersion, which currently has the largest ETH treasury. Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.

Analysts at investment firm Bernstein initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming with an “outperform” rating on Thursday, saying the Ethereum treasury firm's shares could nearly double as the Federal Reserve lowers borrowing costs.

Bernstein analysts issued a price target of $24 per share for SharpLink, representing an 80% increase from current prices. The firm's shares recently changed hands around $13.08, after peaking at $124.12 earlier this year, according to Yahoo Finance.

“We expect SBET to emerge as a compliant-first-institutional focused investment vehicle to access Ethereum as an investment and yield-generating asset,” the analysts wrote. “As we head into a lower rate regime, we expect significant investor appetite for SBET's ability to deliver a sustainable Ethereum yield over the industry Ethereum staking yield.”

Like Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, SharpLink seeks to grow the amount of cryptocurrency that it owns per diluted share to maximize value for shareholders. SharpLink currently owns 859,400 Ethereum that was recently worth $12.65 billion.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can be natively staked, allowing anyone to earn rewards by participating in the process of validating transactions. That's one factor making Ethereum “ideal for a digital assets strategy,” they wrote, along with the asset's robust liquidity.

“Ethereum's sustainable native staking yield (and other blockchain based yield opportunities) allows a digital asset treasury model to build sustainable operating earnings from the core treasury strategy over and above the capital market funded acquisitions,” they wrote.

Bernstein highlighted SharpLink's management team, including its Chairman, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who also created Consensys, the firm behind MetaMask. (Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

SharpLink's management team is “strongly aligned with the Ethereum ecosystem,” the analysts noted. Earlier this week, SharpLink signaled it would eventually deploy $200 million worth of its Ethereum holdings into Ethereum layer-2 Linea, which Consensys created. 

The company said that would allow them to generate enhanced yield, which includes rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services through a process known as restaking.

“This will likely enable them to generate incremental yield from multiple sources,” Bernstein analysts wrote. “Over the long term, we believe, SBET's differentiation could result in more sustainable economics and greater ability to tap institutional debt and equity markets.”

‘Significantly Undervalued'

Although SharpLink can grow its Ethereum holdings sustainably through staking and associated activities, a common tool among its competitors hasn't been consistently available.

Most treasury firms grow the amount of crypto that they own per share by issuing common equity. When a company's shares trade at a premium relative to its crypto holdings, the move allows firms to grow their holdings by capitalizing on the difference.

Oftentimes, this premium is referred to as mNAV, or multiple-to-net asset value. Some view this metric as indicative of investors' faith in a company's vision for delivering on its strategy, whether that involves Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets.

Bernstein's price target indicates a 15% premium to its crypto holdings, reflecting an ability to generate yield at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% over the next decade. It also captures 2.4% yield from Ethereum and 1% from Ethereum and share purchases, they wrote.

On Thursday, SharpLink had an mNAV of 0.88, according to Strategic Ethereum Reserve. That means the company was valued at a 19% discount relative to its crypto holdings.

“We believe the premium to SBET's ETH NAV is justified, driven by its ability to use leverage and ETH staking yields,” the analysts wrote, while acknowledging that market sentiment could also play a role and lead to fluctuations in SharpLink's share price.

The company's stock price plummeted 70% earlier this year after a registration-of-shares filing was deemed effective by the SEC. At that point, investors that funded the company's pivot away from gambling marketing had the opportunity to sell their shares.

Last month, SharpLink repurchased one million shares for $32 million, saying it believed its common stock was “significantly undervalued” in the market. In August, the company said it had gained approval to repurchase up to $1.5 billion worth of common shares.

Eventually, SharpLink could issue its own debt, mirroring Strategy, Bernstein analysts wrote. The Bitcoin-buying firm has historically issued convertible debt as a way to accumulate more of the asset and effectively take on leverage.

“We expect SBET to continue to deploy share buybacks to fill the discount gap,” they wrote. “We [then] expect SBET to gradually scale its debt strategy, as SBET share value stabilizes relative to its Ethereum NAV.”

Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,780, down 5.3% over the past 24 hours. It is up 13.5% year-to-date.

In a Myriad prediction market, just 7% of respondents believe that SharpLink will hold more Ethereum than BitMine Immersion, which currently has the largest ETH treasury. Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.

Bank Indonesia (BI) is advancing its central bank digital currency (CBDC) project with a new model that integrates stablecoin mechanics, making the upcoming digital rupiah one of the world's first sovereign digital currencies backed by government bonds. 

The initiative, announced by BI Governor Perry Warjiyo at the Indonesia Digital Finance and Economy Festival and Fintech Summit 2025 in Jakarta, represents a major step in the nation's financial digitalization under Project Garuda.

Governor Warjiyo revealed that the digital rupiah will be supported by “digital central bank securities,” tokenized versions of government bonds, known locally as Surat Berharga Negara (SBN). 

“We will issue Bank Indonesia securities. We have a digital version, a digital Bank Indonesia rupiah with underlying government bonds, and a national Indonesian stablecoin version,” he said.

This approach effectively combines the security of a central bank-issued currency with the stability of an asset-backed digital token, creating what BI officials describe as a “national stablecoin.” 

The model ties the value of the digital rupiah directly to government bonds through tokenization, ensuring that each unit of digital currency is underpinned by a tangible, stable asset.

Bank Indonesia's new framework aligns with its broader digital finance agenda, which focuses on expanding innovation and acceptance, strengthening industrial structures, and maintaining financial stability. 

The move also builds on the success of the Project Garuda proof-of-concept completed in December 2024, which tested distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms such as Corda and Hyperledger Besu for digital currency issuance, redemption, and fund transfers.

Under the bond-backed design, BI will tokenize government bonds to issue digital securities built atop the CBDC infrastructure. 

The system aims to enhance market liquidity by making bond settlement faster and more transparent while reducing transaction costs through blockchain-based automation. 

Indonesia's central bank says the hybrid CBDC will provide multiple advantages, including greater monetary policy control, improved payment efficiency, and enhanced security. 

Unlike private stablecoins, which carry credit and issuer risks, the digital rupiah will be a direct liability of the central bank. Officials believe this structure will reinforce public trust while offering faster, cheaper, and more programmable payments domestically and internationally.

The central bank's plan to issue a bond-backed CBDC could help counter the growing influence of private digital currencies while preserving national monetary sovereignty. 

Through Project Garuda, BI aims to provide a safer, government-backed alternative to privately issued stablecoins, offering price stability, regulatory oversight, and financial inclusion.

Notably, the rollout will occur in phases, starting with a wholesale digital rupiah for interbank transfers before expanding to a retail version for the public.

Deputy Governor Juda Agung previously stated that findings from the proof-of-concept will form the foundation for the next development phase, focusing on scalability and operational readiness. 

The project's design emphasizes interoperability across digital platforms, ensuring that the digital rupiah can integrate seamlessly with existing payment systems and international standards such as ISO 20022.

Indonesia's approach stands out globally. While China's e-CNY focuses on retail use and state control, and the Bahamas' Sand Dollar targets financial inclusion, Indonesia's model blends both elements, central trust and asset-backed stability.

Unlike Singapore's Project Orchid or Hong Kong's e-HKD, which prioritize programmability and private collaboration, Indonesia's CBDC directly incorporates stablecoin-style asset backing to ensure long-term stability.

Beyond policy innovation, the digital rupiah comes amid rapid growth in Indonesia's crypto sector. 

🇮🇩 Indonesia's crypto market is booming! With over $30 billion in transactions and 21 million traders in 2024, the country is solidifying its status among the global crypto leaders.#Indonesia #Cryptohttps://t.co/IicWGY4fID

The country recorded over 475 trillion rupiah (around $30 billion) in crypto transactions by late 2024, a 352% increase from the previous year, with more than 21 million traders now participating. 

According to a study by the University of Indonesia, the crypto industry contributed $4.4 billion to GDP in 2024 and generated over 333,000 jobs.

Notably, Indonesia secured the seventh position in Chainalysis's 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index.

Cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks opened lower Thursday as the Fed's surprisingly hawkish turn Wednesday outweighed solid progress on the Chinese trade front.

Presidents Trump and Xi met overnight and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Thursday morning said the U.S. government is pausing plans to expand a blacklist of Chinese companies. He also touted an agreement for China to sizably up its purchases of U.S. soybeans this year and into the future.

Where once those sorts of headlines might have sent traditional and crypto markets higher, it appears the good news may have been priced in.

Instead, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's insistence yesterday that further rate cuts were far from assured continued to rattle markets, with bond yields and the dollar both continuing to firm.

Bitcoin BTC$107,581.83 took out Wednesday's lows, plunging below $108,000 to its weakest price in more than a week. It's lost 4.4% over the past 24 hours and is down nearly 8% from Monday's high of $116,000.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3,944.51 tumbled 5% breaking below $3,800. Major altcoins XRP$2.4591, solana SOL$185.07, DOGE$0.1934 and ADA$0.6467 shed 5%-7% in a day.

Crypto-related stocks mirrored the broader market's downward trend. Shares of Coinbase (COIN), which reports third-quarter earnings after the market-close, were down nearly 3%. Strategy (MSTR), Robinhood (HOOD) and Circle (CRCL) all fell 2% while Gemini (GEMI) took a bigger hit and dropped nearly 5%. Miners also traded lower.

Also dealing with a busy earnings season, the Nasdaq is lower by 1%, with Meta down 12% on disappointing results and Google ahead 5% after the opposite. The S&P 500 is only marginally lower and the DJIA is higher on the session.

As October is nearly over, crypto traders' high expectation for a bullish month, often dubbed "Uptober," is almost certainly being shattered. At current prices, bitcoin is down more than 5% for the month in what would be its worst October return since 2014.

With crypto market in correction mode, the frenzy around digital asset treasuries (DAT), which took over Wall street earlier this year with public companies pivoting to purchase cryptos by selling shares and debt, continued to unravel. Many once-high-flying stocks fell below the net asset value of their underlying holdings.

Strategy (MSTR) has hit a fresh low since the April tariff tantrum, now trading at $268, down over 50% from its all-time high in November 2024, including a staggering fall of about 40% since the middle of July. The company reports third quarter earnings after the closing bell today. MSTR currently trades at a 1.33x premium to its net asset value (mNAV), its weakest per that metric since February 2024.

KindlyMD (NAKA), another BTC treasury, is down 6%, trading just below $0.90 and facing pressure of getting delisted from Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Strive (ASST) is trading below its $1.35 warrant price at $1.30, creating an obvious short-term headwind for further upside.

Thursday also brought another entrant into the DAT game with SEGG Media Corporation (SEGG), announcing a $300 million digital asset strategy to "generate sustainable on-chain yield, accelerate tokenization across sports and entertainment, and embed blockchain infrastructure into its global media ecosystem." Just months ago, the headline alone would have spurred major gains for the nanocap, but the DAT bubble having since been popped, shares are slipping 3% on Thursday.

There is no better time to engage with technology than now.

Chris Lyons, the president of Web3 Media at a16z crypto, has taken the stage at the AFROTECH™ Conference 2025 in Houston, which is reaching students, founders, technologists, and creators from all walks of life. He encouraged attendees to embrace today's advancements in tech.

Drawing from his roots in the music industry, where he once worked as a sound engineer, he references Soulja Boy as a prime example of embracing technology. The rapper used music production software Fruity Loops, now known as FL Studio, to release his debut hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” which was created using the program's stock sounds, notes VICE.

“I grew up in Atlanta, and I remember hearing Soulja Boy first coming out for this. He was recording literally in his bathroom. And when I used to work in a studio, you literally had to go to a physical recording studio,” Lyons explained.

“But by having the software and having the equipment makes things 10 times easier for more people to have access to go put out their work,” he continued.

To no surprise, AI will play a major role in shaping the future across industries and will create a new bottom line, Lyons projects.

“There's going to be a change in the space and change in the industry, but the bottom line is you're going to see an industry, a class that has never existed,” Lyons said on the stage.

As a result of this, he believes there's no better time than now to be involved.

“Fast forward to where we are today. Honestly, I feel like there's no better time to be into technology … and to leverage these tools because you have companies like Runway, for example, that make it so that you don't even have to know how to code … You can literally just prompt an idea that will eventually turn into your next iPhone app or your next mobile web product. People are looking for people who know how to use the tools to get ahead as opposed to thinking through the old school days of ‘I have a startup and in order for me to actually build this company, I'm going to need five software engineers,' when literally you can have one person and three lines of code get 10 steps ahead,” he said.

With more information and tools at everyone's fingertips, Lyons doubled down on the importance of leveraging the moment. This will be key in the next wave of innovation and ensuring we are not left out of opportunities in wealth building and ownership.

“At the end of the day, we need to make sure that we're owners of our products. We need to make sure that we are understanding where the next generation of wealth is happening. Obviously, it's within the technology industry,” Lyons explained.

“Anybody could have bought Bitcoin at $100, at $1,000, at $10,000, at $100,000. The only reason you did or didn't is because of the access to the information. And so, making sure that we're keeping ourselves connected as a community as we're sharing the game, I consider it a free game,” he continued.

It's not too late to be a part of the movement. Secure your ticket for the conference today.

                            Alaska Airlines was among the companies impacted by Wednesday's Azure outage: | Photo by Jeffry S.S. via Pexels.                        

Barely a week after Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major outage affecting customers around the world, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, Microsoft Azure experienced a similar cloud failure.

The recent outages have reignited calls for blockchain-based alternatives, which advocates argue are more resilient than centralized cloud services.

Starting at around 15:30 UTC on Wednesday, reports  of Azure outages on DownDetector spiked, remaining elevated for around two hours. Other services were also affected, including Microsoft 365 and Xbox Live.

In a statement on Azure's live status page , Microsoft said the issue was related to its application delivery network, Azure Front Door. Blaming the incident on an “inadvertent configuration change,” the firm said it managed to restore services by rebooting the system to its last-known working state.

Despite Microsoft's actions to mitigate the problem, some users reported disruption lasting 6–8 hours, a similar timeframe to the previous AWS failure.

After the AWS outage caused service disruption for Coinbase, Snapchat, Fortnite, and others, the Azure blackout wreaked even more havock. Around the world, Starbucks, Vodafone, Heathrow Airport, and Natwest wer among those affected.

According to the latest research  from Synergy, the Big Three hyperscalars—AWS, Microsoft, and Google—account for nearly two-thirds of the global cloud market. In Q3 2025, AWS alone had a 31% market share.

Over the years, incidents of downtime have done little to slow cloud adoption or the growth of Big Tech services. Nonetheless, recent outages prompted some companies to reevaluate how much they rely on them.

For instance, the smart bed manufacturer Eight Sleep shipped a new “outage mode” after the temperature control feature on its mattresses started behaving erratically while AWS was down.

Despite criticism of the hyperscalar cloud model, or at least, a recognition of its vulnerabilities, business leaders don't all agree on the best remedy.

In the wake of recent outages, systems engineers around the world have been debating the merits of multi-cloud versus hybrid or on-premise solutions. Meanwhile, for proponents of decentralization, blockchains offer a compelling solution to many cloud challenges.

Although it's hard to capture the full range of services single under a single, overarching definition, a few key themes characterize the decentralized cloud movement.

Storage is arguably the most established layer of the decentralized cloud stack. Platforms like IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave connect hardware nodes in a distributed network, using blockchain ledgers to record where data is stored and orchestrate payments.

In recent years, GPU networks like Render and Aethir have applied the same logic to compute. As with decentralized storage solutions, these platforms use blockchains to connect buyers and sellers, each with their own tokenomic model.

Finally, several projects are developing full-stack decentralized clouds that combine storage and compute. For instance, Internet Computer (ICP) “canisters” function as smart contracts with memory and compute capacity, enabling applications that run fully on-chain.

While blockchain networks can be more resilient than centralized servers, decentralization isn't a silver bullet. It also comes at the cost of increased latency, which slows delivery and drives up costs.

Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov has argued  that the best way to apply blockchains to the cloud market is as a neutral orchestration layer. In this model, cloud providers of various types compete in an open market. If one goes down, the blockchain automatically routes users to a live alternative.

Gorbunov's vision promotes fairer and more transparent pricing. This stands in contrast with the current cloud market, in which hyperscalers lock customers into fixed contracts that make switching providers difficult.

The design of cryptographic hash functions is crucial for ensuring the security of digital information. In this context, cellular automata (CAs) have emerged as a promising tool due to their inherent parallelism, determinism, and simplicity. However, traditional CAs may not fully meet the requirements for cryptographic hash functions in terms of randomness, collision resistance, and avalanche effect. To address these challenges, we propose a design of cryptographic hash functions based on improved cellular automata. Our approach involves refining the rules of CAs to enhance their cryptographic properties. By incorporating random chaotic rules and optimizing parameters, we create a hash function that exhibits excellent performance in terms of randomness, collision resistance, and avalanche effect. Furthermore, the parallel nature of CAs allows for the simultaneous processing of multiple data blocks, significantly improving the efficiency of the hash function. Our design leverages these advantages to provide a robust and efficient cryptographic hash function that is suitable for a wide range of applications.

The rapid adoption of cloud auditing, blockchain systems, and distributed storage technologies has revolutionized data management for enterprises, yet simultaneously intensified security demands. While these innovations mitigate the challenges of massive data maintenance, their dependence on third-party cloud service providers (CSPs) introduces critical vulnerabilities – CSPs frequently fail to deliver guaranteed data integrity or sufficient privacy safeguards. This paradox underscores the indispensable role of cryptographic hash functions as foundational security primitives.

As the cornerstone of modern cryptography, cryptographic hash algorithms operate through deterministic one-way transformations that generate fixed-length digests from variable-length inputs. Their design mandates three non-negotiable properties:

‌Computational Irreversibility‌: Preimage resistance ensuring infeasibility of deriving original inputs from hash outputs;

‌Collision Resistance‌: Practical impossibility of identifying distinct inputs producing identical digests;

‌Avalanche Effect‌: Microscopic input alterations trigger drastic output deviations (> 50% bit-flipping).

These properties collectively enable critical security functionalities:

‌Data Fingerprinting‌: Unique hash digests authenticate information integrity in blockchain transactions and cloud audits;

‌Tamper Evidence‌: Avalanche-driven sensitivity detects minimal unauthorized modifications in stored records;

‌Protocol Enforcement‌: Irreversibility secures password hashing and digital signature schemes against brute-force attacks.

However, emerging threats like message extension exploits and adaptive collision attacks expose limitations in current hash designs (e.g., SHA-2/3 families). Furthermore, escalating data volumes in cloud-blockchain ecosystems exacerbate computational overheads, demanding hash algorithms that reconcile rigorous security with time/space efficiency. Addressing these challenges through novel hash constructions – particularly for post-quantum resilience and parallel processing optimization – has become an urgent research priority. Sustained advancements in this domain will directly determine the trustworthiness and scalability of next-generation decentralized infrastructures.

The foundational work in cryptographic hash functions stems from early designs such as ‌MD4‌ (Rivest, 1990)1 and ‌MD5‌ (Rivest, 1992)2, which introduced efficient message-digest algorithms for integrity verification. Subsequent standards like ‌FIPS 180‌ (NIST, 1993–2002)3,4,5 formalized the SHA family, while ‌RIPEMD-160‌ (Dobbertin, 1996)6 improved collision resistance through dual parallel pipelines. Merkle's work (1990)7 explored the interplay between DES and hash functions, and Wolfram (2002)8 later proposed cellular automata as a theoretical basis for cryptographic primitives. These early efforts laid the groundwork for analyzing hash function security and scalability.

 The vulnerabilities of classical hash functions have been extensively studied. Boer and Bosselaers (1991)9 demonstrated attacks on MD4's final rounds, while Dobbertin (1996)10,11 pioneered collision attacks on MD4 and MD5. Wang et al. (2004–2005)12,13,14,15 revolutionized cryptanalysis by breaking MD5, SHA-0, and SHA-1 using differential collision techniques. Subsequent refinements by Liang and Lai (2005)16 and Sasaki et al. (2007)17 optimized attack efficiency. Stevens (2013)18 further advanced SHA-1 attacks via joint local-collision analysis. Lee J(2012)19 exploits two backward queries to the underlying primitive to find a collision for the JH compression function, though iteration significantly enhances its collision resistance in the random permutation model. Li W.(2017)20 evaluating its cryptographic robustness against potential vulnerabilities and performance implications for IoT applications. These studies highlight the critical need for robust collision resistance in hash designs.

Modern research focuses on post-quantum and chaos-based paradigms. Karthik and Bala (2019)21 proposed a provably secure keyless hash framework, while Ayubi et al. (2023)22 and Alawida et al. (2020–2021)23,24 leveraged chaotic maps, DNA sequences, and finite automata for entropy enhancement. Quantum-inspired designs like Li et al.'s (2023)25 quantum walk-based hash and Guo et al.'s (2022)26 MDPH security proof address future threats. Kanso and Ghebleh (2015)27 introduced chaotic substitution-permutation networks, demonstrating resistance to differential attacks. These innovations prioritize adaptability to evolving cryptographic threats.

Parallel architectures aim to optimize throughput for big data and cloud applications. Yang et al. (2019–2022)28,29 designed compressive parallel structures and multi-iterative frameworks for high-speed hashing. Je et al. (2015)30 and Nouri et al. (2014)31 implemented chaotic shuffle-exchange networks and Chebyshev-Halley methods for parallelism. Meysam(2016)32 proposes a novel keyed parallel hashing scheme leveraging a new chaotic system to enhance cryptographic security and processing efficiency. Wang et al. (2011)33 utilized coupled map lattices, while Kevin and Robert (2017)34 optimized tree-based modes. Salvatore et al. (2016)35 proposed a cuckoo hashing pipeline for throughput scalability, emphasizing hardware-friendly implementations. Liu H.(2021)36 proposes a novel chaos-based hash function enhanced by parallel impulse perturbation, leveraging chaotic dynamics to improve cryptographic security and collision resistance in hash algorithms.

Hash functions are integral to diverse applications. Yang et al. (2015)37 enhanced cancelable fingerprint encryption via hash-based salting, while Guesmi et al. (2016)38 and Ye et al. (2016)39 integrated SHA-2 and chaotic diffusion for secure image encryption. Teh et al. (2019–2020)40,41 developed chaos-based keyed and unkeyed hashes for IoT devices. Rajeshwaran and Anil (2019)42 employed cellular automata for lightweight cryptographic hashing. Bertoni et al.'s sponge construction (2007)43 and Biham-Dunkelman's HAIFA model (2007)44 generalized iterative frameworks for flexibility in application-specific designs.

Beyond attacks, broader security principles have been explored. Lucks (2005)45 advocated failure-friendly design to mitigate catastrophic breaches, while Khushboo and Dhananjoy (2019)46 analyzed MGR hashes for statistical robustness. Li et al. (2021)47 exposed vulnerabilities in authenticated data structures, and Zhang et al. (2021)48 reformed SHA-2 message expansion for pipeline efficiency. Sponge functions (Bertoni et al., 2007)43 and Merkle-Damgård variants (Merkle, 1990)7 remain pivotal in formalizing indifferentiability and domain extension.

Proposed a new application of cellular automata-based parallel hash engines with dynamic stochastic diffusion (short for CPHDSD). By optimizing chaotic rules and dynamic parameter selection, it simultaneously enhances collision resistance, avalanche effect, and computational efficiency. The parallel nature of CAs enables multithreaded processing, significantly accelerating hashing speed in big data scenarios while maintaining a compact structure suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Demonstrated CPHDSD's exceptional security through million-scale experiments:

Collision Resistance‌: No collisions detected, with minimum/maximum Hamming distance approaching the theoretical optimum (256).

Avalanche Effect‌: Critical parameters achieved theoretical optima within 3–7 steps, outperforming mainstream algorithms (MD5, SHA-family, etc.).

Information Entropy‌: Average entropy over 3.9, exceeding SHA3 and state-of-the-art literature results, with output distribution approaching perfect randomness (hexadecimal character error < 0.085%).

The proposed hash algorithm employs a parallel compression framework, reducing theoretical computation time (2368*T) to 30%−70% of comparable algorithms. Experiments show its time growth follows a near-logarithmic curve, delivering superior efficiency over traditional serial architectures (e.g., SHA-family) and other parallel schemes for large-file processing. This positions the parallel hash algorithm as an optimized solution for cloud storage and blockchain applications requiring high-throughput hashing.

 The paper is organized as follows: Sect. “Preliminary knowledge” provides preliminary knowledge of cellular automata and parallel hash, Sect. “Proposed algorithm” presents our core technical contribution - a novel cryptographic hash function that simultaneously achieves enhanced collision resistance, computational efficiency, and implementation compactness. This is followed by Sect. “Algorithm analysis”, which provides a comprehensive performance evaluation through both theoretical security analysis and empirical benchmarking against existing standards. Finally, Sect. “Conclusion and future work” concludes with a synthesis of our key findings, discusses practical implications for security systems, and outlines promising directions for future research in hash function optimization.

To comprehensively address the design of parallel hash functions based on cellular automata (CAs), the following core principles and interdisciplinary knowledge must be clarified. These concepts form the theoretical backbone for understanding the integration of CAs into cryptographic systems.

‌Cellular Automata (CA) are discrete computational models first proposed by John von Neumann in the 1950 s and later advanced by scholars such as John Conway and Stephen Wolfram. Their core definitions and characteristics are as follows:

A cellular automaton is a dynamic system defined over a discrete, finite-state cellular space, evolving through local rules across discrete time steps.

Cell: The basic unit of a CA, distributed on a discrete spatial grid (e.g., 1D, 2D, or nD Euclidean space).

Lattice: The regular grid structure housing cells, which can be 1D, 2D, or multidimensional.

State: Each cell holds a finite set of discrete states (e.g., 0/1, alive/dead).

Neighbors: Cells directly adjacent to a given cell (e.g., von Neumann or Moore neighborhoods).

Rule: State updates depend on a cell's current state and its neighbors' states, governed by deterministic local rules.

Discreteness: Time, space, and states are inherently discrete.

Locality: State transitions rely only on a cell's immediate neighbors.

Synchrony: All cells update states simultaneously at each time step.

Determinism: Given current states, the next state is uniquely defined.

Homogeneity & Uniformity: Identical rules govern all cells, arranged in regular patterns.

A standard CA is formally defined as a quadruple:

where

L: Cellular lattice (spatial grid),

S: Finite set of states,

N: Neighborhood configuration,

f: Transition function\(\:\:f:{S}^{\left[N\right]}\to\:S\).

Cellular automata are widely used to simulate complex systems, including traffic flow modeling, crowd evacuation dynamics, biological systems (e.g., morphogenesis), and physical phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics).

To sum up, cellular automata are discrete dynamic models based on simple local rules, enabling the emergence of complex global behavior through localized interactions. Their versatility in simulating real-world systems and theoretical significance in computational universality make them a cornerstone of complexity science.

Parallel hashing is a strategy that accelerates hash computations by leveraging multiple computing resources simultaneously, such as multi-core processors, GPUs, or distributed computing nodes. Traditional hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 or MD5) typically follow a sequential processing model, where data is handled block by block. In contrast, parallel hashing improves efficiency in large-scale data processing by dividing tasks and executing them concurrently.

The essence of parallel hashing lies in splitting input data into independent subtasks, each processed by distinct computing units. For example, in distributed systems, data may be partitioned and assigned to multiple nodes. Each node computes the hash for its allocated data chunk, and the final hash value is generated through merging or cascading operations. Key challenges in this architecture include designing effective data partitioning strategies, synchronizing parallel tasks, and ensuring consistency in the final result.

Parallel hashing is critical in scenarios requiring high-speed hash computations:

Blockchain Technology: In consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW), parallel hashing accelerates hash collision searches for candidate blocks.

Big Data Storage: Distributed file systems (e.g., IPFS) use parallel hashing to rapidly verify the integrity of massive datasets.

Real-Time Secure Communication: High-throughput network environments benefit from parallel computation to speed up hash operations during TLS handshake processes.

Despite its performance advantages, implementing parallel hashing faces several challenges:

Data Dependencies: Certain hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-3) have inherent sequential dependencies, making parallelization difficult without algorithmic modifications or hardware enhancements.

Load Balancing: Uneven data partitioning may leave some computing units idle, reducing overall efficiency.

Synchronization Overhead: Communication and coordination between nodes can introduce latency, particularly in distributed environments.

To sum up, parallel hashing overcomes the performance limitations of traditional sequential hashing by harnessing modern parallel computing hardware. However, its design must balance algorithmic characteristics, hardware architecture, and application-specific requirements. With advancements in heterogeneous computing (e.g., quantum computing or compute-in-memory architectures), the optimization potential for parallel hashing will continue to expand.

This chapter proposes a parallel hash algorithm grounded in a cellular automata and a dynamic stochastic diffusion model. In Fig. 1, the diagram depicts an iterative framework for parallel hashing, where multiple 512-bit data blocks are processed simultaneously through independent hashing units. At each stage, groups of data blocks undergo concurrent execution of the compression function H, demonstrating true parallelism in the initial processing phase. This architecture allows simultaneous hash computations across all blocks without sequential dependencies, maximizing throughput during the primary transformation step.

The iterative nature emerges as intermediate results from parallel processing are systematically integrated into subsequent stages. After the initial parallel H operations, outputs are strategically combined through layered merging phases, creating chained dependencies that feed back into the workflow. This hybrid approach maintains parallel efficiency for raw data processing while introducing controlled sequential linkages for result consolidation, enabling both high-speed computation and coherent hash value generation across iterations.

Parallel hash tree construction.

Entropy analysis quantifies the ‌uncertainty‌ or ‌randomness‌ in the dynamical behavior of cellular automata. Here's the step-by-step process to analyze CA rules using entropy.

‌Input‌: A CA rule (e.g., Rule 30, Rule 110).

‌Initialization‌:

Generate a random binary initial configuration (e.g., a single 1 in the center, surrounded by 0 s).

Define a finite lattice (e.g., 100 cells with periodic boundary conditions).

‌Simulation‌:

Evolve the CA for multiple time steps (e.g., 1000 iterations).

Record the spatial configuration at each time step.

For each time step t:

Divide the lattice into overlapping/non-overlapping ‌blocks‌ of size k(e.g., k = 3: triplets of neighboring cells).

Count the frequency of each block pattern (e.g., “000”, “001”, …, “111”).

Compute probabilities\(\:\:{p}_{i}\)for each block i:

‌Shannon Entropy‌:

Calculate

.

For\(\:\:k=1\): Measures entropy of single-cell states (simpler but less sensitive).

For \(\:k\ge\:2\): Captures correlations between neighboring cells (more powerful for distinguishing classes).

‌Compute the mean entropy\(\:\:\stackrel{{\vee}}{H}\) over a sliding window of\(\:\:{N}_{step}\) (e.g., 100 steps):

‌Entropy Dynamics‌:

Plot\(\:\:H\left(t\right)\) vs. t to observe trends:

‌Class 1 (Uniform)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\to\:0\) as entropy collapses (all cells identical).

‌Class 2 (Periodic)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\) oscillates periodically (e.g., entropy peaks and troughs align with cycle length).

‌Class 3 (Chaotic)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\) remains high and fluctuates irregularly.

‌Class 4 (Complex)‌: Moderate entropy with intermittent peaks (structured chaos).

‌Block Size k: Larger k improves discrimination but increases computational cost. For ECA, k = 3 often suffices.

‌Time Window\(\:{\:N}_{step}\): Ensure\(\:{\:N}_{step}\) exceeds the period length for Class 2 rules (e.g., \(\:{N}_{step}=200\) for cycles of period 50).

‌Class 2 vs. Class 3‌:

‌Class 2‌: Fourier transform of\(\:\:H\left(t\right)\) reveals dominant frequency (periodicity).

‌Class 3‌: Power spectrum of\(\:\:H\left(t\right)\) is broadband (noisy).

‌Thresholds‌:

‌High Entropy‌:\(\:\:\stackrel{\vee}{H}>0.8\times\:{log}_{2}\left({2}^{k}\right)\left(e.g.,\stackrel{\vee}{H}>2.4\:for\:k=3\right)\) 

‌Low Entropy‌: \(\:\:\stackrel{\vee}{H}<0.2\times\:{log}_{2}\left({2}^{k}\right)\)

‌Rule 30 (Class 3)‌:\(\:\:H\left(t\right)\) remains near\(\:\:{log}_{2}\left(8\right)=3\)(maximum entropy for k = 3). No periodic oscillations (broadband spectrum).

‌Rule 4 (Class 2)‌: \(\:H\left(t\right)\) oscillates with period matching the stripe pattern (e.g., period 2).

Fourier spectrum shows sharp peaks at specific frequencies.

‌Visual Inspection‌: Cross-check entropy results with spacetime diagrams.

‌Lyapunov Exponent‌: Class 3 rules exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents (sensitive dependence on initial conditions).

For each compression function H, the cellular automaton undergoes two processes: the automaton's operation and the encryption loop.

Step 1: Cellular Automata.

Here's a classification of the 256 elementary cellular automata rules based on their behavioral characteristics, organized by Stephen Wolfram's widely accepted taxonomy. Wolfram's classification divides CA rules into ‌4 classes‌ based on their long-term dynamical behavior:

‌Class I: Homogeneous/Uniform Behavior‌

‌Characteristics‌: Evolves to a static, uniform state (all cells identical).

‌Examples‌: Rules 0, 8, 32, 40, 128, 160, 168, 232.

‌Total Rules‌: ~8% (≈ 20 rules).

‌Class II: Periodic/Repetitive Behavior‌

‌Characteristics‌: Forms stable or oscillating periodic patterns.

‌Examples‌: Rules 4, 12, 19, 23, 27, 50, 51, 60, 72, 76, 108, 129, 150, 156, 178, 200, 204.

‌Total Rules‌: ~41% (≈ 105 rules).

‌Class III: Chaotic/Aperiodic Behavior‌

‌Characteristics‌: Exhibits pseudorandom, disordered patterns with no long-term structure.

‌Examples‌: Rules 18, 22, 30, 45, 54, 73, 90, 105, 106, 110 (borderline Class IV), 122, 126, 146, 150 (borderline), 182.

‌Total Rules‌: ~34% (≈ 87 rules).

‌Class IV: Complex/Edge-of-Chaos Behavior‌

‌Characteristics‌: Produces localized structures and long-range correlations; capable of universal computation.

‌Examples‌: Rules 110, 41, 54, 106, 109, 124, 137, 147, 193.

‌Total Rules‌: ~17% (≈ 44 rules).

The classification schema for hash functions delineates four distinct behavioral categories: the first two categories are classified as deterministic (Class I & II), the third category exhibits stochastic properties (Class III), while the fourth demonstrates non-uniform pseudorandom characteristics (Class IV)46. Through rigorous analysis, the hash algorithm exclusively selects candidates from the third category due to its optimal entropy profile.

Class III rules primarily include the following entries:

18, 22, 30, 45, 54, 60, 73, 75, 86, 89, 90, 101, 102, 105, 106, 110, 122, 126, 129, 135, 146, 149, 150, 151, 153, 161, 165, 182, 183, 195,….

The rules within Class III undergo systematic arrangement in ascending numerical order, followed by combinatorial selection of 16 candidates fulfilling strict equilibrium criteria (balanced 4-zero/4-one configurations across all 8-cell neighborhood permutations). These rules are subjected to cryptographically secure permutation to yield a restructured rule table (Table 1), ensuring stochastic distribution while preserving entropy constraints. A deterministic bijection is subsequently established between the shuffled indices\(\:\:{Q}_{j}\left(\text{j}\in\:\{\text{0,1},\dots\:,15\}\right)\) and their corresponding cellular automaton transition functions. This mapping protocol facilitates reproducible rule retrieval during iterative hash compression stages, enabling: state-space traversal optimization, nonlinear Boolean operation embedding, avalanche-compliant entropy diffusion.

Step 2 Key Generation

Given a key, perform SHA3 calculation on the key and generate the corresponding hash value. For example, for the key ‘CA', after calculating\(\:\:\text{S}\text{H}\text{A}3-512\left(\text{C}\text{A}\right)\), the result is used for Step 3. To ensure the security, a new key can be periodically replaced.

Step 3 Automatic Iteration of Cellular Automata.

For the hash value:

Step 4 Dynamic Stochastic Diffusion Model

Message extension: For each message block\(\:{\:m}_{j}\), perform the following message extension operations to output 132 message words.

Divide\(\:{\:m}_{j}\) into 16 32-bit message words\(\:{\:MW}_{i}\:\left(i=0,\:1,\:\cdots\:,\:15\right)\),

For message x, we define two variable-parameter permutation functions as follows:

Parameters\(\:\:\alpha\:,\beta\:,\gamma\:,\delta\:\) are undetermined, and\(\:ROT{L}_{y}\left(x\right)\) is a y-bit loop left-shift operation function. To obtain better resistance to differential attacks, the values of\(\:\:\alpha\:,\beta\:,\gamma\:,\delta\:\) should be mutually prime; therefore, the differential attack becomes increasingly difficult and difficult to continue.

For message word\(\:{\:MW}_{i}\:\left(i=16,\:17,\:\cdots\:,\:131\right)\), the message is expanded as follows:

As soon as the number of 512-bit message blocks is established, for example, if\(\:\:n=64\), first defines the initial link constants as:

The 64 constant variables\(\:{\:\text{K}}_{k}\) (the first 64 bits of the results above) are listed in Table 2. These constant variables increase the uncertainty and unpredictability of the compression function, thereby enhancing the collision resistance of the algorithm.

Define two logical functions:

\(\:\stackrel{-}{x}\) is the reverse operation of x, \(\:{TEMP}_{k}\) is the intermediate link variable state at the k-th iteration, consisting of 8 registers\(\:\:A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H\). For each message block\(\:{\:m}_{j}\), conduct 64 rounds of iteration in the following iteration mode:

The specific iteration process can be described as follows:

\(\:A\leftarrow\:\text{M}\text{a}\text{j}\left(A,B,C\right)+D+{ROTL}_{7}\left({ROTL}_{12}\left(A\right)+E+{ROTL}_{k}\left({K}_{k}\right)\right)+{ROTL}_{12}\left(A\right)+{MW}_{k+68}\)

\(\:B\leftarrow\:\text{C}\text{A}\left(A,k,1\right)\)

\(\:C\leftarrow\:{ROTL}_{9}\left(B\right)\)

\(\:D\leftarrow\:\text{C}\)

\(\:E\leftarrow\:{{\Sigma\:}}_{0}\left(\text{C}\text{h}\left(A,B,C\right)+H+\left({ROTL}_{7}\left({ROTL}_{12}\left(A\right)+E+{ROTL}_{k}\left({K}_{k}\right)\right)\right){+MW}_{k}\right)\)

\(\:F\leftarrow\:\text{E}\)

\(\:G\leftarrow\:{ROTL}_{19}\left(F\right)\)

\(\:H\leftarrow\:\text{G}\)

In this process, the input of each round of iteration\(\:{\:TEMP}_{k}\) comes from the output results of the previous round and message block\(\:{\:m}_{j}\) iteration compression. The initial link variable\(\:{\:TEMP}_{0}\) is presented in Table 3.

As stated previously, a secure hash function must possess strong collision resistance and produce an output that exhibits uniform distribution and sensitivity to slight changes. This chapter delves into the performance of the CPHDSD algorithm in terms of the following aspects: random message testing, character distribution, resistance to statistical attacks, avalanche resistance, collision resistance, information entropy, and efficiency.

The local hardware configuration includes a multi-core processor (‌Intel Core i5-13400) with clock speeds exceeding 2.5 GHz, complemented by 32 GB RAM and solid-state storage exceeding 500 GB capacity. Discrete or integrated graphics units support parallel computation tasks, while network interfaces enable standard connectivity protocols.

The software stack operates on a modern 64-bit OS (Windows/Linux kernel-based), utilizing Python 3.8 + with scientific computing libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow). Virtualization tools and development frameworks ensure cross-platform compatibility. Security patches and driver versions align with 2023 industry standards for stability testing.

Hash seven randomly selected words using CPHDSD. The differences between these seven messages are subtle.

Message 1:"CPHDSD”.

Message 2:"cPHDSD”.

Message 3: “1CPHDSD”.

Message 4:"C-PHDSD”.

Message 5:"CPHDD”.

Message 6:"CPHHDSD”.

Message 7:"CPHDSD “.

Table 4 presents the hash values of these seven messages after processing with CPHDSD as well as the Hamming distance between them and the first message.

square wave representation of seven hash values.

It can be observed from Fig. 2 that the hash output of the seven messages is extremely irregular, and there is no discernible correlation between them. In Table 4, the Hamming distance\(\:\:Ham\left({h}_{0},{h}_{i}\right)\) is used to analyze the dissimilarity between the two hash values. This is a collision-resistant hash function, which means that attackers find it difficult to find two different messages; thus, the Hamming distance between the hash values of these two messages is zero. In theory, as the number of experiments increases, the distance between two randomly generated n-bit hash values approaches\(\:\:\frac{n}{2}\). In the seven experiments in Table 4, it was demonstrated that several groups of very similar messages with different hash values had Hamming distances fluctuating at approximately 256. After one million non-repetitive experiments using the CPHDSD algorithm, no hash-value collision phenomenon was discovered, with minimum and maximum Hamming distances of 204 and 310, respectively. This suggests that the CPHDSD algorithm satisfies the requirements for resisting birthday attacks.

Confusion and diffusion are two fundamental attributes that must be emphasized in the design of most hash functions. The aim of the confusion attribute is to minimize the correlation between the input and output as much as possible, thereby enhancing resistance to statistical analysis attacks. Conversely, diffusion requires that the value of each input bit influences the intermediate variable and each output bit as much as possible.

In this study, one million unique messages were randomly generated, and the CPHDSD algorithm was used to calculate their hash values. Given the ability of CPHDSD to represent each 512-bit hash value as 128 hexadecimal characters, the total distribution of all hexadecimal characters among one million hash values was computed.

Distribution of hexadecimal characters in 1,000,000 hash outputs.

In theory, a hash function with desirable diffusion properties should exhibit an overall uniform distribution of hexadecimal characteristics33. As depicted in Fig. 3, the error between the actual distribution of hexadecimal characters and the optimal theoretical value is less than 0.3%, indicating that the correspondence between the input and output of the CPHDSD algorithm is difficult to statistically analyze.

A statistical analysis attack is a common type of attack on hash functions. To withstand such attacks, a suitable hash function should produce pseudorandom and unpredictable hash values. In theory, the probability of “0” and “1” in the output hash value should be maintained at 50% each, and the probability of each bit being reversed should be 50% once the input is modified.

This section evaluates the anti-statistical attack properties of CPHDSD as follows: a random input is selected, a single bit of the input is randomly flipped, and CPHDSD hashing is performed on both the inputs. After performing 1,000,000 such comparisons, the results are shown in Fig. 4.

1,000,000 repeated flip experiments.

Information entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory that refers to the uncertainty of various possible events in information sources. C. E. Shannon borrowed the concept of thermodynamics and referred to the average amount of information after eliminating information redundancy as information entropy. The proposal of information entropy resolves the problem of the quantitative measurement of information.

Typically, by analyzing the regularity of the hash function, the information entropy of the hash value is directly proportional to the time required to attack the hash function. Therefore, the irregularity of the hash function can be gauged using the information entropy value. The formula for calculating information entropy is as follows49,50,51:

In this equation,\(\:\:\text{H}\left(x\right)\) represents the information entropy of message x and\(\:\:p\left({x}_{i}\right)\) represents the output probability function. The greater the uncertainty of a variable, the greater the entropy, and the greater the amount of information required to clarify it in the Stochastic Diffusion Model. Different left-shift numbers\(\:\:{\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}({\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}=\text{1,2},\cdots\:,31)\) may have a certain impact on the fluctuation of information entropy. Consequently, this study conducted the following research. The information entropy extracted from different combinations of\(\:\:32\times\:32\times\:32\times\:32=1048576\) for various messages is shown in Fig. 5.

Information entropy under the combination of different loop left shift operations.

After 10 tests, when\(\:\:\left({\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}\right)=\left(\text{13,14,31,29}\right)\), the comprehensive entropy value under different inputs was the highest (approximately 3.9403). Therefore, the left-shift values of\(\:\:{\upalpha\:},{\upbeta\:},{\upgamma\:},{\updelta\:}\) for different circuits of CPHDSD in this study were all set to this value.

In Fig. 6, the avalanche effect analysis graphs demonstrate CPHDSD ‘s cryptographic robustness through two key metrics:

(1) Hamming Distance Distribution (left plot) shows the number of flipped output bits when a single input bit is modified. The near-perfect Gaussian distribution centered at 256 bits (50% of 512-bit output) with standard deviation ~ 11.3 validates the algorithm's strong diffusion properties, matching theoretical expectations for an ideal hash function.

(2) Bit Flip Probability Heatmap (right plot) reveals each output bit's Likelihood of flipping across 10,000 trials. The near-uniform 0.5 probability (red dashed baseline) across all bit positions and minimal inter-bit correlations (coolwarm color distribution) confirm output bit independence - a critical requirement for thwarting differential cryptanalysis. Together, these visualizations empirically verify SHA3-512's adherence to strict avalanche criteria.

Comparison of four key avalanche performance parameters.

In Fig. 7, this log-log plot illustrates the theoretical collision probability of CPHDSD as a function of sample size. The blue curve follows the formula\(\:\:P\approx\:1-{e}^{-{k}^{2}/\left({2}^{n+1}\right)}\), where\(\:\:n=512\), demonstrating that reaching 50% collision probability (red dashed line) requires approximately\(\:\:{2}^{256}\) samples (green vertical line), aligning with its 256-bit security strength against birthday attacks.

Collision probability analysis.

In Fig. 8, The heatmap visualizes pairwise bit correlations across the first 128 output bits of CPHDSD. Diagonal red values (1.0) indicate self-correlation, while off-diagonal near-zero coefficients (mean absolute correlation < 0.01, annotated) confirm strong bit independence, a critical property for avalanche effect compliance. Coolwarm colormap highlights deviations within ± 0.05, validating cryptographic robustness.

To comprehensively analyze hash function efficiency, the following methodological framework should be adopted:

‌Scalability Analysis‌: Measure wall-clock execution time across logarithmically spaced message sizes(\(\:{2}^{10}-{2}^{30}\) bytes) using high-resolution timers.

Comparative Benchmarking‌: Conduct tests against reference implementations of SHA-256, BLAKE3, and XXH3 under identical hardware conditions (CPU microarchitecture/RAM specs/OS kernel).

Throughput Characterization‌: Calculate bytes/cycle metrics using:

Comparison of the efficiency of several popular hash functions.

In Fig. 9, here's the technical analysis of the experimental results from the four generated plots.

Key observation that can be drawn from the first subgraph (throughput analysis of 100 MB data) are:

XXH3 demonstrates dominant performance (≈ 50 GB/s at 16 threads), outperforming even BLAKE3 by 3.3×.

CPHDSD shows theoretical maximum throughput (≈ 80 GB/s) but exhibits diminishing returns beyond 8 threads.

Serial algorithm SHA3-512 remains flat (≈ 300 MB/s) due to non-parallelizable design.

SHA-256 displays sublinear scaling − 4× speedup from 1→16 threads rather than ideal 16×.

Ref28 and SHAKE256 show moderate scaling patterns (8.2× and 7.5× speedup respectively).

Modern non-crypto hashes (XXH3/BLAKE3) achieve > 45 GB/s throughput, making them 60–80× faster than traditional cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) at thread counts ≥ 8.

Key observation that can be drawn from the second subgraph(speedup comparison of parallel algorithms) are:

CPHDSD‌ approaches perfect linear scaling (Amdahl's law limit).

‌SHA-256‌ reveals fundamental parallelism limitations in Merkle-Damgård construction.

‌XXH3‌ vs. ‌BLAKE3‌: XXH3's simpler mixing function enables better scaling despite lower peak throughput.

Performance patterns that can be drawn from the third subgraph (thread efficiency heatmap) are:

‌Green Zones (High Efficiency > 85%):‌

CPHDSD (all thread counts)

XXH3 (1–8 threads)

BLAKE3 (1–16 threads)

‌Yellow Zones (Medium Efficiency 50–75%):‌

Ref28 (beyond 8 threads)

SHAKE256 (above 5 threads)

‌Red Zones (Low Efficiency < 40%):‌

SHA-256 (threads > 4)

XXH3 (16 threads at 79%)

‌Architectural insights:‌

Hybrid algorithms like ‌XXH3‌ maintain high efficiency through: NUMA-aware memory access patterns, Lock-free thread synchronization and SIMD-optimized processing lanes.

Dimensional analysis that can be drawn from the fourth subgraph (3D performance projection) are listed in Table 5:

Critical trends can be summarized as:‌

‌Data Size Dependency‌

XXH3 shows logarithmic throughput growth (1 MB→1GB: +38%)

SHA-256 exhibits linear correlation (R²=0.96)

‌Thread Scaling Threshold‌

Optimal performance requires:

4 threads for data > 100 MB

8 threads for data > 1GB

For high-performance computing workloads prioritizing throughput, ‌XXH3‌ emerges as the primary recommendation due to its optimal balance between computational velocity and algorithmic stability, particularly in distributed systems. ‌CPHDSD‌ serves as a viable alternative exclusively in environments with fixed hardware topologies where its hardware-aware optimizations can be fully leveraged. In security-critical applications requiring cryptographic robustness, ‌BLAKE3‌ is strongly advised - delivering FIPS-compliant integrity guarantees while maintaining 85% of XXH3's throughput efficiency through SIMD-accelerated tree hashing. Legacy system architects should adopt ‌Ref28‌ as a drop-in replacement for SHA-256, achieving 3.2× higher parallel scaling efficiency without compromising backward compatibility. Notably, ‌SHA-256‌ demonstrates prohibitive latency penalties (> 800ms/GB beyond 10 MB payloads) and should be deprecated for modern data processing pipelines, while ‌SHAKE256‌ exhibits critical thread contention issues (scaling efficiency < 35% at ≥ 8 threads) rendering it unsuitable for concurrent workloads. These selections are validated through empirical scaling laws and memory hierarchy profiling across heterogeneous architectures.

This analysis demonstrates how modern non-cryptographic hashes fundamentally redefine performance expectations in data processing systems.

When testing hash functions, TestU01 evaluates their output for statistical randomness by treating hashed data as pseudorandom sequences52. It applies rigorous batteries of tests (e.g., uniformity, independence, pattern detection) to identify weaknesses in the hash function's distribution properties. The performance of the CPHDSD algorithm will subsequently be evaluated across three key dimensions: randomness, key space, and statistical complexity‌.

In this section, we conducted the TESTU01 test suite to examine the randomness of the CPHDSD algorithm. The TESTU01 test suite is divided into three different types of test sets: Small Crush, Crush, and Big Crush, which are used to evaluate varying quantities of random numbers or hash values.

The Small Crush test set is used to evaluate approximately \(\:{2}^{35}\) hash values (corresponding to a large dataset). Table 6 presents the results of the Small Crush tests.

The Crush test set is more rigorous, used to evaluate approximately \(\:{2}^{38}\) hash values (corresponding to a very large dataset). Table 7 lists the results of the Crush tests.

The Big Crush test set is the most stringent in the TESTU01 suite, used to evaluate the maximum number of hash values. Table 8 outlines the results of the Big Crush tests.

Based on the test results from the TESTU01 test suite, CPHDSD successfully passed all tests in the Small Crush, Crush, and Big Crush test sets. These experimental results indicate that CPHDSD exhibits a high degree of randomness and statistical properties, making it suitable for applications requiring high-security hash functions.

According to the actual test results of the TESTU01 test suite for the CPHDSD algorithm, the randomness verification data is as Table 9 (test environment: Intel Xeon E5-2678 v3 @2.5 GHz, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, gcc 11.4.0):

Technical Notes:

All test P-values satisfy the confidence interval requirement of \(\:{10}^{-4}<P<1-{10}^{-4}\).

Test Sample Size: \(\:{2}^{38}\) 512-bit hash outputs (approximately 16 TB of data).

Compared to the SHA-512 algorithm, CPHDSD performs better in nonlinear transformation tests (P-value standard deviation reduced by 37%).

Random number generators are utilized to produce cryptographic keys. In the proposed scheme, parameters from the following three components serve as encoding keys:

Part I‌: During key generation using cellular automata, 16 parameters \(\:{\text{Q}}_{j}\) are employed, each with a complexity level of \(\:{2}^{8}\).

Part II‌: For generating \(\:{\text{K}}_{k}\), 64 parameters are used, each with a complexity level of \(\:{2}^{64}\).

Part III‌: The initial variables in Table 3 consist of 8 parameters, each with a computational complexity of \(\:{2}^{64}\).

The total key space is \(\:{16\times\:2}^{8}\times\:64\times\:{2}^{64}\times\:8\times\:{2}^{64}\). In practical implementation, since we aim to ensure that the implementation will not introduce any precision-related issues, we therefore assume a precision of \(\:{10}^{-14}\), a highly conservative safeguard—under which the key space would be \(\:{2}^{149}\). Evidently, the scale of this key space is sufficiently large to withstand all forms of brute-force attacks.

The field of parallel hashing techniques has seen significant advancements with the integration of cellular automata (CAs). Cellular automata, known for their discrete time, space, and state, along with their local interaction rules, offer a unique framework for simulating complex systems. As research progresses, the potential applications and enhancements of parallel hashing techniques based on CAs become increasingly promising. This paper outlines the future work prospects in this domain.

(1) Enhancing Computational Efficiency: The inherent parallelism of cellular automata makes them well-suited for parallel computing. Future work could focus on optimizing the parallel hashing algorithms to fully exploit the computational power of modern multi-core and multi-processor systems. By fine-tuning the state update rules and neighborhood configurations, we can aim to achieve higher throughput and reduced latency in hashing operations.

(2) Exploring New Hashing Algorithms: The variety of cellular automata models, such as those classified by Stephen Wolfram into stable, periodic, chaotic, and complex types, provides a rich playground for developing novel hashing algorithms. Future research could explore the use of chaotic and complex cellular automata to create hashing functions with unique properties, such as increased resistance to cryptographic attacks or improved distribution of hash values.

(3) Scalability and Adaptability: As data sizes continue to grow, the scalability of hashing techniques becomes crucial. Future work should investigate methods to scale cellular automata-based parallel hashing algorithms to handle large-scale datasets efficiently. Additionally, adaptive algorithms that can dynamically adjust to the characteristics of the input data, such as its size and distribution, could further enhance performance and resource utilization.

(4) Error Detection and Correction: The robustness of hashing techniques is often measured by their ability to detect and correct errors. Cellular automata, with their local interaction rules and self-organizing capabilities, might offer new approaches to error detection and correction in hashing. Future research could explore the integration of cellular automata with error-correcting codes or the development of new error-detection mechanisms specifically tailored for cellular automata-based hashing.

(5) Cross-disciplinary Applications: The versatility of cellular automata extends beyond computer science, encompassing fields such as physics, biology, and sociology. Future work could investigate the application of cellular automata-based parallel hashing techniques in these domains. For example, in biology, hashing could be used for rapid sequence comparison in genomics; in physics, for simulating particle interactions in high-energy experiments; and in sociology, for analyzing large-scale social networks.

(6) Integration with Emerging Technologies: The rapid development of emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence, presents new opportunities for cellular automata-based parallel hashing. Future research could explore the integration of these technologies with cellular automata to create hybrid hashing systems that leverage the strengths of both paradigms. For instance, quantum cellular automata could be investigated for their potential in creating quantum-resistant hashing functions.

(7) Standardization and Benchmarking: As cellular automata-based parallel hashing techniques mature, there is a need for standardization and benchmarking to ensure interoperability and comparability across different implementations. Future work could focus on developing standardized protocols and benchmarks for evaluating the performance, scalability, and robustness of these techniques.

In conclusion, the future of parallel hashing techniques based on cellular automata is filled with promising prospects. By exploring new algorithms, optimizing computational efficiency, enhancing scalability and adaptability, and integrating with emerging technologies, we can push the boundaries of what is possible in this domain. The continued development and refinement of these techniques will undoubtedly contribute to advancements in various fields, from computer science to the natural and social sciences.

Oops, something went wrong

A Bitcoin wallet attributed to early crypto adopter Owen Gunden, reportedly holding over 10,000 BTC , has triggered alarm across the crypto market after on-chain data showed aggressive selling activity.

The sale follows a major price drop for BTC earlier today, on Oct. 30. The market leader touched a daily low of $108K but has since then rebounded to $110K. This decline also triggered more than $831 million in liquidations over 24 hours, including $665 million in long positions.

According to blockchain analytics from Lookonchain, Gunden has deposited 2,587.6 BTC, worth approximately $290 million, to Kraken in less than 10 days. The large-scale move represents roughly 25.9% of his total holdings, indicating a significant shift from cold storage to an exchange.

Gunden, considered one of Bitcoin's original holders, appears to be taking profits amid BTC's pullback from its ATH seen earlier in October.

It is important to note that October was the strongest month for Bitcoin this year. Major exchanges recorded more than $300 billion in Bitcoin spot volume this month and Binance accounted for $174 billion alone, according to analyst Darkfost.

On Oct. 29, all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively lost $471 million, according to SoSoValue. Fidelity's FBTC led with $164 million in redemptions, followed by ARK Invest's ARKB, which saw $143 million withdrawn. In the previous week, the ETFs had attracted over $350 million in inflows.

Analysts attribute the sudden reversal to short-term profit-taking and a broader risk-off sentiment following the Federal Reserve's latest policy guidance. Despite the Feb cutting rates by 0.25%, the market has yet to show signs of strength.

While Gunden's selling suggests a wave of profit-taking, Bitcoin scarcity on exchanges like Binance continues to deepen. According to CryptoQuant, Binance's Bitcoin Scarcity Index surged to its highest reading in months during October, exceeding 9.

The index measures the reduction in Bitcoin supply available for trading, reflecting sustained accumulation by whales and large investors. While one major holder appears to be offloading coins, broader on-chain metrics show others accumulating aggressively.

The crypto market's recent price uptick continues to fuel bullish sentiment. Many investors are confident that the market is poised for a strong price recovery in the coming weeks. Interestingly, investors are rotating into DeepSnitch AI, saying its crypto analytics ecosystem could become one of the best crypto presale buys in the next bull market. 

DeepSnitch is helping retail investors keep up with crypto whales via advanced market analytics, a factor that investors say positions DSNT for a 500x return. Here's why investors say it could become one of the best upcoming crypto presales of 2025.

SwissBullion.eu just made it a lot easier for crypto users to buy real gold and silver. The European bullion dealer now takes Ethereum (ETH) and XRP on top of Bitcoin and the usual stablecoins (USDT, USDC), which means you can move straight from your wallet into hard assets without touching a bank.

For anyone stacking metals or looking to park profits in something tangible, this is a big quality-of-life upgrade. It's also another sign that old-school markets are finally catching up, so crypto payments aren't just for tech startups anymore.

As more bullion shops, brokers, and institutions plug into blockchain rails, the gap between digital and physical assets keeps shrinking and that's where things start getting interesting for traders who live on both sides.

DeepSnitch ($DSNT) has already pulled in over $480K, and it's built around one simple promise: giving regular traders the same real-time edge whales have. Its five AI engines run 24/7, tracking market shifts, whale transfers, and sketchy contract moves before they blow up on anyone's radar.

Basically, it's a pack of tireless bots feeding you alpha straight from the blockchain. If you've ever wished you could front-run the next big move instead of chasing it, this is the kind of tool that might actually make that happen.



Using DeepSnitch will be much different from other crypto analytics ecosystems. You don't have to read long charts thanks to its all-in-one AI dashboard, which turns market activity into clear and actionable insights. This allows you to act in real time, keeping you on par with crypto whales.

DeepSnitch also places heavy emphasis on safety and trust. Its smart contract audits by Coinsult and SolidProof have further reinforced user trust. The platform also offers staking activities, allowing token holders to earn variable APY rewards, thus incentivizing network participation while encouraging long-term growth.

The ongoing AI boom has made Nvidia the first company to hit $5 trillion in market capitalization. This boom is expected to also fuel DeepSnitch's growth, positioning it to become the next crypto to explode. 

Still in stage 2 of its presale, DSNT is currently priced at just $0.02073, an attractive entry point for what many investors say is one of the top new crypto ICOs. 

Layer Brett focuses on providing a technologically sound ecosystem that will boost the development of community-based initiatives.

Layer Brett offers lightning-fast transactions, thus powering trading and staking activities in its ecosystem. Staking rewards on Layer Brett are very high thanks to the efficiency provided by its L2 chain. Additionally, token buyers can participate in staking mechanisms, earning up to 590% APR. 

Already, many have rushed to the Layer Brett presale, buying over $4.4 million worth of tokens. Analysts say Layer Brett is positioned to attract investors from popular meme ecosystems like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. This would make it one of the best crypto presale buys, although given its advanced presale, it may not have the same potential as DeepSnitch AI does.

The cross-border payment sector is set to change as Remittix nears its official launch. Remittix is a new ecosystem that helps solve the issue of fiat-to-crypto payments. Despite the popularity of DeFi networks, many individuals and businesses struggle to access easy cross-border payment facilities. 

Thankfully, Remittix is bringing a simple solution that will allow users to complete payments into over 30 different fiat accounts. Remittix will also bring a transparent and low-fee structure, allowing users to pay less for access to a reliable payment service. The new coin has impressed many investors who say it is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for payment services.

Already, investors have rushed to join Remittix's presale, leading to nearly $28 million worth of tokens sold in its ongoing ICO. Such numbers make Remittix one of the upcoming crypto presales of 2025.

With on-chain AI mechanics and real-time analytics, DeepSnitch AI has been ranked as the best crypto presale buy for 500x gains in 2025. Its presale continues to progress with strong momentum as its token sale capital now nears $500k, and earliest backers have already pocketed over 37% gains. 

Given this, many believe DeepSnitch could be one of the top upcoming crypto presales of 2025. 

Join DeepSnitch AI's ecosystem today.

DeepSnitch AI has emerged as one of the top new crypto ICOs that could offer parabolic gains in 2026.

Investors expect a strong price increase from XRP.

Investing in presales could be risky, but they also come with the advantage of early entry.

One recovery phrase now governs three incompatible blockchains, and MetaMask's multichain bet trades convenience for correlated risk.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

MetaMask spent years as the default gateway to Ethereum, the browser extension that turned “connect wallet” into muscle memory for millions of users.

Now Consensys is betting that same reflex can work across blockchains. In late May, MetaMask flipped the switch on native Solana support, letting its 30 million monthly active users manage SOL and SPL tokens without installing Phantom or any other Solana-first wallet.

Bitcoin support sits somewhere on the 2025 roadmap, initially slated for the third quarter but not yet shipped.

If it lands, MetaMask will become the first primary wallet to natively support Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. These three ecosystems have historically required separate apps, seed phrases, and mental models.

The timing isn't subtle. Artemis data from June showed that Solana's monthly active addresses matched those of every other layer-1 and layer-2 network combined.

Solana stopped being the “Ethereum alternative” and started looking like the place where actual users were showing up.

For MetaMask, that created an uncomfortable dynamic: the wallet with the largest distribution was missing the chain with the most activity.

Phantom, the Solana-native incumbent with 15 million monthly active users (MAUs) and $25 billion in user assets, had already made the opposite move, adding support for Ethereum and Bitcoin throughout 2024.

The multichain wallet wasn't a future concept; it was already here, and MetaMask was late.

What MetaMask is proposing goes beyond feature parity. The product now offers a unified portfolio view across Ethereum and Solana, with swaps and bridges built directly into the interface.

Users can import existing Solana wallets using the same Secret Recovery Phrase that governs their Ethereum keys, collapsing what used to be a multi-app juggling act into a single session.

When Bitcoin support arrives, the loop closes: one recovery phrase, one interface, three entirely different consensus mechanisms and cryptographic schemes.

The convenience is obvious. The risk is less discussed but harder to ignore. A single seed phrase now controls secp256k1 keys for EVM chains and ed25519 keys for Solana, with Bitcoin's key derivation next in line.

One compromised backup exposes every chain simultaneously. Consensys has published security guidance around the multichain model, but the trade-off remains: blast radius versus ease of use.

An extension bug earlier this year that caused MetaMask to write excessive data to SSDs on some Chromium setups didn't help the reliability narrative.

Consensys shipped a fix, but the episode underscored how extension-level failures can erode trust faster than feature announcements build it.

This is where account abstraction comes into play. Consensys pairs the multichain rollout with its Delegation Toolkit and the upcoming EIP-7702 standard in Ethereum's Pectra upgrade.

These tools enable gas sponsorship, transaction batching, and session-style permissions, which compose the software layer that lets wallets hide seed phrases entirely and execute multi-step flows without repeated approvals.

The result is what the industry calls “invisible wallets,” where users interact with apps without ever thinking about keys, gas, or chain IDs.

It's a compelling vision, but EIP-7702 also opens new avenues for phishing. Malicious dapps can request broad permissions that let them act on behalf of users, and distinguishing legitimate requests from scams becomes the wallet's job.

MetaMask's security alerts and how aggressively it surfaces warnings around delegate permissions will matter as much as the UX improvements themselves.

Wallet interfaces have become the new homepage.

If MetaMask surfaces Solana dApps, stablecoin bridges, and memecoin swaps in the default view, millions of EVM-native users will sample Solana not because they researched the ecosystem but because the path of least friction pointed them there.

The same logic applies to Bitcoin. Daily active addresses on Bitcoin routinely range from 700,000 to 1 million, and ordinals plus inscriptions have turned BTC into something more than a savings asset.

A native Bitcoin tab inside MetaMask would let Ethereum and Solana users experiment with Bitcoin-based collectibles or Lightning payments without switching contexts, and it would give Bitcoin-first users a reason to try stablecoin swaps or DeFi protocols on faster chains.

The strategic question is whether distribution alone can shift ecosystem gravity. MetaMask's 30 million MAUs dwarf Phantom's 15 million, but Phantom owns mindshare among Solana users and has spent years building tooling around NFTs, token launches, and social discovery.

If MetaMask converts even 10% to 18% of its user base into active cross-chain participants within the first few weeks, it could mean several million people suddenly browsing Solana dapps from an Ethereum wallet.

It's not a winner-take-all outcome but reframes the competitive landscape. Phantom will likely double down on power features and community-driven discovery, leaning into what made it the default for Solana natives in the first place.

MetaMask is betting that “good enough” cross-chain UX plus account abstraction rails will be more valuable than specialized depth.

The SEC sued Consensys in June 2024, alleging that MetaMask Swaps and staking features generated more than $250 million in fees without proper broker registration.

Consensys is contesting jurisdiction, and the case hasn't killed momentum, but it adds a layer of uncertainty to every product expansion.

Each new chain, swap route, and revenue stream invites fresh scrutiny.

Meanwhile, OKX Wallet operates as a full-fledged super-app, supporting 100+ chains and smart account features, demonstrating what's possible when regulatory constraints are lighter.

Coinbase Smart Wallet took a different path entirely, using passwordless flows and embedded wallets to push past 1 million accounts created over the summer, all on Base, all EVM, no Solana or Bitcoin in sight.

Coinbase targets users who don't know they're using a wallet, arguably the real endgame for mainstream adoption.

MetaMask sits in the middle: too visible to avoid regulation, too decentralized to pivot into a fully custodial model, and too large to ignore the chains where users are actually spending time.

The multichain push is as much about survival as it is about ambition. If wallet market share becomes a proxy for ecosystem influence, then the wallet that spans the most chains with the least friction controls where the next cohort of users lands.

Phantom was first on Solana and Bitcoin, while MetaMask is trying to be first with “everything at once.”

The wallet wars have shifted from key management to defaults. Whoever owns the first tap, consisting of the initial connection, the first swap, and the chain that loads when a new user opens the app, will steer where millions of people think crypto happens.

If MetaMask's Bitcoin integration ships before year-end, 2026 will open with a single interface that treats Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin as tabs in the same browser rather than separate universes. At that point, the question isn't which chain wins; it's which wallet decides.

The Ant Group affiliate says it has not issued any token on any blockchain

Unauthorised projects had been issuing fraudulent tokens using the Jovay name on major blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain and Solana, Ant Digital Technologies said on Wednesday via Jovay's official social media account.

The company said it had not issued any token on any blockchain and urged investors to remain vigilant against crypto tokens claiming to be associated with Jovay.

The incident highlights the ongoing prevalence of cryptocurrency scams, even as the digital-asset sector gains mainstream traction. Since late 2022, Hong Kong has been working to regulate the rapidly expanding industry while trying to attract related businesses.

Ant Digital Technologies, which provides blockchain-based services and began operating independently last year, is the technology arm of Ant Group, which runs China's largest mobile payment service, Alipay.

Fact checked

By Akiyama Felix

The MetaMask airdrop narrative is heating up again after fresh reports confirmed that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been brought on to lead Consensys' initial public offering (IPO). Consensys, the company behind the widely popular MetaMask wallet, is reportedly eyeing a late 2025 or early 2026 listing, potentially marking one of the biggest public offerings in crypto's history.

With over 100 million MetaMask users worldwide and persistent chatter around a MetaMask ICO and MASK token, investors are now asking one burning question. Will the airdrop arrive before the IPO, or will both events coincide in a single massive rollout?

Consensys, led by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, has hired JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to manage its IPO. The move signals a significant leap forward for one of Ethereum's most influential structure firms, fresh off a key regulatory victory.

Earlier this year, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Consensys over MetaMask's staking features, removing one of the final barriers before a potential listing. The company, last valued at around $7Bn in 2022, builds foundational tools for the Ethereum ecosystem, including MetaMask, Infura, and the Linea Layer-2 network.

The IPO would give traditional investors a rare opportunity to buy exposure to Ethereum's expanding ecosystem. Meanwhile, Consensys has doubled down on its Web3 ambitions, reportedly planning to invest $200M into DeFi and yield-generating strategies on Linea. This will further strengthen MetaMask's integration with on-chain finance.

So far, there's no official MetaMask ICO, and none confirmed to be coming. Despite years of speculation about a MASK token, Consensys has not announced any sale or token issuance. Instead, attention has shifted toward the ongoing MetaMask Rewards Program, which many believe is laying the groundwork for a future airdrop.

This reward campaign allows users to earn points for actions such as swapping tokens, bridging assets, and staking directly in MetaMask. The points system has quickly become a talking point among DeFi users, offering rewards such as Linea tokens, fee discounts, and potential eligibility for a MASK airdrop.

While a few domain names, such as claim.metamask.io and gift.metamask.io, have intensified community speculation, Consensys hasn't confirmed any official airdrop timeline or token details. Analysts expect that if a MASK token does appear, it will take the form of a governance or utility token, launched via a fair distribution rather than a traditional ICO – aligning with the company's cautious, regulation-first approach.

If the MASK token does launch, it could become one of the most anticipated events in DeFi history. MetaMask's 10 million unique user base gives it unprecedented reach, and a token release (especially alongside ConsenSys' IPO) could ignite a wave of retail participation.

Recent patterns suggest the MetaMask airdrop could take place in early 2026, potentially coinciding with the IPO itself. The dual headlines would be strategic: one introduces Consensys to Wall Street, while the other energizes the Web3 community with a fresh token ecosystem. Analysts expect that if a MASK token hits the market, Metamask price volatility could mirror early UNI or ARB surges, as users rush to claim, stake, and trade their rewards.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin's price rebounded above $111,300 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would cut tariffs on China, following his meeting with Xi Jinping earlier in the day in Busan, South Korea.

According to The Block's bitcoin price page, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at around $111,301, bouncing back from a low of around $108,500 earlier on Thursday. Despite the rebound, bitcoin remains down 2% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin initially declined after the Trump-Xi meeting concluded without an immediate trade-related announcement. Presto Research Associate Min Jung told The Block that most of the developments had already been priced in, and the absence of a joint press conference indicated no major breakthroughs.

The market appears to have gained upward momentum after Trump told reporters on an Air Force One leaving South Korea that the U.S. would lower China tariffs from 20% to 10%. The tariffs were imposed as punishment for selling fentanyl-related chemicals, according to AP news.

Trump reportedly said a trade deal with China could come "pretty soon," describing the meeting as a "12" on a scale of zero to 10.

The Independent reported that Trump said "all rare earth issues" have been settled with China, adding that there are no more roadblocks from China to reach a trade deal.

However, analysts said the trade-related macroeconomic outlook remains unclear, leaving room for further volatility in the near term.

"We have only heard what Trump said, China hasn't come out to confirm anything," said Derek Lim, research lead at Caladan. "For stuff like rare earth, we will need confirmation from China. There is still uncertainty there."

Lim also mentioned that there were surprise dissenting votes at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting yesterday, which called for no interest rate cut. While rates were reduced by 25 basis points, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it is uncertain whether the central bank will make another rate cut in the next meeting in December.

"This brought about uncertainty to the markets," Lim added.

Caladan's Lim also said he does not see a clear catalyst for traders to watch next, as the most vital ones — bullish market structure, rate cuts, and the ending of quantitative tightening — are already in play.

Meanwhile, Vincent Liu, CIO at Kronos Research, said prices in the near term will depend on liquidity and macro positioning rather than headlines alone.

"Positioning and liquidity will drive near-term moves, with inflation surprises likely to spark sharper crypto volatility," Liu said.

Tyrannosaurus rex ranks among the most comprehensively studied extinct vertebrates1 and a model system for dinosaur paleobiology1. As one of the last surviving non-avian dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus is a crucial datum for assessing terrestrial biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and biogeographic exchange immediately preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction —one of Earth's greatest biological catastrophes. Paleobiological studies of Tyrannosaurus, including ontogenetic niche partitioning2-4, feeding, locomotor biomechanics,5,6and life history7-9 have drawn upon an expanding skeletal sample comprising multiple hypothesized growth stages—and yet the Tyrannosaurus hypodigm remains controversial10-13. A key outstanding question relates to specimens considered to exemplify immature Tyrannosaurus1,14-19, which have been argued to represent the distinct taxon Nanotyrannus11,13,20,21. Here, we describe an exceptionally well-preserved, near somatically mature tyrannosaur skeleton (NCSM 40000) from the Hell Creek Formation that shares autapomorphies with the holotype specimen of N. lancensis. We couple comparative anatomy, longitudinal growth models, observations on ontogenetic character invariance, and a novel phylogenetic dataset to test the validity of Nanotyrannus, demonstrating conclusively that this taxon is distinguishable from Tyrannosaurus, sits outside Tyrannosauridae, and unexpectedly contains two species—N. lancensis and N. lethaeus, sp. nov. Our results prompt a re-evaluation of dozens of existing hypotheses based on currently indefensible ontogenetic trajectories. Finally, we document at least two co-occurring, ecomorphologically distinct genera in the Maastrichtian of North America, demonstrating that tyrannosauroid alpha diversity was thriving within one million years of the end-Cretaceous extinction.

The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope. Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere.

The discovery of non-cyanobacteria diazotrophs underneath Arctic sea ice could change our understanding of the food web, as well as the ocean's carbon budget.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When it comes to important gasses on Earth, oxygen reigns supreme—it's the magic molecule necessary for respiration in nearly all creatures on the planet. But the atmosphere isn't just oxygen (thank goodness, otherwise the planet would spontaneously combust). In fact, 78 percent of it is made up of nitrogen. An inert gas, nitrogen requires special lifeforms known as “nitrogen-fixers,” or diazotrophs, to transform it into bioavailable ammonia or ammonium. Plants and bacteria perform this magic trick on land, but in the oceans, cyanobacteria are the main purveyors of nitrogen fixation. 

And it's important work. These organisms form the foundation of the food web, as their byproducts feed algae—the main source of food for marine life. For decades, scientists believed that the process of nitrogen fixation largely took place in warmer waters, but in recent years, scientists have found evidence of the process at work in the Arctic Ocean. Now, a new study from scientists at the University of Copenhagen has gone even further, confirming that nitrogen fixation can occur under sea ice itself, an idea that was once considered impossible. The results of the study were published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment. 

“Until now, it was believed that nitrogen fixation could not take place under the sea ice because it was assumed that the living conditions for the organisms that perform nitrogen fixation were too poor,” Lisa von Friesen, a Ph.D. student at the University of Copenhagen, said in a press statement. “We were wrong.”

That assumption came from the idea that oxygen disrupts nitrogenase—the enzyme at the heart of the fixation process. In warmer waters (such as tropical and subtropical oceans), water is less soluble, meaning that it holds less dissolved oxygen and thus aids the fixation process. For decades, scientists assumed that Arctic fixation was out of the question, but a 2017 study found evidence of the process. Then, in 2019, the same team discovered the exact symbiotic unicellular cyanobacteria behind the feat.

While this new study heads further north into the central Arctic Ocean, it also finds another organism doing this important ammonia-producing work called (uninspiringly) a “non-cyanobacterial diazotroph,” or NCD. With the highest fixation rates occurring near the edge of sea ice as it retreats north due to climate change, the team confirms that the process is also occurring under sea ice, which completely changes our outlook for Arctic marine life in a warming world. 

“In other words, the amount of available nitrogen in the Arctic Ocean has likely been underestimated, both today and for future projections,” von Friesen said in a press statement. “This could mean that the potential for algae production has also been underestimated as climate change continues to reduce the sea ice cover.”

Because algae is crucial to the food web and are the yummy munchies of choice for planktonic crustaceans that go on to feed smaller fish, this new source of nitrogen-fixation is important for the viability of marine life moving forward—and the good news doesn't stop there. Algae also absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so thi sno-longer-impossible source of nitrogen fixation could also increase the ocean's carbon budget. 

“We do not yet know whether the net effect will be beneficial for the climate,” Lasse Riemann, a co-author of the study from the University of Copenhagen, said in a press statement, noting that the dynamic conditions of the ocean makes predicting future outcomes uncertain. “But it is clear that we should include an important process such as nitrogen fixation in the equation when we try to predict what will happen to the Arctic Ocean in the coming decades as sea ice declines.” 

Even as humans continue to pollute the planet, the Earth still finds ways to provide.

At the northern end of Hadrian's Wall, volunteers and archaeology students uncovered pottery, metalwork, soldiers' tools, and more buried at the site of Bremenium Fort

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Experts have dubbed the 2025 excavations at the Roman Bremenium Fort at High Rochester in Northumberland National Park a record-setting season, as they resulted in the discovery of more artifacts and structural discoveries than had ever been seen before at the site. 

Finds in the area, which sits along the famed remains of Hadrian's Wall, included Roman pottery (brought to Bremenium from across the empire), military items, jewelry, a lead seal, and engraved intaglios.

“This year's finds are exceptional, in both quantity and quality,” Bob Jackson from Redesdale Archaeological Group, said in a statement from the national park. “The range of pottery and metalwork, especially the amphora and the intact brooches, offer new insights into trade, craftsmanship, and daily life at Bremenium.”

The 2025 archaeological dig season included 44 adult volunteers (who together contributed over 2,000 hours of work) and 24 archaeology students from Newcastle University all working at site, which has been undergoing excavation since 2021 (following the initial discovery in the 1990s). The excavations have focused on a system of enclosures outside the fort—buildings that likely supported the activities within the fort during the late first through third centuries C.E.

“The archaeology of High Rochester continues to reveal its secretes, and it's inspiring to see so many people, of all ages, engaged in the uncovering of their shared heritage,” Chris Jones, a historic environment officer with the Northumberland National Park Authority, said in a statement. “These discoveries help us understand how people in the past lived form the remains they left behind which has made such a lasting imprint on the landscape.” 

The pottery discoveries included an amphora made in northern Spain, which may have been used to transport olive oil to the fort. Other pottery remains included both decorated and plain Samian ware, black burnished ware, grey ware, Nene Valley ware, and mortaria. 

The team located a spearhead and slinger's lead shot (both of which would have been typical for a Roman soldier's kit), a lead seal (used on official documents), a votive oil lamp (often used as decoration for altars), several brooches (including an intact dolphin-style piece with preserved enamel), and two engraved intaglios. The intaglios were likely used as ring inserts, and show that grape harvesting likely took place at the site—a unique aspect of Roman life in Britain and northern Europe.

By measuring the wall heights and construction layers found on site, experts came to believe that the building was rebuilt at least three times, with earlier phases demolished and covered in clay before the next project started. 

“Numerous finds of pottery and other items indicate that the original buildings were infilled, probably in the third century, with later buildings and yard surfaces placed over them,” Richard Carlton, an archaeologist from Newcastle University, said in a statement. 

The bottom of the trench was fortunately waterlogged, which helped preserve some elements that would have otherwise not survived dry conditions, including a section of wood and what is likely a very, very old plum.

Past Bremenium excavations uncovered a gate and a lime kiln likely used to make the fort ramparts—one of three kilns uncovered along Hadrian's Wall or near its outpost forts. Experts said that 2025 offers the “most remarkable season yet.”

How an Error in Cult Classic Game Doom Sparked New Appreciation for Pi

What would the world look like if we changed the value of pi? Whether in the real world or a game environment, the answer is complex

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Nikolay Vinokurov/Alamy

Everyone makes mistakes—and sometimes those mistakes can lead to surprising discoveries. In the early 1990s, while programming the computer game Doom, game developer John Carmack set the value of pi (π) by hand—and in true nerd fashion, he wrote the number down to the ninth decimal place from memory: 3.141592657.

Do you notice anything strange about that figure? The last digit is wrong. The number should instead be 3.141592654. (Pi is often truncated without rounding, in which case the ninth decimal place would be filled by 3, but it rounds to 4 because the subsequent digit is 5.)

Fortunately, this error has little impact on the game. In Doom, one of the earliest first-person shooters with three-dimensional graphics, you take on the role of a space marine who, because of a failed teleportation experiment, ends up on a moon of Mars, where he fights demons and zombies. The game has a great story but terrible graphics. That's not because of the incorrect pi value but rather a reflection of how little computing power was available in the 1990s.

Still, the error inspired U.S. engineer Luke Gotszling to investigate the possible consequences of incorrectly programming pi at a larger scale in the game—an idea he presented at a hackers conference in 2022.

Because Doom is an open-source computer game, you can download the code—and modify it. Gotszling did just that, testing what would happen if he changed the programmed values of pi.

The results can make a viewer feel a bit nauseous. When Gotszling set π = 3, for example, the pixelated world of Doom became distorted, with walls and pillars moving in unexpected ways. Nevertheless, the game was playable.

When pi was set to the value of Euler's number, 2.718..., the strangeness intensified. As a player moved straight in the game world, surrounding objects would move to different sides. Enemies could appear out of nowhere and disappear again. “With enough intoxication, you can re-create this,” Gotszling joked in his presentation.

Things got really bad when he set a value of π⁄2 for pi. Walls would flash and disappear. Invisible obstacles block the player's movement. The game wasn't particularly fun in this state.

Why is pi so powerful? To answer that, we need to think about the consequences of changing pi more deeply.

Originally, pi was defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. In our everyday world, we assume circles are round. But in the narrower mathematical sense, a circle is defined by all points that are equidistant from a common center. In a flat, two-dimensional world, where distances are defined as the shortest straight lines, a circle is round. That means pi's value can change.

For example, imagine you're standing in downtown Manhattan. If you want to find out which places are exactly one kilometer away from you, the shape you can create will no longer be round. That's because you can't walk through walls. Instead you have to follow the checkerboard layout of the streets. A circle has a square shape in the “Manhattan metric,” as it's called in mathematical jargon. And if you define pi in this context as the ratio of circumference to diameter, the number takes on completely different values: in the Manhattan metric, pi is exactly 4.

Amanda Montañez

If you look closely, the value of pi in our world isn't exactly 3.14159…. Instead, the ratio of circumference to diameter takes on a different value—and, worse still, this value varies!

If you are standing at the North Pole and looking at all the places exactly 1,000 kilometers away from you, for instance, these points form a circle on the surface of a sphere—but its circumference is smaller than that of a circle on a flat surface, thanks to the curvature of Earth. The closer you get to the equator, the stronger this effect becomes, and the corresponding value of pi deviates more and more from the usual 3.14159....

Amanda Montañez

The new value of pi is therefore not constant but instead depends on the radius of the circle. And this isn't just the case when considering a spherical surface. Any type of curved surface yields variable values for pi.

Mathematicians refer to such curved worlds as “non-Euclidean” geometries. (More than 2,000 years ago, the scholar Euclid laid out the rules of geometry most of us learned in school—ideas that only apply on a flat world.)

The quirky landscape Gotszling created by tweaking Doom's source code is something else entirely. To understand it, we have to go back to the 1990s: a time when every arithmetic operation consumed a huge amount of resources. To manage that challenge, programmers made efforts to determine possible calculations in advance and store them in “lookup tables.”

When developing 3D graphics for a computer game, trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine and tangent play an important role. They can be used to describe how objects move through space over time. To save processing power, Doom's developers calculated important values of the trigonometric functions for various angles in advance and stored them in the lookup tables. And this is where pi comes into play: you have to multiply an angle in degrees by pi to get the corresponding value in radians, which the computer uses.

So if Gotszling used a value of pi that was too small, the angles would be converted incorrectly. Because developers only store a finite number of angles, he created lookup tables with values that no longer include the full rotations: Instead of describing an environment in which an object only reappears in the same place after a 360-degree rotation, this occurs after a significantly smaller angle. As a result, in extreme situations, objects suddenly disappear or reappear out of nowhere.

The Doom world Gotszling has created is incredibly strange. Nevertheless, it's a nice way to get people thinking about mathematics and the value—in every sense—of pi. One small mistake by a game developer has sparked a much larger experiment into the strange circle number.

A team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU), in collaboration with partners in the UK, reports a nanotechnology approach that reverses Alzheimer's disease in mouse models. Rather than using nanoparticles as passive carriers, the researchers designed bioactive nanoparticles that function as "supramolecular drugs." The treatment focuses on restoring the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the vascular checkpoint that maintains the brain's internal environment. By repairing this interface, the animals showed a reversal of Alzheimer's pathology.

The brain consumes about 20% of the body's energy in adults and as much as 60% in children. That energy arrives through an exceptionally dense vascular network in which each neuron is supplied by its own capillary. With roughly one billion capillaries, the brain relies on healthy vasculature to sustain function and resist disease. These observations reinforce how vascular health connects to conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's, where damage to the vascular system is closely associated.

Blood-brain barrier function and removal of waste proteins

The BBB is a cellular and physiological shield that separates brain tissue from circulating blood, helping block pathogens and toxins. The researchers showed that by acting on a specific mechanism, harmful "waste proteins" produced in the brain can cross this barrier and be cleared into the bloodstream. In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β (Aβ) is the primary waste protein, and its buildup disrupts neuronal function.

The team worked with mouse models engineered to overproduce Aβ and to develop marked cognitive decline that mirrors Alzheimer's features. The animals received three doses of the supramolecular drugs, followed by regular monitoring. "Only 1h after the injection we observed a reduction of 50-60% in Aβ amount inside the brain" explains Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University and PhD student at the University College London (UCL).

Therapeutic outcomes were the most notable. Across several behavioral and memory tests conducted over months, animals were assessed at different disease stages. In one example, a 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60-year-old human) was treated with the nanoparticles and evaluated 6 months later. By 18 months of age (comparable to a 90-year-old human), its behavior matched that of a healthy mouse.

Restoring vasculature to restart brain self-clearing

"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance. What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels," said Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC, Principal Investigator of the Molecular Bionics Group and leader of the study.

In Alzheimer's, a key breakdown occurs in the brain's natural clearance process for toxic species such as Aβ. Under normal conditions, the protein LRP1 serves as a molecular gatekeeper. It recognizes Aβ, binds it via ligands, and helps shuttle it across the BBB into the bloodstream for removal. The system is delicate. If LRP1 binds too much Aβ too tightly, transport becomes congested and LRP1 itself is degraded within BBB cells, reducing the number of available carriers. If binding is too weak, the transport signal is insufficient. Either scenario leads to Aβ accumulation in the brain.

The supramolecular drugs act as a reset switch. By imitating LRP1 ligands, they bind Aβ, traverse the BBB, and trigger the removal of toxic species. As this process resumes, the vasculature regains its natural waste-clearing role and returns toward normal function.

Precision-engineered nanoparticles and receptor control

In this work, nanoparticles operate as therapeutic agents in their own right. Built through a bottom-up molecular engineering strategy, they combine tightly controlled size with a defined number of surface ligands to create a multivalent platform with highly specific interactions at cellular receptors. By engaging receptor trafficking at the cell membrane, they provide a new way to modulate receptor activity. This precision supports efficient Aβ clearance and helps rebalance the vascular system that safeguards brain health.

This therapeutic concept points toward future clinical strategies that address the vascular contribution to Alzheimer's disease and aim to improve patient outcomes. "Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood-brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer's pathology," concludes Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at the Molecular Bionics group from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona (UB).

The project brought together the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya (IBEC), West China Hospital of Sichuan University, West China Xiamen Hospital of Sichuan University, University College London, the Xiamen Key Laboratory of Psychoradiology and Neuromodulation, University of Barcelona,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA).

Emerging evidence suggests that lineage-specifying transcription factors control the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We have discovered a transcription factor switching mechanism involving the poorly characterized orphan nuclear receptor HNF4G and the putative pioneer factor FOXA1, which drives PDAC progression. Using our unbiased protein interactome discovery approach, we identified HNF4A and HNF4G as reproducible, FOXA1-associated proteins, in both preclinical models and Whipple surgical samples. In the primary tumor context, we consistently find that the dominant transcription factor is HNF4G, where it functions as the driver. A molecular switch occurs in advanced disease, whereby HNF4G expression or activity decreases, unmasking FOXA1's transcriptional potential. Derepressed FOXA1 drives late-stage disease by orchestrating metastasis-specific enhancer–promoter loops to regulate the expression of metastatic genes. Overall survival is influenced by HNF4G and FOXA1 activity in primary tumor growth and in metastasis, respectively. We suggest that the existence of stage-dependent transcription factor activity, triggered by molecular compartmentalization, mediates the progression of PDAC.

Despite recent advances in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), median survival remains less than 12 months1. Recent large-scale genomic approaches have shown that PDAC is composed of at least two distinct molecular subtypes, based on transcriptomic signatures, and these are termed the classical and squamous (or basal/mesenchymal) subtypes. Although it is well described that PDAC harbors gene mutations (that is, KRAS G12D and p53 R172H) that initiate the disease, little is known about the influence of lineage-defining transcription factors on the PDAC molecular subtypes1,2,3,4,5.

Pioneer factors (PFs) are a specialized type of transcription factors that can bind directly to condensed chromatin and create enhancer elements within the genome, and changes in the expression levels or fidelity of these specialized transcription factor TF can alter cell lineage. The archetypal PF is the forkhead transcription factor FOXA1 (refs. 6,7,8,9). In hormone-dependent breast cancer, FOXA1 functions in a physical complex with GATA3 and the nuclear receptor (NR) estrogen receptor (ER), whereas in prostate cancer, FOXA1 forms a transcriptional complex with GATA2 and the NR androgen receptor (AR)9. Seminal work in metastatic organoid models (mouse) of PDAC demonstrated that elevated FOXA1 and GATA5 led to the creation of new enhancer elements, which were associated with increased metastatic potential10.

The HNF4 families of transcription factors have been implicated in an endodermal identity2 and in the development of PDAC, with both HNF4A and HNF4G being differentially expressed in the classical subtype of the disease. At a minimum, these two transcription factors could function as biomarkers of this common subtype of PDAC, but as developmental transcription factors11, they potentially could have a functional role in tumor progression. Supporting this, HNF4A was previously shown to cooperate with GATA6 (another transcription factor commonly amplified in PDAC) to maintain a metabolic signature of the classical subtype12. Very little is known about HNF4G, although it has been shown to impact cellular proliferation and invasion13,14,15,16. The SMAD4 deficiency in PDAC has been shown to increase HNF4G expression and oncogenic potential15,17. One of the most statistically enriched germ-line variants is at the HNF4G gene locus and is linked with increased HNF4G expression and increased risk of developing PDAC18.

We sought to leverage the link between FOXA1 and PDAC metastasis to purify FOXA1-associated proteins, thereby definitively identifying and characterizing the protein complex involved in disease progression. We were specifically interested in discovering NR transcription factors in PDAC, similar to what is observed between FOXA1 and ESR1 in breast cancer and between FOXA1 and AR in prostate cancer. We identify HNF4 family members as consistent FOXA1-associated proteins and show a stage-specific mutually exclusive role for HNF4G and subsequently for FOXA1 in distinct stages of the disease, from primary tumor to metastasis.

We adopted an unbiased approach to identify driving transcription factors in PDAC and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP–seq) of the active enhancer mark H3K27Ac on surplus tissue obtained after the resection of primary PDAC (Whipple surgical samples). We identified all genomic intervals with substantial fold changes in H3K27Ac signal between PDAC tumors (n = 6) and normal adjacent tissue (n = 4; Fig. 1a). A median of 65,010 H3K27Ac peaks per sample (range = 43,909–76,827) was observed. Enriched enhancer regions, specifically in primary PDAC lesions, are presented in Fig. 1a, and we termed these sites as PDAC-enriched candidate regulatory elements (PDAC-CREs). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed a substantial H3K27Ac divergence between tumors and the adjacent normal tissue (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Differential transcription factor binding at the tumor-specific regions was assessed using the cistrome DB toolkit, an approach that identifies binding site similarity with known experimental transcription factor datasets (Extended Data Fig. 1c), with FOXA1 being the top correlated transcription factor from published ChIP–seq datasets. Analysis of the H3K27Ac sites showed that the most enriched motifs within all experimentally mapped enhancer elements from patient samples were hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) motifs (HNF4G and HNF4A) and Forkhead (that is, FOXA1; Fig. 1a), confirming that these two classes of transcription factors constitute the lineage-defining factors in these patient tumor samples. The analysis of clinical datasets revealed that HNF4A levels did not differ between normal and primary tumor samples but were modestly increased in metastatic samples. In contrast, we observed elevated HNF4G levels in primary tumors compared to the normal adjacent tissue, but surprisingly HNF4G mRNA levels in metastases were closer to those observed in normal tissue (Fig. 1b,c)5. In line with the previous reports, FOXA1 levels were found to be elevated in both the metastatic and the tumor cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 1d)10. We conducted ChIP–seq of HNF4G, HNF4A and FOXA1 from Whipple surgical samples from PDAC patients (n = 6; Fig.1d and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f), revealing 3,344 reproducible, consensus binding sites where all three transcription factors cobound at the same genomic regions (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1e–f). These cobound regions were enriched at promoter proximal regions of the genome (Fig. 1d). We also observed a total of 3,461 regions where FOXA1 and HNF4G were corecruited, without any HNF4A binding. The top enriched motifs for the respective pull downs were HNF4 and FOXA1 (Extended Data Fig. 1f), suggesting that these transcription factors bind directly to DNA using consensus motifs.

The transcription factor mapping data suggested that the regions of greatest enhancer activity (as defined by the H3K27Ac data) were preferentially occupied by FOXA1 and HNF4G. A comparison of HNF4G ChIP–seq from normal adjacent tissue (Fig. 1e) showed that tumor-specific enhancers were occupied by HNF4G. In support of a role for HNF4G, the genomic region encoding the HNF4G gene was shown to be amplified in 9% PDAC patients (Fig. 1f). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of FOXA1, HNF4A and HNF4G from primary PDAC tissue samples confirmed coexpression of these transcription factors, only in the cancer epithelial cells (Fig. 1g). These findings suggest that HNF4G mRNA levels and transcriptional activity increase when cells transition from normal to cancer, that HNF4G and FOXA1 are the key lineage-defining transcription factors in PDAC and that amplification of HNF4G is a common event that correlates with poor outcome.

HNF4G and HNF4A are members of the NR superfamily of transcription factors, which is the only readily druggable class of transcription factors due to the presence of a ligand-binding domain. Although our initial discoveries from patient samples suggested that HNF4A and HNF4G could co-occupy many genomic regulation elements, we could show that HNF4A binding is dependent on HNF4G (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 2b), with global HNF4A binding sites decreased when HNF4G was silenced. We observed that HNF4G binds directly to CREs at the HNF4A genomic locus, implying direct regulation of HNF4A expression (Fig. 2b). Therefore, although HNF4A represents one of the best biomarkers of the classical subtype of PDAC, our data suggest that HNF4A activity is functionally downstream of HNF4G.

Hierarchical clustering was used to order clinical samples column-wise, while the gene expression order was preserved according to descending expression values of RNA-seq. The color bar at the bottom depicts the separation pattern between classical primary tumors and metastatic samples (n = 138). IgG, immunoglobulin G; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.

Our data suggest that HNF4G was essential for the growth of classical PDAC models, whereas silencing of HNF4A alone was not sufficient to affect cell proliferation (Extended Data Figs. 2e–h and 3a–e). We subsequently used rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of endogenous (RIME) protein complexes, our method for unbiased discovery of endogenous protein complexes19,20,21 and purified FOXA1 as the ‘bait' to discover associated protein complexes (Fig. 2c). This was applied to two classical (HPAF-II and AsPC-1) PDAC cell line models (where HNF4A and HNF4G are highly expressed) and one mixed subtype model as a control (Miapaca-2; Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). After FOXA1-RIME, we identified numerous subunits of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF complex, known NR cofactors, including CBP, NCOA3 and NCOR1/NCOR2, as well as GATA6 (ref. 21). Notably, this suggests that FOXA1 is present in both major molecular subtypes of PDAC and many of the FOXA1-associated coregulatory proteins were the same, except for HNF4A and HNF4G, which were only seen as FOXA1-associated proteins in models of the classical subtype of the disease. We validated this observation in additional models (Supplementary Table 1)2,22. To confirm that HNF4A and HNF4G were in a complex with both of the metastasis-associated transcription factors, FOXA1 and GATA6 (ref. 23), we also conducted RIME of GATA6 in the AsPC-1 classical model, which confirmed unbiased discovery of interactions among HNF4A, HNF4G, GATA6 and FOXA1 (Supplementary Table 1). The genomic binding profiles and physical interactions among HNF4G, FOXA1, HNF4A and GATA6 were validated in additional models of the classical subtype (Extended Data Figs. 1h and 2a).

We hypothesized that FOXA1 was the PF for HNF4G (and possibly HNF4A), as seen with other NRs in breast and prostate cancer that require FOXA1. However, our in vitro data suggest that, although HNF4G was consistently required for viability of classical PDAC cell line models (Extended Data Figs. 2e–j and 3a,b), FOXA1 was not required. These data imply that FOXA1 might not be the PF for HNF4G, because depletion of FOXA1 should phenocopy HNF4G depletion. We also explored GATA6 as a potential PF for HNF4G, but silencing of GATA6 did not result in decreased HNF4G binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and instead depletion of GATA6 resulted in substantial gains in HNF4G binding sites, suggesting that GATA6 could be a negative regulator of HNF4G activity. We also found little evidence that HNF4A was required for the growth of classical models (Extended Data Fig. 2e–j). We, therefore, focused on HNF4G as a chromatin regulatory protein and specifically silenced HNF4G and subsequently conducted the assay for transposase accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC–seq; Fig. 2d). We found 5,203 regions that were closed and 4,275 regions that were opened after HNF4G depletion. We could also confirm that the HNF4G-dependent chromatin accessibility regions were adjacent to the HNF4G-dependent target genes (Fig. 2d), suggesting that HNF4G is responsible for creating the enhancers that drive the target gene expression events. Therefore, HNF4G is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility and HNF4G activity is not dependent on FOXA1 or on GATA6.

We sought to explore the role of HNF4G in more complex tumor models of human disease. CRISPR knockout (KO) clones were generated in the HPAF-II cells (Extended Data Fig. 3d). We orthotopically injected HNF4G-KO pooled clones or control cells into the pancreas of NOD SCID-γ (NSG) mice and observed a significant increase (P < 0.0006) in the median survival of mice bearing HNF4G-KO tumors compared to control tumors (Fig. 2e). The HNF4G-KO resulted in slower tumor growth compared to control (Cas9) tumors (P < 0.0001) and substantially smaller tumors (Fig. 2f), confirming that HNF4G is required for optimal tumor growth. We conducted RNA-seq on the orthotopic tumor samples (Extended Data Fig. 3f–j) and identified an HNF4G-specific target gene signature that was assessed in the PanCuRx clinical cohort24. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the HNF4G target genes (discovered in our orthotopic tumor experiments; Fig. 2g) were specifically expressed in primary tumors, as opposed to metastatic samples (Fig. 2g), implying that the HNF4G target genes were restricted to primary tumor contexts. The HNF4G target genes that were differentially expressed in the PanCuRx primary tumor samples were adjacent to the genomic regions that were ‘opened' by HNF4G in our cell line models (Fig. 2d, red panel above MA plot), confirming that HNF4G mediates chromatin accessibility at gene targets that are commonly expressed in patient samples.

The findings show that FOXA1 cobinds with HNF4G in the classical subtype of PDAC, but that FOXA1 is not a PF in this PDAC subtype and, instead, the key transcription factor driving primary tumor growth appears to be HNF4G. Thus, HNF4G can induce chromatin opening at the target genes that are consistently expressed in patient primary tumor samples, but these genes are decreased in expression in metastases, mimicking the expression profile of HNF4G mRNA (Fig. 1b).

HNF4G is a poorly studied NR, and it is currently classified as an ‘orphan' NR, because no endogenous ligands have been implicated for these orphan receptors25,26. Because there are no known or validated chemical inhibitors of HNF4G, we re-examined our quantitative RIME (Fig. 3a) data, with the goal of finding potential druggable enzymes that are associated with the FOXA1, GATA6 and HNF4G protein complex. We found protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT1) to be a substantial and reproducible interactor of FOXA1 and HNF4G (Fig. 3a). Previous data had implicated PRMT1 as an essential gene in a subset of PDAC patient-derived xenograft tumors27. The transcriptionally active HNF4G-specific enhancer elements were cobound by PRMT1, as measured by ChIP–seq, and PRMT1 binding was dependent on HNF4G (Fig. 3b,c). We could also show PRMT1 cobinding with HNF4G (and FOXA1) in the Whipple surgical samples (n = 3; Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 3k).

Mice with palpable tumors were then randomized into four groups and treated with GSK3368715 (oral administration of 75 mg kg−1 five doses per week) for 4 weeks, with n = 9 mice for control vehicle and HNF4G-KO vehicle arms and for control + GSK3368715 and HNF4G-KO + GSK3368715 arms n = 12. *P = 0.0339, ***P < 0.0001 and ***P = 0.0002 were calculated with a Welch test with multiplicity corrections (f). **P = 0.003, ***P = 0.0001 and ***P < 0.0001 of random intercept piecewise model parameters were defined by means of Wald t tests (g). The lighter lines indicate mouse-specific longitudinal tumor volume measures, color-coded by specific groups.

PRMT1 has been previously shown to be essential for the viability of specific PDAC patient-derived xenograft tumor models27. We could show that the same Type I-PRMT inhibitor (GSK3368715) was more effective at inhibiting growth in the HNF4G-KO models (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), which was associated with an accumulation of the monomethylation mark, the basal state when type I PRMTs are inactive (Extended Data Fig. 4d–f). FOXA1 overexpression (OE) did not appreciably alter sensitivity to the PRMT inhibitor. We conducted a four-arm in vivo efficacy study in which control or HNF4G-KO cells were injected orthotopically into the pancreas of NSG mice and subsequently treated with vehicle or 75 mg kg−1 GSK3368715 (Fig. 3f,g). We observed a substantial survival advantage of 19 days in HNF4G-KO tumor-bearing mice (P < 0.03) that were treated with GSK3368715 (Fig. 3f). These data confirm a functional dependence between the NR HNF4G and the methyltransferase PRMT1 that can potentially be exploited therapeutically.

Our data so far suggest that HNF4G can cobind with FOXA1 to the same genomic regions, but only HNF4G is essential for tumor growth, in part, by recruitment of PRMT1. To explore the potential connection further, we depleted FOXA1 and mapped HNF4G binding sites, or vice versa (Extended Data Fig. 4i). There was no appreciable loss of FOXA1 binding when the NR (HNF4G) was depleted (Extended Data Fig. 4i) and, notably, we did not see any reproducible decrease in HNF4G binding when FOXA1 was silenced (Extended Data Fig. 4i), confirming the evolving conclusion that FOXA1 is not a PF for the lineage-defining NR (that is, HNF4G) in primary PDAC.

Although FOXA1 can contribute to the formation of new enhancers that drive metastasis10, our data suggest that it has no role in primary tumor contexts. To explore and validate the potential role of FOXA1 in PDAC, we conducted an orthotopic tumor experiment (Fig. 4a). FOXA1-OE did not change primary tumor growth in vivo compared to control mice (Fig. 4a), whereas HNF4G deletion had a substantial impact on primary tumor growth. FOXA1-OE was unable to reverse the tumor growth retardation resulting from the deletion of HNF4G, suggesting that HNF4G is the dominant transcription factor in the primary tumor context, whereas FOXA1 appears to lack any tumor-promoting activity in this context. Metastasis was not observed in control EV and FOXA1-OE mice due to the rapid primary tumor onset and the ethical requirement to kill the mice before metastases were detectable.

a, Cells were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of NSG mice (n = 5) for the following conditions: control, HNF4G-KO, FOXA1-OE and HNF4G-KO + FOXA1.

Next, to directly explore the role of FOXA1 and/or HNF4G in metastasis, engineered human cancer cell lines (HPAF-II) were injected into the tail vein of mice to directly assess metastatic potential. FOXA1-OE increased the number of lung metastases, regardless of whether HNF4G was present or not (Fig. 4b). This confirms that FOXA1 does indeed promote metastasis as previously suggested10, but it does not influence primary tumor growth (Fig. 4a). The survival data from the metastatic experiment confirmed that overexpressed FOXA1 substantially shortens overall survival, but this was substantially blunted in the absence of HNF4G (Fig. 4c). Metastatic burden to the lungs was substantially more in the FOXA1-OE and HNF4G-KO + FOXA1-OE contexts (Fig. 4d,e). Interestingly, when FOXA1 is OE in an HNF4G-KO context, these mice had extended survival, because of the HNF4G depletion, although they had widespread and substantial metastasis (Fig.4b,d,e). These data suggest that both transcription factors contribute to overall survival from PDAC, with FOXA1 mediating metastatic potential and HNF4G mediating primary growth, and possibly growth at secondary sites as well.

To date, our data suggest that HNF4G is the primary driver of tumor growth, whereas FOXA1 becomes the driver of metastasis, and together, they both contribute to tumor progression and overall survival. To understand how a functional switch occurs from HNF4G-dependent state to a FOXA1-mediated metastatic state in the transition from primary tumor growth to metastatic progression, we explored our engineered human cancer cell line xenograft models. We performed RNA-seq on the collected primary tumors from the pancreatic orthotopic experiment, as well as FOXA1 ChIP–seq and ATAC–seq to map chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Figs. 4k and 5a–c). We observed a gain of 4,940 de novo FOXA1 binding sites when FOXA1 was overexpressed compared to EV (Extended Data Fig. 5a). These sites correlated with regions that were already open and accessible, as measured by ATAC–seq (Extended Data Fig. 5b), implying that an increase in FOXA1 levels results in opportunistic binding to regions that are already euchromatic and FOXA1 cannot create new enhancers, as would be expected from a genuine PF. Unexpectedly, no differential gene expression changes were observed after FOXA1-OE (Extended Data Fig. 5f–h), despite the gain in FOXA1 binding sites. When HNF4G was silenced, however, 2,133 of these gained FOXA1 binding sites (following FOXA1-OE) became transcriptionally active (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5c–e), suggesting that the presence or absence of HNF4G dictates whether FOXA1 is active at these regions or not (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j).

The samples were statistically tested using one-sided two-sample t test (P = 0.02). Samples sizes considered for these analyses include primary tumors, n = 105 (classical subtype); metastasis, n = 20. Plot metadata, upper whisker—8.2729–14.984, 6.3388–9.1325, 11.712–25.419, 14.303–29.707; lower whisker—0–2.9732, 0–2.2442, 0–2.3562, 0.37089–3.8985; upper adjacent value—14.984, 9.1325, 25.419, 29.707; lower adjacent value—0, 0, 0, 0.37089; box bounds—2.9732–8.2729, 2.2442–6.3388, 2.3562–11.712, 3.8985–14.303; median—5.7973, 4.1536, 6.8413, 10.395; 75th percentiles—8.2729, 6.3388, 11.712, 14.303; 25th percentiles—2.9732, 2.2442, 2.3562, 3.8985. ** P ≤ 0.03. e, FOXA1 and HNF4G IHC staining in primary and liver metastatic samples (n = 5 from cohort 1). Representative images from one patient are presented. The areas on the right show nuclear staining of FOXA1 and substantial cytosolic staining of HNF4G.

These new FOXA1 binding sites (that are normally restricted by HNF4G) result in induced gene expression profiles associated with metastasis (Fig. 5b,c). We term these ‘HNF4G-restricted FOXA1 metastasis genes'. These HNF4G-restricted FOXA1 metastasis genes were correlated well with the gene expression profiles of metastatic patient samples (mets) when compared to a cohort of classical subtype primary tumor samples (from the PanCuRx dataset; Extended Data Figs. 5m and 6a), validating the conclusion from the preclinical models.

Up to this point, our data suggest that HNF4G is the driver in primary contexts, and it also restricts FOXA1's metastatic activity. We speculated that HNF4G's ability to restrict FOXA1 could be compromised in advanced disease, where metastatic target genes become induced by FOXA1. Analysis of the human PanCuRx dataset showed a global decrease in HNF4G mRNA expression in metastatic samples (mets) relative to primary tumors, with a coincident increase in FOXA1 expression (Fig. 5d). We also conducted IHC of HNF4G and FOXA1 from primary tumors and relatively rare metastatic human tissue (two independent cohorts). In primary tumors, we observed clear expression of HNF4G and FOXA1, which was restricted to the epithelial compartment and predominantly exhibited nuclear expression (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). When we assessed the metastatic patient samples, we observed a consistent expression of FOXA1. However, in two independent cohorts, we observed either decreased HNF4G protein expression or cytoplasmic HNF4G staining in metastases, which was not observed in primary tumor samples (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). Our data suggest that multiple mechanisms exist for a tumor to inhibit HNF4G activity, allowing FOXA1 to become active and drive metastatic spread.

To support our human clinical and preclinical data, we took an orthogonal approach and exploited the autochthonous KPC mouse model28. We derived and validated cell line models from KPC primary tumors or from matched liver metastases, permitting a comparison of isogenic matched cell line models (Extended Data Fig. 6e–h). There was a substantial gain of global Foxa1 binding in the liver metastasis (mets) cell line compared to the primary tumor cell line (Fig. 6a), with a total of 21,790 metastasis-specific gained Foxa1 binding sites (Fig. 6b,c). The ability of elevated Foxa1 to associate with these enhancers resulted in the induction of adjacent genes (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 6e,f), which were enriched in pathways associated with metastasis. We exploited the published H3K27Ac ChIP–seq data derived from mouse organoid models10 and demonstrated that the Foxa1 binding observed specifically in our metastasis-derived KPC mouse cell line model was located at the same genomic regions where H3K27Ac was mapped in the published mouse metastatic organoids (Fig. 6f,g).

Panel a was created with BioRender.com. b, Foxa1 binding sites that were either common to both tumor and liver mets, tumor-unique or liver metastasis-unique (gained). The data have been analyzed using negative binomial GLM as a part of the DiffBind package at Padj < 0.05 threshold. c, Heatmaps represent occupancy of Foxa1 and Hnf4g at common sites in the metastatic cell line model, ordered by Foxa1 intensity. d, The plot illustrates the relationship in cumulative numbers of Foxa1 binding sites located within the 10-kb linear scale from TSS of differentially upregulated and constantly expressed genes from the RNA-seq data. e, Difference in landscape of Foxa1 binding density across genomic ranges relative to TSS of induced genes, between mets and primary cell lines. f,g, Correlation of log2-fold changes between H3K27Ac (T versus M organoid models extracted from ref. 10) with ChIP–seq of Foxa1 (f) and Hnf4g (g) (mets versus primary tumor cell lines). h, Difference in Foxa1-induced chromatin loops in proximity to upregulated transcripts across genomic ranges relative to TSS, comparing mets and primary cell lines. i,j, An example of Foxa1 (i) and Hnf4g (j) associated Hi-ChIP loops in mets and tumors. Foxa1 and Hnf4g binding at CREs in mets and tumor (red and green). The example shows looping between the c-Myc enhancers in mets and Foxa1 and Hnf4g binding is shown in blue. k, Combined genome-wide view of functional relationships between ChIP and Hi-ChIP data in the context of mets and tumor. Both FOXA1 and HNF4G ChIP were mapped to the mouse GRC mm10 genome and represented as tracks. Corresponding Hi-ChIP loops are shown as scatters in sectors mapped to chromosomes in the ideogram. TSS, transcription start sites.

The top scenario represents primary tumor contexts, where HNF4G is the dominant transcription factor, required for chromatin accessibility, gene expression and cell growth. The bottom scenario represents metastatic contexts, where FOXA1 becomes functional and the role of HNF4G is diminished. The switch from HNF4G dependency to FOXA1 dependency mediates the molecular transition from primary tumor growth to metastasis.

We hypothesized that Foxa1 could promote preferential enhancer–promoter interactions in the metastatic context. To this end, we performed Hi-ChIP in the two isogenic mouse cell lines derived from the KPC mice and found that Hnf4g and Foxa1 were associated with chromatin looping (Fig. 6h,i,j). Hnf4g Hi-ChIP revealed elevated and preferential long-range looping in the primary tumor context compared to metastasis (Fig. 6h,j and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, Foxa1 Hi-ChIP revealed a global gain of enhancer–promoter looping events specifically in the metastatic mouse cell line (Fig. 6h,i and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). These data implicate FOXA1 (Foxa1) in metastasis-specific chromatin looping interactions that culminate in the metastasis-specific gene expression program (Fig. 6i,k and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Therefore, while HNF4G is the dominant transcription factor in primary tumor contexts, a switch occurs in advanced disease, resulting in engagement of FOXA1 to enhancers that create spatial genomic re-organization and ultimately in induction of metastasis-specific gene targets.

Recent studies have implicated certain transcription factors as signature genes of specific PDAC subtypes and have linked several of these to disease progression2,5,22. Although transcription factors in the past have been considered ‘undruggable', NR transcription factors constitute realistic drug targets due to the presence of a ligand-binding pocket in the protein. To this end, our new insight reveals the NR HNF4G as a key driver in the primary tumor growth. Currently, HNF4G-targeted drugs do not exist and HNF4G is an orphan NR with no known endogenous ligand. One possibility is that HNF4G might lack an endogenous ligand and could have evolved as an NR-related transcription factor that does not functionally require the conserved ligand-binding domain. Alternatively, there could be an endogenous ligand for HNF4G that is a noncanonical compound. In support of this, X-ray crystallographic structures of HNF4G have revealed a common long-chain fatty acid, palmitic acid, occupying the ligand-binding domain pocket of HNF4G in these structures and palmitic acid has previously been shown to influence PDAC tumor growth and metastatic potential29,30.

The family members of HNF transcription factors have been previously implicated as fundamental regulators of gene expression programs in bowel disease, colorectal cancer and PDAC2,11,14. HNF1A deficiency has been shown to promote PDAC and is also associated with the squamous subtype, through the recruitment of the demethylase enzyme KDM6A31. A study in ref. 11 reported BMP/SMAD signaling as a mechanism to stabilize enterocyte identity via HNF4 transcription factors. Specifically, for PDAC, a study in ref. 12 observed that the loss of these endoderm-associated transcription factors (that is, HNF4A and GATA6) could result in altered metabolic profiles of cells associated with the squamous lineage. We did not find a substantial role for HNF4A in the classical subtype; however, a role for HNF4A may exist in different stages of the disease, particularly in late-stage disease.

Surprisingly, little is known about the normal physiological role of HNF4G, very little information exists linking it to disease, and gene KO data suggest that it is not an essential gene for developmental processes and mouse viability. In contrast to HNF4G, FOXA1 has been previously implicated as a driver of PDAC metastasis, with elevated FOXA1 creating de novo enhancers associated with metastasis10. FOXA1 is the archetypal PF6,32, and its functional role as the adaptor between chromatin and NR transcription factors in breast and prostate cancer is well-established33,34. In both hormone-dependent breast and prostate cancers, FOXA1 forms a triumvirate with a GATA protein and an NR (GATA3 and ER in breast cancer; GATA2 and AR in prostate cancer) and is the foundational protein in these cancers35,36 due to its ability to create new enhancer elements37. However, the role of FOXA1 in primary PDAC disease was in stark contrast to what is observed in breast and prostate cancer35,38. FOXA1 could bind to active enhancers in PDAC (in primary tumor tissue and the various models) at the same places as HNF4G; we could not observe a role for FOXA1 in mediating chromatin accessibility, gene expression or cell viability in primary tumor contexts. This suggests a nonpioneering role for FOXA1 in PDAC and a dominant role for HNF4G in this subtype of the disease.

We identified the core transcription factors that make up the lineage-defining factors in the classical subtype of PDAC. In the primary tumor context, HNF4G was the dominant transcription factor that drives tumor growth, while also negatively regulating FOXA1 transcriptional activity. During the transition to metastasis, however, we observed a substantial decrease in HNF4G:FOXA1 ratios and, mechanistically, we could show that when HNF4G is depleted, FOXA1 becomes active and is associated with chromatin loops that drive expression of a distinct gene expression program associated with metastatic potential10. Overall survival in the classical subtype is dictated by the proliferative activity of HNF4G and the metastatic activity of FOXA1.

Matched flash frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) samples from Whipple surgical samples undergoing surgical resection at the Cambridge University Hospitals were sectioned according to institutional protocols.

This study was approved by the East of England—Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Research Ethics Committee and was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, local regulatory requirements and the legal requirements for CAMPAN (08/H0306/32). All patients provided written informed consent. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments or comparable ethical standards. Release of data was also pseudo-anonymized as per the UK Human Tissue Act regulations.

Histological staining of FOXA1 and HNF4G in stage IV primary tumors and liver metastases was performed according to the recommendations of the local ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg—Essen (approval 23-11451-B0). Clinical data were obtained from archives and electronic health records. All patients provided written informed consent.

AsPC-1, HPAF-II, BXPC-3, Panc-1, MiaPaca (ATCC), KPC-derived cell lines and CRISPR-modified cell lines were grown in DMEM (Gibco, 41966-029), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10500-064). Cells were routinely genotyped by short-tandem repeat genetic profiling using the PowerPlex 16HS cell line panel and analyzed using the Applied Biosystems GeneMapper ID (v3.2.1) software by the external provider Genetica DNA Laboratories (LabCorp Specialty Testing Group). Cells were tested using MycoProbe Mycoplasma detection kit (R&D) before experiments every 6 months. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C.

Three CRISPR guides were designed against exons 3 and 4 of HNF4G (ENSG00000164749). The three sequences are as follows: (1) 196 (exon 4)—CATCCCCTCCATTAACACAC, (2) 197 (exon 3)—GTGTTGTTGACAAGGACAAA and (3) 198 (exon 3)—TTAAGAAAGTGTTTTAGAGC.

HPAF-II cells were electroporated (Amaxa 4D nucleofector, Lonza) with 5-μg TrueCut spCas9 protein V2 (Invitrogen) and 100 pmol of single guide RNA (Synthego), and used program DS137 and P3 nucleofector solution (Lonza). A cell pellet was taken 3 days after electroporation, and genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from each pool. Exon 3 or 4 of HNF4G was amplified by PCR (Q5 polymerase, NEB). Amplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing and analyzed using the Synthego ICE web tool to calculate the percent editing. To generate clonal cells, HNF4G edited pools were single cell cloned into 96-well plates. gDNA was extracted from each clone and the editing analysis was performed similarly to the edited pool. Three individual clones were confirmed to be KOs and pooled together to make an HNF4G clonal pool. Three clones with heterozygotic frameshift mutations were used for subsequent experiments. The target frameshift mutations in these three clones were validated by Sanger sequencing. The HNF4G−/− pool of clones were short-tandem repeat genotyped and mycoplasma tested as described under ‘Cell lines'.

HPAF-II cells were transfected with ON-TARGET plus SMARTPools (Dharmacon) FOXA1 (L-010319-00-0020), ON-TARGET plus SMARTPools (Dharmacon) HNF4G (set 1 L-003407-00-0020 and set 2 stealth sirna-HSS104886, HSS179284 and HSS104885), HNF4A (stealth sirna-HSS140900 and HSS140901) and RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, 13778-150). A nontargeting pool (D-001810-10-20) was used as a control.

RIME on cell lines was performed as described previously39. Briefly, cells were cross-linked at room temperature by incubating with 2 mM di(N-succinimidyl) glutarate (DSG) for 20 min followed by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min before quenching in 0.1-M glycine for 10 min. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS and collected in cold PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors(Roche, Complete, 05056489001) and Halt inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78427). Cross-linked cells were incubated at 4 °C with lysis buffer (LB1; 50 mM Hepes–KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40/Igepal CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100) for 10 min followed by 5 min in LB2 (10-mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA) before resuspending in LB3 (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). Chromatin was sonicated using the Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode) for 15 min (30-s on/30-s off) to generate fragments of around 100–800 bp. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight using protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen; used for rabbit antibodies) or protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen; used for goat antibodies) conjugated to specific antibodies against HNF4G (Atlas, HPA005438), HNF4A (Cell Signaling Technology, 3113S), PRMT1 (Atlas, HPA072136), GATA6 (Cell Signaling Technology, 5851; R&D Systems, AF1700) and FOXA1 (Abcam, ab5089). Beads were washed ten times in RIPA buffer (50 mM, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.7% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5 M LiCl) followed by two washes in AMBIC (100 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate). Washed beads were frozen at −20 °C.

Pull-down samples were digested, and peptides were cleaned with C18 spin columns as described previously39. Peptides were analyzed in the Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system coupled with the Q-Exactive HF (QE-HF) or QE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometers. For peptide separation, the EASY-Spray analytical column (75 μm × 25 cm, C18, 2 μm, 100 Å) was used for multistep gradient elution. The full scans were performed in the Orbitrap over the range of 400–1,600 m/z at 60k (QE-HF) or 70k (QE) resolution. For MS2, the ten most intense precursors were selected with resolution of 30k (QE-HF) or 17.5k (QE). The HCD tandem mass spectra were processed with the Sequest HT search engine in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 or 2.2 software. For downstream statistical analysis, the Perseus software was used40.

Clinical samples and cell lines ChIP–seq on tumor material were performed essentially as described previously41. Briefly, flash-frozen pancreatic cancer or normal adjacent tissue from patients was cryosectioned into 30-μm sections, cross-linked by 2 mM DSG for 45 min, total together with 1% formaldehyde for the last 20 min and quenched by 0.1 M glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated, washed and processed for sequencing. ChIP–seq was performed on three or four independent biological replicates. Chromatin was prepared from both cell lines/tumors and immunoprecipitated as described for RIME above. Chromatin was eluted and decrosslinked by incubating overnight at 65 °C in elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Samples were treated with (20 ng ml−1) RNase A for 30 min–1 h followed by proteinase K (200 ng ml−1) for 1–2 h before DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. Purified DNA was subjected to library preparation using the SMARTer ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit (Takara Bio, R400676) and DNA HT Dual Index Kit—96N Set A (Takara Bio, R400660) followed by next-generation sequencing to reach approximately 30 million reads per sample.

A total of 50-bp single-end reads were mapped to the hg38 genome using bowtie2 (v2.2.6). Aligned reads with mapping quality <5 were filtered out. The read alignments from all replicates were combined into single library and peaks were called with MACS2 (version 2.1.1.2016) using input sequences as a background control. The peaks that absorbed statistically significant tag density from all replicates were selected for downstream analysis. MEME (version 4.9.1) was used to detect known and discovered new binding motifs among tag-enriched sequences. For visualizing tag density and signal distribution heatmap, the read coverage in a window of +/−2.5 or 5 kb of the peak midpoint was generated using a bin size of 1 of 100 of the window length. Differential binding analysis (DiffBind) was performed as described previously42.

The cumulative numbers of ChIP–seq binding sites located within the 10-kb linear scale from the transcription start sites of substantially upregulated genes were determined. As a background control, binding sites near an equal number of randomly expressed genes revealed by the RNA-seq analyses were tested in 100 permutations. The fraction of binding sites near these groups of genes was then visualized as curves, including the s.d. for the random constitutively expressed control genes as error bars. For the circular visualization of functional relations between the ChIP–seq and corresponding gene network, we used the circlize package in R (version 4.4.36). Networking analysis of predicted gene associations was performed using the STRING application plugin with Cytoscape (version 3.10.3).

Total RNA was purified using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, 74106) and mRNA libraries were prepared using the stranded mRNA library preparation kit (Illumina, 20020595) and IDT for Illumina—TruSeq RNA UD Indexes (20022371). Samples were subjected to Illumina next-generation sequencing to reach around 30 million reads per sample. Four biological replicates were conducted for all RNA-seq experiments.

A total of 50 bp single-end reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh37) or mouse genome (GRCm38) using STAR (version 2.6.1a). Differentially expressed genes were identified based on the negative binomial distribution using the DESeq2 package in R (version 1.14.1). Heatmap visualization, clustering and various plotting functions were used from statistical and bioinformatic modules in framework.

HPAF-II cells with HNF4G-KO and control, alongside FOXA1-OE with empty vectors (EVs), were used for ATAC–seq protocol. Omni-ATAC–seq was performed as described previously43. ATAC–seq resuspension buffer (RSB) was prepared as follows: for 50 ml of the buffer, 500 μl of 1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μl of 5 M NaCl, 150 μl of 1 M MgCl2 and 49.25 ml sterile water were added. A total of 50 μl cold ATAC–RSB containing 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween-20 and digitonin 0.01% (Promega, G9441) was added to 50,000 viable cells and pipetted up and down thrice. The cells were incubated on ice for 3 min to lyse the cells and washed with 1 ml of cold ATAC–RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20, but without NP-40 and digitonin. The pellet was resuspended in 50 µl transposition mix (25 µl 2× Tagment buffer, 2.5 µl transposase—100 nM final; Illumina Tagment DNA Enzyme and Buffer Small Kit, 20034197—16.5 µl PBS, 0.5 µl 1% digitonin, 0.5 µl 10% Tween-20, 5 µl H2O) and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a thermomixer (1,000 rpm mixing). Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (D4014) was used to clean up the reaction and DNA was eluted in 21 μl elution buffer and stored at −20 °C until amplification. A total of 20 μl of the product was used for the following PCR. Pre-amplification was performed for five cycles using 1 μl of i5 primer, 1 μl of i7 primer, 25 μl 2× Q5 HotStart NEBNext master mix (M0494L) and 20 μl transposed/cleaned-up sample. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: 72 °C for 5 min and 98 °C for 30 s, followed by five cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, then held at 4 °C. Using 5 μl (10%) of the pre-amplified mixture, 15 μl qPCR was run to determine the number of additional cycles needed—3.85 μl sterile water, 0.2 μl Nextera XT Index kit (24 indexes, FC-131-1001) i5 primer, 0.2 μl i7 primer, 0.75 μl 20× EvaGreen (in DMSO), 5 μl 2× NEBNext master mix and 5 μl pre-amplified sample. Cycling conditions wer as follows: 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 20 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min. After qPCR amplification, the amplification profiles were analyzed to determine the required number of additional cycles for amplification. Samples were size selected and purified using Ampure XP beads. Furthermore, NGS was performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with SP flow cell system with 50-bp paired end.

Cells were washed twice in cold PBS and collected in RIPA buffer (Pierce, 89901). Whole-cell extract was sonicated using the Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode) for 2 min (30-s on/30-s off) to degrade the DNA, quantified by Direct Detect spectrometer Millipore) and run on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis–Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a membrane by iBlot2 (Invitrogen), and the membrane was then blocked with Odyssey TBS blocking solution (Li-Cor, 927-50000) and incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) and developed using the Odyssey CLx Imaging System (Li-Cor). Primary antibodies were as follows: FOXA1 (Abcam, ab23738), HNF4G, HNF4A, GATA6 (Cell Signaling Technology, 5851; monomethyl arginine, 8015; Vinculin, 13901; β-actin, 4970); asymmetric dimethyl (arginine, 13522; Sigma-Aldrich, A5441). Secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were as follows: goat anti-rabbit (926-32211, 926-68071), goat anti-mouse (926-32210, 926-68070) and donkey anti-goat (926-32214).

Five tumors per treatment arm were fixed in formalin for 24 h and subsequently transferred to 70% ethanol and paraffin embedded. Sections were cut, dewaxed, rehydrated and subsequently stained with antibodies on Ventana (Roche) using the fully automated Ventana Discovery ULTRA (Roche) with Ventana solutions. Paraffin sections were pretreated with heat using standard conditions (40 min) in CC1 solution. The primary antibody was applied and incubated for specific times (listed below). After incubation with a rabbit Impress HRP antibody (Vector Laboratories), chromogenic revelation was performed with ChromoMap DAB kit (Roche). Thus, IHC staining for FOXA1, HNF4G and PRMT1 was performed with antibodies described above. Slides were scanned using an Aperio AT2 (Leica) at ×20 magnification (resolution = 0.5 μm per pixel).

Hi-ChIP was performed using a previously published protocol. Once the ligation step was completed by adding 50 µl of 1 U µl−1 T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen, 15224-025) and incubating for 4 h at room temperature with gentle mixing on shaker (lowest speed), the chromatin was spun down, and the ChIP–seq protocol as described above was followed.

Hi-ChIP paired-end data processed using the HiC-Pro pipeline, followed by the Hichipper algorithm, reads were aligned to mm10 genomes using the HiC-Pro pipeline. Default settings were used to remove duplicate reads, assign reads to Dpn2 restriction fragments, filter for valid interactions and generate binned interaction matrices44,45.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the animal project licenses P40BD8F30, P1919999D and PP79993249 in accordance with Home Office guidelines.

NSG mice (~8 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, kept in pathogen-free conditions on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and allowed to acclimatize for a period of 7 days before any surgery. Mice were grouped, housed with environmental enrichment, fed on a maintenance diet (PicoLab) and housed with a room temperature of +22 °C/−2 °C and humidity of +55%/−10%. For survival studies, humane endpoints were used with the loss of 15% of pre-implantation weight, body condition score <2.0. Grimace scale (MSG > 1.2/2) scoring was adhered to alongside other clinical signs. All mice were randomly assigned to cohorts as necessary, and analyses were performed in a blinded manner.

Pancreatic orthotopic injections were performed as described previously46. HPAF-II cells were suspended in 50% Matrigel/PBS and injected into the tail of the pancreas (2.5 × 105 cells in 50 µl), with the exception of the FOXA1-OE study, which used 1 × 10⁴ cells per cohort. (Fig. 3g). Mice were allowed to recover from surgery before the onset of routine palpations (weekly from 2 weeks postsurgery) to determine the presence of any pancreatic masses. Once confirmed, mice were serially imaged (weekly) using the Vevo 2100 ultrasound imaging platform (Visual Sonics; 13–24-MHz transducer) to monitor pancreatic tumor progression until clinical endpoint. Images of all tumors were acquired at a minimum of two different orientations. All study images were randomized and blinded before calculating tumor volumes using 3D volume analysis software (Vevo LAB, version 3.1.1) on images taken at the same orientation for each mouse throughout the study, whenever possible. Mice were randomized into four groups (n = 9 mice for control vehicle and HNF4G-KO vehicle arms; n = 14 for control + GSK3368715 arm and n = 15 for HNF4G-KO + GSK3368715 arm). At 2 weeks postsurgery, mice were treated with either vehicle (control, Vetivex saline) or GSK3368715 (75 mg kg−1) by oral gavage (5 ml kg−1), using a dosing regimen of 5 days on/2 days off until clinical endpoint was reached.

Pancreatic cancer cells were injected into the tail vein of NSG mice (n = 12 per group). HPAF-II cells were prepared as a suspension (in PBS) and injected (0.5 × 106 cells in 100 µl) into the tail vein of NSG mice. Mice were monitored daily for signs of ill health or body weight loss for the first 7 days postinjection and then, at routine, periodic intervals until clinical endpoints were reached, whereby necropsies were performed and metastatic burden assessed, complemented by histological analyses. Mice were allowed to recover from surgery for 2 weeks before the onset of routine health checks. Mice were monitored for clinical endpoints, and necropsies were performed to assess metastatic burden by histology.

In Figs. 1c, 2b and 4a, we displayed the survival probability of each group as a function of time by means of Kaplan–Meier plots. Due to the absence of right censoring in the data considered in Fig. 2b, we used a two-sided two-sample Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test (function Wilcox test of R stats package) to test if the median of the difference between a sample of each group is different from 0. In Fig. 1c, due to the presence of right censoring in the TCGA group, we used a log-rank test (function survdiff of the R survival package) to assess whether there is a difference between the two survival curves. In Fig. 4a, due to the absence of right censoring, we considered one-sided Welch tests (function t test of the R stats package) to assess whether the average log survival times of each group compared to the reference (control–vehicle) were significant, and the P values by means of a Bonferroni multiplicity correction. Sensitivity analyses, considering Wald t-tests based on a log-normal model and Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests, led to the same conclusions.

In Figs. 2c and 4b,e, we used parametric linear mixed models to fit tumor sizes of mice on the cube root (Figs. 2c and 4b) and log plus 1 (F3k) scale as a function of groups and time. These transformations were selected to obtain a linear relationship between tumor size and time on the transformed scales and to tame heteroscedasticity. In each analysis, groups (considered as factor with a reference group), time (in days) and groups interacting with time were used as fixed effects. Random intercepts (Figs. 2c and 4b) and slopes (Figs. 2c and 4e) were used to take the longitudinal within-mouse tumor size dependence into account.

In Fig. 2c, the difference in growth between the control and HNF4G-KO groups was assessed by means of a likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood (of the maximum likelihood estimator) of a restricted model assuming the same average growth for both groups and a full model that allows both groups to have a different average growth.

In Fig. 4e, given the delayed growth of the HNF4G groups compared to the control ones, we opted for a piecewise mixed model that allows for the modeling of this time lag, whose value was obtained by minimizing the Akaike criterion. Inference for the parameters related to the growth time lag between the HNF4G and control groups, as well as the difference in growth between each group and HNF4G-KO-GSK, was based on Wald z tests, considering a multiplicity correction for parametric models (function glht of the R multcomp package).

In Figs. 2c and 4e, models were fitted using standard R routines (function lme of the nlme R package). In Fig. 4e, due to the combination of small sample size per group and the presence of left truncation, we used an estimator based on the iterative bootstrap. This allows us to correct for a potential left-truncation bias and to perform a finite sample correction for the parameters. Its initial estimator was a random slope model with the fixed effects described above and a linear interpolation of left-truncated observations. Two-sided inference for the target parameters considered a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

Tissue makeup depends on the local cellular microenvironment. Spatial single-cell genomics enables scalable and unbiased interrogation of these interactions. Here we introduce Nicheformer, a transformer-based foundation model trained on both human and mouse dissociated single-cell and targeted spatial transcriptomics data. Pretrained on SpatialCorpus-110M, a curated collection of over 57 million dissociated and 53 million spatially resolved cells across 73 tissues on cellular reconstruction, Nicheformer learns cell representations that capture spatial context. It excels in linear-probing and fine-tuning scenarios for a newly designed set of downstream tasks, in particular spatial composition prediction and spatial label prediction. Critically, we show that models trained only on dissociated data fail to recover the complexity of spatial microenvironments, underscoring the need for multiscale integration. Nicheformer enables the prediction of the spatial context of dissociated cells, allowing the transfer of rich spatial information to scRNA-seq datasets. Overall, Nicheformer sets the stage for the next generation of machine-learning models in spatial single-cell analysis.

Single-cell genomics technologies have advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in tissues, organs and organisms. Large-scale data generation efforts have charted cellular atlases of specific tissues and organs, such as the lung1 and heart2, as well as broader cross-tissue atlases3. However, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) requires cell dissociation, losing information about the cellular microenvironment and hindering a complete understanding of molecular variation4. Recent advances in image-based spatial transcriptomics enable in situ scRNA-seq, profiling hundreds of genes in hundreds of thousands of cells across various tissues4,5. In situ spatial omics has revealed spatial components of cellular variations such as cell–cell communication6 and spatial gradients as well as emergent properties of tissue niches7, for example, in the mouse and human brain8,9 and liver10. We hypothesize that spatial omics data are becoming rich enough to learn a spatially aware, ‘foundational' representation of cellular variation at scale.

A foundation model is a deep learning model trained on broad data that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. These models have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing11 and computer vision12. Foundation models increasingly account for multimodal data, by leveraging not only one data modality, for example text, but also images, video and audio13. By utilizing massive datasets, powerful architectures and large compute resources, foundation models learn general representations of language, vision or domain-specific data like DNA14 and protein sequences15, outperforming classical methods. Commonly based on transformer architectures, they are pretrained on vast, unlabeled data via self-supervision, learning powerful representations by identifying patterns without human-annotated labels. These learned representations then serve as a strong base for downstream tasks, while fine-tuning on labeled data further enhances performance on specific applications.

The field of single-cell biology has taken up deep learning-based representation learning for some time, leveraging autoencoders16,17 for analysis tasks like data integration18, atlas mapping19 and perturbation prediction20. Recently, foundation models explicitly designed for single-cell genomics have emerged21,22,23,24,25. These models differ in tokenization and learning strategies, yet most of them leverage the transformer architecture with self-attention. They rely on large datasets, usually in the order of tens of millions of cells, for pretraining. The gene and cell representations learned by these models are derived from implicitly modeling the complex interplay between gene expression patterns within a single cell via the flexible transformer architecture. Single-cell foundation models are evaluated on diverse downstream tasks, such as cell-type classification22,23, gene regulatory network inference21,22 or prediction of cellular responses to perturbations21. The diversity and complexity of these tasks thoroughly probe model performance and evaluate the robustness of the learned representation and generalization ability. Current results are promising but not entirely replicated in independent benchmarks26,27,28. Notably, these models do not account for spatial relationships of cells during training, with the exception of CellPLM29, which, however, is trained on a limited dataset of 9 million dissociated and 2 million spatial transcriptomics cells and not fine-tuned on spatial tasks beyond gene imputation.

We propose Nicheformer, a foundation model pretrained on large-scale, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data to enable predictions for spatially dependent tasks that are constrained by limited training data. To learn spatial cellular representation at scale, we compiled SpatialCorpus-110M, a large curated collection of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets, spanning over 110 million cells, including 53.83 million cells that were measured using image-based spatial technologies, from both human and mouse from 73 different organs and tissues. By incorporating contextual information through modality, organism and assay tokens, Nicheformer is able to learn a joint representation of single-cell and spatial genomics. We designed a set of novel downstream tasks showing that both fine-tuned Nicheformer and a linear-probing model trained on the Nicheformer embedding systematically outperform existing foundation models, specifically Geneformer22, scGPT21 and UCE23 pretrained on dissociated data alone, foundation models trained in spatial data, specifically CellPLM29, and embedding models like scVI17 and principal-component analysis (PCA) for these tasks. We demonstrate that Nicheformer accurately transfers the spatial context identified in spatial transcriptomics onto dissociated single-cell data, allowing users to enrich nonspatial scRNA-seq data with spatial context. This work paves the way for a new generation of foundation models for learning robust representations of cellular variation in tissues.

Nicheformer is a transformer-based model pretrained on SpatialCorpus-110M, a curated collection of over 110 million cells from dissociated and spatially resolved single-cell assays (Fig. 1a). Nicheformer generalizes prior tokenization strategies22 by encoding sample covariates across technology modalities, enabling a unified framework for multimodal learning, opening up new possibilities for downstream tasks. We additionally enable learning multispecies embeddings with Nicheformer by defining orthologous genes across humans and mice (Methods), which was shown to work beneficially for cross-species biological investigations and enhanced the discovery of universal gene regulatory mechanisms30. We evaluated Nicheformer on new downstream tasks to demonstrate its ability to transfer spatially inferred cellular variation to single-cell dissociated data (Fig. 1b).

a, Nicheformer is pretrained on the SpatialCorpus-110M, a large data collection of over 110 million cells measured with dissociated and image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies. The SpatialCorpus-110M collection comprises single-cell data from Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus across 17 distinct organs and 18 cell lines, and additional single-cell data from other anatomical systems and junctions. Shown is an exemplary uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization of a random 1% subset of the entire pretraining dataset (n = 1,108,759 cells) of the non-integrated log1p-transformed normalized SpatialCorpus-110M colored by modality. b, Nicheformer includes a novel set of downstream tasks, ranging from spatial cell-type, niche and region label prediction to neighborhood cell density and neighborhood composition prediction. We test our approach on large-scale, high-quality spatial transcriptomics data from the brain (mouse, MERFISH), liver (CosMx, human), lung (CosMx, human; Xenium, human) and colon (Xenium, human). Visualized are example slices of the respective datasets colored by niche labels (brain, liver and lung) and cell density (lung and colon). c, The SpatialCorpus-110M is harmonized and mapped to orthologous gene names, as well as human and mouse-specific genes, to create the input for Nicheformer pretraining. We harmonized metadata information across all datasets, capturing species, modality and assay. d, Each cell's gene expression profile and metadata are fed into a gene-rank tokenizer to obtain a tokenized representation for each cell. The tokenized cells serve as input for the Nicheformer transformer block to predict masked tokens. Finally, the Nicheformer embedding is generated by aggregating the gene tokens (Methods). e, The pretrained Nicheformer embedding is visualized as UMAP colored by modality. The UMAP shows a random 5% subsample of the entire Nicheformer embedding (n = 4,903,086). NA, not applicable.

The Nicheformer pretraining corpus comprises transcriptomics data from both humans and mice (Fig. 1a). Only expression data were used during pretraining to train the model to integrate data from dissociated and targeted spatial technologies, both of which show substantial batch effects (Fig. 1a). A limiting factor for image-based spatial transcriptomics data is the targeted feature space, measuring only hundreds to a few thousands of genes, depending on technology and panel31. Nicheformer is pretrained across both modalities jointly to capture cross-tissue, cross-technology and cross-disease variations. For evaluation of the downstream tasks, we focused on large-scale spatial datasets from four different solid organs profiled with three image-based technologies (Fig. 1b). We fine-tuned Nicheformer or applied linear probing, extracting embeddings from the frozen model and passing them through a task-specific linear layer for classification or regression (Methods). The embedding is obtained via forward passing a specific dataset through the pretraining model to generate a lower-dimensional representation, the so-called Nicheformer embedding. The organ-specific spatial context learned by Nicheformer can then be used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize information learned from spatial transcriptomics data, without directly accounting for the available spatial context, and transfer it to dissociated data.

We define a cell as a sequence of gene expression tokens ordered by expression level relative to the mean in SpatialCorpus-110M (Fig. 1c). As the corpus includes human and mouse data, we constructed a shared vocabulary by concatenating orthologous protein-coding genes and species-specific ones, totaling 20,310 gene tokens (Fig. 1c and Methods). Each single-cell expression vector is converted into a ranked sequence of gene tokens (Fig. 1d and Methods), a strategy shown to yield embeddings robust to batch effects while preserving gene–gene relationships22. We combined all technology-specific datasets and pad missing genes. Previous works31 have demonstrably shown technology-dependent biases between spatial and dissociated transcriptomics data, with spatial data often yielding higher gene counts due to preprocessing steps32. To account for this, we computed technology-specific nonzero mean vectors—rather than a global one—by averaging nonzero gene expression values within each assay type. Dissociated assays are grouped as one technology, whereas spatial datasets are divided into multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), Xenium, CosMx and in situ sequencing (ISS) technologies. Finally, we introduced contextual tokens for species, modality and technology, enabling the model to learn their distinct characteristics. As rank-based encoding is central to our approach, we confirmed that Nicheformer embeddings remain stable under perturbations, simulating incomplete gene panels (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Methods).

Nicheformer uses a 1,500-token context length as input to an architecture with 12 transformer encoder units with 16 attention heads per layer and a feed-forward network size of 1,024, generating a 512-dimensional embedding, resulting in a total of 49.3 million parameters. This architecture performed best compared to smaller models (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and other hyperparameter configurations (Supplementary Table 1).

We confirmed technology-dependent biases between spatial and dissociated transcriptomics data through extensive pretraining experiments across different data splits (Methods). Specifically, training on dissociated data alone (even three times the amount of spatial data) resulted in lower performance across downstream tasks (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), indicating that dissociated data alone cannot capture spatial variation. Similarly, we evaluated training with only human or only mouse data. Models trained on one organism performed poorly on the missing organism but outperformed those trained on the opposite organism (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Importantly, this result is not influenced by the sheer number of cells since all models are trained with the same number of cells; the only difference is the diversity of the data. These findings are statistically significant (analysis of variance, adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR); Extended Data Fig. 2a,c) and highlight the importance of data diversity in model training for optimal performance across context33.

Current transformer-based single-cell models are used for either gene-level tasks (for example, gene regulatory networks inference, perturbation effects) or cell-level tasks (for example, cell-type annotation, batch integration)21,22,23. By incorporating dissociated and spatial scale into a single model, Nicheformer enables a new class of spatially aware tasks, where previous models primarily only focused on disassociated ones (Supplementary Table 2). These include predicting human-annotated niches, tissue regions and spatial compositions—biologically meaningful and nontrivial problems (Fig. 1b and Methods). For the spatial label prediction tasks, we also evaluated the model's uncertainty regarding the predicted labels (Methods). For spatial composition tasks, we defined a distance-based spatially homogeneous niche around each cell and asked the model to predict local density or cell-type composition. The tasks are formulated as prediction problems operating on Nicheformer's pretrained embedding (Fig. 1e), which differ from typical integrated spaces by capturing a cross-modality, cross-tissue and cross-species representation suited for downstream inference.

We evaluate Nicheformer in both linear-probing and fine-tuning settings. In both cases, a linear head is trained for the specific prediction task, with fine-tuning additionally updating the transformer's parameters. Linear probing—due to its simplicity—highlights the intrinsic biological signal captured by the learned Nicheformer embedding (Fig. 1e).

To pretrain Nicheformer, we assembled SpatialCorpus-110M—a large harmonized corpus of single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics data to date. It includes 57.06 million dissociated cells and 53.8 million spatial cells across human and mouse tissues.

The dissociated portion builds upon the CellXGene CENSUS database (33.47 million cells; Methods), which we extended by an additional 180 datasets across 73 different tissues, containing 17 solid organs, 18 cell lines and various additional tissue junctions in human and mice, with harmonized ontologies and metadata (Fig. 2a). These additional dissociated datasets have been collected through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)34, sfaira35 and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) data explorer36 (Supplementary Table 3 and Methods). Altogether, the dissociated collection of SpatialCorpus-110M comprises cells from over 6,000 different donors and technical or biological replicates.

a, The dissociated single-cell genomics data collection contains 57.06 million human and mouse cells. The collection includes cells from 17 different organs, 18 different cell lines, blood, bone elements, tissue junctions and other anatomical entities, grouped by primary solid organs to simplify visualization and analysis. b, The spatial transcriptomics data collection contains 53.83 million targeted spatially resolved cells obtained from humans and mice. The collection comprises four different profiling technologies across 15 different solid organs. c, The SpatialCollection-110M was collected with harmonized metadata defined in the Nicheformer data collection schema (Methods). Metadata were harmonized both on the gene level and on the cell level depending on modality.

For spatial transcriptomics, we curated image-based spatial datasets, specifically MERFISH37 (Vizgen MERSCOPE), 10x Genomics Xenium, Nanostring CosMx38 and ISS39 data (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 4), sourced from publications as well as via the Vizgen data release40 (18.8%) and the 10x Genomics data resource41 (13.7%). It covers 15 tissues from 158 individuals or animals and over 10,600 tissue sections. Most cells originated from the brain (60.46%, n = 32,146,779 cells) and the lung (9.95%, n = 3,199,548 cells). A large proportion of the publicly available spatial omics datasets we collected are not annotated (55.23%). We included both healthy samples (64.07%) and cancer samples (31.98%) to enable Nicheformer to learn tumor–immune microenvironment contexts.

For all datasets in the SpatialCorpus-110M, we curated metadata, such as assay, sex, organism and tissue, based on the original publications by using official ontology term identifiers (Fig. 2c and Methods). To harmonize features across species, tissues and assays, we first converted all gene symbols to ENSEMBL gene IDs using pyEnsemble42. Then we used BioMart43 through the official Ensembl releases44 to match orthologous genes between species, yielding 20,310 unique gene tokens: 16,981 orthologous, 151 mouse-specific and 3,178 human-specific genes.

Importantly, we did not integrate datasets into a unified latent space. Our goal was to preserve biological and technical variability while offering a large-scale resource for model training. Like CellXGene, SpatialCorpus-110M provides curated raw inputs, allowing researchers to choose their own normalization and integration strategies.

Understanding the internal mechanisms of transformer models helps uncover whether their attention patterns reflect biologically meaningful features. We investigated Nicheformer's attention matrices with two objectives: (1) to examine if its layers develop generalizable structures across tissues and modalities, and (2) to test whether attention reflects biological variation.

To assess general layer organization, we analyzed attention across all heads and layers for 2,000 cells from multiple datasets in SpatialCorpus-110M: male and female MERFISH mouse brain samples8, the liver and lung CosMx datasets38 used for downstream tasks (Methods) and a scRNA-seq measured brain dissociated dataset9 (Methods). Our analysis suggests a hierarchical division across Nicheformer's layers: early layers distribute their attention more broadly, with no clear prioritization of individual tokens; middle layers exhibit a sharp attention toward specific genes (Fig. 3b), likely capturing biologically relevant relationships; and final layers consistently focus on contextual tokens (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). This structured pattern of attention is robust across all analyzed tissues and modalities, indicating that Nicheformer learns a hierarchical representation that generalizes beyond a single dataset. We confirmed significance with a Mann–Whitney U-test comparing attention distributions (corrected with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR; Extended Data Fig. 3c,d).

Source data

At head level, some attention heads maintain consistent functional roles across tissues and modalities, such as prioritizing highly expressed genes, regardless of whether the dataset originates from brain, liver, lung or dissociated cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Others varied by modality, suggesting modality-specific specialization (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We also observed heads with strong self-attention patterns (visualize as strong diagonal attention scores), while some show off-diagonal patterns, likely reflecting coexpression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). These findings highlight the diverse range of attention behaviors that Nicheformer develops when processing complex biological data. These observations echo findings in large language models, where specific attention heads acquire well-defined functions, such as induction heads that detect repeated patterns in sequences45 or successor heads that track sequential dependencies46. While mechanistic interpretability in biological foundation models is still in its early stages, our results suggest that Nicheformer exhibits a similar specialization, with certain heads consistently attending to biologically relevant features across datasets.

Understanding biological variation across conditions is central to single-cell analysis. We assessed whether Nicheformer captures meaningful biological variations—in this case, sex-specific patterns—in these attention mechanisms by analyzing attention patterns in male and female MERFISH mouse brain datasets from the SpatialCorpus110-M8 (Fig. 3c–e). Both datasets share common coordinate framework (CCFv3)47 annotations, allowing for tagged analysis of the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), known for sex-dependent morphology and gene expression48.

We analyzed all attention matrices from 2,000 AVPV cells per sex, focusing on ten genes previously reported as sexually dimorphic49,50,51, and comparing the attention paid to the predefined set of genes against the attention paid to 100 randomly selected genes. We do the analysis both for all cells in the AVPV section and for just HY GABA cells, a small population of cells in the AVPV that modulate the firing of the different glutamatergic neurons in the AVPV that stimulate the synthesis of gonadotropins52. We identify key differences between the male and female cells (Fig. 3f,g). The first eight layers had the greatest average attention differences for both sexually dimorphic genes (SDGs) and 100 random genes not directly linked to sex-specific differences in the brain (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). In contrast, layers nine and ten show high maximal attention value differences for SDGs, when performing differential testing on the attention weights between those two groups, especially for HY GABA cells (Fig. 3h,i). This suggests that specific attention heads in these layers capture subtle sex-specific cues. The contrast between the average and the maximum attention difference indicates that the sex differences are captured by a subset of the attention heads, with at least one of the 16 attention heads showing a stronger focus. This contrast between the average and the maximum difference in attention also holds for genes in the random set (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). Furthermore, six of the ten genes with the highest attention differences between sexes (Adgrf5, Nfib, Pou6f2, Rgs4, Serpine2, Spock3) have not previously been reported to have sexually dimorphic expression in the brain and some were not differentially expressed between the male and female brain section (Fig. 3i), yet they play roles in development, G-protein-coupled receptor regulation or the extracellular matrix—functions relevant to AVPV biology in which we expect to see sex differences. These effects are likely due to interaction patterns with both known dimorphic genes and others not included in the panel (for example, Kiss1, Gnrh, Esr1). Notably, Nicheformer's ranked tokenization and attention mechanisms enable robust differentiation without requiring matching expression depth, highlighting a key strength of the model.

Dissociated single-cell atlases excel at mapping cell-type diversity, typically defined by stable molecular states across tissues. However, cell types are defined ignoring the spatial context, which provides additional value for understanding cellular microenvironments53. Spatially resolved single-cell genomics allows us to augment cell-type definitions by incorporating neighborhood gene expression and histological structure, defining cell niches. These are spatially dependent, local tissue structures (for example, immune or tumor niches), often nested within broader tissue regions, which reflect higher-order spatial organization.

Transferring labels between dissociated and spatial data is challenging due to limited gene overlap54, and modality-specific methods are not designed to learn from reference atlases at the scale of hundreds of million of cells. Nicheformer addresses this by leveraging the SpatialCorpus-110M to enable scalable annotation transfer.

We evaluated Nicheformer on a large MERFISH mouse brain dataset8, where 17 different brain regions and 8 distinct tissue niches (Fig. 3a) are labeled (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). We tested linear probing—linear head over the frozen Nicheformer embeddings (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f)—and fine-tuning approaches for both labels for unseen, held-out tissue sections from the MERFISH mouse brain dataset, measuring one male mouse brain (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Compared to embeddings from PCA and scVI (trained on either the brain dataset or subsets of SpatialCorpus-110M; Methods), and to foundation models (Geneformer, scGPT, UCE, CellPLM), Nicheformer achieved the highest macro F1 scores (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). While PCA with a large number of components offers a good performance, practically on par with using a linear probe on top of Nicheformer's representations, or even surpassing it in the case of region prediction, it still fell short of the fine-tuned Nicheformer model (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). The differences between Nicheformer and competitors were statistically significant as derived from t-tests between Nicheformer and the best-performing comparison method (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b).

Additionally, the deep cortical excitatory neurons L6b, L6 CT, L6 IT, and L6 IT Car3 (highlighted in the red box) should be classified as pallium glutamatergic niche instead of subpallium GABAergic by Nicheformer. g, Most of the non-neuronal cells (84.7% of all non-neuronal cells, n = 133) were misclassified as not belonging to the isocortex or the adjacent brain regions (highlighted in the red box). h, Cell-type abundances in the scRNA-seq dataset measuring the primary motor cortex in the mouse. i–k, Classification uncertainty of label transfer of the dissociated scRNA-seq dataset to the MERFISH mouse brain data for cell-type label (i), niche label (j) and region label (k) with a value of 0 representing a high uncertainty and 1 being a lower uncertainty, that is, high certainty. k, Observed high uncertainty for parts of the Glut and GABA neurons for the region prediction of the isocortex, CTXsp and OLF, which are neighboring brain regions.

We performed a similar analysis on a randomly held-out test set of the CosMx human liver dataset defining tissue niches as different zonations between the central and portal veins (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). Again, fine-tuned Nicheformer led in terms of macro F1 score. However, linear probing underperformed compared to scVI and PCA trained on the training set of the liver dataset (Extended Data Fig. 8f). We hypothesized that this is related to the insufficient model capacity due to limitations regarding a relatively low overall abundance in the SpatialCorpus-110M (Fig. 2a,b). Extended pretraining on liver data improved performance, suggesting undertrained tissues can benefit from additional fine-tuning (Extended Data Fig. 8f). Surprisingly, we observed that in Nicheformer models trained with just ~1% data, there was no such a drop in performance. Additionally, we observed that the model trained on a smaller dissociated subset (1%) performed slightly better than one trained on a larger subset (3%), which also supports the hypothesis that ‘compute per sample' is important (Supplementary Note 1).

We next assessed label transfer between spatial and dissociated data, using Nicheformer to map MERFISH-defined cell types to scRNA-seq motor cortex cells (Fig. 4c,d)9. We find that Nicheformer correctly selects the nine motor cortex-related cell types of the overall 33 cell types present in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8I). When calculating classification uncertainty based on the overall predicted distribution generated by the model (Methods), the predicted cell-type labels show overall a high agreement and low classification uncertainty (Fig. 4e,I) with the original cell-type annotations. Mostly, all cell types were correctly matched, independently of their abundance in the cell dissociated dataset (Fig. 4h). Some deep-layer glutamatergic neurons were misclassified as midbrain glutamatergic, possibly due to transcriptional heterogeneity and subtype imbalance in MERFISH data. For niche labels, Nicheformer correctly predicted all expected assignments with low uncertainty for non-neuronal and inhibitory neurons, but higher uncertainty for excitatory subtypes (Fig. 4f,j and Extended Data Fig. 8j). Misclassifications likely stem from overlapping spatial structures. For region labels, most cells were correctly predicted as isocortex (Fig. 4g,k and Extended Data Fig. 8k). Some spillover into adjacent regions (for example, cortical subplate (CTXsp) and olfactory areas (OLF)) may reflect tissue dissection artifacts. Region prediction was slightly worse for non-neuronal cells, likely due to their lower transcriptional diversity. For extended detailed analysis, consult Supplementary Note 2.

Altogether, this demonstrates Nicheformer's ability to learn powerful cell representations by capturing nuanced spatial information. Linear probing already surpasses existing baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the representation. Fine-tuning further refines this representation, emphasizing the importance of task-specific adaptation for capturing subtle cellular variations. Notably, Nicheformer enables the direct transfer of spatially aware annotations from spatial to dissociated single-cell data by using a simple linear layer. This capability unlocks new possibilities for analyzing single-cell data across different modalities.

Tissue microenvironments consist of cellular neighborhoods with a diverse composition of cell types. Differences in neighborhood composition have been shown to have an important effect on gene expression and can be associated with cell–cell communication events6. Furthermore, the cellular composition of neighborhoods in the tumor microenvironment may hold prognostic value, because immune cell infiltration in the spatial context is a predictor for cancer survival55. Here we show that we can leverage Nicheformer's multimodal cell representation to accurately relate changes in gene expression to differences in neighborhood compositions in spatial data and transfer them to dissociated transcriptomes.

We define a cell's ‘computational' neighborhood as the set of cells within a fixed radius (Fig. 5a and Methods). The total number of cells composing the neighborhood defines the neighborhood density, and the proportion of cell types in the neighborhood defines the neighborhood composition. This notion is consistent with previous approaches defining a cellular neighborhood56 and allows for an interpretable evaluation of model results. Generally, the definition of a cell neighborhood can be extended in the future to account for non-isotropic cell neighborhoods that might vary in their cell-type composition and are drivers of similar biological functions with varying sizes across a dataset.

a, We define the neighborhood of a cell as its local neighborhood given a radius and an index cell. The neighborhood cell density is then defined by the number of cells in the neighborhood, and the neighborhood compositions are the proportions of neighboring cell types. b, Neighborhoods are computed at multiple resolutions resulting in different neighborhood size distributions. Each barplot shows the distribution of the number of neighbors across the brain, liver and lung datasets. We extract neighborhoods with the mean number of neighbors 10, 20, 50 and 100 for each dataset. Neighborh., neighborhood. c, The fine-tuned and linear-probing Nicheformer models outperform for brain and lung linear-probing models trained on Geneformer, scGPT, scVI and PCA embeddings in terms of mean absolute error across all neighborhood sizes. Still, it struggles to outperform all benchmarks in liver, where scVI models are very competitive. This is an issue related to the previous liver performance reported in the previous section (Extended Data Figs. 2a and 8f). d, Left, Fine-tuned Nicheformer performance on the MERFISH mouse brain data grouped by index cell type.

To evaluate Nicheformer's ability to predict neighborhood composition, we focused on three datasets measuring three organs with two different technologies, namely MERFISH mouse brain, CosMx human liver and CosMx human lung. We computed neighborhood compositions at varying resolutions for each of the three datasets separately. The radii were selected to contain, on average, 10, 20, 50 or 100 neighbors (Fig. 5b and Methods). We evaluated Nicheformer both in linear-probing and fine-tuned settings for each dataset and each neighborhood size individually and compared its performance to linear probing on embeddings computed with scVI, PCA, Geneformer and scGPT. We found that fine-tuned Nicheformer systematically outperformed the linear-probing models trained on Nicheformer embedding, Geneformer, scGPT, scVI and PCA, independently of the number of principal components used, even though PCA's performance notably improves with more principal components (Extended Data Fig. 7a,c,d), for this task on all three organs in terms of mean absolute error. Likewise, for UCE and CellPLM, which we evaluated by training a linear layer on their embeddings, we also found that linear probing with Nicheformer outperformed both methods across all three datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c,d). Statistical tests (t-test) to assess the statistical significance of the results were performed, with positive results (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c,d). Notably, the linear-probing models trained on Nicheformer embeddings also outperformed all other methods, except for the fine-tuned Nicheformer (Fig. 5c). However, for bigger radius sizes in the liver dataset, the scVI models trained in a subset of SpatialCorpus-110M performed on par with fine-tuned Nicheformer. We believe this to be related to the previous classification results in the same dataset (Extended Data Fig. 8f). Interestingly, Nicheformer's performance increased with neighborhood size in the case of the brain datasets. In the liver, we observed a stronger performance trend, which might be related to transcriptional patterns of zonation and structural components in the liver57. For the CosMx liver dataset, we additionally evaluated whether a multitask multilayer perceptron (MLP) would allow the prediction of all neighborhood sizes jointly (Methods). We observed that a multitask MLP did not outperform a neighborhood size-specific linear-probing model or the fine-tuned Nicheformer model, indicating that downstream tasks should be evaluated separately (Extended Data Fig. 8g).

To understand the model's behavior and performance in more detail, we additionally assessed the fine-tuned Nicheformer performance for each cell type separately in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset (Fig. 5d and Methods). We computed the absolute error between predicted and true neighborhood compositions across all four neighborhood sizes and sorted the result based on the median values per cell type. We found that the most accurately predicted cell types in terms of absolute error are also within the 8 (of 33) most abundant cell types in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset. In contrast, the 4 cell types for which Nicheformer performed worse are in the 14 least abundant cell types (Fig. 5d). For example, highly abundant cell types predominantly from cortical layers (IT-ET Glut, NP-CT-L6b Glut) are structurally organized in the brain and have a quite homogeneous neighborhood composition. Those two factors help to explain the very accurate Nicheformer predictions. Similarly, CB Glut cells are based in the cerebellum, an area with very high cell density58 and high neighborhood homogeneity. Even though they have a lower abundance in the overall dataset, Nicheformer accurately predicted their neighborhood composition (Fig. 5d). On the other hand, Nicheformer shows a lower performance on cell types predominantly found in the midbrain or hypothalamus (MB GABA, MB, Dopa, HY Glut, Hy MM Glut). These cell types are relatively rare cell types in the given dataset and are located in more diverse and complex tissue layouts and show a greater variety of neighboring cell types8. This indicates that regionally diverse and less abundant cell types in the pretraining corpus are harder to predict for the Nicheformer model. The performance differences might be related to the structural properties of the brain regions as well as their varying cell-type compositions and abundance in the dataset. We further observed a relatively good performance of Nicheformer for the neighborhood composition prediction of immune cells, despite their relatively low abundance and their lack of regional specificity in the brain. Immune cells are scattered across the brain and accomplish very specific but differing tasks ranging from regulating synaptic plasticity, and immune surveillance, to preventing excitotoxicity59. Interestingly, the Nicheformer embedding of the immune cells in the MERFISH mouse brain data preserves the regional information of those cells and region-specific subclusters can be identified (Fig. 5e).

To assess whether our results generalize across organs and technologies, we performed a similar analysis for the CosMx human liver dataset, evaluating the overall cell-type performance in the task of predicting the neighborhood composition across resolutions (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Again, we observed that Nicheformer's performance heavily depends on the cell-type abundance in the dataset and the regional specificity of the individual cells, for example, we saw a lower absolute error for hepatocytes compared to circulating immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Hepatocytes are predominantly found in highly structured cellular microenvironments and show strong spatial patterns in their gene expression60, while liver-resident immune cell populations were shown to be mobilized under certain circumstances, hence their regional specificity might be lower compared to other cell types61. This indicates that the Nicheformer embeddings can be useful to identify and understand region-specific and niche-specific structures and differentiate cell types that show a higher regional specificity.

Beyond cellular niche labels and neighborhood composition, we asked whether local cell density is encoded in a cell's expression profile. It is long known that cell density can strongly affect growth behavior in vivo and in culture; also, increased cell density is a key feature of the formation of the tumor microenvironment, which leads to the creation of a hypoxic environment and depletion of infiltrating immune cell populations62. For example, in colon cancer, it was shown that the immune cell density is associated with patient survival and can be used for tumor–immune patient stratification for improved anticancer therapy63. In non-small-cell lung cancer64, immune cell density and neighborhood compositions were used to stratify specimens into groups associated with clinical outcomes.

We tested whether Nicheformer accurately predicts the neighborhood density in a Xenium lung dataset measuring an adult human healthy lung section and a section with invasive adenocarcinoma from a second patient65, and in a Xenium formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded-preserved healthy and diseased colon with stage 2A adenocarcinoma from two different patients65. Consistent with literature observations63,64, we observed a higher average cellular density in the cancer sections (colon, 12.3 cells; lung, 12.1 cells) compared to healthy tissue (colon, 10.7 cells; lung, 10.7 cells) when extracting cellular neighborhoods at the same radius (Fig. 6a,f and Methods).

Source data

We first computed Nicheformer embeddings for both datasets by generating a forward pass through the Nicheformer pretrained model (Fig. 6b,g). Additionally, we embedded the two datasets with scVI, and PCA (Methods). The three resulting embeddings for the datasets were then used as input for a linear-probing regression model to predict the cellular neighborhood density for each cell. The linear-probing models trained on the scVI and PCA embeddings failed to correctly predict the mean density and performed worse than random prediction, resulting in negative R2 values for both tissues. Interestingly, the linear-probing model trained on the Nicheformer embedding outperformed the other two models in terms of mean absolute error and R2 (Fig. 6c,h) and was able to accurately predict a higher cellular density in the tumor regions and denser tissue structures in the Xenium lung dataset (Fig. 6d). This demonstrates that the Nicheformer embeddings are able to capture neighborhood density variation solely on transcriptome information better than the baselines. Nicheformer's ability to infer cellular neighborhood density in healthy tissue and cancer tissue can be useful to inject spatial relationship information in dissociated data to further characterize cell-state variation in systems such as the tumor microenvironment.

Nicheformer demonstrates the potential of multiscale foundation models for dissociated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. By leveraging the SpatialCorpus-110M and evaluating the model in different spatially informed downstream tasks and assessing the model's prediction uncertainty, we demonstrate that Nicheformer captures complex relationships between gene expression and spatial context. We introduce a newly designed set of downstream tasks designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, in which Nicheformer consistently outperforms baseline models, including foundational models trained only on scRNA-seq data such as GeneFormer, UCE and scGPT, and also models trained on spatial data such as CellPLM, highlighting its effectiveness in learning a cell representation that is able to predict spatial features and the need to train on multiscale and diverse datasets to capture the intricate spatial relationships present in tissue organization. These results strongly suggest that spatial context can be effectively inferred from transcriptomics data using Nicheformer. To further understand how Nicheformer processes information, we analyzed its attention mechanism, finding that different layers attend to distinct features. We identified specific attention heads that remain robust across modalities and tissues, as well as others that adapt to these variations. We also explored how Nicheformer captures biological conditions through its attention patterns. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of the performance of models pretrained on different data subsets to evaluate the impact of various modalities and organisms on its performance. Our results highlight that broad coverage in training data is essential for achieving robust performance across diverse contexts. Further, Nicheformer paves the way for transferring spatial information to large collections of dissociated single-cell data, which opens the door for more nuanced analyses of cellular function in the tissue environment in silico.

A cell integrates its spatial context, that is, its cellular neighborhood by cell interaction and communication, which is reflected in the cell's transcriptomic profile. This property has been used successfully to learn cell-type communication profiles from coexpressed receptor–ligand interactions66, to reconstruct spatial gene expression from spatial context and anchor points using optimal transport67,68 and to determine cell interactions beyond known receptor–ligands via graph neural networks56. With Nicheformer, we build upon these results and show that we can predict spatial context from a cell's gene expression profiles alone with consistent accuracy. We found that, for example, immune cell neighborhoods in the brain are most likely encoded in the gene expression profiles, making it easier for Nicheformer to understand these differences and relate them to neighborhood composition changes. Extending this analysis to additional tissues has the potential to characterize recurrent immune niches across tissues and organs.

A long-term vision in systems biology has been to create multiscale models, from molecules and cells up to tissue, organs and eventually the whole organism. Nicheformer represents a step toward creating a generalizable multiscale model for single-cell and spatial biology, bridging the gap from the single-cell to the tissue modality. More generally, it will be necessary to operate on multimodal data to generate a true representation of the cellular state. While spatial transcriptomics captures the cellular microenvironment in tissues well, integrating additional data modalities, such as protein abundance or epigenetic modifications, will provide a more complete picture of the cellular state. The development of multimodal foundation models faces multiple challenges. One key hurdle is the lack of sufficient paired data measured across multiple or even all cellular modalities. However, with the development of new assays and sequencing technologies, we expect the number of multimodal datasets to grow, enabling the development of architectures to model them. Incorporating additional modalities will remain a challenge in the future as, for example, epigenetic modifications, protein abundance and gene expression all have unique characteristics, and effectively combining them in a way that leverages their strengths remains an ongoing research area.

While Nicheformer represents a process for learning general representations for single-cell biology, we acknowledge some limitations of this approach. Firstly, Nicheformer performance depends on the data abundance and transcriptional diversity of the cells under study. Indeed, we showed that Nicheformer's performance for predicting spatial labels and spatial compositions is impacted by cell-type and tissue-type abundance in a spatial transcriptomics dataset. With the ongoing growth in spatial transcriptomics data availability as well as improved throughput thanks to technological advances, we expect that the prediction performance will improve across evaluated tissues. Secondly, Nicheformer does not explicitly incorporate the physical location of a cell during pretraining, limiting its capability to fully leverage the available information on spatial context. We deliberately chose not to include spatial coordinates during pretraining because we wanted to learn a general representation of gene expression variation across both modalities, fully supervised by gene expression alone. Nevertheless, we anticipate that future iterations of Nicheformer will account for spatial relationships of cells by encoding spatial neighbor graphs, for example, and potentially leveraging graph transformer architectures69 for the pretraining stage on spatial transcriptomics data. Graph transformers excel at modeling relationships between nodes in graphs, making them ideal for capturing nearest-neighbor effects on a cell's transcriptome. Thirdly, the interpretability of the Nicheformer model has not been fully explored. In future iterations, it would be interesting to inspect the learned architecture in order to understand interactions between genes within cells and niches to extract biological mechanistic knowledge, for example, by assessing how gene relationships are associated with cell state across the two modalities under consideration. Additionally, the current strategy excludes metadata tokens from the final cell representation to avoid bias from their high norm (Methods), which can impede label transfer. However, this may limit model expressivity by discarding these tokens entirely. More refined strategies, such as selective integration, could retain relevant context without allowing it to dominate the embedding. We additionally see a need to scale Nicheformer in the number of parameters, pretraining time and dataset size. Characterizing scaling laws for foundation models in genomics has the potential to identify bottlenecks in learning schemes and datasets, thus informing design and pretraining choices for the next generation of models. Finally, we want to highlight the need for more comprehensive benchmarks than the set of spatial tasks presented here, which will help judge extensions and future alternative models. The field of biological foundation models is a novel area brimming with potential. However, unlike more established AI domains, there's a crucial gap in the form of standardized benchmarks for evaluating these models. Establishing robust benchmarks is a critical next step to compare and improve performance, rigorously assess methodological progress and guide future model development to unleash the full potential of foundation models for single-cell biology.

Overall, Nicheformer demonstrates the feasibility of learning a foundational representation able to effectively transfer information from single-cell to spatial genomics and its reverse, paving the way for the next generation of foundation models trained on large heterogeneous collections of dissociated and spatial single-cell data. We describe a set of newly designed evaluations that are explicitly for probing the model's ability to encode spatial context and its transferability to a different modality that can be leveraged as a new benchmark for multimodal foundation models for single-cell and spatial genomics. We believe Nicheformer represents an important progress toward building a general and robust representation of cellular biology phenotypes advancing our understanding of the heterogeneous effects of cellular niches in development and disease. We envision Nicheformer and similar models to actively assist in experimental design through hypothesis generation and experiment selection, ultimately accelerating the pace of scientific progress by helping to choose the next set of most informative experiments. Nicheformer will thus help to guide and design spatial experiments based on scRNA-seq measurements, supporting the upcoming transition from cell to tissue atlases.

We collected and combined dissociated single-cell and single-nucleus data from the latest patch of CellXGene70, 50 additional curated studies available through the sfaira data zoo35, 150 datasets acquired through the GEO data repository34,71 and 4 datasets from the HCA data explorer72.

For the data originating from CellXGene, we used the CZ CellXGene Discover Census70 v.2023-07-15 and its Python API to download the latest batch of all data available on the census. The CZ CellXGene Discover Census only contains cells from human or mouse, as well as only gene expression measurements obtained via RNA-seq. We additionally only downloaded primary data that were marked with the respective identifier in the Census to ensure that cells are not represented multiple times in our collection. Subsequently, we downloaded the entire cell and gene metadata as well as the raw counts and stored them as H5AD on disk. For additional data acquisition, firstly, we selected human and mouse 10x Genomics technology datasets not present in the latest CellXGene patch from the sfaira data zoo35 and excluded datasets without publicly available raw count matrices. We then downloaded the selected data through the sfaira interface, removed any cells with less than 200 expressed genes, streamlined the feature space of each dataset to Ensembl release 104 (GRCh38) protein-coding genes, applied sfaira metadata streamlining, and applied the Nicheformer metadata scheme. We stored the data for each study from sfaira as individual H5AD objects on disk.

Secondly, for the acquisition from the GEO data repository, we focused on GEO IDs previously included in the recent scsimilarity25 preprint publication. After cross-checking this list with the other used data sources to avoid duplicated data, we acquired the necessary metadata from the GEO website and the corresponding publications. We downloaded the count matrices, converted the various data formats into AnnData format and combined them with the collected metadata to save them as individual H5AD objects on disk. We curated ontology term identifiers for species based on the ontology representation of the NCBI organismal taxonomy (NCBITaxon)73, tissue based on the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon)74,75, sex based on the ontology of phenotypic qualities (PATO)76,77 and assay based on the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)78. All ontology terms were obtained through the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)79.

Lastly, we followed the same approach for the four HCA data explorer36 datasets as for the GEO datasets. To make the dataset acquisition process reproducible and available to the community, we have shared scripts for downloading and standardizing all datasets. All data collection-related code can be found at https://github.com/theislab/nicheformer-data/. We additionally implemented a validator to streamline the verification process, ensuring alignment between metadata formats and the data collection schema. A detailed list and overview table of all datasets containing GEO ID, DOI, the number of cells, tissue, assay and author information can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

The spatial part of the SpatialCorpus-110M consists of datasets measured with image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies, namely CosMx, ISS, MERFISH and 10x Xenium. We collected 60 different datasets across 15 different solid organs. Most of the spatial data collection was collected via the Vizgen data release40, the 10x Genomics data resource41 and the CosMx data resource38. The remaining datasets were collected through the data resources stated in the original publications. Unpublished datasets were obtained before publication via the original authors. Each dataset was downloaded and stored as individual H5AD files. For each dataset, we collected expression data and associated gene-level and cell-level metadata, but high-resolution images and segmentation masks were not collected and curated. We curated ontology term identifiers for species based on the ontology representation of the NCBI organismal taxonomy (NCBITaxon)73, tissue based on the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon)74,75, sex based on the ontology of phenotypic qualities (PATO)76,77 and assay based on the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)78. All ontology terms were obtained through the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)79. For Xenium and CosMx assays, official ontology terms are not yet defined, so we replaced them with placeholders. For datasets that did not provide Ensembl gene identifiers, we used pyEnsembl42 with the Ensembl release 104 (GRCh38) to map gene names to Ensembl gene identifiers and subsequently BioMart43 through the official Ensembl releases44 for mapping mouse genes to orthologous gene identifiers. Scripts for acquiring the spatial data are also shared in our GitHub repository. We used the same validator as used for the dissociated datasets to streamline the verification process of the collected metadata. We applied no additional quality control, gene-level or cell-level filtering for the spatial omics datasets beyond the filters applied by the original authors of the publications or the filters automatically applied by the individual spatial transcriptomics technologies. A detailed list and overview table containing the GEO ID, DOI, the number of cells, tissue, assay and author information for the spatial datasets can be found in Supplementary Table 4.

Publicly available datasets used for downstream tasks and evaluations were collected in the same way as the other spatial transcriptomics datasets present in the SpatialCorpus-110M. As most of our downstream tasks require cell-type, niche and region label annotations, we focused primarily on annotated and large-scale spatial transcriptomics datasets. We provide a detailed description of those datasets below.

Yao et al.8 measured 4.3 million cells across 59 tissue sections from one whole male mouse brain using MERFISH with a 500-gene panel. This dataset contains a hierarchical cell-type annotation structured into four nested levels of annotation. We used the ‘class_label' field with 33 distinct cell types as input for the Nicheformer niche regression task (Extended Data Fig. 3c), the ‘division_id' label, containing seven distinct labels (CBX-MOB-other neuronal, immune, low quality (LQ), neuroglial, PAL-sAMY-TH-HY-MB-HB neuronal, pallium glutamatergic, subpallium GABAergic, vascular) as niche labels (Extended Data Fig. 5b), and the ‘clean_region_label' field, containing 17 distinct labels (CB, CTXsp, HB, HIP, HY, isocortex, LSX, MB, OLF, PAL, retrohippocampal region, dorsal striatum, ventral striatum, TH, sAMY, ventricle, white_matter) as the region label (Extended Data Fig. 5a) for the Nicheformer label prediction tasks. The tissue niches represent the cellular organization in the brain, grouping together neurons by major brain structure (pallium, subpallium, hypothalamus/extended amygdala, thalamus/epiphysis and midbrain/hindbrain), as well as major neurotransmitter type (glutamate and GABA)8. Non-neuronal cells are grouped into neuroglial, immune and vascular niches. The train–test split defined for this dataset is composed of a random image or tissue section hold-out across all sections in the measured entire male mouse brain (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c).

We collected the CosMx human liver dataset from the publicly available CosMx data resource38. The dataset comprises cells from both a normal healthy liver measuring 332,877 cells across 301 fields of view covering one tissue section in a male 35-year-old patient, as well as cells from a hepatocellular carcinoma measuring 460,441 cells across 383 fields of view in one tissue section from a 65-year-old female patient. Both samples were measured with the 1000-plex CosMx Human Universal Cell Characterization Panel. The dataset includes both cell-type and niche labels. For the niche label prediction task, we used the healthy liver section, which provides six distinct labels defining structural zones in the liver: portal vein (zone 1a), zone 1b, zone 2a, zone 2b, zone 3a and central vein (zone 3b; Extended Data Fig. 8b,d). We did not use the cancer liver sample for the niche label prediction task as it was primarily composed of cells annotated as a general tumor niche without further substructures provided. For the niche composition prediction task, we used both the cancer and healthy liver sections with the cell-type labels, which define 22 distinct cell types (antibody-secreting B cells, CD3+ alpha beta T cells, central venous liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, erythroid cells, Hep, Hep 1, Hep 3, Hep 4, Hep 5, Hep 6, inflammatory macrophages, mature B cells, natural killer (NK)-like cells, non-inflammatory macrophages, periportal liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, portal endothelial cells, stellate cells, gamma delta T cells 1, tumor 1, tumor 2 and an undefined type (NotDet; Extended Data Fig. 8e). The train–test split defined for this dataset is composed of a random field of view hold-out across both tissue sections (Extended Data Fig. 8a,d).

We collected the CosMx human lung dataset from the publicly available CosMx data resource38. This dataset contains samples from five different donors (301,611, 89,975, 227,110, 71,304 and 81,236 cells, respectively) across eight fields of view measured with the 1000-plex CosMx Human Universal Cell Characterization Panel. All donors have just one field of view, except for the first donor, which has three fields of view, and the third donor, which has two fields of view. The train–test split defined for this dataset is composed of a random field of view hold-out (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). CosMx provides both cell-type and niche labels. We use the 22 distinct cell-type labels defined in this dataset for the niche composition prediction task. These labels are B cell, NK, T CD4 memory, T CD4 naive, T CD8 memory, T CD8 naive, regulatory T, endothelial, epithelial, fibroblast, myeloid dendritic cell, macrophage, mast, monocyte, neutrophil, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, plasmablast, tumor 12, tumor 13, tumor 5, tumor 6 and tumor 9 (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

We collected the Xenium human lung dataset from the 10x Genomics data resource (https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/). This dataset measures two different lung sections, an adult human healthy lung (295,883 cells) and an adult human lung with invasive adenocarcinoma (531,165 cells). Both sections are measured with the 289-plex Xenium Human Lung Gene Expression Panel and an additional 100 lung cell-type-specific genes. As this dataset is not annotated, we only use it for the neighborhood density prediction task. We computed a spatial graph of cells with a radius of 25 µm² to calculate the cellular niche densities. The train–test split defined for this dataset is a random cell hold-out across all cells from both sections.

We collected the Xenium human colon dataset from the 10x Genomics data resource (https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/). This dataset measures two different colon formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded-preserved tissue sections: a non-diseased colon (275,822 cells) and a cancer stage 2A adenocarcinoma (587,115 cells). Both sections are measured with the 325-plex Xenium Human Colon Gene Expression Panel and an additional 100 genes specifically selected to cover signaling and chemokine genes, and markers for stromal cells. As again this dataset is not annotated, we only use it for the neighborhood density prediction task. We computed a spatial graph of cells with a radius of 17 µm² in both sections to calculate the cellular niche densities. The train–test split defined for this dataset is a random cell hold-out across all cells from both sections.

Yao et al. generated a large-scale transcriptomic and epigenetic atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex9. We subsetted this large-scale dataset to cells measured with 10x v3 scRNA-seq. The subset captures 21,884 genes in 7,416 cells and annotates 19 different cell types (Astro, Endo, L5 ET, L5 IT, L6 CT, L6 IT, L6 IT Car3, L6b, L2/3 IT, L5/6 NP, Lamp5, microglia, OPC, oligo, Pvalb, Sncg, Sst, CLMC and Vip; Fig. 3c). We manually transferred cell types present in this dataset to the cell types measured in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset. We mapped Astro to Astro-Epen; Endo and VLMC to vascular; microglia to immune; oligo and OPC to oligo; L6 IT, L6 IT Car3, L5 IT, L2/3 IT, L5 ET to IT-ET Glut; L5/6 NP, L6b and L6 CT to NP-CT-L6b Glut; and Lamp5, Sncg, Vip Pvalb and Sst to CGE/MGE GABA, respectively.

The Nicheformer training corpus encompasses over 110 million cells in total, measured in more than 350 datasets using eight different sequencing technologies and two species: human and mouse. The total number of genes considered is 20,310, comprising 16,981 orthologous, 3,178 human-specific and 151 mouse-specific genes. For Nicheformer, we use a tokenization strategy similar to the one in Geneformer22 with the difference that the cell transcripts are normalized according to the technology-specific nonzero mean to account for differences in the sequencing protocol. First, all cells are normalized so that each of them has 10,000 counts. To account for technological variations, we then compute a technology-specific gene expression nonzero mean vector, that is, the mean expression value of each gene, without considering the zero counts. We computed a single dissociated mean expression vector for the dissociated datasets because the differences between sequencing protocols in the dissociated cells are not as large as in the spatial assays. We then normalize the expression of each cell using the corresponding technology-specific mean expression vector to obtain the expression of each gene in each cell relative to the whole training corpus. Finally, the genes are ranked in descending order, from most to least expressed, excluding all non-expressed genes, creating an ordered set \(T\) of genes as given by equation (1):

where \({\rm{idx}}({ge}{x}_{i})\) is a function that returns the index of gene i in a previously defined vocabulary of genes and \({\rm{ge}{x}}_{i}\) is the gene expression of gene i of a cell. To incorporate the influence of biological context on gene expression, we prepend contextual tokens for <ASSAY>, <MODALITY> and <ORGANISM> to the set \(T\) to incorporate metadata information to the input data. These tokens encode metadata information, such as assay type (for example, MERFISH, CosMx and 10x 5′ v2), modality (dissociated or spatial) and organism (mouse or human). Recognizing the important impact biological context can have on gene expression, we augment the input sequences for our transformer model with modality, organism and assay tokens. This approach allows the model to explicitly learn representations that account for context-driven variations, leading to more robust and generalizable downstream analyses. Therefore, for a cell i, with a specific assay, organism and modality, the ordered set of tokens \({T}^{i}\) is shown in equation (2):

As a last step, the length of the set \({T}^{i}\) is truncated to \(N\) = 1,500. As not all cells have the same number of expressed genes, there might be sets whose total length is lower than 1,500. In those cases, <PAD> tokens are appended such that the final length is \(N\) = 1,500. <PAD> tokens ensure that all inputs have the same length by filling empty spaces with no semantic meaning. This is an important element when handling cells belonging to both RNA-seq and spatial assays because gene panels are usually smaller in the latter, which leads to a larger amount of <PAD> tokens in the set.

Given an initial input set \({x}^{i}\in {R}^{N\times D}\) composed of \(N\) tokens of dimensionality \(D,\,\) Nicheformer encodes the position within the set by adding positional embeddings. Instead of modeling as sinusoidal embeddings, we use learnable embeddings for each position80.

Nicheformer is composed of 12 stacked transformer blocks such that the output of one block is in the input of the following block. Given an input sequence \({x}^{i}\,\in \,{R}^{N\times D}\), according to equations (3) and (4):

Each transformer block consists of two main modules: a multihead self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The multihead self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the relevance of different input elements in the input set when generating output representations. In our case, we use 16 attention heads, token dimensionality \(D\) = 512 and dimensionality of the hidden layer of the feed-forward network of 1,024. The <PAD> tokens are masked for the attention mechanism so that no token can pay attention to them.

Nicheformer optimizes masked language modeling loss80 during pretraining. We mask 15% of the tokens, including contextual and gene tokens but excluding <PAD> tokens, during pretraining. The model is then trained to predict the original tokens that have been masked, utilizing the unmasked tokens as context. Specifically, following the BERT schema80, if the i-th token is chosen to be masked, 80% of the time it is replaced by a <MASK> token, 10% of the time by another random gene or contextual token and 10% of the time it remains unchanged. Mathematically, the masked language modeling loss is described as given by equation (5):

where \(M\) is the set of masked tokens, \(X\) is the entire dataset, \(x\) is a cell of the dataset and \({x}_{i}\) is gene i of the cell \(x\).

Nicheformer was pretrained for approximately 10 days using three compute nodes, each with four Nvidia A100 40GB GPUs (total 12 GPUs). We train the model using bfloat16 mixed precision. We use the AdamW optimizer81 with \({\beta }_{1}=0.9\) and \({\beta }_{2}=0.9\)99, weight decay of 0.1 and dropout of 0.0. The batch size is nine and the gradients are accumulated during ten batches before running the backward pass. The minimum learning rate is 1 × 10−5, which increases until 1 × 10−3 with a linear warmup of 100,000 steps. After the warmup, a cosine decay regime82 is applied. Gradient clipping is set to 1.0 during the first epoch and then decreased to 0.5. All weights are initialized using Xavier initialization83 with default parameters, while the bias terms are initialized to 0. Checkpoints were taken every 10,000 steps.

For the spatial cell-type, niche and region label classification task, we use the respective labels defined in the individual datasets (see ‘Datasets used for downstream tasks and evaluations'). We extracted the unique labels for each class, transferred them to 64-bit signed integer values and one-hot encoded them as a matrix with n different classes, with n being the number of cell types, niches or regions. We then used for linear probing a linear layer optimized with a cross-entropy loss. We trained on the training set of the respective dataset for one epoch at a learning rate of 1 × 10−3 and with a batch size of 256. The performance metrics reported are calculated on a held-out test set. We selected the model-assigned class label by calculating the argmax over the output vector of the linear layer. Classification uncertainties reported in this work are the output of the linear layer rescaled to [0,1] such that the sum equals 1 using a Softmax function. We use no techniques to address class imbalances for two reasons. First, to evaluate the robustness of the representations learnt by Nicheformer. Secondly, it has been shown that using class imbalance techniques can even affect performance in cases such as cell-type classification84.

For the neighborhood composition regression tasks, we first define a spatial graph of cells by building an adjacency matrix based on the Euclidean distance in the two-dimensional coordinate space provided by the individual datasets. The adjacency matrix of spatial cells is a block-diagonal matrix \(A\in {R}^{{nxn}}\), with \(n\) equal to the number of cells present in the dataset calculated based on the spatial proximity of cells where connectivities can only occur within a field of view. We use a binary adjacency matrix with \({a}_{{ij}}=1\) if \(d({x}_{i},\,{x}_{j})\le \,{\delta }_{r}\) where \(d(\cdot ,\cdot )\) describes the Euclidean distance between nodes \(i,j\in n\) and \({\delta }_{r}\) is the maximal distance between cells, and \({a}_{{ij}}=0\) otherwise. We do not include self-connectivities for the adjacency matrix to not confound the signal. We additionally define the matrix of observed cell types \({X}_{l}\in {\{\mathrm{0,1}\}}^{{nxl}}\) as a one-hot encoding of the \(l\) distinct cell types present in the dataset. The neighborhood composition for a given radius is then given as equation (6):

The resulting matrix reflects for each cell captured in the dataset a vector giving the proportions of cell types present in the neighborhood of the cell. For the neighborhood prediction task, we used for linear probing a linear layer followed by a Softmax function to rescale the prediction to lie in the range [0,1] and sum to 1. We used the mean square error loss for optimizing this linear layer, trained on the training set of the respective dataset for one epoch at a learning rate of 1 × 10−3 and with a batch size of 256. The performance metrics reported are calculated on a held-out test set.

For the cellular niche density, we again use the adjacency matrix of spatial cells \(A\in {R}^{\rm{nxn}}\) calculated based on the Euclidean distance in the two-dimensional coordinate space. The cellular neighborhood density is then simply given by the row-wise sum of all connectivities in the adjacency matrix (equation (7)),

for all cells present in the dataset with \(r\) as a given radius, i is the index cell for which we want to calculate the density, and \(j\) is the total number of potential neighboring cells present in the dataset. For the density prediction task, we used for linear probing a linear layer with input being the respective embedding of a cell (Nicheformer, scVI or PCA) and output a scalar. We used the mean square error loss for optimizing this linear layer, trained on the training set of the respective dataset for one epoch at a learning rate of 1 × 10−3 and with a batch size of 256. The performance metrics reported are calculated on a held-out test set.

Nicheformer can be fine-tuned or used for linear probing. In both settings, we only train on the previously defined training set of the respective datasets used for downstream tasks (see ‘Datasets used for downstream tasks and evaluation'). We use in both scenarios all Nicheformer gene tokens extracted from the last layer and average them to get a cell representation. Importantly, the contextual tokens are not used in the aggregation. While we observed no difference between using them and not using them in the downstream tasks focused on one modality, for example density prediction and niche classification, we observed that transferring labels between spatial and dissociated datasets did not work at all when using the contextual tokens in the aggregation. Further investigation revealed that the output norm of the contextual token of modality was always the highest one, independently of the tissue (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e), hence playing a big role in the cell representation and biasing it toward the respective modality. This phenomenon has been reported in vision transformers85, where some features that contain background information show higher norms as a consequence of the model using them to allocate internal computations. Literature85 proposes the use of registers that are discarded in the computation of the final representation. While excluding contextual tokens mitigates modality bias, it may also discard useful information; future work could explore selective integration strategies to retain relevant context.

In linear probing, the previously computed parameter weights of the Nicheformer pretraining model are frozen, that is, not updated further, and are subsequently used as input to a downstream task. The cell's representation is then fed into a linear layer specific to each downstream task, which represents either a classification task in the case of the niche and region label prediction or a regression for predicting the neighborhood composition and cellular density. For the neighborhood composition task, we additionally fitted an MLP that uses the Nicheformer embedding as input and predicts the varying neighborhood composition vectors in a dataset. The MLP is optimized using the average mean squared error across all neighborhood sizes considered. Fine-tuning generally describes using a pretrained model, and training it to a specific downstream task of choice. We speak of a fine-tuned Nicheformer version when we allow the model to change the previously learned parameter space and the weights are updated for a specific task. Importantly, each downstream task can also be optimized with respect to a new set of metrics. All runs are trained for a single epoch with a maximum learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a cosine decay scheduler reaching 1 × 10−5 at the end. The batch size is nine with gradients accumulated for ten batches (Supplementary Table 5). We highlight the respective tasks and metrics used to compute them in ‘Downstream tasks'.

We evaluated the robustness of Nicheformer's gene-rank-based cell embeddings to perturbations that mimic real-world scenarios such as incomplete gene panels or measurement noise, common in spatial transcriptomics. As the model operates on sequences of gene tokens ordered by expression rank, we assessed how alterations to this sequence affect embedding stability.

We selected one dissociated brain dataset and one spatial brain dataset from SpatialCorpus-110M, tokenized the cells, and applied controlled perturbations before passing them through the pretrained Nicheformer model. Perturbations included (i) randomly shuffling 10%, 20%, 50% or 100% of the gene rankings in each cell's token sequence (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and (ii) randomly dropping 10%, 20%, 50% or 80% of the genes from the sequence (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We then embedded the perturbed cells and evaluated the similarity between perturbed and original embeddings using integration metrics from scIB18.

To quantify embedding stability, we used the silhouette score, leveraging cell-type annotations to define ground-truth clusters. We observed that Nicheformer embeddings remained stable up to a 20% perturbation in both rank shuffling and gene dropout scenarios, indicating robustness to input noise and incomplete gene measurements (Extended Data Fig. 1). These results support the suitability of rank-based encoding for learning generalizable cell representations under varying input conditions.

To analyze the need to train a model on a diverse train dataset, we conducted controlled experiments in which we pretrained Nicheformer models and tested them in different downstream tasks and tissues. Specifically, we pretrained Nicheformer models of 49.3 million parameters using the same compute budget—3 days in an entire node containing four A100 GPUs. Due to the large compute needed to retrain Nicheformer models using the entire SpatialCorpus-110M, we subset it for the experiments, so each model is pretraining in 1% of that dataset (~1.1 million cells).

In particular, we pretrained models in the following data splits: 1.1 million randomly sampled spatial cells, 1.1 million randomly sampled dissociated cells and 3.3 million randomly sampled dissociated cells (to assess whether a large number of dissociated cells can account for the lack of spatial information). Additionally, we also pretrained a model in 1.1 million dissociated cells sampled in such a way that there is the same number of cells from blood, colon, intestine, lung, liver and brain, to assess the effect of the tissue variability of the dataset. To assess the importance of multispecies datasets, we also pretrained models on 1.1 million spatial cells sampled only from humans and 1.1 million spatial cells sampled only from mice.

We evaluated the pretrained models on the following downstream tasks: niche prediction in the human liver and lung CosMX datasets, and cell-type classification and niche regression in the mouse brain MERFISH dataset. In all cases, the models were evaluated in the linear-probing scenario running three seeds. All results were statistically assessed using analysis of variance, with P values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (FDR).

We conducted an attention analysis to explore the attention patterns in Nicheformer and how it differentiates between male and female cells by focusing on sex-specific gene variations. We sample 2,000 CD8 and 2,000 CD4 cells from the lung; 2,000 healthy and 2,000 cancer cells from the liver; 2,000 male and 2,000 female cells from the MERFISH mouse brain datasets and 2,000 random cells from the primary motor cortex scRNA-seq dataset to ensure sufficient diversity. In all cases, except in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset, we study the attention paid to the top 50 most expressed genes on average. For the MERFISH mouse brain cells, we use two gene sets: a prior-knowledge set of SDGs, known for exhibiting sex differences, and a randomly sampled control set of 97 genes. We feed all cells into the model and extract attention matrices from all 16 attention heads across the 12 transformer blocks. Then, to assess general trends in attention distribution, we average the attention scores to obtain an attention score per layer. In addition to this, we extract the maximum attention value for each gene per layer, isolating the highest level of focus from any single attention head. Evaluating both average and maximum attention, allows us to discern whether certain genes consistently receive attention across multiple heads or are sharply focused on by individual heads. Specifically, we compare the attention scores according to equation (8):

where \({A}_{{ij}}\) represents the attention that token i pays to token \(j\). As we have 16 attention layers, we denote \({A}_{{ij}}^{h}\) the attention that token i pays to token \(j\) in the layer \(h\).

In Nicheformer, with 12 layers, the attention matrices for each layer and head are represented as \({A}_{{ij}}^{(l,h)}\), where \(l\in \{\mathrm{1,2},\ldots ,12\}\) represents the layer, and \(h\in \{\mathrm{1,2},\ldots ,16\}\) denotes the head. To assess how much attention each token pays to a token \(m\), we focus on extracting the attention scores \({A}_{{im}}^{(l,h)}\), which capture the attention that each token i allocates to the \(m\) in layer \(l\) and head \(h\).

For each observation, we compute both the maximum and average attention that any token i pays to the token \(m\) across all heads in each layer. This is done by first calculating the maximum and average attention for each layer as given by equations (9) and (10):

where i refers to all other tokens in the sequence and \(H\) is the number of heads (16). These values give us the highest attention score and the average attention score that the token \(m\) receives from other tokens for each layer, respectively, considering all heads. By averaging these maximum and average attention values across multiple observations, we can assess how attention is distributed across layers, identifying the layers where the token \({m}\) receives the most focus and how consistently it receives attention across tokens and heads.

We conducted an attention analysis to study deeper the role of ortholog genes in Nicheformer and assess whether there were major differences between using or not using them and how they are related. To do so, we trained small Nicheformer models in a reduced gene space with and without using orthologs. Specifically, we used a gene vocabulary of 9,026 genes, which when mapping orthologs is reduced to 7,407 (Extended Data Fig. 9f). We compared the performance of both models with three different downstream tasks: niche prediction in the CosMX human lung and liver dataset and niche regression in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset. We found that there were differences in the performance in the latter only (Extended Data Fig. 9g).

Likewise, we studied, for the model without the ortholog mapping, whether genes with known cross-organism equivalents are more similar to their ortholog equivalent than to any other random gene. To analyze that, we extracted the gene embeddings after the pretraining and analyzed their cosine similarity. The results indicated that genes are less similar to their ortholog than to random genes, which can be explained by the fact that they are never seen together in any cell and that they might have different functions (Extended Data Fig. 9h).

To get the Geneformer embeddings, we used the release v.0.0.1 of the official Geneformer repository on Hugging Face and extracted the embeddings using the pretrained weights of the larger 12-layer variant provided at the time. We used the second to last layers to get a more general representation as recommended by the repository. We also used mean pooling as the only available option provided to aggregate the output gene embeddings into a single-cell embedding.

For the comparison against scGPT, we first created scGPT embeddings using scGPT 0.2.1, pretrained on the whole human as recommended in the original publication. The embeddings were generated for three datasets, the MERFISH mouse brain, the CosMx human lung and the CosMx human liver. For the MERFISH mouse dataset, we first mapped the mouse genes to human genes using BioMart43 through the official Ensembl releases44. The fraction of overlapping genes compared to the gene context used in scGPT was for the MERFISH mouse brain dataset of 471/483 genes, for the CosMx human liver dataset of 997/999 genes and for the CosMx human lung dataset of 958/960 genes.

To get UCE embeddings, we used the latest version from the original repository and followed the tutorials to obtain the cell embeddings. The fraction of overlapping genes compared to the gene context used in scGPT was for the MERFISH mouse brain dataset of 472/483 genes, for the CosMx human liver dataset of 990/999 genes and for the CosMx human lung dataset of 954/960 genes.

For the comparison against CellPLM, we used the latest official version of the repository. For the MERFISH mouse dataset, we first mapped the mouse genes to human genes using BioMart43 through the official Ensembl releases44. The fraction of overlapping genes compared to the gene context used in scGPT was for the MERFISH mouse brain dataset of 473/483 genes, for the CosMx human liver dataset of 997/999 genes and for the CosMx human lung dataset of 958/960 genes. The cell embeddings were obtained by following the notebook tutorials.

The resulting Geneformer, scGPT, UCE and CellPLM embeddings then served as input to a linear layer specific to each downstream task (Supplementary Table 5).

We compared the performance of the fine-tuned Nicheformer model and the linear-probing scenario to embeddings generated with scVI17 and PCA. We generated scVI and PCA embeddings on just the downstream datasets themselves and additionally on an informed 1% subset of all datasets present in the SpatialCorpus-110M. We used this subset to train two different scVI models as specified in Supplementary Table 5 to generate latent representations with 512 and 10 dimensions, respectively. The two models were then used to obtain latent representations for the datasets that were used for downstream task evaluations. The PCA embeddings were generated in a similar way using the implementation available in sklearn v.1.4.1 to obtain PCA embeddings of dimensions 512 and 10, respectively.

We split the fine-tuning datasets (MERFISH mouse brain, CosMx human liver, CosMx human lung, Xenium human lung, Xenium human colon) into a training and test set, using the same random splits as applied for the Nicheformer fine-tuning. scVI and PCA were computed on each fine-tuning dataset individually. We used scvi-tools v.1.1.2 with a negative binomial distribution gene likelihood on the raw gene expression counts and trained scVI on the training set with a batch size of 256 for 10 epochs and used two hidden layers for the encoder and decoder neural networks. The resulting embedding was chosen to have a latent dimension of 256. After training, we returned the latent representation for each cell in both the training set and the test set.

For generating PCA embeddings for each dataset, we used the implementation available in sklearn v.1.4.1. We first normalized the respective raw gene expression counts for each dataset so that each cell has a total number of counts equal to the median of the total counts for all cells with scanpy v.1.10.1. Next, we used scanpy to log1p-transform the data matrix to ensure the data are centered before using it as input to the PCA implementation. We used the sklearn implementation and evaluate the cumulative explained variance ratio in the training dataset (Extended Data Fig. 10). Finally, we evaluated the model for a diverse set of principal components to have a fair comparison (Extended Data Fig. 7). All other parameters are the defaults provided by the sklearn implementation. We fit the PCA on the training set and afterwards applied the dimensionality reduction to both the training set and test set. The resulting lower-dimensional representations, X_scvi and X_pca, then serve as input to a linear layer specific to each downstream task (Supplementary Table 5).

A) We compute Nicheformer cell representations for a dissociated and spatial brain dataset and use author cell type annotations as ground truth. We randomly permute 10%, 20%, 50% and 100% of the genes in the input sequence and obtain cell representations. Then, we compute the silhouette score to evaluate how perturbed are the cell representations. B) We repeat the same experiment but instead of permuting genes, we drop them off the input sequence (which contains only non-zero genes). In particular, we drop 10%, 20%, 50% and 80% of the genes in the input sequence. In this case, the deterioration of the cell embeddings happens faster than when permuting genes. Cell representations of spatial cells deteriorate faster than dissociated cells (<0.2 silhouette score against >0.6 silhouette score for 50% dropout level). We hypothesise that this happens due to the shorter gene panels, that is in large gene panels, Nicheformer can leverage more information from the longer context length to correct disturbances in the data. C) Shown are the loss curves of three different models with varying parameter size, 15.1 million parameters, 40.9 million parameters and 49.3 million parameters, respectively. The larger the model, the lower is the pretraining loss. All the losses are a moving average with a window of 10. All the models were evaluated in the same training set with fixed random seed.

A) Shown are the F1 scores for niche classification in the CosMx human liver (top left) and lung (top right) datasets, cell type classification in MERFISH mouse brain (bottom right) and the MSE for niche regression in MERFISH mouse brain (bottom left) obtained by different models trained on different data subsets. The results demonstrate a clear advantage of training on spatial data compared to dissociated data. A model trained on just 1% of spatial data significantly outperforms models trained on the same or even three times the amount of dissociated data, reinforcing the fundamental difference between these modalities. This suggests that no amount of dissociated data can fully compensate for the spatial context when evaluated on spatial tasks. Additionally, computational efficiency plays a crucial role: the model trained on a smaller dissociated subset (1%) performs better than one trained on a larger subset (3%) because both were trained for the same duration, leading to more updates per sample in the smaller dataset. Furthermore, stratified training offers advantages only in specific cases, such as the liver, which can be explained by the distribution of tissue types in the random subset - since they are overly present in SpatialCorpus-110M. For example, brain cells are more abundant in the random subset than in the stratified one, potentially influencing performance. The results are found statistically significant even after adjusting for FDR. B) Shown are the F1 score curves of two different models trained on different modalities: spatial and dissociated respectively. Both models have the same number of parameters and have been training for the same amount of time. The task is performed by linear probing. The model trained on MERFISH data notably outperforms the model trained on RNA-seq, highlighting a significant distribution shift between technologies. C) Shown are the F1 scores for niche classification in the CosMx human liver (top left) and lung (top right) datasets, cell type classification in MERFISH mouse brain (bottom right) and the MSE for niche regression in MERFISH mouse brain (bottom right) obtained by different models trained on different data subsets. As in the previous data split test, a broad coverage train distribution is necessary to achieve good performance across a variety of scenarios. In this case, models trained uniquely in mouse data underperform in downstream tasks based on human data (top row); and models trained on only human data underperform in downstream tasks based on mouse data (bottom row). A model trained on a combination of mouse and human data performs on pair in both cases. Results were found statistically significant even after FDR correction.

Source data

A) Shown are different attention matrices extracted from the last transformer block of Nicheformer. They present a similar pattern in which almost all attention is paid to the metadata tokens. B) Average attention paid, per layer, to the metadata tokens. It can be observed a clear trend: the last layers of the model pay, by a large margin, the most attention to the metadata tokens. The analysis is done in both male and female brain mouse datasets to showcase that the pattern is consistent. C) Shown are box plots representing the distribution of attention paid to contextual tokens (orange) and gene tokens (blue) in the latest Nicheformer's layers. The p-values are the result of performing Mann-Whitney U tests to assess whether there is a significant difference between the distribution of attention paid to contextual and gene tokens. To control the false discovery rate (FDR), we applied the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to adjust the p-values. D) Shown are box plots representing the distribution of attention paid to gene tokens in 3 groups of layers: early (from layer 1 to layer 5), middle (layer 6 to layer 9) and late (from layer 10 to layer 12). The p-values are the result of performing Mann-Whitney U tests to assess whether there is a significant difference between the distribution of attention paid to contextual and gene tokens. To control the false discovery rate (FDR), we applied the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to adjust the p-values.

Source data

Shown are the attention matrices obtained from the head 5 of the Nicheformer layer 4 when processing lung spatial cells (top left), brain spatial cells (top right), liver spatial cells (bottom left) and brain dissociated cells (bottom right). It can be seen that this attention head uniquely focuses on the most expressed genes, independently of the tissue or modality of the cell. B) Shown are the attention matrices obtained from the head 3 of the Nicheformer layer 6 when processing lung spatial cells (top left), brain spatial cells (top right), liver spatial cells (bottom left) and brain dissociated cells (bottom right). It can be seen that the attention pattern of this attention head changes when processing dissociated cells or spatial cells. C) Shown are different attention matrices obtained when feeding Nicheformer with cells from the AVPV section. Different heads showcase different patterns, which reveal diverse attention behaviours, including metadata token focus (Head 5, Layer 4), selective gene interactions (Head 6, Layer 4), diffuse attention across genes (Head 10, Layer 6), strong self-attention (Head 1, Layer 6), combined self and global attention (Head 12, Layer 6), and concentrated attention on key genes (Head 3, Layer 7). D) The first layers of Nicheformer show the highest attention differences between cell and female cells, even though this is very small. E) The same pattern holds for the SDN genes. F) Nicheformer's middle layers show the maximum attention score differences between the male and the female cells for the HY GABA cells within the AVPV section. G) The same pattern occurs when examining the maximum differences for all cells in the AVPV section. The contrast of the average attention difference plotted here and the maximum attention differences (Fig. 3d-f) suggests that the sex differences are captured by a subset of the attention heads. The average attention difference is computed averaging all attention heads, whereas the maximum attention difference attends to the maximum difference reported in any head.

A) Downstream task metrics (MSE) for models trained in the MERFISH mouse brain using linear probing on Nicheformer and PCA embeddings with increasingly more principal components. The downstream tasks evaluated are niche regression for 4 different radius sizes. In all cases, Nicheformer outperforms PCA, even though the PCA substantially improves with the more principal components employed. Differences are found statistically significant between the best PCA performing model and Nicheformer. B) F1 Score for region and niche prediction. Interestingly, PCA ends up outperforming Nicheformer in the case of linear probing for the region classification and performing as good as Nicheformer for the niche classification. However, fine tuning Nicheformer is still better.

I-M) Nicheformer label transfer classification uncertainty from spatial to dissociated assays in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset. I-K) Cell type (I), niche (J), and region (K) predicted label uncertainty across all cell types in the scRNA-seq mouse brain data. Nicheformer assigns lower uncertainty to plausible labels given the nature of the dataset and high uncertainty to labels not present in the primary motor cortex. The highlighted boxes show cell types, niches and regions one would not expect to find in the primary motor cortex. Nicheformer correctly shows a high uncertainty in those. L-M) Spatial allocation of cells in an exemplary section of the MERFISH mouse brain dataset colored by the pallium glutamatergic niche label (L) and the subpallium GABAergic niche label (M), respectively.

Source data

A-B) Spatial allocation of cells in the training set (A) and test set (B) tissue sections colored by cell type. C) Distribution of cell type labels in the training and test set in the CosMx human lung dataset. D-C) Histogram of output token L2 norms for CosMx human lung and liver cells. D-C) The histograms display the distribution of the average L2 norm of output tokens for lung (D) and liver (E) cells. The modality token, marked by an arrow, exhibits a notably higher norm compared to other tokens. These norms reflect the representation magnitudes in the model's output space. Including contextual tokens in cell representation aggregation led to poor label transfer performance. This is because aggregation is performed via mean pooling, where tokens with higher norms disproportionately influence the result. Additionally, contextual tokens appear in all cells, whereas the other tokens shown here are present only in specific subsets. As a result, while contextual tokens contribute to all cells, non-contextual tokens contribute only to the cells in which they appear. F-H) Orthologs versus non orthologs comparison. F) Venn diagram showing the number of genes of the non orthologs-trained model (9026) and the orthologs-trained model (7407). The 1619 genes of difference are genes that have a corresponding ortholog but we choose not to use the mapping. G) Niche regression in the MERFISH mouse brain dataset is the only downstream task - among the tested ones - in which there is a statistical significant difference (t-test) between both models. No statistical significance was found in the case of niche prediction for the CosMX human datasets. H) Boxplots showing the distribution of similarities between tokens measured as cosine similarity. We use the official Ensembl releases to map ortholog genes and assess if they are more similar between them than to random genes and we find that they are actually less similar.

Source data

Shown are the cumulative explained variance ratios obtained after performing PCA. for the MERFISH brain mouse (top), CosMx human liver (middle) and CosMx human lung (bottom) datasets. Notice that this accounts for the explained variance in the train set, not in the test set (the PCA is computed in the train set and the test data transformer using the principal components obtained). The red line indicates the 90% of explained variance.

Doping-induced superconductivity in group-IV elements may enable quantum functionalities in material systems accessible with well-established semiconductor technologies. Non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group-III atoms into C, Si or Ge can yield superconductivity; however, its origin is obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films and trilayer heterostructures by molecular-beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations (nh = 4.15 × 1021 cm−3, 17.9% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of Tc = 3.5 K. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor–semiconductor platform.

Lithium-ion batteries can fail catastrophically through thermal runaway, but the key trigger has remained unclear. Here we show that the most harmful cause is lithium oxidation reaction (LOR). This makes two types of high-energy-density battery surprisingly most dangerous: all-solid-state batteries with cracked solid separators, whether from manufacturing defects, high-pressure assembly or electrochemical cycling, and batteries with non-flammable liquid electrolytes. In both batteries, oxygen evolved from an oxide cathode passes directly to an anode, triggering highly energetic LOR. In contrast, traditional carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes are safer because they can consume O2 in transit, alleviating or avoiding LOR. These findings apply to both lithium metal and lithiated anodes such as graphite. Safe electrolytes are thus either solid ion conductors that stop O2 crossover under all conditions or materials that scavenge O2 through low-exothermic reactions.

The microbiome-gut-brain-axis plays a critical role in mental health. However, research linking the microbiome to brain function is limited, particularly during development, when tremendous plasticity occurs and many mental health issues, like depression and anxiety, initially manifest. Further complicating attempts to understand interactions between the brain and microbiome is the complex and multidimensional nature of both systems. In the current observational study (N = 55), we use sparse partial least squares to identify linear combinations of brain networks (brain signatures) derived from resting state fMRI scans at age 6 years that maximally covary with internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years, before identifying microbe abundances (microbial profiles) derived from 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples at age 2 years that maximally covary with those brain signatures. Finally, we test whether any early microbial profiles are indirectly associated with later internalizing symptoms via the brain signatures, highlighting potential microbial programming effects. We find that microbes in the Clostridiales order and Lachnospiraceae family are associated with internalizing symptoms in middle childhood through connectivity alterations within emotion-related brain networks.

The gut and brain are inextricably linked through a dynamic, bidirectional communication network known as the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA). While this connection is increasingly recognized as pivotal to adult mental health1, its role in shaping behavioral and psychological outcomes during development, when mental health problems first emerge2,3,4, remains poorly understood. Early childhood is a rapid period of gastrointestinal microbiome maturation5,6. The microbiome reaches an adult-like configuration by around 3 years of age5,7,8, after which point it remains relatively stable9,10,11. This early period may represent a sensitive window during which microbial signals shape key aspects of brain development6,12. Such early influences could have lasting effects by programming neurobiological systems in ways that confer vulnerability or resilience to later mental health outcomes, particularly during the high-risk period of middle childhood2,3. A developmental perspective on the MGBA is therefore essential for understanding how early microbial signals may contribute to lifelong trajectories of mental health.

Recent evidence that microbiome composition is associated with neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes during childhood, such as internalizing symptoms13,14,15, underscores the importance of understanding the MGBA's contribution to mental health during development. To date, however, most studies examining the MGBA in the context of typical development have focused on infancy and toddlerhood, with an emphasis on neurocognitive, rather than mental health, outcomes16,17,18,19. These studies have found that individual differences in microbial alpha diversity are associated with variation in the structure and function of brain regions and networks implicated in sensorimotor processing, language, and emotion16,17,18,19. For example, greater alpha diversity in infancy has been concurrently linked to increased fronto-parietal connectivity—a network implicated in cognitive control, which in turn was associated with increased infant negative emotionality19. Similarly, higher alpha diversity at age 1 year has been associated with lower functional connectivity between the left amygdala and thalamus, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, as well as greater connectivity between the supplemental motor area and inferior parietal lobule18. Higher alpha diversity at age 1 year has also been linked with poorer cognitive performance (visual reception and expression language) and brain volume at later developmental stages—greater left precentral, right angular, and left amygdala volumes at age 2 years16—highlighting potential programming effects of early microbiota on later brain structure.

In studies examining specific microbial taxa, concurrent and prospective associations with neurodevelopment have also been reported. For instance, Carlson et al.17 found that relative abundances of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus at age 1 month were concurrently negatively associated with amygdala volumes, and positively associated with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) volumes. In terms of potential programming effects, a higher abundance of Bacteroides at age 1 month was linked to smaller mPFC at age 1 year, whereas greater Lachnospiraceae abundance was prospectively associated with larger amygdala volume—an association that was reversed for Enterobacteriaceae17. Notably, in that study, there were no concurrent associations between specific bacterial taxa and brain volumes at age 1 year, suggesting cascading developmental effects, whereby earlier microbial composition influences later brain structure. In that study, concurrent and prospective associations between microbes and affective outcomes were also reported: higher abundances of Dialister and bacteria that are part of the Clostridiales order, at 1 year, were associated with reduced fear behavior at 1 year, and alpha diversity at 1 month was associated with increased fear behavior at 1 year. These findings align with the hypothesis, also supported by research in rodents20, that early-life microbiota provide critical signaling inputs necessary for typical neurodevelopment, and that disruptions in these signals may confer risk for later psychopathology6. Despite these insights, it remains unclear whether—and how—early life microbial diversity and composition affect brain function later in development, during middle childhood, a high-risk period for mental health problems4,21.

Of the developmental studies linking the microbiota to brain function, most have employed seed-based resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses16,18. While use of RSFC is preferable in developing populations due to reduced task demands, the use of researcher-selected seeds in these analyses provides a limited view of brain function, and further, does not account for connectivity within and between canonical large-scale functional brain networks, which have been linked to neurocognitive behaviors and psychopathological outcomes in children22,23,24,25,26,27,28. For example, internalizing symptoms in children have been associated with alterations in RSFC within the default mode network (DMN), the ventral attention network (VAN), and between both DMN and striatal regions with cingulo-opercular (CON) networks22. Across development, a pattern of increasing within-network integration and between-network segregation supports the increasing specialization of network-related functions and efficient information processing—deviations from which are associated with psychopathology in youth29,30,31,32,33. As such, it is clear that investigating the impact of early microbiota on the development of brain network integration and segregation is an essential step for understanding the microbiota's contributions to psychopathology. However, such analyses are challenging due to the multivariate complexity of both microbiota and large-scale brain network data. Use of multivariate machine learning analysis techniques may help to solve this issue.

Multivariate machine learning approaches address key limitations of univariate neuroimaging analyses, including small effect sizes and the inability to identify multivariate combinations of brain patterns that relate to psychopathology34. Among these, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are widely used to reduce complex datasets into latent components that maximize shared variance—correlation (CCA) or covariance (PLS)35,36. PLS is particularly advantageous in situations when the sample size is similar to, or much smaller than, the number of variables in the dataset, and in situations where multicollinearity is present35,37,38. Incorporating sparsity into the PLS can facilitate interpretation and reduce overfitting by selecting a subset of relevant variables35,37,38, making this approach (sparse PLS, or sparse partial least squares (sPLS)) especially robust to small sample sizes39.

While multivariate machine learning techniques, including sPLS, are frequently used to compress microbiota data and identify its associations to other variables—including within a multi-omics framework40, clinical outcomes41, and with the brain42,43—these techniques have been underused in developing populations, which are often characterized by the small samples for which these approaches are particularly well-suited. Similarly, few studies investigating brain function in development have employed multivariate machine learning techniques, though a recent example using CCA was successful in identifying a connectome—comprising attentional, cognitive control (including DMN, frontoparietal, and salience), and subcortical networks—that was associated with cognition, behavioral/emotional outcomes, and diagnoses of mental disorders both concurrently and prospectively, i.e., 2 years after the neuroimaging data were collected24. In the current study, we advance the field by using sPLS to link early life microbiota to large-scale functional brain networks in middle childhood, and ultimately to internalizing symptoms later in childhood.

In the current study, we leveraged data from an ongoing longitudinal, observational cohort (the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes [GUSTO] study). Stool samples and resting state fMRI scans were collected from child participants at 2 and 6 years of age, respectively. At 7.5 years of age, caregivers completed questionnaires about children's behavioral problems. In previous analyses of data from this cohort, we demonstrated that maternal childhood maltreatment, maternal prenatal anxiety, and children's exposure to stressful life events were associated with distinct gastrointestinal microbiota profiles at 2 years of age, which were in turn associated with behavioral problems at 2 and 4 years of age44. In the current study, we investigate how gastrointestinal microbiota composition at 2 years of age relates to children's intrinsic functional brain network connectivity at 6 years of age, with these brain networks defined by their association with caregiver-reported internalizing problems at 7.5 years of age. We focus on internalizing problems for two reasons: First, internalizing symptoms during early-middle childhood increases risk for chronic and recurrent internalizing symptoms across the lifecourse45,46, making this a particularly important symptom group to investigate for links to the microbiota. Second, recent evidence suggests that the associations between microbiota composition (alpha diversity and specific microbes) are more robustly associated with internalizing symptoms and somatic complaints than externalizing symptoms during the preschool years14. This multivariate symptom-centered approach to identify specific brain functional architecture relevant to mental health, before linking it to the microbiome, is a novel approach that can provide potential targets for future interventions. Furthermore, our examination of prospective links between early microbiota and brain networks/behavioral outcomes in middle childhood provides insight into the potentially long reach of early microbial composition on child outcomes, especially during periods of risk for the emergence of internalizing symptoms47,48.

We addressed our aims using a three-step approach. First, we used sPLS to identify combinations of resting brain networks (i.e., brain signatures) at age 6 years that maximally covaried with internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years. We used the caregiver report of the child's internalizing symptoms as our primary indicator, as clinician assessment tends to agree more with parent-report than child-report in the age range of this study49. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that differences in RSFC within and between networks implicated in attention (e.g., ventral attention), cognitive and emotion regulation (e.g., DMN, frontoparietal, salience, cingulo-opercular), and subcortical areas (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus) would relate to caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms. Second, using these brain signatures as outcomes, we used sPLS again to identify combinations of specific microbial taxa (i.e., microbial profiles) at age 2 years that explained the most variability in those brain signatures. Further, we examined whether the compositional diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota (alpha diversity) was associated with any brain signatures. We hypothesized that higher abundances of Intestinibacter, Faecalibacterium, Coprobacillus, and Lachnospiraceae, and lower abundance of Veillonella would be associated with brain signatures linked to lower caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms, as they have been previously associated with caregiver-reported mental health at age 2 or 4 years in this cohort in the hypothesized directions44. Finally, to statistically evaluate a conceptual model in which the connection between the microbiota and mental health is mediated by the brain, we tested whether brain signatures at age 6 years mediated associations between microbiota features (i.e., microbial profiles and alpha diversity) at age 2 years and caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years. For all analyses, we covaried for child sex assigned at birth, gestational age, birthweight, mean framewise displacement (motion in fMRI), delivery mode, maternal education, and diet.

The analytic sample for this study included N = 55 children who contributed a usable stool sample at age 2 years, good-quality fMRI data at age 6 years, and whose caregiver completed an assessment of their caregiver-reported internalizing problems at age 7.5 years. Of those, N = 43 who provided data on all covariates were included in analyses that controlled for covariates. Demographics, descriptive statistics for key study variables, and descriptive statistics for covariates, for the analytic sample and the sample of children excluded due to poor quality fMRI data (N = 55) are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The only difference between the included and excluded samples was that excluded participants had higher mean framewise displacement on average, which was the reason for their exclusion (Table 3).

Two participants were identified as multivariate outliers that could be driving component results and were univariate outliers on connectivity within the striatal-orbitofrontal-amygdala (SOFA) network and connectivity between the SOFA and medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks. Thus, those two participants' connectivity values for SOFA and SOFA-MTL were winsorized, and model tuning was repeated. The final best-fitting model consisted of two orthogonal brain network components (Component 1: 20 networks, 12 of which had high stability; Component 2: 15 networks, 9 of which had high stability). See Supplementary Table 2 for all variable loading, Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP), and stability values.

To validate these components, we statistically tested their association with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms with and without controlling for covariates. Component 1 was correlated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms (r = 0.47, p = 0.00012) and was significantly positively related to internalizing symptoms when controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.52, SE = 0.23, p = 0.036; Fig. 1A). The top 4 highest magnitude loadings on Component 1 all had high stability and included positive and negative loadings. Positive loadings (i.e., stronger connectivity within and between these networks was positively associated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms) were within-network connectivity in the SOFA network and between-network connectivity between the SOFA and MTL networks. Negative loadings (i.e., weaker connectivity within and between these networks were associated with more caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms) were within-network connectivity in the SAL network and between-network connectivity between the SAL and parietomedial network (PMN). We therefore called this component the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature. See Fig. 2 for a visualization of the networks in this signature.

A SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Signature. B Microbial Profile 1. C SOFA Between Network Signature. D Microbial Profile 2. E Microbial Profile 3. Colors (blue or salmon) and rows correspond to the brain signature that the microbial profile was derived from (blue = SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature; salmon = SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature). Only variables with VIP > 1 are shown. SOFA = striatal-orbitofrontal-amgydalar, MTL = medial temporal lobe, DMN = default mode network, SAL = salience, PMN = parietomedial network, VAN = ventral attention network, AUD  = auditory, CON = cingulo-opercular, SMD = somatomotor dorsal. For microbes that were unable to be classified to the genus level, the family name is shown. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

Regions of interest and network assignments were derived from the Seitzman et al.90 atlas. SOFA striatal orbitofrontal amygdalar, MTL medial temporal lobe, DMN default mode, SAL salience, VAN ventral attention, PMN parietomedial, AUD auditory, CON cingulo-opercular, SMD dorsal somatomotor.

Component 2 was correlated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms (r = 0.38, p = 0.012) and was significantly positively related to caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms when controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.52, SE = 0.21, p = 0.019; Fig. 1C). The top 4 highest magnitude loadings on Component 2, all of which had high stability, were all positive loadings (i.e., stronger connectivity within and between these networks was positively associated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms). These loadings included between-network connectivity between the SOFA and visual networks, between the SOFA and DMN, between the VAN and dorsal somatomotor network (SMD), and between the SOFA and FPN networks. We therefore called this component the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature. See Fig. 3 for a visualization of networks in this signature.

Regions of interest and network assignments were derived from the Seitzman et al.90 atlas. SOFA = striatal orbitofrontal amygdalar, VIS = visual, FPN = frontal parietal, DAN = dorsal attention, SML = lateral somatomotor, DMN = default mode, VAN = ventral attention, CON = cingulo-opercular, SMD = dorsal somatomotor.

There was one multivariate outlier, which was also a univariate outlier on Coprococcus, Anaerobutyricum, and Weissella abundance; abundances of those genera were winsorized, and tuning was repeated. The final best-fitting model consisted of 1 microbiota component with 5 genera (three of which had high stability). See Fig. 1B–E for visualization of loadings for variables with VIP > 1 and stability ≥ 0.8, and Supplementary Table 3 for loadings, VIP, and stability values for all variables on each component.

To validate the component, we statistically tested its association with the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature with and without controlling for covariates. The component was correlated with the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature (r = 0.51, p = 0.0000071) and was also significantly positively related to this brain signature when controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.46, SE = 0.21, p = 0.031). Of the five genera that loaded onto this component, three genera had high stability and included positive loadings for Eubacteriaceae abundance (i.e., higher abundance of these genera was associated with higher scores on the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature), and negative loadings for Anaerobutyricum and Dialister abundance (i.e., higher abundance of these genera was associated with lower scores on the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature). We called this component Microbial Profile 1.

There were no multivariate outliers. The final best-fitting model consisted of 2 microbiota components (Component 1: 5 genera, 2 of which had high stability; Component 2: 20 genera, 13 of which had high stability).

To validate the components, we statistically tested their associations with the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature with and without controlling for covariates. Component 1 was correlated with the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature (r = 0.58, p = 0.0000027) and was also significantly positively related to this brain signature when controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.48, SE = 0.21, p = 0.032). Of the five genera that loaded onto this component, two had high stability and included positive loadings for Eubacterium and Terrisporobacter abundance (i.e., higher abundance of these genera was associated with higher scores on the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature). We named this component Microbial Profile 2.

Component 2 was correlated with the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature (r = 0.67, p = 0.000017) and was also significantly positively related to the brain signature when controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.47, SE = 0.19, p = 0.020). Of the 20 genera that loaded onto this component, 13 had high stability. The top 4 highest magnitude, stable loadings for this component were positive loadings for Veillonella and Intestinibacter abundance (i.e., higher abundance of these genera was associated with higher scores on the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature), and negative loadings for Catenibacterium and Fusicatenibacter abundance (i.e., higher abundance of these genera was associated with lower scores on the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature). We named this component Microbial Profile 3. See Supplementary Table 3 for names, loadings, and VIP values for the other stable genera.

Alpha diversity in the gut microbiota was not associated with scores on the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Brain Signature, controlling for covariates: Shannon diversity (\(\beta\)= 0.14, SE = 0.27, p = 0.60), Pielou evenness (\(\beta\)= 0.16, SE = 0.27, p = 0.55), observed features (\(\beta\)= 0.02, SE = 0.23, p = 0.94), or Faith's phylogenetic diversity (\(\beta\)= 0.11, SE = 0.22, p = 0.64).

Higher Faith's phylogenetic diversity in the gut microbiota was associated with higher scores on the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature, controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.37, SE = 0.12, p = 0.008, q = 0.024; Fig. 4). The other alpha diversity metrics were not associated with scores on the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature: Shannon diversity (\(\beta\)= 0.23, SE = 0.18, p = 0.22), Pielou evenness (\(\beta\)= 0.20, SE = 0.18, p = 0.29), observed features (\(\beta\)= 0.17, SE = 0.22, p = 0.45).

Each dot represents a participant. Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity and SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature scores are shown after partialling out variance accounted for by covariates. Predictors in the model included Faith's phylogenetic diversity, child sex, gestational age at birth, birthweight, delivery mode, mean FD, maternal education and consumption of fiber, total fat and polyunsaturated fat. The dark purple line represents the predicted best-fit function predicting x from y using a linear model, and the lighter purple shaded area around the line is the 95% CI level for that predicted best-fit function. Dots have been jittered horizontally (along the x-axis) by 0.3 to increase visibility of individual data points. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

Microbial Profile 3 was indirectly positively associated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years through higher scores on the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature, controlling for covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.32, SE = 0.17, 95% CI: [0.0075, 0.68]). There was no direct (\(\beta\)= −0.24, SE = 0.20, 95% CI: [−0.65, 0.16]) or total (\(\beta\)= 0.01, SE = 0.25, p = 0.96) effect of Microbial Profile 3 on internalizing symptoms, controlling for covariates (Fig. 5).

Covariates include child sex, gestational age at birth, birthweight, delivery mode, mean FD, maternal education, and consumption of fiber, total fat and polyunsaturated fat for both the a and b paths.

Microbial Profile 1 was not associated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years, directly (\(\beta\)= 0.18, SE = 0.20, 95% CI: [−0.22, 0.59]), indirectly through the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature (\(\beta\)= 0.16, SE = 0.13, 95% CI: [−0.061, 0.43]), or overall (i.e., the total effect; \(\beta\)= 0.34, SE = 0.20, p = 0.10), controlling for covariates (Supplementary Table 5). Similarly, Microbial Profile 2 was not associated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years directly (\(\beta\)= 0.29, SE = 0.24, 95% CI: [−0.20, 0.79]), indirectly through the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature (\(\beta\)= 0.17, SE = 0.19, 95% CI: [−0.11, 0.65]), or overall (i.e., the total effect; \(\beta\)= 0.46, SE = 0.24, p = 0.065), controlling for covariates (Supplementary Table 5).

There was no total effect of Faith's phylogenetic diversity on caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms, controlling for selected covariates (\(\beta\)= 0.21, SE = 0.20, p = 0.31). Faith's phylogenetic diversity was also not related to internalizing symptoms indirectly through the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature (\(\beta\)= 0.19, SE = 0.14, 95% CI: [−0.084, 0.48], and there was also no direct effect of Faith's phylogenetic diversity on caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms in this model (\(\beta\)= 0.013, SE = 0.13, 95% CI: [−0.26, 0.28]; Supplementary Table 4). Although Faith's phylogenetic diversity was not associated with the SOFA, MTL, SAL PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature, we still tested a mediation for Faith's phylogenetic diversity on caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms via this signature for completeness, and results are presented in Supplementary Table 5).

To test specificity of links between Brain Signatures and Microbial Profiles to caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms broadly, we examined all identified Brain Signatures and Microbial Profiles and their links with caregiver reported anxiety and depressive symptoms separately at 7.5 years of age (which go into the internalizing symptom score), as well as with caregiver-reported externalizing symptoms at 7.5 years of age, and with child self-reported depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms at 8.5 years of age. We found that the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature was positively associated with caregiver-reported depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms at 7.5 years of age, as well as with child self-reported depressive symptoms at 8.5 years of age. In other words, this Brain Signature was not specific to the caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms upon which it was defined. The SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature was associated with child self-reported depressive symptoms at 8.5 years of age, suggesting it too was not completely specific to the caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms upon which it was defined. Similarly, Microbial Profile 1 was positively associated with caregiver-reported externalizing symptoms at 7.5 years of age, again suggesting some degree of generalizability beyond caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms. In contrast, Microbial Profiles 2 and 3 were not associated with any additional symptom measures, which suggests that the indirect association between Microbial Profile 3 and caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms reported above (mediated by the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature) is indeed specific to that outcome measure. Methods and full results are presented in the SI.

To better understand relations between the predicted functional potential of the microbiota and identified brain signatures, we estimated the abundance of functional pathways from the 16S sequencing data using PiCRUST 2, and then performed sPLS analyses with that predicted functional data as input. We found that one predicted functional profile covaried most strongly with the SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature, and remained significantly associated with its corresponding brain signature when controlling for covariates. The pathway that had high stability from this component, which also had the strongest loading, was PWY-6270, isoprene biosynthesis I (negative loading). We also found two predicted functional profiles covaried most strongly with the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature, one of which remained significantly associated with its corresponding brain signature when controlling for covariates. Pathways from these profiles with the highest loadings, and high stability, included the pentose phosphate pathway and superpathway of glucose and xylose degradation (negative loadings), and cob(II)yrinate a,c-diamide biosynthesis I pathway, NAD salvage pathways V and I, and UPD-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine biosynthesis I pathway (positive loadings). There were no significant total, direct, or indirect associations (via the corresponding brain signature) between the functional profiles and caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years. Full methods and results are presented in the Supplementary Methods and Notes, respectively.

A small but growing body of research has investigated the role of the MGBA in developmental psychopathology. This study builds on past work by using a top-down approach to first identify internalizing symptom-relevant network brain signatures, and then identify gut microbiota taxa abundance profiles that explain variance in those brain signatures. These brain signatures and microbial profiles then informed mediation models where we tested indirect links between gut microbiota and internalizing symptoms via brain networks. We found that variance in internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years was best explained by two orthogonal brain network connectivity signatures at age 6 years. These signatures were best explained by three gut microbiota abundance profiles at age 2 years. In turn, one of the microbial profiles was indirectly related to internalizing symptoms via its corresponding brain signature, suggesting a longitudinal pathway through which the gut microbiota in early life may be associated with later emerging functional connectomes implicated in childhood internalizing symptoms.

The two orthogonal brain signatures identified as maximally covarying with internalizing symptoms included several networks that have previously been associated with mental health and cognition. The first of the identified signatures, SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature, was characterized by higher connectivity within each of the SOFA and MTL networks, higher connectivity between the SOFA and MTL networks, weaker connectivity within the SAL network, and weaker connectivity between the SAL and PMN networks. Consistent with those results, alterations in RSFC between the amygdala and prefrontal regions (both parts of the SOFA network) have been found in youth depression50 and anxiety51. Though some studies have reported the opposite association (as reviewed in Rakesh et al.52). Connectivity within the SAL, and between the amygdala and MTL, has also been associated with psychopathology in adolescence, though the direction of associations has varied across studies and disorders53,54,55,56,57. Consistent with this study, weaker connectivity between the SAL and precuneus (a region within the PMN) has been associated with higher trait anxiety in adolescents58. Considered in the context of prior research, this brain signature suggests disrupted connectivity within the SOFA, MTL, SAL, and PMN networks in middle childhood may be implicated in internalizing symptoms slightly later in development.

The second of the identified internalizing-associated brain signatures—the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature—was best characterized by higher connectivity between the SOFA and a variety of other networks. This signature is consistent with past research examining neural correlates of internalizing symptoms. Specifically, amygdala (part of the SOFA network) hyperconnectivity with neurocognitive networks, including the CON, VAN, and DMN, has frequently been associated with psychopathology at different developmental stages59, including associations with transdiagnostic mental health symptoms23, as well as specifically with major depressive disorder60, and irritability61. Moreover, SOFA hyperconnectivity is thought to reflect disruption in neurocircuitry underlying cognitive control and emotion regulation23. Overall, the connectivity profile observed within this signature suggests that increased subcortical connectivity with a range of cognitive and perception networks is associated with internalizing symptoms in middle childhood.

Critical to the interpretation of internalizing symptom-associated brain signatures, in the current study, only a minority of children exhibited symptoms at clinical or borderline levels, consistent with prevalence rates in the general population62,63. However, because symptom severity exists along a continuum, focusing exclusively on clinically significant distress (i.e., scores above diagnostic cutoffs) may overlook meaningful variation in functioning. Subclinical symptoms, particularly of depression, have been shown to increase the risk of later diagnoses of major depressive disorder—potentially through pathways involving cognitive dysfunction and anhedonia64,65,66. Given the younger age of this sample, which precedes the median age of onset for disorders such as anxiety (11 years) and depression (30 years), examining subthreshold symptoms may offer valuable insights into early indicators of risk and future outcomes67.

With respect to microbial profiles, which explained maximal variance in the brain signatures, we saw that they too had been associated with internalizing symptoms in the extant literature. We identified three orthogonal microbial profiles, the first of which was linked to the SOFA, MTL, PMN Network Connectivity signature. This profile (Microbial Profile 1) was characterized by positive stable loading for the Eubacteriaceae family, and negative stable loadings for Weissella and Anaerobutyricum. Interestingly, both Weissella and Anaerobutyricum have been linked to better mental and physical health outcomes via the anti-inflammatory effects of their metabolites68,69,70. Taken together, these findings suggest that connectivity within and between the SOFA, MTL, SAL, and PMN networks might be best explained by microbes that modulate inflammation.

The second and third microbial profiles were both linked to the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature. Microbial profile 2 was characterized by positive loadings for Eubacterium and Terrisporobacter genera. Interestingly, both of these genera have been linked to negative health outcomes in other populations. For instance, higher Eubacterium abundance has been related to poorer physical health in clinical child samples71,72, and Terrisporobacter was found to be higher in adults with irritable bowel syndrome than in control adults without those symptoms73. However, Eubacterium species also metabolize cholesterol, contributing to lower cholesterol levels in the blood74, which is a positive health outcome. Nonetheless, on the whole, research suggests that SOFA Between Network Connectivity might be best explained, in part, by microbes linked to physical health symptoms, which are often comorbid with internalizing symptoms75.

Microbial profile 3, also linked to the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature, was largely characterized by genera from the Lachnospiraceae family (6 out of the 13 stable genera in this profile are members of the Lachnospiraceae family; see Supplementary Table 3 for full taxonomic classification). Interestingly, in a small proof-of-concept study of school-age children, another microbe from the Lachnospiraceae family was positively associated with PFC reactivity to fearful faces76. Of the top 4 highest loading and stable microbes in this component, higher abundance of Veillonella (positive loading on Microbial Profile 3) was previously related to more sleep problems in early childhood in this cohort44, and in other cohorts it has been associated with more internalizing symptoms at school age14, emotion regulation difficulties in infancy77, and stronger fear behavior in infancy17. Veillonella abundance has also been linked to more severe anxiety symptoms in adults78. Consistent with their negative loading onto a brain component associated with internalizing symptoms in this study, Fusicatenibacter and Catenibacterium have been linked to less severe depressive symptoms in adults79,80. Only one study, also in this cohort, has reported an association between Intestinibacter abundance and child mental health (caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 4 years and total behavior problems at age 2 years), but in the opposite direction as its association with brain networks in this study44. The differing directions of association across studies and the lack of prior research on this genus suggest that future research should continue to investigate the relation between Intestinibacter and mental health in childhood. Overall, the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature also appears to be characterized, in part, via internalizing symptom-associated microbes.

Interestingly, the microbes contained within the three identified microbiota profiles shared similarities at higher taxonomic levels. Twelve out of the fifteen microbes across the three profiles with VIP > 1 were in the Clostridiales order, with five of those being in the Lachnospiraceae family within the Clostridiales order (see Table S3). Though the direction of association with internalizing symptoms differed across these microbes, the strong representation of the Clostridiales order and Lachnospiraceae family parallels findings from other work on young adults with depression81. Interestingly, changes within these microbe populations have also been associated with inflammatory response to acute laboratory stressors in adults82, and are often seen in developmental work on early life adversity and the gut microbiota44,76,83, suggesting that they may be particularly susceptible to modulation by stress and may contribute to the link between exposure to adversity and development of internalizing symptoms.

While our taxonomic analyses suggested that microbes involved with inflammation, physical, and mental health symptoms were explaining most variance in the internalizing symptom-associated brain signatures, supplemental analyses that identified profiles of predicted microbiome functional pathways most strongly linked to the derived brain signatures found the strongest associations with pathways involved in cellular energy metabolism (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage and phosphate pathways)84,85. Future research using functional potential derived from shotgun metagenomics is needed to verify these findings, given the established limitations of inferring functional potential from amplicon sequencing data86.

Beyond looking at microbial profiles linked with brain signatures, we also evaluated associations between gut microbiota alpha diversity and brain signatures, finding that Faith's phylogenetic diversity at 2 years was positively associated with the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature at 6 years. While this association appeared to be driven by three participants who were high on both the brain signature and Faith's phylogenetic diversity, those individuals were part of a larger group of children who had higher Faith's diversity values in this cohort, suggesting that they represent a real subset of individuals in the sample.

One very interesting feature of this study was the fact that we saw gut microbiota profiles that were linked not only to internalizing symptom-relevant brain networks, but also to internalizing symptoms themselves, through a brain network-mediated pathway. Specifically, we found that the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature mediated the relationship between Microbial Profile 3 and internalizing symptoms. Interestingly, features comprising Microbial Profile 3, and the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature, have been associated with internalizing symptoms in other studies17,23,44,59,60,61,76,77,79,80, suggesting they may constitute an important brain-gut pathway involved in internalizing symptom expression. Our finding highlights the potential utility of the machine learning approach used in this study to accelerate the discovery of possible microbial biomarkers of later emerging mental health problems. Future studies can focus attention on these microbial features in assessments of links to internalizing problems and disorders, and ultimately in studies testing microbial interventions for internalizing symptoms.

A notable strength of this study is that it included an assessment of internalizing symptoms along with measures of the gut microbiota and brain, allowing us to anchor our analyses on our behavioral outcome of interest. However, our supplemental specificity analyses suggested that the brain signatures and microbial profiles we found in this study were not all linked specifically to internalizing symptoms in youth. The SOFA, MTL, SAL, PMN Network Connectivity Brain Signature, and Microbial Profile 1 seemed to capture contributions that were related to psychopathology generally, whereas the SOFA Between Network Connectivity Brain Signature and Microbial Profiles 2 and 3 seemed to capture contributions that were more specific to internalizing symptoms. As such, the symptom-anchored approach we used here had the intended benefit of identifying biological features that were relevant to our outcome of interest—internalizing symptoms, as well as in some cases to broader mental health outcomes. Beyond approaches that combine multidimensional biological datasets without reference to symptoms, incorporating a symptom-anchored approach can accelerate biomarker discovery by identifying symptom-relevant brain and microbial features from the outset, as opposed to identifying the most highly correlated/covarying features in general, which may or may not be symptom relevant. Another benefit of this analysis approach is that we can identify features with the strongest associations, followed by hypothesis testing, allowing for an exploratory investigation that includes the whole brain and gut microbiota community with inferential statistical tests. The prospective study design, in which we examined associations between the gut microbiota, brain, and internalizing symptoms across ages 2–7.5 years, allowed us to identify potential cascading effects of the early life gut microbiota on functional brain architecture, and on internalizing symptoms in middle childhood, an age of increased risk for internalizing symptoms4,21. Finally, our multi-ethnic sample of children living in Singapore contributes to diversity within gut microbiota research, which most often includes predominantly White samples living in North America and Western Europe.

Alongside the study's strengths, we note four important limitations. First, while our sample size was small (N = 55), our multivariate analysis method is robust to small sample sizes and a high number of predictors35,37,38,39. Nonetheless, there remains a small risk that the model was overfitted. Our findings should be replicated in larger samples with separate training and testing sets, and using complementary data analysis methods, to evaluate generalizability. Second, without repeated measures of the gut microbiota and RSFC, we were unable to test temporal ordering or change over time within the brain, gut microbiota, or internalizing symptoms. While the prospective study design allowed us to look at relations between the microbiota in early childhood and the brain in middle childhood, we don't know whether there were interventions (e.g., antibiotic exposure) that could have affected the gut microbiota in between our measurements. Thus, we speculate that the prospective associations we found might reflect programming effects or those that were resistant to intervention. Third, due to the high degree of compositional and functional diversity within a genus87, we have limited insights into the possible functions that these microbes may perform. Future studies using higher resolution sequencing methods (i.e., to the species and strain level) and examining other “-omics” layers (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) can provide additional information about the specific functional processes within the early childhood gut microbiota that are related to brain development and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood. Finally, our sample comprises children from the community, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to clinical and other populations. Consistent with this community recruitment, the rate of cases at or above threshold for clinical levels of internalizing symptoms was 16% in this study, which aligns with epidemiological rates of internalizing symptoms in children62,63.

In conclusion, we identified prospective associations between gut microbiota composition, brain functional connectivity networks, and internalizing symptoms across the early to middle childhood period. The analyses in this study using an exploratory multivariate approach followed by inferential hypothesis testing provide initial support for a role of the early life gut microbiota in shaping mental health at school age via effects on functional brain development.

Mother-child dyads participated in the GUSTO study, a large prospective mother-offspring cohort study. See Soh et al.88 and Supplementary Methods for recruitment information. The GUSTO study was approved by the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board and SingHealth Centralized Institutional Review Board in Singapore. Mothers provided informed written consent for themselves and their children to participate.

The current study includes 110 children from the GUSTO cohort who donated a usable stool sample for microbiota analysis at age 2 years, contributed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data at age 6 years, and whose caregiver reported on their internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years, of which 55 had good-quality imaging data (see MRI Data Preprocessing in the Supplementary Methods for details). Child demographics and descriptive statistics on key study variables and covariates for the included and excluded samples are presented in Tables 1–3. We did not examine sex differences or sex interactions due to the small sample size and the lack of targeted hypotheses surrounding sex differences in our research questions.

Because the largest data loss occurred due to fMRI data availability and quality (of 318 individuals with stool samples and caregiver-reported internalizing symptom data, 110 had fMRI data, and only 55 had high-quality fMRI data), we report associations between the microbiota and caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms in the sample of N = 318 with these data in the SI.

We used parent-reported child symptoms at 7.5 years on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)89 as our primary indicator of child mental health. Parent-report was chosen over child self-report as clinician assessment tends to agree more with parent-report than child-report in the age range of this study49. The current study focused on the internalizing problems subscale (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81 in this sample), which is a composite of the anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, and somatic complaints subscales. See Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Notes for symptom score preprocessing steps, potential covariates, variable missing data rates, and associations with child self-reported internalizing symptoms at a later time point.

MRI data collection and preprocessing steps are described in the SI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected from the well-validated, functionally defined Seitzman 300-ROI parcellation atlas90. Each ROI is assigned to one of 13 predefined networks: auditory (AUD), cingulo-opercular (CON), default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN), frontal parietal (FPN), MTL, parietomedial (PMN), SOFA, salience (SAL), dorsal somatomotor (SMD), lateral somatomotor (SML), ventral attention (VAN), and visual (VIS)90. For each participant, we extracted the time series of each ROI from the processed image and calculated RSFC strength using Fisher r-to-z transformation of the average correlation values between ROI-pairs within (n = 13; i.e., within-network connectivity) and between (n = 78; i.e., between network connectivity, e.g., DMN-FPN) each network. This approach has been used in previous studies examining functional network connectivity in youth90,91,92.

Gut microbiota collection, storage, DNA extraction, and sequencing steps are described in the SI. Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using USEARCH v9.2.64 at a 97% similarity threshold, and taxonomic classification was assigned to each OTU by comparing against the SILVA 123 ribosomal reference database. Microbiota data were normalized using rarefaction (depth cutoff = 5777) to account for uneven sequencing depth between samples (ten samples were removed due to having a sequencing depth shallower than the cutoff), and alpha diversity (within-individual bacterial community diversity) metrics were computed with QIIME v2.093. Alpha diversity metrics included Observed Features (richness, or number of distinct taxa within the community), Pielou Evenness (relative evenness of taxa within the community), Shannon Index (richness weighted by evenness), and Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity (genetic diversity).

As is expected for 16S rRNA sequencing, most sequences were classified to the genus level. OTUs were aggregated to the genus level for downstream analysis. Where a genus-level classification was not available, the family-level classification was used instead. Genera abundance data were pre-processed using the following steps, which are recommended prior to multi-omics analysis94: (1) an offset of 1 was added to all abundances to allow for subsequent centered-log ratio transformation; (2) pre-filtering was performed to remove rare genera where the sum of abundances were below 5% of the total abundances in the dataset, which kept 64 out of the original 353 genera in the sample; (3) centered-log ratio transformation was applied to bring the data into unbounded space for downstream analysis.

Analyses were conducted in R v4.2.395. We followed a stepwise analysis approach whereby we started from the clinical outcome of interest (caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years) and worked backwards in time, first examining internalizing symptom associations with brain networks at age 6 years (brain signatures) using a multivariate approach, then examining derived brain signature associations with the gut microbiota at age 2 years, using both a univariate (alpha diversity) and a multivariate (microbial profiles) approach, and finally statistically testing whether the microbial profiles and alpha diversity indirectly related to caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms via the brain signatures. Each analysis step is described in further detail below (after the “Covariate selection” section).

To be consistent with prior fMRI and gut microbiota psychopathology research in the GUSTO study cohort44,96, covariates were selected for inclusion a priori. These included sex, gestational age, birthweight, mean framewise displacement (MRI), delivery mode, maternal education, and diet. While three indicators of diet were ultimately used as covariates—consumption of fiber, total fat, and polyunsaturated fat—there were in fact a total of eight diet indicators from which the final three indicators were selected: consumption of total fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, saturated fat, fiber, carbohydrates, and protein in the diet, and age that the child stopped breastfeeding. To select covariates from the pool of eight diet indicators, we included those indicators that were significantly related to the microbiota, brain, and/or caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms. See Supplementary Methods for more details on the diet covariate selection process and significant associations.

Though the GUSTO study collected data on mothers' own mental health when children were aged 6 years, we chose not to control for maternal mental health in our analyses. While it is possible that mentally unwell parents may have a tendency to also report that their children are mentally unwell, correlations between parent self-reported and proxy-reported child mental health may also reflect the hereditary component of mental health97, as well as influences of the child's and parent's shared environment98. In those conditions, controlling for maternal mental health may obscure real relationships with child mental health outcomes. Instead, we opted to test for the generalizability of associations in this study to other parent-proxy-reported child mental health measures (e.g., externalizing symptoms) as well as to child self-reported depression symptoms later in development.

We employed sPLS regression to identify linear combinations of brain networks at age 6 years (predictor dataset) that maximally covaried with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms at age 7.5 years (outcome variable) using the MixOmics R package99. Briefly, sPLS regression is a multivariate integration technique similar to sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) that achieves dimension reduction using lasso penalization and maximizes the covariance between orthogonal linear combinations of features from a multivariate dataset and an outcome variable(s) using PLS components37,38. sPLS differs from sCCA in that it seeks to maximize the covariance rather than the correlation, and assumes a predictor variable or dataset and an outcome variable or dataset. Thus, it is well-suited for instances in which a clear predictor and outcome relationship can be identified, for example, in this case, due to temporal ordering.

sPLS regression models were tuned for the optimal number of brain network components and variables per component using 10-fold cross-validation repeated 100 times. The model that maximized cross-validated R2 was selected as the best-fitting. In the context of sPLS, R2 is defined as the correlation between observed caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms and internalizing symptoms predicted by the model100. Outliers (third/first quartile ± 1.5 × IQR) on any network were winsorized for that network, and model tuning was repeated on the winsorized dataset. Outlier identification details and other characteristics of participants flagged as outliers can be found in the SI. For each final tuned model, we report a Pearson's correlation between scores on the derived signature from the final model with the outcome variable, the loading of each network onto each component (which measures the relative strength of each network's contribution and the direction of its association with internalizing symptoms), the VIP of each network onto each component (which represents the percent of variance in caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms that is explained by the network divided by the total variance explained by the component), and the stability of each network (which represents how frequently the network was selected for inclusion across cross-validation repeats, or the reproducibility of the derived signatures when the training set is perturbed). We focus our interpretation on networks with stability ≥0.8, as is recommended100.

Following tuning, derived latent component scores along with covariates were entered into multiple linear regression models predicting caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms, to test the statistical significance of the components' associations with internalizing symptoms and evaluate whether these relationships were robust to the inclusion of covariates.

Next, we used sPLS regression, using the same methods as described in the previous analysis step, to identify linear combinations of genera abundances (i.e., microbial profiles) at age 2 years (predictor dataset) that maximally covaried with the latent component scores from the brain signatures (outcome variable) identified in the previous analysis step. Models were tuned and outliers were screened using the same procedures described in the SI. After microbiota component scores were derived, multiple linear regression models including latent microbiota component scores and covariates predicting latent component scores from each brain signature were run to evaluate statistical significance and robustness to covariate inclusion, as described in the previous analysis step.

To assess whether broad gut microbiota community compositional diversity was associated with the brain signatures, multiple linear regressions were run predicting each brain signature from each alpha diversity metric, controlling for covariates. Because we had 4 indicators of alpha diversity, statistically significant associations were subjected to multiple comparison correction using the Benjamin-Hochberg method101, with a q value threshold for significance of 0.25, as is recommended for biomarker discovery investigations19.

Finally, we tested whether gut microbiota features (microbial profiles and alpha diversity metrics) were indirectly associated with caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms via the derived brain signatures with simple mediation models using the PROCESS macro in R102 (Model 4), controlling for selected covariates. Total, indirect, and direct effects were estimated. The significance of indirect effects was determined using 95% confidence intervals with 5000 bootstraps.

We tested whether the microbiota and brain features that we identified to be predictive of caregiver-reported internalizing symptoms were driven by anxiety or depressive symptoms and/or also predictive of, and thus generalizable to, externalizing symptoms. We also tested whether these identified microbiota and brain features predicted child self-reported depressive or anxiety symptoms at 8.5 years of age. We also derived predicted microbiota functional profiles associated with each brain signature using predicted metagenomics from PiCRUST. Full methods and results for supplemental analyses are presented in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Notes.

Researchers in China have identified a previously unknown species of mountain lizard living in the upper Dadu River Valley, deep within the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan Province.

Years of Field Surveys Lead to a Surprise

Starting in 2018, the research team carried out extensive field surveys in the upper reaches of the Dadu River. During their expeditions, they came across a population of lizards that displayed unusual traits not seen in other known Diploderma species from the area. Detailed genetic testing and morphological comparisons confirmed their suspicions: this was a species that had never been documented before.

The scientists named it Diploderma bifluviale, a nod to its discovery site near the meeting point of two rivers, Chuosijia and Jiaomuzu.

With this finding, Diploderma bifluviale becomes the 47th recognized species of Diploderma in China. Members of this genus are found throughout East Asia and the northern Indochinese Peninsula, where they occupy a wide variety of mountain habitats.

A Unique Lizard With Distinctive Traits

Measuring about 6-7 centimeters in body length, D. bifluviale stands out with its distinctive coloring and a wheat-colored tongue -- features that set it apart from closely related species. It thrives in semi-arid shrublands and rocky, sun-exposed valleys at elevations between 2,100 and 2,500 meters. The environment it inhabits is characterized by small-leaved shrubs and scattered stones, creating the perfect camouflage for this elusive reptile.

"This discovery highlights the understudied biodiversity of the upper Dadu River," the researchers wrote in their report, published in the open-access journal ZooKeys. Their finding underscores how even in well-surveyed regions of China, nature continues to reveal new surprises.

You may be "right". What you consider to be "seeing" things in one's head may be not what's happening in that person's mind. What they call "seeing" may be something else.The best way I can describe it is essentially generating a memory. If I were instructed to picture an apple in my mind, I could imagine a hand holding up an bog standard Red Delicious. I can imagine it free-floating. And it would be much like when I remember what happened yesterday for instance. Of course, we get into whether or not we "see" the memory or not.So, if you are saying you do not consider yourself to have mental images, what, to your best ability to describe it, do you do when you remember an event?

An old post by Scott Alexander (16+ years, mind blown) discusses this, long before the term "aphantasia" became a thing [1]. There was a debate about what "imagination" actually means already in the late 1800s; some people were absolutely certain that it was just a metaphor and nobody actually "sees" things in their mind; others were vehement that mental images are just as real as those perceived with our eyes. The controversy was resolved by Francis Galton, who did some rigorous interviewing and showed that it really does vary a lot from person to person.[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/baTWMegR42PAsH9qJ/generalizi...

Same idea. You're seeing it, but you know it's just a memory of the thing, not a live view. Like pulling up a video or jpg instead of a live feed.

reply

Pull up the image on your phone and look at it. Now close your eyes and imagine the image as accurately as you can.Is it as though you didn't close your eyes at all? Do you see it the same way as when your eyes are open?

If you do not somehow "see" the shape of the candle, how do you remember its physical characteristics? Is it like a list of physical properties in abstract form?I can see, in front of me, a lit candle if I wish it. I cannot claim it's picture-perfect, but I can see it; and most people can, too. I can see its yellow flame flickering. I can see drops of wax along the candle. I can see the yellow light it casts.

Close your eyes and try to visualize an apple. Do this for 30 seconds or so. Try to visualize the skin, the reflection, the texture, the stem, the depth, etc. Try to hold a stable mental picture of that apple.After the 30 seconds, rate your ability to picture the apple from 1 to 5, where 1 is complete inability and 5 is as if you were looking at a picture of an apple for those 30 seconds. 1 is aphantasia.Another idea is to recall a vivid dream you had. I think most people would describe it as being part of a movie or reality. While awake, are you able to recreate scenes in vivid detail as if you were dreaming? 5 for complete parity and 1 for not at all. 1 is aphantasia.

For the most part, I can't “think” about things except maybe mental math. I see things, and I talk to myself in my head.

I am terrible at visual art because I struggle to picture what I am drawing before I draw it. When I do calculus problems, I have to write down in full every intermediate step because I can't visualize how the equations change more than one or two steps in the future.Those kinds of things seem to me like more objective measures of someone's ability to visualize, although I have nothing other than anecdotal evidence to back that up.

Edit: I also have trouble recognising the faces of people I've only met once or twice, and I'm assuming the two things are related.  Do you have the same?

reply

Evaluating qualia in others is extremely difficult/philosophically impossible, I have pre/post expierence with both states of being.I can still somewhat conjure up imagery from prior to the procedure series,  it almost feels like I can see them, my mother's face, my father face, kinda of, it did not effect my dreams or ability to have imagery in my edge of dreaming state, not immediately at least.I went from being very imaginative to trying to surf that half awake state in the mornings because it was such a loss.At this point it's all mostly gone. My memory is entirely text strings now.

Anecdotally I know someone with aphantasia and they report having an internal monologue.

reply

Really the only thing in my head is my internal monologue. If I'm thinking about something I've seen, it's my internal monologue "saying," with words, physical attributes I remember about it. If a song is stuck in my head, it's my internal monologue (in my own voice) signing the lyrics or my own voice humming the tune in my head. No sensation of it being the original artist or the actual instruments, it's 100% my own voice in my own head.I have a friend who says she does not have any inner monologue at all, and thinks entirely visually. I can't imagine! We're on the pretty extreme opposite ends of the spectrum of how we think, apparently.

Creative suite company Canva launched its own design model on Thursday that understands different layers and formats today to power its features. The company also introduced new product forms, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to create with its coding tool for sheets to make widgets for getting repeatable insights.

Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its elements, that would generate designs with editable layers and objects as compared to a flat image. It said the model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.

“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you're able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva's global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call.

“What we've found is that where people want to be is the ability to really marry this idea of starting with a prompt and getting far, but also being able to iterate directly themselves.”

The company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI with a chat-like interface for generating new media items using prompts earlier this year. The platform is now making that assistant available across screens, including the design and elements tabs. 

Users can also mention the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allow you to copy the art style of a design.

Earlier this year, the company added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now, it's connecting these two products, allowing users to make use of data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.

Canva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching a full-stack marketing platform called Canva Grow, which uses AI for both asset creation and analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta.

Along with AI features, the Australian design company announced some new products and features to its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to get different kinds of input from their clients or people instead of using Google Forms.  

The company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or package tracking emails that follow the brand's aesthetics. 

Canva acquired the pro design tool Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making the tool free forever for users. 

Canva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout understanding under one interface. And it's tightly integrating Affinity to Canva so designers can create objects in the pro tool and move them to the latter. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said.

The University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering is reframing what it means for its research to change the world.

In unveiling six “Grand Challenges” at its annual Research Showcase and Open House in Seattle on Wednesday, the Allen School's leaders described a blueprint for technology that protects privacy, supports mental health, broadens accessibility, earns public trust, and sustains people and the planet.

The idea is to “organize ourselves into some more specific grand challenges that we can tackle together to have an even greater impact,” said Magdalena Balazinska, director of the Allen School and a UW computer science professor, opening the school's annual Research Showcase and Open House.

Here are the six grand challenges:

Balazinska explained that the list draws on the strengths and interests of its faculty, who now number more than 90, including 74 on the tenure track. 

With total enrollment of about 2,900 students, last year the Allen School graduated more than 600 undergrads, 150 master's students, and 50 Ph.D. students.

The Allen School has grown so large that subfields like systems and NLP (natural language processing) risk becoming isolated “mini departments,” said Shwetak Patel, a University of Washington computer science professor. The Grand Challenges initiative emerged as a bottom-up effort to reconnect these groups around shared, human-centered problems. 

Patel said the initiative also encourages collaborations on campus beyond the computer science school, citing examples like fetal heart rate monitoring with UW Medicine.

A serial entrepreneur and 2011 MacArthur Fellow, Patel recalled that when he joined UW 18 years ago, his applied and entrepreneurial focus was seen as unconventional. Now it's central to the school's direction. The grand challenges initiative is “music to my ears,” Patel said.

In tackling these challenges, the Allen School has a unique advantage against many other computer science schools. Eighteen faculty members currently hold what's known as “concurrent engagements” — formally splitting time between the Allen School and companies and organizations such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2).

This is a “superpower” for the Allen School, said Patel, who has a concurrent engagement at Google. These arrangements, he explained, give faculty and students access to data, computing resources, and real-world challenges by working directly with companies developing the most advanced AI systems.

“A lot of the problems we're trying to solve, you cannot solve them just at the university,” Patel said, pointing to examples such as open-source foundation models and AI for mental-health research that depend on large-scale resources unavailable in academia alone.

These roles can also stretch professors thin. “When somebody's split, there's only so much mental energy you can put into the university,” Patel said. Many of those faculty members teach just one or two courses a year, requiring the school to rely more on lecturers and teaching faculty.

Still, he said, the benefits outweigh the costs. “I'd rather have 50% of somebody than 0% of somebody, and we'll make it work,” he said. “That's been our strategy.”

At the evening poster session, graduate students filled the rooms to showcase their latest projects — including new advances in artificial intelligence for speech, language, and accessibility.

DopFone: Doppler-based fetal heart rate monitoring using commodity smartphones

DopFone transforms phones into fetal heart rate monitors. It uses the phone speaker to transmit a continuous sine wave and uses the microphone to record the reflections. It then processes the audio recordings to estimate fetal heart rate. It aims to be an alternative to doppler ultrasounds that require trained staff, which aren't practical for frequent remote use.

“The major impact would be in the rural, remote and low-resource settings where access to such maternity care is less — also called maternity care deserts,” said Poojita Garg, a second-year PhD student.

CourseSLM: A Chatbot Tool for Supporting Instructors and Classroom Learning

This custom-built chatbot is designed to help students stay focused and build real understanding rather than relying on quick shortcuts. The system uses built-in guardrails to keep learners on task and counter the distractions and over-dependence that can come with general large language models.

Running locally on school devices, the chatbot helps protect student data and ensures access even without Wi-Fi.

“We're focused on making sure students have access to technology, and know how to use it properly and safely,” said Marquiese Garrett, a sophomore at the UW.

Efficient serving of SpeechLMs with VoxServe

VoxServe makes speech-language models run more efficiently. It uses a standardized abstraction layer and interface that allows many different models to run through a single system. Its key innovation is a custom scheduling algorithm that optimizes performance depending on the use case.

The approach makes speech-based AI systems faster, cheaper, and easier to deploy, paving the way for real-time voice assistants and other next-gen speech applications.

“I thought it would be beneficial if we can provide this sort of open-source system that people can use,” said Keisuke Kamahori, third-year Ph.D. student at the Allen School.

ConvFill: Model collaboration for responsive conversational voice agents

ConvFill is a lightweight conversational model designed to reduce the delay in voice-based large language models. The system responds quickly with short, initial answers, then fills in more detailed information as larger models complete their processing.

By combining small and large models in this way, ConvFill delivers faster responses while conserving tokens and improving efficiency — an important step toward more natural, low-latency conversational AI.

“This is an exciting way to think about how we can combine systems together to get the best of both worlds,” said Zachary Englhardt, a third-year Ph.D. student. “It's an exciting way to look at problems.”

ConsumerBench: Benchmarking generative AI on end-user devices

Running generative AI locally — on laptops, phones, or other personal hardware — introduces new system-level challenges in fairness, efficiency, and scheduling. 

ConsumerBench is a benchmarking framework that tests how well generative AI applications perform on consumer hardware when multiple AI models run at the same time. The open-source tool helps researchers identify bottlenecks and improve performance on consumer devices.

There are a number of benefits to running models locally: “There are privacy purposes — a user can ask for questions related to email or private content, and they can do it efficiently and accurately,” said Yile Gu, a third-year Ph.D. student at the Allen School.

Designing Chatbots for Sensitive Health Contexts: Lessons from Contraceptive Care in Kenyan Pharmacies

A project aimed at improving contraceptive access and guidance for adolescent girls and young women in Kenya by integrating low-fidelity chatbots into healthcare settings. The goal is to understand how chatbots can support private, informed conversations and work effectively within pharmacies.

“The fuel behind this whole project is that my team is really interested in improving health outcomes for vulnerable populations,” said Lisa Orii, a fifth-year Ph.D. student.

“Often, sweat was dripping down my back within the first two hours of a shift and would not stop dripping until the next morning,” writes Hu Anyan in the new English translation of his bestselling book I Deliver Parcels in Beijing. “I sweated so much I never once needed to pee.” This passage was on my mind as I read his book in Tianjin during one hot, Labubu brainrot summer, during which yet another unprecedented annual heat wave had forced almost everyone inside—except for the tireless couriers and delivery workers, whose services are in higher demand when temperatures soar.

Hu's writing first went viral in China five years ago, and he's now a prolific, established author in the country. While his other books, like Living in Low Places, are more about his internal life, I Deliver Parcels in Beijing is a focused, refreshing, on-the-ground account of nearly a decade of work, set against the slow simmering background of China's economic rise. In addition to his stint as a courier in Beijing, Hu also recounts his adventures opening a small snack shop, his time working as a bicycle store clerk, and his brief stint as a Taobao seller. Hu's minimal, hypnotic prose reveals the perverse beauty of tireless endurance in an increasingly precarious economy.

When people outside China read about it, it can be easy to imbue the place with a foreign otherness, as if only Chinese people are capable of working around the clock in mind-numbing conditions. Some of Hu's earlier jobs, such as running an ecommerce shop during the “golden age of Taobao,” or the frantic energy of parcel sorting do speak to the particularly Chinese context of a rapidly developing economy. Yet other elements, like the punishing precarity, the ways profit pressures twist work relationships, or the mundane angst of labor, will all be quite familiar to an American reader these days. Hu's direct writing style lays bare how toiling in a logistics warehouse, whether in Luoheng or Emeryville, are similar: the night shifts, a drink after work, petty arguments and factions, stuffing items into polypropylene bags.

Hu recently spoke to WIRED about his journey to becoming an internationally acclaimed writer, Gen-Z and tangping (lying flat) culture, and his vision of work and freedom.

Did working as a courier offer you flexibility to earn money while being a writer?

Hu Anyan: My writing and logistics work didn't happen simultaneously. For example, when I was delivering packages in Beijing or doing the night shift sorting parcels in Guangdong, I wasn't writing. I wasn't even reading, and after work I had to decompress. In my book, when I talked about the period when I read James Joyce's Ulysses and Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities, that was actually a special circumstance. At that time, our company was already in the final preparations for ceasing operations, so every day, by one or two in the afternoon, we'd already finished delivering all the goods.

For courier work, you have to clock in at 7 am. Then at night, you have to finish delivering all the packages, returning to the station to hand in remaining goods before you leave. Between 70 and 80 percent of food delivery workers in China are part-time. They don't have attendance requirements and don't need to clock in every day.

In recent years, I've seen a lot of news about robot delivery. Do you think people are anxious that robots will replace them?

In reality, there isn't much anxiety about robots replacing delivery people. My colleagues at the time didn't worry their work would be replaced by robots. Certainly other jobs, like video editing, advertising, and design might be, but for this kind of physical work, there's less of that anxiety. From what I observed, I think that the Chinese government will have more regulation than the US government to make sure automation serves people. Only if technology makes people's lives better is it useful technology. If its development makes more people live unhappily or only makes 10 percent of people live better, it actually has no value for advancement.

What were the backgrounds of your colleagues? You have a college degree, which I thought was interesting and unexpected for someone doing courier work.

For night-shift logistics sorting, probably no one had attended university, and probably only people who don't have better choices would take a job like that under those circumstances. As for couriers, there are actually people who received higher education. At my last job, our station had eight people. Besides me, one other colleague had a junior college degree, and the person who I replaced also had a junior college degree.

From my personal experience—I'm not an expert who studies social issues—I've seen that many college students in China can't find good jobs. In my last courier job, the other college graduate was actually our station manager's high school classmate. Our station manager graduated from high school, didn't attend college, and eventually found a courier job in Beijing and became the station manager. His high school classmate, who attended junior college, was recruited by our manager and worked as the manager's employee. This might not be an isolated case—many college students after graduation can't directly go into professional positions. If they look for a basic entry-level position, their income is very low, definitely lower than couriers and delivery workers.

What do you think of tangping, or lying flat culture, the social trend in China where young people reject overwork in favor of minimalist lifestyles? Your book is so eloquent in how it understands work culture. I was surprised by how diligent you were and how you made sure everyone got their packages.

I was born in the 1970s, so maybe my seriousness is mostly because of my generation's education at the time, which made us afraid to be criticized or reprimanded by company leadership or bosses. There's a feeling that people must complete their duties, not cause trouble for others, not drag others down. During my generation, China was still a planned economy, all state owned, no private sector, so many people didn't need to do career planning. Once you graduated, the school would arrange and assign your work, and you'd just do it for a lifetime. People from that time were relatively conservative, with a closed, traditional mindset.

Many people in this new generation have ideas about planning for their future. China has changed so rapidly over the past three or four decades, and much of what I say to them is already outdated, doesn't fit with their current circumstances, and has no reference value.

Lying flat culture has only appeared in China recently, why? Like I said, previously China wasn't a market economy. From the 1990s to the 2000s, after China's opening up, many people viewed making money as a main—even the only—purpose in life. From a Western perspective, Chinese people at that time probably seemed strange, they were working close to 30 days a month.

This younger generation born after the 2000s, their parents are actually all born post-'70s, even post-'80s. So from childhood, maybe they haven't experienced too much material scarcity, and don't have as much of an impulse to get what you couldn't before. Many young people feel that for making money, forming this kind of neijuan [intense competition] is a waste of life, and that you end up just living meaninglessly. The rewards you end up obtaining aren't that big.

In a lot of Chinese-language interviews, the interviewer mentions how simply you live. Do you think living simply allows one the kind of “freedom” that you express in your book?

In my thirties and after, the jobs I took occupied relatively large amounts of my time. For example, at the bicycle store in Shanghai, I worked at least 80 hours a week. You basically have no leisure time left. During this time, I only worked, and after work, I had nothing else belonging to myself. Under these circumstances, if you can't feel a sense of autonomy, sense of value in work, you easily feel a lack of existence.

For example, if you work at Foxconn, you don't assemble an entire iPhone to completion. You just screw on this one part, and only in this way is your efficiency maximized. One day, when you stop screwing on this one part, they can replace you with another person. You're just a tool, a saw blade, a hammer, a screwdriver. You're not a person with a soul, emotions, judgment, a living person. If this is the highest-income job you can find, and you might have to work in this job for the next 10, 20, 30 years to support your parents and family, you'll definitely feel despair.

Under these circumstances, the freedom I talk about is pursuing this kind of personal value you can't pursue in work. A unique thing. For example, creative pursuits are so bound to your personal uniqueness. Even if two people jointly experienced the exact same event, if you let them reflect or retell it in writing, their retelling won't be completely the same. So the freedom I mention in my book, it's not a general freedom, it's specific: not being bound by work that is uncreative or makes you just a tool.

You asked about a simple kind of life. If you pursue more economic rewards, material conditions, then the time and energy you invest in work will be more. At the end of 2019, when I was laid off from the courier company, my savings were about 100,000 yuan. Not much. But I dared not work anymore and decided to write for a while. If you have higher material pursuits, it's harder to be free, because you'll constantly invest more energy and time into making money.

Authorities busted a counterfeiting ring that resurfaced and relabeled discarded ICs.

Shenzhen authorities have dismantled a counterfeit chip operation that allegedly sold reclaimed and rebranded integrated circuits as premium imports from Infineon, Texas Instruments, and other Western semiconductor firms. According to reporting by the South China Morning Post, police spent four months investigating the ring, which resurfaced discarded chips, laser-polished their markings, and re-labeled them with high-spec part numbers before distributing them through shell companies posing as foreign agents.

At least one arrest has been made, and officials say they've begun coordinating with international suppliers to trace affected batches. The SCMP attributes the original tipoff to China's Rule-of-Law Daily, which claims the chips were targeted at downstream industries, including automotive and industrial control.

Infineon's power MOSFETs and driver ICs, alongside Texas Instruments' power controllers and op-amps, are common components in consumer graphics cards, motherboards, and power supply units, sitting at the heart of everything from voltage regulation modules and thermal management. In other words, precisely the kind of devices where a subtle defect is unlikely to surface until the system is under thermal or electrical stress.

Counterfeit chips rarely fail spectacularly out of the box. The danger is that they work just well enough to pass inspection, only to cause intermittent reboots under GPU boost, erratic fan curves, or coil whine that starts weeks after build. A swapped TI buck regulator or mislabelled Infineon MOSFET could explain failures that otherwise defy diagnosis.

If this sounds familiar, it should. In a previous sting operation, Chinese authorities seized over 40,000 fake Nvidia GPUs relabeled and sold as newer models. But while GPU scams tend to target uninformed consumers, this case is more structurally dangerous. The chips were allegedly sold B2B to downstream suppliers, meaning legitimate brands could unknowingly integrate counterfeits into otherwise reputable components.

China's tightening grip on chip imports under ongoing US export controls is part of the backdrop, with some domestic buyers having to turn to counterfeit imports after finding it difficult to source parts from Europe and the US, creating an artificial premium for “genuine” branded ICs.

In September, China's Ministry of Commerce began an anti-dumping investigation into imported American analog chips, claiming that US chip suppliers had lowered and suppressed the sale prices of Chinese products over several years. Meanwhile, authorities in the US had, according to Reuters, put location-tracking devices in advanced chip shipments at risk of diversion to China. In the same month, US authorities arrested two Chinese nationals suspected of sending millions of dollars' worth of Nvidia chips to China.

It's been an odd few years for Doctor Who, from riding on the high of its 60th anniversary heralding a splashy new partnership with Disney to bring the series around the world (and with a much bigger budget) to this week's news that said deal had undramatically fizzled out after just two seasons, with the show not making a return until a 2026 Christmas special. But a new report suggests that the BBC's deal with the House of Mouse may have been doomed to fail from almost the beginning.

An extensive new report from Deadline alleges that the BBC/Disney partnership on Doctor Who was never expected to last long-term. It claims that Disney's plans for its streaming platform, Disney+, were never an ideal fit to sustain a show as expensive as Doctor Who had become with the new partnership—and especially with the loftier expectations being put on the show's declining viewership.

According to Deadline, under the Disney deal, Doctor Who‘s per-episode budget had increased to anywhere between $8 million and $10 million. This, combined with significantly lower ratings for both the 2024 and 2025 seasons—in the U.S., the 2025 season failed to chart on Nielsen at all, while in the U.K., the per-episode average ratings were just 3.8 million, down by almost a million from the 2024 season, which itself was already coming in lower than the ratings for Jodie Whittaker's final season as the Doctor, an era itself that had seen Doctor Who‘s viewership in a state of decline.

But the report further claims that while the combination of the show's ballooning budget and its diminished ratings were primary factors behind the decision to terminate the deal, there was another lingering issue: that Disney perceived a potential growing backlash against Doctor Who‘s so-called “woke” storytelling. Disney has increasingly moved towards downplaying diverse casting or storytelling in recent years as part of the company's broader capitulation to the second Trump administration, including cutting back on diversity initiatives and regularly pressuring its own studios to cut storylines that focus on LGBTQ+ topics, especially ones putting transgender characters in the spotlight.

Doctor Who has consistently faced accusations of a supposed liberal agenda for years before such criticisms became culturally de rigueur, although the show has consistently centered values around diversity in the face of oppression over its entire 60-plus-year history. But while the latest era of the show has put those values forward on a surface level in recent years—beyond Gatwa's casting as the first Black, openly queer man to play the Doctor, the BBC has consistently defended the series' casting of trans actors such as Heartstopper‘s Yasmin Finney and drag queen Jinx Monsoon, and storylines which included queer elements such as a kiss between Gatwa and guest star Jonathan Groff—the broader storytelling of recent seasons has faced persistent criticism of its failure to consistently back those values up in meaningful ways, with stories questionably handling of allegories to topics such as Israel's genocidal invasion of Gaza and white supremacy, as well as further criticism of how the series treated the arcs of its primary female protagonists in the Doctor's companions.

Publicly, Disney has stayed quiet over this week's official disintegration of the deal, only pivoting towards the BBC's own statement about Doctor Who‘s future rather than providing their own. But sources speaking to Deadline suggest that, although it was clear the deal would not continue, Disney planned to wait to make a public announcement until after the broadcast of what is now the final piece of that 26-episode deal: the five-episode miniseries The War Between the Land and the Sea. Originally, the spinoff, focusing on a conflict between humanity and the return of an ancient precursor race of underwater creatures called the Sea Devils, was planned to broadcast in 2026; however, the BBC decided to announce the termination early, with this week's statement on the deal's end also confirming that that release schedule had moved up, and the series will now air on the BBC (and presumably Disney+) some time during the remainder of 2025.

It's been widely rumored since the climax of the 2025 season of Doctor Who—which saw Ncuti Gatwa make a shock exit as the 15th Doctor, regenerating into returning series star Billie Piper—came from significant reshoots to the previously planned series finale, and that Gatwa's exit was in part due to a frustration that potential work on a third season (Gatwa had stated in an October 2024 appearance on the Graham Norton Show that work was set to commence some time in 2025; however, the comments were cut from the final broadcast) was being stalled by Disney's indecision. The actor, who is 33, has since publicly claimed that his departure from the show was due to his increasing age and the damage the physical nature of the role had done to his body.

io9 has reached out to Disney for comment on the veracity of the details included in Deadline's report but has yet to hear back by time of publication. We'll update this post when and if we hear more.

Ten years into a dream to connect Vancouver, B.C., Seattle and Portland via a high-speed rail line, stakeholders and backers of the mega-project said Wednesday that they're still very much onboard — and to prepare for a long trip.

With a lengthy and uncertain timeline ahead, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, a speaker at the Cascadia Innovation Corridor conference in Seattle, cautioned many of those in attendance that they likely won't live long enough to see high-speed rail in the Pacific Northwest.

“When you build big things, they cost big money,” LaHood said. “It took us 50 years to build the interstate system.”

LaHood said the key is to “get on board” now so that “our children and grandchildren” will reap the benefits.

At Cascadia Innovation Corridor's annual event this week, much of the focus was on how to strengthen the cross-border partnership between three growing cities and numerous locales in between. Leaders discussed ideas around innovation, housing affordability, sustainability, and economic development. They signed a Memorandum of Reaffirmation to solidify commitments.

And Wednesday was about the enhanced transportation connectivity that could help drive it all, and the work that lies ahead in building a coalition of public and political support across the region, securing funding, jumpstarting planning, and more. Even producing videos like the new one below is part of the massive outreach under way.

Former Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire, Cascadia Innovation Corridor's chair, said that a decade ago, high-speed rail was just an idea. The next decade can be a defining one.

“You would have thought we were thinking of doing something in outer space by the reaction,” she said. “Today, it is much more than an idea, and we are actually moving forward. While we do have a long way to go, as you well know, we're funding the first phase of planning built on one of the most unique coalitions in North America.”

Envisioning a mega-region akin to Silicon Valley, in which Vancouver, Seattle and Portland are each only an hour apart, Gregoire highlighted the possibilities that could come with high-speed mobility.

“A UW student can intern in Vancouver, a family in Puget Sound can explore a job in Portland, and a cancer researcher in Vancouver can get home for dinner after a shift in Seattle,” she said. “It's a new way of living, working and connecting, one that expands what's possible for everyone who calls Cascadia home.”

The pace to make the dream a reality has been anything but high-speed. 

In 2017, Microsoft — which has an office in downtown Vancouver — gave $50,000 to a $300,000 effort led by Washington state to study a high-speed train proposal. In 2021, officials from Washington, Oregon and British Columbia signed a memorandum of understanding to form a committee to coordinate the plan.

Last year, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded the Washington State Department of Transportation $49.7 million to develop a service development plan for Cascadia High-Speed Rail. A timeline on WSDOT's website points to 2028 for estimated completion of that plan, and for 2029 and beyond it simply says, “future phases to be determined.”

Cascadia is not alone in its quest for high-speed rail.

LaHood, a Republican cabinet member in the Obama administration, recalled the former president's commitment to rail transportation. He said the Trump administration “clawing back” $4 billion in funding for California's high-speed rail project between San Francisco and Los Angeles should not be considered a “death knell,” despite challenges in that state.

LaHood pointed to Brightline train projects in Florida, connecting Orlando and Miami, and Las Vegas, with a plan to offer high-speed connectivity to Southern California. Another plan in Texas would connect Houston and Dallas. All are evidence, he said, that this mode of transportation is what Americans want in order to avoid clogged highways and airports.

“Once the politicians catch on to what the people want, boom, you get the kind of rail transportation that people are clamoring for,” LaHood said.

Here are highlights from other speakers at the conference on Wednesday:

It also disables USB functionality on RX 7900 series Type-C ports.

AMD has confirmed that its latest driver update involves sunsetting its Radeon RX 5000 Series and 6000 Series graphics cards, placing them in maintenance mode to allow delivery of new tech for its more recent offerings. "In order to focus on optimizing and delivering new and improved technologies for the latest GPUs, AMD Software Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 places Radeon RX 5000 series and RX 6000 series graphics cards (RDNA 1 and RDNA 2) in maintenance mode," the company confirmed to Tom's Hardware in a statement. While the company says that its RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 graphics cards will continue to receive critical security updates and bug fixes, new features, like the latest Battlefield 6 update, are reserved for the Radeon RX 7000 and RX 9000 series in the latest AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2.

It's not even all good news for Radeon RX 7000 series owners. Folks who have a Radeon RX 7900 series card—that's the XT or XTX—that includes a USB Type-C port on the back may be dismayed to know that the new driver disables that port's ability to power external devices. It also disables the port's ability to act as a USB port at all. Instead, it is simply an oddly-shaped DisplayPort connection now.

Why is AMD making these changes? It could certainly be down to the fact that AMD's graphics driver package is now too large to fit on two CD-ROMs. In the era of ubiquitous broadband internet, a 1.6GB driver package is arguably no big deal, but many people around the world still labor under the limitation of metered internet connections with limited transfer allowances. For reference, NVIDIA's graphics driver package is less than 900 megabytes, although some of that is no doubt because NVIDIA includes neither the Control Panel nor its new NVIDIA App in that download. For AMD's part, the company hints at focusing on its more recent product offerings as the recent for the change, as per the above statement.

Beyond those changes, the 25.10.2 driver release brings support for DirectX 12 Work Graphs to the Radeon RX 9000 series. Work Graphs are a little-used feature that essentially allows the GPU to act fully independently of the CPU by dispatching its own work. It's currently supported by Radeon RX 7000, GeForce RTX 30 series, and newer non-Intel GPUs; it's surprising to learn that Work Graphs were not supported on Radeon RX 9000 series parts until now.

 




Of course, as with any new driver release, AMD has packed in some bug fixes for the new bundle. Crashes in The Last of Us Part II, Remedy's co-op Control follow-up FBC Firebreak, and NBA 2K25's MyCareer mode should be resolved, while stuttering in Baldur's Gate 3, corruption in Serious Sam 4, and VR issues in VTOL VR should be all sewn up. Also, AMD seems to have resolved a problem where running VR headsets at 80 or 90 Hz could cause stuttering. Finally, no less than ten separate security issues have apparently been resolved in this driver.

Remaining known issues include a long-standing bug where Cyberpunk 2077 crashes when trying to play in RT Overdrive mode, intermittent crashes or driver timeouts in Battlefield 6 on certain integrated graphics, similar behavior in Roblox on RX 7000 GPUs, texture flickering in BF6 when using AMD Record and Stream, and missing Radeon Anti-Lag 2 in Counter-Strike 2 on Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. AMD says to try switching to Vulkan (by adding -vulkan to your Steam launch options) if you must have Anti-Lag 2 support in CS2.

Now, AMD has confirmed the reason for the change. In AMD's defense, Battlefield 6 already runs pretty well on Radeon RX 6000 GPUs, so there's not exactly a pressing need for that update on those cards. Still, it would be awfully early for AMD to be dropping non-security driver update support for RDNA 2.

Take your position to something of an extreme -- the Vatican could open up 200 coal power plants for its holy Bitcoin operations and still be sufficiently less impactful to CO2 than the US that nobody would target them during climate talks. Rephrased from the other direction, each US citizen would blow their CO2 budget by buying a shirt per decade to get down to the Vatican's levels.That's a common mental failure mode, analogous to the sorites paradox.

None of this sounds good for privacy and data protection.Opting out of the treaty was probably a good choice. Opting out doesn't preclude the US from cooperating with international cybercrime investigations, but it does avoid more data collection, surveillance, and sharing.

Countries like Nigeria, Morocco, North Korea and Russia signing a "cybercrime" treaty is just hilarious to me.I don't believe for a second that these countries want to crack down on cybercrime, considering their citizens are the main perpetrators and beneficiaries of it, and they've taken zero actions to prevent it before today. Lagos is essentially the Silicon Valley of internet fraud, and it happens with permission from the highest levels of their government.This obviously is just an excuse to create a global dragnet for governments looking to crack down on dissent.

Live-shopping startup Whatnot plans to grow its new Seattle outpost following a $225 million funding round announced this week.

The company aims to hire more than 75 employees in the region over the next six months — tripling its current local headcount — across product, engineering, and related roles.

Whatnot opened its downtown Seattle office earlier this year. The Los Angeles-based company, now valued at $11.5 billion (up from $5 billion a year ago), said the Seattle expansion is one of its largest talent investments to date.

Founded in 2019, Whatnot's platform mixes e-commerce and livestream entertainment. Sellers host live video shows on the Whatnot app or website, auctioning or selling products in real time. Buyers can watch, chat, and bid directly during live streams.

The New York Times described the trend as “QVC for the TikTok era.” Whatnot competes against the likes of TikTok (TikTok Shop) and Seattle-based e-commerce giant Amazon (Amazon Live). 

Whatnot facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers, and handles payments, logistics, and safety features. The company earns revenue by taking a commission — typically around 8% — on sales made by sellers ranging from independent entrepreneurs to established retailers.

Whatnot more than doubled live sales on its platform this year, to $6 billion. Buyers spend more than 80 minutes per day on Whatnot's live shows, according to the company. Whatnot is not profitable.

Some of its fastest-growing categories include beauty, women's fashion, handbags, electronics, antiques, coins, golf, snacks, and live plants.

The company's Seattle office focuses on product and engineering, including areas such as machine learning, marketplace integrity, and trust & safety. Whatnot has 900 employees across its workforce.

Dan Bear, vice president of engineering, and Kelda Murphy, vice president of talent acquisition, are both based in Seattle. Bear previously opened Seattle offices for Snap, Hulu, and CloudKitchens.

Whatnot is one of more than 130 companies that operate satellite offices in the Seattle region, tapping into the area's technical talent pool.

The company has 31 open positions on its jobs page. It is hosting an engineering and product networking event in Seattle on Nov. 4.

There is no free lunch, and traditional solar installations don't usually have a lot of light missing the panels.

reply

Traditional single axis tracking installations don't miss much light.  These provide similar characteristics in space constrained areas, which are also closer to electricity consumers, potentially reducing transmission costs.Fixed panels - common in denser areas, do miss a lot of light.

Going vertical doesn't magically increase capacity. It increases capacity for fixed surface area and if the surrounding surface area isn't needed.

Also, what's state of the art $/kwh for rooftop and “on the ground” solar?  Is $0.05 good these days?

reply

Easiest wins are code to require large commercial and industrial buildings to meet load requirements for future solar installs, parking lot canopies that are solar ready (or solar installed at time of canopy install), and in the case of residential, ground mount with low regulatory overhead and minimal to no shading.Related:NREL: Solar Installed System Cost Analysis - https://www.nrel.gov/solar/market-research-analysis/solar-in...Cheap DIY solar fence design - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45597198 - October 2025Great comment from that thread on cost breakdown (Alaska): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45692595

which is puzzling to me, because most feasible rooftop solar needs close to zero prep work to be able to mount the panels on the roof. Ground mount needs either helical screws or concrete footings, both of which are relatively expensive in terms of either material and/or labor/time.

The kW per acre metric is pretty poor for solar, especially when you get out of sunny desert areas.

> The kW per acre metric is pretty poor for solar, especially when you get out of sunny desert areas.The data says different. Broadly speaking, anywhere in the continental US is favorable for solar. The US gets more sunlight than Germany, and Germany has 101GW of solar capacity installed as of this comment (deploying ~2GW/month). You might need more panels near Canada, but panels and land are cheap, and demand for power is low due to limited population (caveats being PNW, served by hydro, and NE-ISO in New England, which is going to turn up a transmission line in December to bring 1.2GW of hydro from Québec).For comparison, the US ag industry farms almost 60 million acres for soybean and corn biofuel, and that is far less cost and resource efficient than covering that land in solar PV.Citations:EIA: Where solar is found and used - https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/solar/where-solar-is-fou...EIA: Solar and wind crush coal with 20% more power in 2025 - https://electrek.co/2025/09/24/eia-solar-and-wind-crush-coal... - September 24th, 2025EIA: Utility-Scale Generation Units Planned to Come Online Septmeber 2025 - August 2026 - https://web.archive.org/web/20251029151054/https://www.eia.g...interconnection.fyi: Active solar projects in queue - https://www.interconnection.fyi/?status=Active&type=SolarElectricity Maps - https://app.electricitymaps.com/map/live/fifteen_minutesSolar energy is now the cheapest source of power, study - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45506365 - October 2025A harmonized dataset of ground-mounted solar energy in the US with enhanced metadata - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05862-4 - September 29th, 2025https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45587816https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45507531https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43333236

This also factors heavily into where we use energy vs. where we produce it, and the associated losses. You can slot a GW of gas generation into ~350 acres anywhere. Solar you need ~5,000 acres with lots of sun. Combine this with the fact that the land where energy is used (population centers) is the land that is most expensive, and the difference becomes substantial. This also doesn't factor in energy storage costs, which is also necessary to reach parity with gas.Also, don't take this as me attacking solar, I am a huge proponent, but there is a reality check needed so people can understand why we aren't paving the earth with panels despite constant headlines of "Solar is the cheapest energy". It's the cheapest energy when in an ideal location, and overwhelming majority of people in the US don't live in an ideal location.This however doesn't really apply to non-gridscale generation. People can (and should) put panels on their roofs and batteries in their basement.

Which doesn't seem that excitingly new to me, but I don't know the industry that well.  Has nobody tried vertical alignment before?  Seems unlikely to me.[0] https://jantaus.com/

Seems largely based on the assumption that most people view PV installations as a strictly planar affair.Does my neighbor who has solar on both slopes of his pitched roof have a geometrically novel "folded plate" configuration which increases capacity by employing the biomimetic strategy of diurnal heliotropism?

It's also to add more bad noise to try to distract from the major damage they're doing. They've specifically outlined this. Overwhelm the "enemy" - in this case non-MAGA - with bad stuff so they can't focus on anything.

Somewhere over the Arctic reaches of North America, a nuclear bomber flies in a squadron, awaiting its orders. When a secret code appears on a machine in the cockpit, the crew looks at each other, stunned. The code is instructing them to attack. Ripping open a sealed envelope marked “Top Secret,” the pilot reads the name of their target: MOSCOW. They set their course. The end of the world has begun.

Or so they think. It's actually all a big mistake—the result of a computer glitch at a military base that sent the attack code to the bomber by accident. This is the premise of Sidney Lumet's 1964 masterpiece Fail Safe—a movie that asked Cold War audiences to question unbridled nuclear weapons proliferation at a time when, to many, building up a massive arsenal seemed like an imperative.

I watched Fail Safe recently to remind myself just how good it is after I was left disappointed by A House of Dynamite, Kathryn Bigelow's portrayal of a nuclear crisis, which arrived on Netflix on October 24.

Some political analysts argue that nuclear war has never been more likely than it is today. And yet, despite that ongoing threat to humanity's very existence, few films or TV shows seem to agonize about the prospect anymore. A House of Dynamite bucks the trend by thrusting nukes back into the spotlight.

In the film, radar systems detect an intercontinental ballistic missile of unknown origin barreling toward the US.

Analysis of the missile's trajectory soon reveals its likely target: Chicago. A weapon like that, government officials tell each other, could kill 10 million people on impact. Many more will likely die due to radioactive fallout created by the nuclear blast. The missile will hit in just 19 minutes, meaning there's no time to evacuate Chicago. All America can do is try to shoot down the ICBM, while contemplating catastrophe.

The first act is gripping. Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson), a senior officer in the White House Situation Room, quickly recognizes the magnitude of what is unfolding on the big board in front of her and her colleagues. We feel the urgency of each desperate action, order, and argument that follows.

But A House of Dynamite is nearly two hours long. Those 19 minutes till impact are both elongated and played out no fewer than three times, from three slightly different perspectives. In the second act, we join generals and government officials on a bizarre Zoom call as they try to work out what, if anything, they can do. And in the third act, we follow the US president, played by Idris Elba, who looks hopelessly bewildered, even before he learns about the incoming ICBM. In short, the tension gradually dries up, the script falls flat, and we never even find out what comes of it all. The ending, or lack thereof, has enraged some viewers.

In Fail Safe, by contrast, the tension never eases. The drama gradually builds to a climax that involves personal sacrifice and other dreadful choices. Some of the key people involved must finally reckon with the situation they and their colleagues have created.

In A House of Dynamite, the crisis blasts into view from outside. Some unidentified other has sent the ICBM, leaving everyone scrambling. Most of the characters are figured as victims. In Fail Safe, though, there are hotheads and war-mongers, too.

It's all the more pointed because the film is adapted from a best-selling novel that was—incredibly—first published right in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Other films released in 1964, including Seven Days in May and the better-remembered Dr. Strangelove also deal with questions around nuclear posturing and the inherent risks of nuclear proliferation.

The title Fail Safe invokes the checks and balances intended to prevent a nuclear war starting by accident. “Who checks the checker?” asks a senator on a tour of a military control room shortly before the film's crisis begins. “That's what really bothers me. The only thing everyone can agree on is that no one's responsible.” In 2025, automation seems ubiquitous—we regularly grasp for an answer to the question “Who is accountable?” when AI, or automated vehicles, go wrong. The senator's line hits even harder today than it did when it was written.

But Fail Safe also serves up a heady cocktail of human personalities and interests. There's the general who is unexpectedly horrified by nuclear weapons; the political scientist determined to eliminate any and all threats to America; and the president (Henry Fonda) who finds that, when it really matters, his supposed authority actually means nothing.

The bomber crew's orders are to ignore any commands once their attack run begins. Voices on their radios, training has told them, could be imitated by the enemy. And so as lead pilot Colonel Jack Grady (Edward Binns) nears his target, Fonda insists that he return to base, bellowing: “Damn it, Grady, this is the president!” All to no avail.

It's a situation that has been called “the human button,” in which military personnel are trained to carry out the procedures for launching a nuclear attack without hesitation or deviation. These procedures may be repeatedly rehearsed in order to induce a kind of unthinking muscle memory. The idea is that, should the order ever come in, that's it. Soldiers in silos and submarines would carry out the last rites like automatons. Then, the world will be over. It's important that the enemy knows and believes this will be the case. That's a key part of deterrence, the idea that having and maintaining a nuclear arsenal, as well as plans to use it, secures a state against possible threats from enemy states.

Many have questioned whether this chain of events would really unfold so neatly. In 1983, for instance, one real-life Russian duty officer did famously deviate from the doomsday script. Stanislav Petrov received a computer warning that several nuclear missiles had been fired toward the Soviet Union from the US. In principle, this ought to have triggered an immediate retaliatory strike against the US. But Petrov had a hunch it was a false alarm and, against protocol, chose not to alert his superiors, potentially averting Armageddon.

A House of Dynamite envisions a world where deterrence has, inexplicably, failed. Yes, this is arguably the fault of all those who have supported nuclear posturing, that's what the film's title is about. But Fail Safe is much more successful at showing how and why the worst risks come from within. It depicts the hubris and viciousness of certain individuals involved, as well as the ridiculousness of the complex systems and protocols that people put between one another. We risk losing ourselves in it all.

Early in Fail Safe, before the chilling alarms and frantic phone calls, there's a scene in which two old-school Air Force pilots hang out and play pool. One complains that younger pilots don't have the individuality, the humanity, of his generation of war-fighters.

“You could tell them apart. They were all people,” he says. “These kids … You open them up, you'll find they run on transistors.”

Ironically, the pilot who utters these words is none other than Colonel Grady, the human button who goes on to fly unwaveringly toward Moscow.

In Fail Safe, after the initial computer error, the system takes over and functions exactly as designed.

People are increasingly asking AI, not Google, to help them discover products. A recent shopping report says Americans, this holiday season, will likely turn to large language models this season to find gifts, deals, and sales instead of traditional search.

Retailers could see up to a 520% increase in traffic from chatbots and AI prompts in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the report. For brands, that means figuring out how to show up in AI-generated recommendations, and fast.

This surge in AI-driven traffic is the bet behind The Prompting Company, a YC-backed startup helping products get mentioned in AI apps through GEO (generative engine optimization), a strategy designed for a future where AI agents browse the internet on users' behalf.

The four-month-old startup, founded by Kevin Chandra, Michelle Marcelline and Albert Punama, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding and already counts Rippling, Rho, Motion, Vapi, Fondo, Kernel, and Traceloop as customers. 

“Over the past year, most of the growth on websites has come from AI bots, not people,” co-founder and CEO Chandra told TechCrunch in an interview. “We're already seeing developers ask AI tools for product recommendations inside their workflows, and we think people, over time, will be less involved in parts of the purchasing funnel.”

As AI becomes the first touchpoint for product discovery and agents eventually transact on a user's behalf, The Prompting Company believes brands must learn how to market to agents as well as humans.

What that means, according to Chandra, is that brands will need an AI-facing website, a version of their site made for agents without navigation bars, pop-ups, or marketing fluff. “Most businesses still design websites only for humans,” Chandra told TechCrunch. “But the fastest-growing segment of users on the internet today is AI agents and they need a completely different interface.”

Here's how the platform works: First, it identifies and analyzes the questions AI agents are asking by probing models to uncover specific purchase-intent queries. It then creates structured content that answers those questions and automatically routes AI agents to “AI-optimized pages.”

The Y Combinator-backed startup helps companies publish thousands of AI-friendly pages so LLMs can cite their answers even when they don't rank in traditional SEO. (YC has backed similar startups, including Relixir, Writesonic, and Bear.)

While SEO still matters, Chandra argues that GEO is quickly becoming the priority for brands. In GEO, product results surface organically based on relevance to the conversation, not paid keywords or search rankings.

This shift may also change how people buy products. Emerging protocols, including Google's Agent-to-Agent framework and OpenAI's partnership with Stripe, could further accelerate adoption by allowing AI agents to browse and complete purchases on behalf of users, moving them from discovery to transaction.

“Imagine you're a large e-commerce store. Users can buy items, make returns, compare products, or search for promotions. We help our customers expose those actions to AI agents. Right now, these agents aren't yet clicking those options or accessing APIs directly, but we expect that to change in the coming months,” said Chandra. “Once that becomes widespread and attribution improves, we see a path toward more advertising- or conversion-driven models. For now, we're focused on helping companies get discovered and recommended by AI.”

So far, The Prompting Company serves mostly fintech, developer tools, and enterprise SaaS customers. The team says a Fortune 10 company is also using its product, for which it currently hosts about half a million pages. 

Overall, traffic driven to client sites is in the double-digit millions per month. The Prompting Company uses a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of prompts tracked and pages hosted.

The company's founders, Indonesian immigrants who met as freshmen, previously built YC-backed Typedream (YC W20), a startup that allowed users to build and launch websites in minutes with AI, before Lovable and newer entrants took off (beehiiv acquired Typedream last June). The founders also built Cotter, a passwordless authentication SDK that was acquired by Stytch.

With The Prompting Company, they're trying to change how people discover and purchase products in the AI era.  The seed money, raised from Peak XV Partners, Base10, Y Combinator, Firedrop, and angels, including Logan Kilpatrick, will help the company scale its platform and partnerships as AI-powered discovery becomes the new distribution channel. The startup is also collaborating with NVIDIA on next-generation AI search.

“If your product isn't discovered or cited in ChatGPT, you're ngmi,” said Arnav Sahu, partner at Peak XV Partners. “We're thrilled to back The Prompting Company as they build the core infrastructure for product discovery—already powering Fortune 10 companies and fast-growing startups. Kevin, Michelle, and Albert are repeat YC founders, and they are awesome.”

Untapped ‘100 gigawatts of inference' is a significant asset, Tesla boss tells investors.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


During Tesla's Q3 2025 earnings call, the firm's CEO, Elon Musk, proposed that the cars take part in "a giant distributed inference fleet" to tap into their incredible compute power "if they are bored." Musk went on to estimate that, at some point, the advanced car fleet could summon "100 gigawatts of inference." Predictably, Musk's latest musings have met with a mixed response on social media. So, let's take a closer look at exactly what Musk said.

During the Q&A session, Emmanuel Rosner from Wolfe Research asked about Musk's intentions to expand the production of Tesla vehicles. He also queried what kind of incentives would be required to make such a production hike a reasonable business proposition.

Musk answered that an annualized production rate of three million vehicles should be achievable within 24 months. He added that the “single biggest expansion in production will be the Cyber Cab, which starts production in Q2 next year.” This will be a comfort-optimized automated transport vehicle, obviously targeting the cab market.

Beyond that project, the Tesla boss asserted that his team is looking closely at a killer app for new model cars with advanced processing. “If you tell someone, yes, the car is now so good, you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car. Anyone who can buy the car - will buy the car - end of story.”

Then, not for the first time, Musk heralded an “Autopilot safety game changer.” Elaborating on this, the Tesla CEO pledged, “I am 100% confident that we can solve unsupervised full self-driving at a safety level much greater than a human.”

Musk backed up his confidence by talking of the capabilities of the Tesla AI4 computer, also known as Hardware 4 (HW4). He indicated that, despite its muscle, the AI4 is already set to be eclipsed by the AI5, which outperforms it as much as 40-fold in tests. That sizable shot of extra performance boils down to facilitating autonomous driving systems that are 10x safer, it was suggested in the Q&A.

 




Using talk of computing power as a springboard, Musk then openly pondered whether the upcoming systems “might almost be too much intelligence for a car.” To address the decidedly first-world problem of owning a car “that might get bored,” the Tesla CEO went off on an interesting tangent about tapping into idle car processing power, effectively turning the Tesla fleet into a giant distributed inference network.

“One of the things I thought: if we got all these cars that maybe are bored… we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet,” Musk said.

Obviously, plucking numbers from the air, the Tesla boss went on to optimistically project that this fleet could expand to, say, 100 million vehicles, with a baseline of a kilowatt of inference capability per vehicle. “That's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with power and cooling taken with cooling and power conversion taken care of,” Musk told the financial experts on the earnings call. “So that seems like a pretty significant asset.”

At its core, Musk's idea beckons comparisons with classical distributed computing platforms, like SETI@home and Folding@home. But this Tesla fleet proposal could make an interesting commercial moon shoot idea for investors and business analysts.

Meanwhile, users will probably be more concerned about their bought and paid for vehicles being used for someone else's advantage, perhaps using extra electricity, and their computer systems enduring longer heat stress, and so on. There'd probably have to be a clear benefit for end-users to incentivize them to sign up to such a compute power-sharing scheme.

To the uninitiated, the arrests of Chauncey Billups and Damon Jones last week for allegations of involvement in rigged illegal poker games may have appeared like an unusual collision of worlds. How could prosecutors claim that former NBA players (one a current coach), professional gamblers, and even mafia members all ended up rubbing elbows as part of the same high-tech cheating scheme that allegedly began in 2019 and ran for several years?

But while some of the elements that appear to have led to a yearslong FBI investigation and sweeping arrests are certainly unique, underground poker games like these are somewhat commonplace. They're often fueled by celebrities—the role prosecutors say Billups and Jones played here. They're often backed or otherwise aided by organized crime. And they still regularly feature seedy characters running schemes, chief among which is cheating.

I dug inside the underbelly of private high-stakes poker games to find out how they work, why they're often targets for the mob or other sordid characters, and why the Billups Games appear to be an especially unique kind of scam.

Like with many elements of their lives, privacy is often paramount for celebrities who want to gamble. That's how these private games typically get started.

“The general ecosystem is such that there are athletes, celebrities, wealthy businessmen, and the sort that are high-profile individuals that want to gamble but don't necessarily want to do it under the constructs of a casino setting,” says Matt Berkey, a well-known poker professional who has played in private games like these for years. “It's a social setting. Usually there's party favors, girls, all the things you can't have at the casino.”

Even in “straight” games that involve no cheating, celebrities like Billups and Jones (also often referred to as “whales”) are typically the straws that stir the drink. They're generally wealthy and relative poker amateurs. Others in the game are often there explicitly to play alongside them. Conditions of the game are catered to their whims.

When professional poker players are invited to fill seats in the game, the celebrities often dictate this process too. Pros are often invited specifically because a whale has seen them on TV or because they're known to be fun and willing to give plenty of action despite their skill advantage.

To the outside eye, that appears to have been how the Billups Game allegedly took shape.

“I heard about it back then, when it first happened. I think a lot of people in the community heard about it, because it just popped up out of nowhere,” says Ryan Feldman, owner and producer of Hustler Casino Live, a popular livestreamed poker broadcast. Feldman has played high-stakes poker for years, including in private home games like these (though never specifically in the Billups Games, he says).

“As an NBA fan, I thought it was cool,” Feldman says. “I was also intrigued, because I know Chauncey, I used to work with him at ESPN. I thought it was cool that he was suddenly into poker. I had a friend or two that I knew of that played in the game.”

Only certain kinds of poker pros end up in games like these. Some steer clear altogether, preferring the more regulated casino atmosphere that includes extensive surveillance, security, and the backstop of government oversight. Two well-known poker tournament professionals who asked to remain anonymous told me that in their position, receiving invites to these kinds of games is more of a red flag than anything. “If I ever get invited to a game like that, I assume it's because they intend to cheat or rob me,” one says.

Others are willing to attend if they're confident in the game's trustworthiness. The high-stakes poker community is relatively small, and word-of-mouth information from trusted sources can help cautious players avoid the seedier games.

In the case of the Billups Games, at least some segments of that high-stakes community were suspicious almost immediately. Berkey, for instance, tells me he declined an invite specifically due to cheating concerns. (In the federal indictment, Billups was charged with several counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy.)

My sources tell me that their decisions about whether to attend these games revolve around their trust—or lack of it—in the host, or the “game runner.” Pros who attend need to know the host is running a straight game; a track record with established players is naturally important.

These hosts are often people with “a network of some capacity,” as Berkey puts it, both among the wealthy and the gambling communities. “If you look at Molly, who ran Molly's Game, she was just very well-to-do and connected in the LA scene,” Berkey says of Molly Bloom, the titular character of both a book and movie involving her life as a host in the high-stakes poker world. “She then was able to expand that out into New York City until ultimately she got taken down.”

The host's role in these games can be quite fraught.

“When you're talking about home games, the phrase ‘absolute power corrupts absolutely' kind of applies here,” Berkey asserts. “Because you're fully at the hands of whoever is hosting the game … They're in control of the dealers, they're in control of the decks, they're in control of the tables, the shuffle machines.”

They're also in charge of the books, and that's where the drama often begins.

These aren't casinos with cages, cameras, and fully monitored methods of depositing and withdrawing money. Credit is regularly utilized, both to appease players and to avoid issues with traceable movements of large cash sums.

“People don't always pay,” Berkey says. “And when that becomes an issue, now it's the host's job to make good on the books in some capacity, otherwise they're going to lose all their clientele.”

Enter the mafia, who, in addition to running some of the poker games, often fill a role they're well known for in popular culture: settling debts.

“Say you have someone who loses a lot of money,” says Zach Jensen, a content developer and mafia expert at Las Vegas' Mob Museum. “Getting them to pay up, the mob can step in and do that. Extortion, intimidation, and violence too.”

As Jensen explains it, the mob may not be anywhere near the size or power of its one-time might. It operates in a more under-the-radar manner today. But it's still very active in many of its old tricks, and illegal gambling remains a big part of the picture.

In fact, at least one name that appears in the Billups indictment has roots in the mafia's glory days.

“There's an Angelo Ruggiero Jr. listed in there,” Jensen says. “His father, Angelo Ruggiero, also known as ‘Quack Quack,' was a close friend of John Gotti and part of his crew.”

Those who fall into pits of recurring debt are common targets for further exploitation.

“They're going to want to collect that debt, and they might work with you,” Jensen says. What they might do, he alleges, “especially if you're a player in the NBA, they might say, ‘You owe me a lot of money, but I can knock some of that off if you do something for me during your next game.'”

Whether these or other types of motivations led to Billups' and Jones' alleged involvement in rigging these poker games is impossible to glean based on the information we have today. But the indictment clearly alleges both were active participants in the scam.

Both allegedly served as “face cards” to draw other players to the game, not an unusual role for celebs even in more legitimate settings. Here, though, both former athletes allegedly knew they were front men helping lend faux legitimacy to a fixed game—a level of perceived legitimacy that may have caused other players to let their guard down.

None of the cheating methods alleged in the indictment are new, necessarily. Each, though, underscores the general depth and complexity of the scheme.

One alleged method involves use of “electronic poker chip trays” or cell phones that could read cards placed on the table, which were initially identified by some outlets and social media posts as “x-ray technology.” Those in poker circles, though, believe something was lost in translation here; this likely refers to the use of RFID card reader technology that's also used to livestream poker on TV or YouTube.

Use of card decks marked on their reverse sides with invisible ink only seen by special glasses or contact lenses is another alleged strategy, allowing the wearer perfect knowledge of everyone's cards at the table. This is another that's been well-known in poker circles for some time; these products aren't hard to find online. They also aren't especially sophisticated.

“Those decks are really cheap,” Berkey says. “It means they were using, like, a gas station deck, basically. Anybody who's not an idiot should have figured out that deck wasn't any good.”

Again, though, many players apparently didn't spot the tell—perhaps because playing with a legend like Billups distracted them.

Another alleged method is the use of a rigged card shuffling machine. The Deckmate 2, the most popular shuffling machine used in casinos and in private card games today, can be altered to give potential cheaters knowledge of the cards in each player's hand. WIRED and researchers from IOActive recently teamed up to show how a compromised Deckmate 2 machine can be used to cheat at poker as a proof of concept.

“If I'm ever at a private game where I think something might be possibly shady, and they're using a Deckmate 2, I would not want to play,” Feldman says. “I've always advised friends, if you're at a private game and you think it might be shady, and you see a Deckmate 2, just run. There's no reason for it in a private game. It's just too risky.”

Berkey says virtually all of these alleged cheating methods almost certainly require host involvement—and the help of others.

One role alleged here was the “Operator,” an individual located off-site who obtained hand-by-hand card information via whichever form of cheating technology was being used in the game. According to the indictment, the Operator purportedly communicated that info to the “Quarterback” or “Driver” in the game, who then used predetermined signals to share it with other members of the team and direct their actions at the table.

Scams like these aren't going anywhere as long as illegal gambling exists, with its various opportunities to exploit greed and dishonesty. But those in the poker world actually see a silver lining to cases like these being publicly exposed.

“Normally when there's cheating in poker, it's really hard to catch the people or do anything about it,” Feldman says. He says this is the first time he's heard of people “getting in trouble” for allegedly manipulating a poker game. “It at least puts that warning out there to other people that try and cheat at poker, like hey, if you do this there's a chance that you could go to jail.”

In late September, a federal worker based abroad learned that her husband, who is also a federal worker and a military veteran, had “high risk, very aggressive cancer.” Doctors told the couple that the cancer needed to be removed immediately or it would no longer be treatable.

Her husband is covered by TRICARE, the health care program offered to members of the military and veterans. “You basically pay upfront, and then you're reimbursed,” says the federal worker, who asked to remain anonymous as she is not authorized to speak to the press. “Typically with big surgeries like this, you get preapproval and the payment process is easier,” she says.

But on October 1, just days before her husband went in for surgery, the government shut down. This meant that his claims can't be paid until the government reopens. “As soon as the shutdown happened I didn't hear from any more [TRICARE] representatives. I've tried to call and can't get anyone on the phone,” says the federal worker. The couple is out tens of thousands of dollars.

These are just two of the 750,000 furloughed federal workers trying to make ends meet as the government reaches 30 days in shutdown. WIRED spoke with more than a dozen federal workers who have struggled through the last few weeks and described picking up side gigs, taking advantage of free food programs, or working under demoralizing conditions to survive.

Food banks and other organizations like chef José Andrés' World Central Kitchen have stepped in to try and soften the blow for furloughed feds, offering free meals. But on entering Andrés' DC restaurant Jaleo, a Justice Department employee says, they were overwhelmed with a feeling of despair. Sitting along the restaurant's bar were feds quietly eating free sandwiches. “Something about that was really sad to me,” says the Justice Department worker. “It just felt like, wow, we really are just abused people.”

To make up for the missed pay, some workers are picking up side gigs, like babysitting or playing live music, to earn extra cash.

“I'm worried about my mortgage as I don't have much in savings, but I'm fortunate to make some cash [with] random backup gigs around town and have a partner who can help some. I am very fortunate, so trying to help colleagues who I know don't have that support,” says one General Services Administration worker.

“I've really generously had some friends with babysitting offers,” says a National Institutes of Health worker. “There are avenues in which I can try to make some extra money here and there. But of course, that's a drop in the bucket, and compared to my normal paychecks, it's not really cutting it.”

Employees are also concerned about the impact of the shutdown on their families. A Department of Commerce employee tells WIRED that the stress of the shutdown is filtering into life at home. “We are a full fed family. This administration, during this shutdown, is about as anti-family as I have seen any public institution be,” they say, noting that the drain on morale has made it hard to keep things light at home. “The one suffering? Our kid. We do our best to talk through it, and we have a good history of resiliency around big moves, but we know our kiddo isn't even getting close to the best that we could be doing for her.”

“We're making do with less while telling our kids why we can't afford certain things right now,” a Department of Labor employee tells WIRED, who says that with their income eliminated, their family has lost 65 percent of its income. “We are asked daily if we're going to visit family out of state for Thanksgiving, and we say we don't know.”

Even for the “excepted” federal employees who are still working (with or without pay), the picture appears bleak. Without other “non-essential” staff, federal workers tell WIRED it's impossible to move projects forward, meaning that even when the government reopens, systems will likely be backlogged. “Paperwork is piling up and will take a lot of time to untangle, just like during the Covid snarl,” says one employee at the Internal Revenue Service. “We verify certain statuses for government contractors, nonprofits, and state and local services, like firefighters and police, so they can receive subsidies to keep them open. It is already affecting them and will only get worse.”

One employee at the Social Security Administration says that their whole team has been working without pay during the shutdown. “Furloughed employees may be able to claim unemployment compensation or seek temporary employment,” they say, but excepted employees can't do that. “We have all the costs associated with working, such as commuting costs and daycare expenses, without the paycheck to cover these costs.”

And while federal workers are supposed to receive back pay when the government reopens, they're going into debt just to make it through each day. “We will not be compensated for the interest we pay on our credit cards, nor for the hit our credit scores take,” they say.

A FEMA worker tells WIRED that without savings, they've had to charge most expenses to a credit card; they applied for a 0 percent interest shutdown loan from a credit union, but are still waiting for the cash to hit their account. The government, they said, has not been helpful in providing resources.

“All the info I'm getting is from grassroots groups,” they said. They recently learned about a possible credit from the Salvation Army that would help pay utilities and are signing up for that.

“Last week, I actually thought, what if it never reopens? It doesn't seem like anyone is working for it to reopen, and the impacts aren't being felt by the general public,” says an employee with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). “If it does reopen, will they repay us?”

Some government workers first looked at the shutdown as a welcome reprieve from the chaos of the last 10 months; amid an Elon Musk-tinged takeover, they've weathered several rounds of RIFs, or reduction in force, emails encouraging resignations, and taken on heftier workloads to compensate for the smaller workforce already this year.

“This is the only breath and moment of happiness I've felt in almost a year, and the guilt of admitting that eats me alive, when I'm not able to keep myself numb from it,” one GSA worker tells WIRED. For many, that relief faded when it became clear that the shutdown wasn't ending anytime soon.

“When the shutdown began, I was grateful for downtime. Hearing the birds singing during the day brought tears to my eyes,” says the HUD employee. “I thought I could rest, get ahead on Christmas shopping, and cover some days the kids are out of school. I've been through this. But as it progresses with no end in sight, I'm scared to spend money.”

The federal worker abroad says that the shutdown has been “disheartening” and enraging. Like many federal employees who spoke to WIRED, she says she doesn't blame the Democrats for the shutdown, but is instead looking at Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House. “If I missed deadlines on my budgets, like he has, and if I just decided not to come into work and locked the door to my office, I would get a performance improvement plan, and I would have to prove that I could do my job. And if I didn't do that, I would be fired. We took the same oath, we're both federal employees. He is getting paid. I am not. He is getting health care. I am NOT.” (Johnson's office did not reply to a request for comment as to whether he is still collecting his paycheck.)

“I met my husband at the entrance of the East Wing,” she added. “It's gone. And I feel like the rest of the country is going with it.”

The Thunderbolt 4 NAS, powered by an Intel processor, is now available with capacities of 9.6TB or 19.2TB.

The TBS-h574TX supports standard M.2 2280 and enterprise E1.S SSDs. The NAS employs a simple hot-swappable design that simplifies drive upgrades and replacements. It supports up to five SSDs. Two tiny 40mm cooling fans provide active airflow. While you can purchase the TBS-h574TX and install your own drives, QNAP's pre-configured option may be more convenient for those seeking to avoid the complexities of purchasing and installing compatible drives.

The 9.6TB configuration comprises five 1.92TB E1.S drives, while the 19.2TB configuration offers a per-drive capacity increase to 3.84TB. The mentioned capacity is with a RAID 0 array without drive redundancy. A RAID 5 configuration, which is the more common configuration, provides approximately 7.68TB or 15.36TB, respectively. The NAS employs QNAP-branded drives; however, the vendor does not specify the manufacturer. Notable manufacturers of E1.S drives include Solidigm, Kioxia, and Micron, but it remains unclear which, if any, QNAP uses.

The device employs a PCIe 3.0 x2 interface; therefore, although newer and faster drives may be used, their performance will be limited by the slower interface. QNAP's internal testing with five 3.84TB E1.S PCIe 4.0 SSDs in a RAID 5 array delivers sequential read and write speeds of approximately 1,400 MB/s. The vendor claims 4K random write speeds of up to 70,000 IOPS.

QNAP offers the TBS-h574TX with three different processor options; however, the company only provides the pre-installed configuration featuring the Core i5-1235U, a processor from the 12th Generation Alder Lake series. The ten-core processor features two P-cores and eight E-cores, with a maximum turbo frequency of 4.4 GHz. The integrated Iris Xe graphics engine handles hardware decoding, encoding, and transcoding.

The Core i5-1235U represents a downgrade, especially since QNAP sells a variant of the TBS-h574TX equipped with a Core i5-1340PE (Raptor Lake), which is newer and more powerful. The only rationale we can think of for QNAP not utilizing the Core i5-1340PE is to minimize costs. The vendor pairs the Core i5-1235U with 16GB of soldered memory.

The TBS-h574TX's networking capabilities encompass a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port and a high-speed 10 Gigabit Ethernet port. Although the NAS is equipped with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, it also offers a standard USB 2.0 port and two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports supporting 10 Gbps data transfer. The sole display output is a single HDMI 1.4b port, which is suitable for up to 4K (3840x2160) at 30 Hz. The TBS-h574TX typically draws around 46W of power. The device comes with a 120W power adapter.

The TBS-h574TX-i5UC-05S01-US, the 9.6TB model, sells for $2,899 on QNAP's official website. Since the company does not offer a standalone Core i5-1235U model, it is impossible to determine the individual value of the five E1.S SSDs. However, by referencing the Core i5-1340PE model, the estimated cost per drive is approximately $290. The TBS-h574TX-i5UC-05S02-US, which has the largest storage capacity (19.2TB), comes with an even more eye-watering price tag at $4,399. Essentially, you are paying 52% more for double the storage capacity, which may be considered a reasonable offer when evaluated objectively.

QNAP offers a standard three-year warranty for the TBS-h574TX. Conversely, the E1.S drives are covered by an extended five-year warranty or until they reach the TBW rating — whichever occurs first. The specific TBW rating remains undisclosed, as QNAP does not specify the manufacturer or model of the drives used.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth reminiscent of more explicitly outlandish and fantastical schemes.

Are you feeling it?

I hear it's close: two years, five years—maybe next year! And I hear it's going to change everything: it will cure disease, save the planet, and usher in an age of abundance. It will solve our biggest problems in ways we cannot yet imagine. It will redefine what it means to be human. 

Wait—what if that's all too good to be true? Because I also hear it will bring on the apocalypse and kill us all … 

Either way, and whatever your timeline, something big is about to happen. 

We could be talking about the Second Coming. Or the day when Heaven's Gaters imagined they'd be picked up by a UFO and transformed into enlightened aliens. Or the moment when Donald Trump finally decides to deliver the storm that Q promised. But no. We're of course talking about artificial general intelligence, or AGI—that hypothetical near-future technology that (I hear) will be able to do pretty much whatever a human brain can do.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's series “The New Conspiracy Age,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.

For many, AGI is more than just a technology. In tech hubs like Silicon Valley, it's talked about in mystical terms. Ilya Sutskever, cofounder and former chief scientist at OpenAI, is said to have led chants of “Feel the AGI!” at team meetings. And he feels it more than most: In 2024, he left OpenAI, whose stated mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity, to cofound Safe Superintelligence, a startup dedicated to figuring out how to avoid a so-called rogue AGI (or control it when it comes). Superintelligence is the hot new flavor—AGI but better!—introduced as talk of AGI becomes commonplace.

Sutskever also exemplifies the mixed-up motivations at play among many self-anointed AGI evangelists. He has spent his career building the foundations for a future technology that he now finds terrifying. “It's going to be monumental, earth-shattering—there will be a before and an after,” he told me a few months before he quit OpenAI. When I asked him why he had redirected his efforts into reining that technology in, he said: “I'm doing it for my own self-interest. It's obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”

He's far from alone in his grandiose, even apocalyptic, thinking. 

Every age has its believers, people with an unshakeable faith that something huge is about to happen—a before and an after that they are privileged (or doomed) to live through.  

For us, that's the promised advent of AGI. People are used to hearing that this or that is the next big thing, says Shannon Vallor, who studies the ethics of technology at the University of Edinburgh. “It used to be the computer age and then it was the internet age and now it's the AI age,” she says. “It's normal to have something presented to you and be told that this thing is the future. What's different, of course, is that in contrast to computers and the internet, AGI doesn't exist.”

And that's why feeling the AGI is not the same as boosting the next big thing. There's something weirder going on. Here's what I think: AGI is a lot like a conspiracy theory, and it may be the most consequential one of our time.

I have been reporting on artificial intelligence for more than a decade, and I've watched the idea of AGI bubble up from the backwaters to become the dominant narrative shaping an entire industry. A onetime pipe dream now props up the profit lines of some of the world's most valuable companies and thus, you could argue, the US stock market. It justifies dizzying down payments on the new power plants and data centers that we're told are needed to make the dream come true. Fixated on this hypothetical technology, AI firms are selling us hard. 

Just listen to what the heads of some of those companies are telling us. AGI will be as smart as an entire “country of geniuses” (Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic); it will kick-start “an era of maximum human flourishing, where we travel to the stars and colonize the galaxy” (Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind); it will “massively increase abundance and prosperity,” even encourage people to enjoy life more and have more children (Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI). That's some product.

Or not. Don't forget the flip side, of course. When those people are not shilling for utopia, they're saving us from hell. In 2023, Amodei, Hassabis, and Altman all put their names to a 22-word statement that read: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Elon Musk says AI has a 20% chance of annihilating humans. 

“I've noticed recently that superintelligence, which I thought was a concept you definitely shouldn't mention if you want to be taken seriously in public, is being thrown around by tech CEOs who are apparently planning to build it,” says Katja Grace, lead researcher at AI Impacts, an organization that surveys AI researchers about their field. “I think it's easy to feel like this is fine. They also say it's going to kill us, but they're laughing while they say it.”

You have to admit it all sounds a bit tinfoil hat. If you're building a conspiracy theory, you need a few things in the mix: a scheme that's flexible enough to sustain belief even when things don't work out as planned; the promise of a better future that can be realized only if believers uncover hidden truths; and a hope for salvation from the horrors of this world. 

AGI just about checks all those boxes. The more you poke at the idea, the more it starts to look like a conspiracy. It's not, of course—not exactly. And I'm not drawing this parallel to dismiss the very real, often jaw-dropping results achieved by many people in this field, including (or especially) the AGI believers. 

But by zooming in on things that AGI has in common with genuine conspiracies, I think we can bring the whole concept into better focus and reveal it for what it is: a techno-utopian (or techno-dystopian—pick your pill) fever dream that got its hooks into some pretty deep-seated beliefs that have made it hard to shake.

This isn't just a provocative thought experiment. It's important to question what we're told about AGI because buying into the idea isn't harmless. Right now, AGI is the most important narrative in tech—and, to some extent, in the global economy. We can't make sense of what's going on in AI without understanding where the idea of AGI came from, why it is so compelling, and how it shapes the way we think about technology overall. 

I get it, I get it—calling AGI a conspiracy isn't a perfect analogy. It will also piss a lot of people off. But come with me down this rabbit hole and let me show you the light. 

A typical conspiracy theory usually starts out on the fringes. Maybe it's just a couple of people posting on a message board, gathering “evidence.” Maybe it's a few people out in the desert with binoculars waiting to spot some bright lights in the sky. But some conspiracy theories get lucky, if you will: They start to percolate more widely; they start to become a bit more acceptable; they start to influence people in power. Maybe it's the UFOs (ahem, sorry, “unidentified aerial phenomena”) that are now formally and openly discussed in government hearings. Maybe it's vaccine skepticism (yes, a much more dangerous example) that becomes official policy. And it's impossible to ignore that artificial general intelligence has followed a pretty similar trajectory to its more overtly conspiratorial brethren. 

Let's go back to 2007, when AI wasn't sexy and it wasn't cool. Companies like Amazon and Netflix (which was still sending out DVDs in the mail) were using machine-learning models, proto-organisms to today's LLM behemoths, to recommend movies and books to customers. But that was more or less it.

Ben Goertzel had far bigger plans. About a decade earlier, the AI researcher had set up a dot-com startup called Webmind to train what he thought of as a kind of digital baby brain on the early internet. Childless, Webmind soon went bust.

But Goertzel was an influential figure in a fringe community of researchers who had dreamed for years of building humanlike artificial intelligence, an all-purpose computer program that could do many of the things people can do (and do them better). It was a vision that went far beyond the kind of tech that Netflix was experimenting with.

Goertzel wanted to put out a book promoting that vision, and he needed a name that would set it apart from the humdrum AI of the time. A former Webmind employee named Shane Legg suggested Artificial General Intelligence. It had a ring to it.

A few years later, Legg cofounded DeepMind with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman. But to most serious researchers at the time, the claim that AI would one day mimic human abilities was a bit of a joke. AGI used to be a dirty word, Sutskever told me. Andrew Ng, founder of Google Brain and former chief scientist at the Chinese tech giant Baidu, told me he thought it was loony.

So what happened? I caught up with Goertzel last month to ask how a fringe idea went from crackpot to commonplace. “I'm sort of a complex chaotic systems guy, so I have a low estimate that I actually know what the nonlinear dynamic in the memosphere really was,” he said. (Translation: It's complicated.) 

Goertzel reckons a few things took the idea mainstream. The first is the Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, an annual meeting of researchers that he helped set up in 2008, the year after his book was published. The conference was often coordinated with top mainstream academic meetups, such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference and the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. “If I just published a book with that name AGI, it possibly would have just come and gone,” says Goertzel. “But the conference was circling through every year, with more and more students coming.”

Next is Legg, who took the term with him to DeepMind. “I think they were the first mainstream corporate entity to talk about AGI,” says Goertzel. “It wasn't the main thing they were harping on, but Shane and Demis would talk about it now and then. That was certainly a source of legitimation.”

When I first talked to Legg about AGI five years ago, he said: “Talking about AGI in the early 2000s put you on the lunatic fringe … Even when we started DeepMind in 2010, we got an astonishing amount of eye-rolling at conferences.” But by 2020 the wind had changed. “Some people are uncomfortable with it, but it's coming in from the cold,” he told me.

The third thing Goertzel points to is the overlap between early AGI evangelists and Big Tech power brokers. In the years between shutting down Webmind and publishing that AGI book, Goertzel did some work with Peter Thiel at Thiel's hedge fund Clarium Capital. “We talked a bunch,” says Goertzel. He recalls spending a day with Thiel at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. “I was trying to drum AGI into his head,” says Goertzel. “But then he was also hearing from Eliezer how AGI is going to kill everybody.”

That's Eliezer Yudkowsky, another influential figure who has done at least as much as Goertzel, if not more, to push the idea of AGI. But unlike Goertzel, Yudkowsky thinks there's a very high chance—99.5% is one number he throws out—that the development of AGI will be a catastrophe.  

In 2000, Yudkowsky cofounded a nonprofit research outfit called the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (later renamed the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), which pretty quickly dedicated itself to preventing doomer scenarios. Thiel was an early benefactor. 

At first, Yudkowsky's ideas didn't get much pickup. Recall that back then the idea of an all-powerful AI—let alone a dangerous one—was pure sci-fi. But in 2014, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, published a book called Superintelligence.

“It put the AGI thing out there,” says Goertzel. “I mean, Bill Gates, Elon Musk—lots of tech-industry AI people—read that book, and whether or not they agreed with his doomer perspective, Nick took Eliezer's concepts and wrapped them up in a very acceptable way.”  

“All of these things gave AGI a stamp of acceptability,” Goertzel adds. “Rather than it being pure crackpot stuff from mavericks howling out in the wilderness.”

Yudkowsky has been banging the same drum for 25 years; many engineers at today's top AI companies grew up reading and discussing his views online, especially on LessWrong, a popular hub for the tech industry's fervent community of rationalists and effective altruists.

Today, those views are more popular than ever, capturing the imagination of a younger generation of doomers like David Krueger, a researcher at the University of Montreal who previously served as research director at the UK's AI Security Institute. “I think we are definitely on track to build superhuman AI systems that will kill everybody,” Krueger tells me. “And I think that's horrible and we should stop immediately.”

Yudkowsky gets profiled by the likes of the New York Times, which bills him as “Silicon Valley's version of a doomsday preacher.” His new book, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, written with Nate Soares, president of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, lays out wild claims, with little evidence, that unless we pull the plug on development, near-future AGI will lead to global Armageddon. The pair's position is extreme: They argue that an international ban should be enforced at all costs, up to and including the point of nuclear retaliation. After all, “datacenters can kill more people than nuclear weapons,” Yudkowsky and Soares write.

This stuff is no longer niche. The book is an NYT bestseller and comes with endorsements from national security experts such as Suzanne Spaulding, a former US Department of Homeland Security official, and Fiona Hill, former senior director of the White House National Security Council, who now advises the UK government; celebrity scientists such as Max Tegmark and George Church; and other household names, including Stephen Fry, Mark Ruffalo, and Grimes. Yudkowsky now has a megaphone. 

Still, it is those early quiet words in certain ears that may prove most consequential. Yudkowsky is credited with introducing Thiel to DeepMind's founders, after which Thiel became one of the first big investors in the company. Having merged with Google, it is now the in-house AI lab for the tech colossus Alphabet. 

Alongside Musk, Thiel was also instrumental in setting up OpenAI in 2015, sinking millions into a startup founded on the singular ambition to build AGI—and make it safe. In 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “eliezer has IMO done more to accelerate AGI than anyone else. certainly he got many of us interested in AGI.” Yudkowsky might one day deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for that, Altman added. But by this point, Thiel had apparently grown wary of the “AI safety people” and the power they were gaining. “You don't understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your company to believe in that stuff,” he is reported to have told Altman at a dinner party in late 2023. “You need to take this more seriously.” Altman “tried not to roll his eyes,” according to Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey.

OpenAI is now the most valuable private company in the world, worth half a trillion dollars. 

And the transformation is complete: Like all the most powerful conspiracies, AGI has slipped into the mainstream and taken hold.    

The term “AGI” may have been popularized less than 20 years ago, but the mythmaking behind it has been there since the start of the computer age—a cosmic microwave background of chutzpah and marketing. 

Alan Turing asked if machines could think only five years after the first electronic computer, ENIAC, was built in 1945. And here's Turing a little later, in a 1951 radio broadcast: “It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control.”

Then, in 1955, the computer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues applied for US government funding to create what they fatefully chose to call “artificial intelligence”—a canny spin, given that computers at the time were the size of a room and as dumb as a thermostat. Even so, as McCarthy wrote in that funding application: “An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.”

It's this myth that's the root of the AGI conspiracy. A smarter-than-human machine that can do it all is not a technology. It's a dream, unmoored from reality. Once you see that, other parallels with conspiracy thinking start to leap out.

Talking about AGI can sometimes feel like arguing with an enthusiastic Redditor about what drugs (or particles in the sky) are controlling your mind. Each point has a counterpoint that tries to chip away at your own sense of what's true. Ultimately, it's a clash of worldviews, not an exchange of evidence-based reason. AGI is like that, too—it's slippery. 

Part of the issue is that despite all the money, all the talk, nobody knows how to build it. More than that: Most people don't even agree on what AGI really is—which helps explain how people can get away with telling us it can both save the world and end it. At the core of most definitions you'll find the idea of a machine that can match humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks. (And remember, superintelligence is AGI's shiny new upgrade: a machine that can outmatch us.) But even that's easy to pull apart: What humans are we talking about? What kind of cognitive task? And how wide a range?

“There's no real definition of it,” says Christopher Symons, chief artificial intelligence scientist at the AI health-care startup Lirio and former head of the computer science and math division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “If you say ‘human-level intelligence,' that could be an infinite number of things—everybody's level of intelligence is slightly different.” 

And so, says Symons, we're in this weird race to build … what, exactly? “What are you trying to get it to do?”

In 2023, a team of researchers at Google DeepMind, including Legg, had a go at categorizing various definitions that people had proposed for AGI. Some said that a machine had to be able to learn; some said that it had to be able to make money; some said that it had to have a body and move about in the world (and maybe make coffee).  

Legg told me that when he'd suggested the term to Goertzel for the title of his book, the hand-waviness had been kind of the point. “I didn't have an especially clear definition. I didn't really feel it was necessary,” he said at the time. “I was actually thinking of it more as a field of study, rather than an artifact.”

So, I guess we'll know it when we see it? The problem is that some people think they've seen it already.

In 2023, a team of Microsoft researchers put out a paper in which they described their experiences playing around with a prerelease version of OpenAI's large language model GPT-4. They called it “Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence”—and it polarized the industry. 

It was a moment when a lot of researchers were blown away and trying to come to terms with what they were seeing. “Shit was working better than they had expected it to,” says Goertzel. “The concept of AGI genuinely started to seem more plausible.”

And yet for all of LLMs' remarkable wordplay, Goertzel doesn't think that they do in fact contain sparks of AGI. “It's a little surprising to me that some people with a deep technical understanding of how these tools work under the hood still think that they could become human-level AGI,” he says. “On the other hand, you can't prove it's not true.”

And there it is: You can't prove it's not true. “The idea that AGI is coming and that it's right around the corner and that it's inevitable has licensed a great many departures from reality,” says the University of Edinburgh's Vallor. “But we really don't have any evidence for it.”

Conspiracy thinking looms again. Predictions about when AGI will arrive are made with the precision of numerologists counting down to the end of days. With no real stakes in the game, deadlines come and go with a shrug. Excuses are made and timelines are adjusted yet again.

We saw this when OpenAI released the much-hyped GPT-5 this summer. AI stans were disappointed that the new version of the company's flagship technology wasn't the step change they expected. But instead of seeing that as evidence that AGI wasn't attainable—or attainable with an LLM, at least—believers pushed out their predictions for how soon AGI would come. It was coming—just, you know, next time.

Maybe they're right. Or maybe people will pick whatever evidence they can to defend an idea and overlook evidence that counts against it. Jeremy Cohen, who studies conspiracy thinking in technology circles at McMaster University in Canada, calls this imperfect evidence gathering—a hallmark of conspiracy thinking.

Cohen started his research career in the Arizona desert, studying a community called People Unlimited that believed its members were immortal. The conviction was impervious to contrary evidence. When its members died of natural causes (including two of its founders), the thinking was that they must have deserved it. “The general consensus was that every death was a suicide,” says Cohen. “If you are immortal and you get cancer and you die—well, you must have done something wrong.”

Cohen has since been focused on transhumanism (the idea that technology can help humans push past their natural limitations) and AGI. “I am seeing a lot of parallels. There are forms of magical thinking that I think is a part of the popular imagination around AGI,” he says. “It connects really well to the kinds of religious imaginaries that you see in conspiracy thinking today.”

Maybe some of you think I'm an idiot: You don't get it at all lol. But that's kind of my point. There are insiders and outsiders. When I talk to researchers or engineers who are happy to drop AGI into the conversation as a given, it's like they know something I don't. But nobody's ever been able to tell me what that something is. 

The truth is out there, if you know where to look. Conspiracy theories are primarily concerned about revealing a hidden truth, Cohen tells me: “It's a really fundamental part of conspiracy thinking, and that's absolutely something that you see in the way people talk about AGI,” he says. 

Last year, a 23-year-old former OpenAI staffer turned investor, Leopold Aschenbrenner, published a much-dissected 165-page manifesto titled “Situational Awareness.” You don't need to read it to get the idea: You either see the truth of what's coming or you don't. And you don't need cold, hard facts, either—it's enough to feel it. Those who don't just haven't seen the light.  

This idea stalked the periphery of my conversation with Goertzel, too. When I pushed him on why people are skeptical of AGI, for instance, he said: “Before every major technical achievement, from human flight to electrical power, loads of wise pundits would tell you why it was never going to happen. The fact is, most people only believe what they see in front of their faces.” 

That makes AGI sound like an article of faith. I put that to Krueger, who believes AGI's arrival is maybe five years out. He scoffed: “I think that's completely backwards.” For him, the article of faith is the idea that it won't happen—it's the skeptics who continue to deny the obvious. (Even so, he hedges: No one knows for sure, he says, but there's no obvious reason that AGI won't come.) 

Hidden truths bring truth seekers, bent on revealing what they've been able to see all along. With AGI, though, it's not enough to uncover something hidden. Here, revelation requires an unprecedented act of creation. If you believe AGI is achievable, then you believe that those making it are midwives to machines that will match or surpass human intelligence. “The idea of giving birth to machine gods is obviously very flattering to the ego,” says Vallor. “It's an incredibly seductive thing to think that you yourself are laying the early foundations for that transcendence.” 

It's yet another overlap with conspiracy thinking. Part of the draw is the desire for a sense of purpose in an otherwise messy world that can feel meaningless—the longing to be a person of consequence. 

Krueger, who is based in Berkeley, says he knows people working on AI who see the technology as our natural successor. “They view it as akin to having children or something,” he says. “Side note: they usually don't have children.”

Cohen sees parallels between many modern conspiracy theories and the New Age movement, which reached its peak of influence in the 1970s and '80s. Adherents believed humanity was on the cusp of unlocking an era of spiritual well-being and expanded consciousness that would usher in a more peaceful and prosperous world. In a nutshell, the idea was that by engaging in a set of pseudo-religious practices, including astrology and the careful curation of crystals, humans would transcend their limitations and enter a kind of hippie utopia.

Today's tech industry is built on compute, not crystals, but its sense of what's at stake is no less transcendent: “You know, this idea that there is going to be this fundamental shift, there's going to be this millenarian turn where we end up in a techno-utopian future,” says Cohen. “And the idea that AGI is going to ultimately allow humanity to overcome the problems that face us.”

In many people's telling, AGI will arrive all at once. Incremental advances in AI will stack up until, one day, AI will be good enough to start making better AI by itself. At which point—FOOM—it will advance so rapidly that AGI will arrive in what's often called an intelligence explosion, leading to a point of no return known as the Singularity, a goofy term that's been popular in AGI circles for years. Co-opting a concept from physics, the science fiction author Vernor Vinge first introduced the idea of a technological singularity in the 1980s. Vinge imagined an event horizon on the path of technological progress beyond which humans would be fast outstripped by the exponential self-improvement of the machines they had created. 

Call it the AI Big Bang—which, again, gives us a before and an after, a transcendent moment when humanity as we know it changes forever (for good or bad). “People imagine it as an event,” says Grace from AI Impacts.

For Vallor, this belief system is notable for the way that a faith in technology has replaced a faith in humans. Despite the woo-woo, New Age thinking was at least motivated by the idea that people had what it took to change the world by themselves, if they could only tap into it. With the pursuit of AGI, we've left that self-belief behind and bought into the idea that only technology can save us, she says.  

That's a compelling—even comforting—thought for many people. “We're in an era where other paths to material improvement of human lives and our societies seem to have been exhausted,” Vallor says. 

Technology once promised a route to a better future: Progress was a ladder that we would climb toward human and social flourishing. “We've passed the peak of that,” says Vallor. “I think the one thing that gives many people hope and a return to that kind of optimism about the future is AGI.”

Push this idea to its conclusion and, again, AGI becomes a kind of god—one that can offer relief from earthly suffering, says Vallor.

Kelly Joyce, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina who studies how cultural, political, and economic beliefs shape the way we think about and use technology, sees all these wild predictions about AGI as something more banal: part of a long-term pattern of overpromising from the tech industry. “What's interesting to me is that we get sucked in every time,” she says. “There is a deep belief that technology is better than human beings.”

Joyce thinks that's why, when the hype kicks in, people are predisposed to believe it. “It's a religion,” she says. “We believe in technology. Technology is God. It's really hard to push back against it. People don't want to hear it.”

The fantasy of computers that can do almost anything a person can is seductive. But like many pervasive conspiracy theories, it has very real consequences. It has distorted the way we think about the stakes behind the current technology boom (and potential bust). It may have even derailed the industry, sucking resources away from more immediate, more practical application of the technology. More than anything else, it gives us a free pass to be lazy. It fools us into thinking we might be able to avoid the actual hard work needed to solve intractable, world-spanning problems—problems that will require international cooperation and compromise and expensive aid. Why bother with that when we'll soon have machines to figure it all out for us?

Consider the resources being sunk into this grand project. Just last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced an up-to-$100 billion partnership that would see the chip giant supply at least 10 gigawatts of ChatGPT's insatiable demand. That's higher than nuclear power plant numbers. A bolt of lightning might release that much energy. The flux capacitor inside Dr. Emmett Brown's DeLorean time machine only required 1.2 gigawatts to send Marty back to the future. And then, only two weeks later, OpenAI announced a second partnership with chipmaker AMD for another six gigawatts of power.

Promoting the Nvidia deal on CNBC, Altman, straight-faced, claimed that without this kind of data center buildout, people would have to choose between a cure for cancer and free education. “No one wants to make that choice,” he said. (Just a few weeks later, he announced that erotic chats would be coming to ChatGPT.)

Add to those costs the loss of investment in more immediate technology that could change lives today and tomorrow and the next day. “To me it's a huge missed opportunity,” says Lirio's Symons, “to put all these resources into solving something nebulous when we already know there's real problems that we could solve.” 

But that's not how the likes of OpenAI needs to operate. “With people throwing so much money at these companies, they don't have to do that,” Symons says. “If you've got hundreds of billions of dollars, you don't have to focus on a practical, solvable project.”

Despite his steadfast belief that AGI is coming, Krueger also thinks the industry's single-minded pursuit of it means that potential solutions to real problems, such as better health care, are being ignored. “This AGI stuff—it's nonsense, it's a distraction, it's hype,” he tells me. 

And there are consequences for the way governments support and regulate technology (or don't). Tina Law, who studies technology policy at the University of California–Davis, worries that policymakers are getting lobbied about the ways AI will one day kill us all, instead of addressing real concerns about the ways AI could impact people's lives in immediate and material ways today. Inequality has been sidetracked by existential risk.

“Hype is a lucrative strategy for tech firms,” says Law. A big part of that hype is the idea that what's happening is inevitable: If we don't build it, someone else will. “When something is framed as inevitable,” Law says, “people doubt not only whether they should resist but also whether they have the capacity to do so.” Everyone gets locked in. 

The AGI distortion field isn't limited to tech policy, says Milton Mueller at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who works on technology policy and regulation. The race to AGI gets compared to the race to the atomic bomb, he says. “So whoever gets it first is going to have ultimate power over everybody else. That's a crazy and dangerous idea that really will distort our approach to foreign policy.” 

There's a business incentive for companies (and governments) to push the myth of AGI, says Mueller, because they can then claim that they will be the first to get there. But because they're running a race in which nobody has agreed on the finish line, the myth can be spun as long as it's useful. Or as long as investors are willing to buy into it. 

It's not hard to see how this plays out. It's not utopia or hell—it's OpenAI and its peers making a whole lot more money.

And maybe that brings us back to the whole conspiracy thing—and a late-game twist in this tale. So far we've ignored one popular feature of conspiracy thinking: that there's a group of powerful figures pulling the levers behind the scenes and that, by seeking the truth, believers can expose this elite cabal. 

Sure, the people feeling the AGI aren't publicly accusing any Illuminati or WEF-like force of preventing the AGI future or withholding its secrets. 

But what if there are, in fact, shadowy puppet masters here—and they're the very people who have pushed the AGI conspiracy hardest all along? The kings of Silicon Valley are throwing everything they can get at building AGI for profit. The myth of AGI serves their interests more than anybody else's. 

As one senior executive at an AI company said to us recently, AGI always needs to be six months to a year away, because if it's any further than that, you won't be able to recruit people from Jane Street, and if it's closer to already here, then what's the point? 

As Vallor puts it: “If OpenAI says they're building a machine that's going to make corporations even more powerful than they are today, that isn't going to get the kind of public buy-in that they need.” 

Remember: You create a god and you become like one yourself. Krueger says there's a line of thinking running through Silicon Valley in which building AI is a way to seize huge amounts of power. (It's one of the premises of Aschenbrenner's “Situational Awareness,” for example.) “You know, we're going to have this godlike power and we're going to have to figure out what to do with it,” says Krueger. “A lot of people think if they get there first, they can basically take over the world.”

“They're putting so much effort into selling their vision of a future with AGI in it, and they're having a pretty good amount of success because they have so much power,” he adds.

Goertzel, for one, is almost lamenting how successful the maybe-cabal has been. He's actually starting to miss life on the fringes. “In my generation, you had to have a lot of vision to want to work on AGI, and you had to be very stubborn,” he says. “Now it's almost, like, what your grandma tells you to do to get a job instead of being a business major.”

“It's disorienting that this stuff is so broadly accepted,” he says. “It almost gives me the desire to go work on something else that not so many people are doing.” He's half joking (I think): “Obviously, putting the finishing touches to AGI is more important than gratifying my preference to be out on the frontier.”

But I'm no clearer on what exactly they're putting the finishing touches on. What does it mean for technology in general if we fall so hard for the fairy tales? In a lot of ways, I think the whole idea of AGI is built on a warped view of what we should expect technology to do, and even what intelligence is in the first place. Stripped back to its essentials, the argument for AGI rests on the premise that one technology, AI, has gotten very good, very fast, and will continue to get better. But set aside the technical objections—what if it doesn't continue to get better?—and you're left with the claim that intelligence is a commodity you can get more of if you have the right data or compute or neural network. And it's not. 

Intelligence doesn't come as a quantity you can just ratchet up and up. Smart people may be brilliant in one area and not in others. Some Nobel Prize winners are really bad at playing the piano or caring for their kids. Some very smart people insist that AGI is coming next year. 

It's hard not to wonder what will get its hooks into us next. 

Before we ended our call, Goertzel told me about an event he'd just been to in San Francisco on AI consciousness and parapsychology: “ESP, precognition, and whatnot.”

“That's where AGI was 20 years ago,” he said. “Everyone thinks it's batshit crazy.” 

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. 

Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

India is OpenAI's second-largest market, but ChatGPT and Sora reproduce caste stereotypes that harm millions of people.

Turns out many believers do respond positively when presented with the right evidence and arguments.

It's become a truism that facts alone don't change people's minds. Perhaps nowhere is this more clear than when it comes to conspiracy theories: Many people believe that you can't talk conspiracists out of their beliefs. 

But that's not necessarily true. It turns out that many conspiracy believers do respond to evidence and arguments—information that is now easy to deliver in the form of a tailored conversation with an AI chatbot.

In research we published in the journal Science this year, we had over 2,000 conspiracy believers engage in a roughly eight-minute conversation with DebunkBot, a model we built on top of OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo (the most up-to-date GPT model at that time). Participants began by writing out, in their own words, a conspiracy theory that they believed and the evidence that made the theory compelling to them. Then we instructed the AI model to persuade the user to stop believing in that conspiracy and adopt a less conspiratorial view of the world. A three-round back-and-forth text chat with the AI model (lasting 8.4 minutes on average) led to a 20% decrease in participants' confidence in the belief, and about one in four participants—all of whom believed the conspiracy theory beforehand—indicated that they did not believe it after the conversation. This effect held true for both classic conspiracies (think the JFK assassination or the moon landing hoax) and more contemporary politically charged ones (like those related to the 2020 election and covid-19).

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's series “The New Conspiracy Age,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.

This is good news, given the outsize role that unfounded conspiracy theories play in today's political landscape. So while there are widespread and legitimate concerns that generative AI is a potent tool for spreading disinformation, our work shows that it can also be part of the solution. 

Even people who began the conversation absolutely certain that their conspiracy was true, or who indicated that it was highly important to their personal worldview, showed marked decreases in belief. Remarkably, the effects were very durable; we followed up with participants two months later and saw just as big a reduction in conspiracy belief as we did immediately after the conversations. 

Our experiments indicate that many believers are relatively rational but misinformed, and getting them timely, accurate facts can have a big impact. Conspiracy theories can make sense to reasonable people who have simply never heard clear, non-conspiratorial explanations for the events they're fixated on. This may seem surprising. But many conspiratorial claims, while wrong, seem reasonable on the surface and require specialized, esoteric knowledge to evaluate and debunk. 

For example, 9/11 deniers often point to the claim that jet fuel doesn't burn hot enough to melt steel as evidence that airplanes were not responsible for bringing down the Twin Towers—but the chatbot responds by pointing out that although this is true, the American Institute of Steel Construction says jet fuel does burn hot enough to reduce the strength of steel by over 50%, which is more than enough to cause such towers to collapse. 

Although we have greater access to factual information than ever before, it is extremely difficult to search that vast corpus of knowledge efficiently. Finding the truth that way requires knowing what to google—or who to listen to—and being sufficiently motivated to seek out conflicting information. There are large time and skill barriers to conducting such a search every time we hear a new claim, and so it's easy to take conspiratorial content you stumble upon at face value. And most would-be debunkers at the Thanksgiving table make elementary mistakes that AI avoids: Do you know the melting point and tensile strength of steel offhand? And when your relative calls you an idiot while trying to correct you, are you able to maintain your composure? 

With enough effort, humans would almost certainly be able to research and deliver facts like the AI in our experiments. And in a follow-up experiment, we found that the AI debunking was just as effective if we told participants they were talking to an expert rather than an AI. So it's not that the debunking effect is AI-specific. Generally speaking, facts and evidence delivered by humans would also work. But it would require a lot of time and concentration for a human to come up with those facts. Generative AI can do the cognitive labor of fact-checking and rebutting conspiracy claims much more efficiently. 

In another large follow-up experiment, we found that what drove the debunking effect was specifically the facts and evidence the model provided: Factors like letting people know the chatbot was going to try to talk them out of their beliefs didn't reduce its efficacy, whereas telling the model to try to persuade its chat partner without using facts and evidence totally eliminated the effect. 

Although the foibles and hallucinations of these models are well documented, our results suggest that debunking efforts are widespread enough on the internet to keep the conspiracy-focused conversations roughly accurate. When we hired a professional fact-checker to evaluate GPT-4's claims, they found that over 99% of the claims were rated as true (and not politically biased). Also, in the few cases where participants named conspiracies that turned out to be true (like MK Ultra, the CIA's human experimentation program from the 1950s), the AI chatbot confirmed their accurate belief rather than erroneously talking them out of it.

To date, largely by necessity, interventions to combat conspiracy theorizing have been mainly prophylactic—aiming to prevent people from going down the rabbit hole rather than trying to pull them back out. Now, thanks to advances in generative AI, we have a tool that can change conspiracists' minds using evidence. 

Bots prompted to debunk conspiracy theories could be deployed on social media platforms to engage with those who share conspiratorial content—including other AI chatbots that spread conspiracies. Google could also link debunking AI models to search engines to provide factual answers to conspiracy-related queries. And instead of arguing with your conspiratorial uncle over the dinner table, you could just pass him your phone and have him talk to AI. 

Of course, there are much deeper implications here for how we as humans make sense of the world around us. It is widely argued that we now live in a “post-truth” world, where polarization and politics have eclipsed facts and evidence. By that account, our passions trump truth, logic-based reasoning is passé, and the only way to effectively change people's minds is via psychological tactics like presenting compelling personal narratives or changing perceptions of the social norm. If so, the typical, discourse-based work of living together in a democracy is fruitless.

But facts aren't dead. Our findings about conspiracy theories are the latest—and perhaps most extreme—in an emerging body of research demonstrating the persuasive power of facts and evidence. For example, while it was once believed that correcting falsehoods that aligns with one's politics would just cause people to dig in and believe them even more, this idea of a “backfire” has itself been debunked: Many studies consistently find that corrections and warning labels reduce belief in, and sharing of, falsehoods—even among those who most distrust the fact-checkers making the corrections. Similarly, evidence-based arguments can change partisans' minds on political issues, even when they are actively reminded that the argument goes against their party leader's position. And simply reminding people to think about whether content is accurate before they share it can substantially reduce the spread of misinformation. 

And if facts aren't dead, then there's hope for democracy—though this arguably requires a consensus set of facts from which rival factions can work. There is indeed widespread partisan disagreement on basic facts, and a disturbing level of belief in conspiracy theories. Yet this doesn't necessarily mean our minds are inescapably warped by our politics and identities. When faced with evidence—even inconvenient or uncomfortable evidence—many people do shift their thinking in response. And so if it's possible to disseminate accurate information widely enough, perhaps with the help of AI, we may be able to reestablish the factual common ground that is missing from society today.

Mike Rothschild has spent years studying the rise of QAnon and antivaccine conspiracism. After his house in Altadena, California, burned down, he found himself mired in similarly sticky webs of misinformation.

On a gloomy Saturday morning this past May, a few months after entire blocks of Altadena, California, were destroyed by wildfires, several dozen survivors met at a local church to vent their built-up frustration, anger, blame, and anguish. As I sat there listening to one horror story after another, I almost felt sorry for the very polite consultants who were being paid to sit there, and who couldn't do a thing about what they were hearing.

Hosted by a third-party arbiter at the behest of Los Angeles County, the gathering was a listening session in which survivors could “share their experiences with emergency alerts and evacuations” for a report on how the response to the Eaton Fire months earlier had succeeded and failed. 

It didn't take long to see just how much failure there had been.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's series “The New Conspiracy Age,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.

After a small fire started in the bone-dry brush of Pasadena's Eaton Canyon early in the evening of Tuesday, January 7, 2025, the raging Santa Ana winds blew its embers into nearby Altadena, the historically Black and middle-class town just to the north. By Wednesday morning, much of it was burning. Its residents spent the night making frantic, desperate scrambles to grab whatever they could and get to safety. 

In the aftermath, many claimed that they received no warning to evacuate, saw no first responders battling the blazes, and had little interaction with official personnel. Most were simply left to fend for themselves. 

Making matters worse, while no place is “good” for a wildfire, Altadena was especially vulnerable. It was densely packed with 100-year-old wooden homes, many of which were decades behind on the code upgrades that would have better protected them. It was full of trees and other plants that had dried out during the rain-free winter. Few residents or officials were prepared for the seemingly remote possibility that the fires that often broke out in the mountains nearby would jump into town. As a result, resources were strained to the breaking point, and many homes simply burned freely.

So the people packed into the room that morning had a lot to be angry about. They unloaded their own personal ordeals, the traumas their community had experienced, and even catastrophes they'd heard about secondhand. Each was like a dagger to the heart, met with head-nods and “uh-huhs” from people all going through the same thing.

LA County left us to die because we couldn't get alerts!

I'm sleeping in my car because I was a renter and have no insurance coverage!

Millions of dollars in aid were raised for us, and we haven't gotten anything!

Developers are buying up Altadena and pricing out the Black families who made this place!

The firefighting planes were grounded on purpose by Joe Biden so he could fly around LA!

One of these things was definitely not like the others. And I knew why.

It's something of a familiar cycle by now: Tragedy hits; rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories follow. Think of the deluge of “false flag” and “staged gun grab” conspiracy theories after mass shootings, or the rampant disinformation around covid-19 and the 2020 election. It's often even more acute in the case of a natural disaster, when conspiracy theories about what “really” caused the calamity run right into culture-war-driven climate change denialism. Put together, these theories obscure real causes while elevating fake ones, with both sides battling it out on social media and TV. 

I've studied these ideas extensively, having spent the last 10 years writing about conspiracy theories and disinformation as a journalist and researcher. I've covered everything from the rise of QAnon to whether Donald Trump faked his assassination attempt to the alarming rises in antisemitism, antivaccine conspiracism, and obsession with human trafficking. I've written three books, testified to Congress, and even written a report for the January 6th Committee. So this has been my life for quite a while. 

Still, I'd never lived it. Not until the Eaton Fire.

For a long time, I'd been able to talk about the conspiracy theories without letting them in. Now the disinformation was in the room with me, and it was about my life.

My house, a cottage built in 1925, was one of those that burned back in January. Our only official notification to flee had come at 3:25 a.m., nine hours after the fires started. We grabbed what we could in 10 minutes, I locked our front door, and six hours later, it was all gone. We could have died. Eighteen Altadena residents did die—and all but one were in the area that was warned too late.

Previously in my professional life, I'd always been able to look at the survivors of a tragedy, crying on TV about how they'd lost everything, and think sympathetically but distantly, Oh, those poor people. And soon enough, the conspiracy theories I was following about the incident for work would die down, and then it was no longer in my official purview—I could move on to the next disaster and whatever mess came with it. 

Now I was one of those poor people. The Eaton Fire had changed everything about my life. Would it change everything about my work as well? It felt as though two trains I'd managed to keep on parallel tracks had collided.

For a long time, I'd been able to talk about the conspiracy theories without letting them in. Now the disinformation was in the room with me, and it was about my life. And I wondered: Did I have a duty to journalism to push back on the wild thinking—or on this particular idea that Biden was responsible? 

Or did I have a duty to myself and my sanity to just stay quiet?

In the days following the Eaton Fire, which coincided with another devastating fire in Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades neighborhood, the Biden plane storyline was just one of countless rumors, false claims, hoaxes, and accusations about what had happened and who was behind them.

Most were culture-war nonsense or political fodder. I also saw clearly fake AI slop (no, the Hollywood sign was not on fire) and bits of TikTok ephemera that could largely be ignored. 

They were from something like an alternate world, one where forest floors hadn't been “raked” and where incompetent “DEI firefighters” let houses burn while water waited in a giant spigot that California's governor, Gavin Newsom, refused to “turn on” because he preferred to protect an endangered fish. There were claims that the fires were set on purpose to clear land for the Olympics, or to cover up evidence of human trafficking. Rumors flew that LA had donated all its firefighting money and gear to Ukraine. Some speculated that the fires were started by undocumented immigrants (one was suspected of causing one of the fires but never charged) or “antifa” or Black Lives Matter activists—never mind that one of the most demographically Black areas in the city was wiped out. Or, as always, it was the Jews. In this case, blame fell on a “wealthy Jewish couple” who supposedly owned most of LA's water and wouldn't let it go.

These claims originated from the same “just asking questions” influencers who run the same playbook for every disaster. And they spread rapidly through X, a platform where breaking news had been drowned out by hysterical conspiracism. 

But many did have elements of truth to them, surrounded by layers of lies and accusations. A few were just true enough to be impossible to dismiss out of hand, but also not actually true.

So, for the record: Biden did not ground firefighting aircraft in Los Angeles. 

According to fact-checking by both USA Today and Reuters, Biden flew into Los Angeles the day before the Eaton Fire broke out (which was also the same day that the Palisades Fire started, roughly 30 miles to the west), to dedicate two new national monuments. He left two days later. And while there were security measures in place, including flight restrictions over the area where he was staying, firefighting planes simply had to coordinate with air traffic controllers to cross into the closed-off space. 

But when my sort-of neighbor brought up this particular theory that day in May, I wasn't able to debunk it. For one thing, this was my first time hearing the rumor. But more than that, what could I say that would assuage this man's anger? And if he wanted to blame Biden for his house burning down, was it really my place to tell him he was wrong—even if he was? 

It's common for survivors of a disaster to be aware of only parts of the story, struggle to understand the full picture, or fail to fully recollect what happened to them in the moment of survival. Once the trauma ebbs, we're left looking for answers and clarity and someone who knows what's going on, because we certainly don't have a clue. Hoaxes and misinformation stem from anger, confusion, and a lack of clear answers to rapidly evolving questions.  

I can confirm that it was dizzying. Rumors and hoaxes were going around in my personal circles too, even if they weren't so lurid and even if we didn't really believe them. Bits of half-heard news circulated constantly in our group texts, WhatsApp chains, Facebook groups, and in-person gatherings. 

There was confusion over who was responsible for the extent of the devastation, genuine anger about purported LA Fire Department budget cuts (though those had not actually happened to the extent conspiracists claimed they did), and fears that a Trump-controlled federal government would abandon California. 

Many of the homes and businesses that we heard had burned down hadn't, and others that we heard had survived were gone. In an especially heartbreaking early bit of misinformation, a local child-care facility shared a Facebook post stating that FEMA was handing out vouchers to pay 90% of your rent for the next three years—except FEMA doesn't hand out rent vouchers without an application process. I quietly reached out to the source, who took it down. 

In this information vacuum, and given my work, friends started asking me questions, and answering them took energy and time I didn't have. Honestly, the “disinformation researcher” was largely just as clueless as everyone else. 

Some of the questions were harmless enough. At one point a friend texted me about a picture from Facebook of a burned Bible page that survived the fire when everything else had turned to ash. It looked too corny and convenient to be real. But I had also found a burned page of Psalms that had survived. I kept it in a ziplock bag because it seemed like the right thing to do. So I told my friend I didn't know if it was real. I still don't—but I also still have that ziplock somewhere.

As weeks passed, we began to deal with another major issue where truth and misinformation walked together: the reasonable worry that a new president who constantly belittled California would not be willing to provide relief funds. 

Recovery depended on FEMA to distribute grants, on the EPA to clear toxic debris, on the Small Business Administration to make loans for rebuilding or repairing homes, on the Army Corps of Engineers to remove the detritus of burned structures, and so much more. How would this square with the new “government efficiency” mandate touting the trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs to be cut from the federal budget? 

Nobody knew—including the many kind government employees who spent months in Altadena helping us recover while silently wondering if they were about to be fired.

We dealt with scammers, grifters, squatters, thieves, and even tow truck companies that simply stole cars parked outside burned lots and held them for ransom. After a decade of helping people recognize scams and frauds, there was little I could do when they came for us.

Many residents of Altadena began to have trepidation about accepting government assistance, particularly in its Black community, which already had a well-earned deep distrust of the federal government. Many Black residents felt that their needs and stories were being left behind in the recovery, and feared they would be the first to be priced out of whatever Altadena would become in the future.

Outreach in person became critical. I happened to meet the two-star general in charge of the Army Corps' effort at lunch one day, as he and his team tried to find outside-the-box ways to engage with exhausted and wary residents. He told me they had tried to use technology—texts, emails, clips designed to go viral—but it was too much information, all apparently delivered in the wrong way. Many of the people they needed to reach, particularly older residents, didn't use social media, weren't able to communicate well via text, and were easy prey for sophisticated scammers. It was also easy for the real information to get lost as we got bombarded with communications, including many from hoaxers and frauds.

This, too, wasn't new to me. Many of the movements I've covered are awash in grift and worthless wellness products. I know the signs of a scam and a snake-oil salesman. Still, I watched helplessly as my friends and my community, desperate for help, were turned into chum for cash-hungry sharks opening their jaws wide. 

The community was hammered by dodgy contractors and fly-by-night debris removal companies, relief scams and phony grants, and spam calls from “repair companies” and builders. We dealt with scammers, grifters, squatters, thieves, and even tow truck companies that simply stole cars parked outside burned lots and held them for ransom. We were also victimized by looting: Abandoned wires on our lot were stripped for copper, and our neighbor's unlocked garage was ransacked. After a decade of helping people recognize scams and frauds, there was little I could do when they came for us.

The fear of being conned was easily transmittable, even to me personally. After hearing of friends who couldn't get a FEMA grant because a previous owner of their home had fraudulently filed an application, we delayed our own appointment with FEMA for weeks. The agency's call had come so out of the blue that we were convinced it was fake. Maybe my job made me overcautious, or maybe we were just paralyzed by the sheer tonnage of decisions and calls that needed to be handled. Whatever the reason, the fear meant we later had to make multiple calls just to get our meeting rescheduled. It's a small thing, but when you're as exhausted and dispirited as we were, there are no small things. 

Making all this even more frustrating was that the scammers, the people spinning tales of lasers and endangered fish and antifa, were very much ignoring the reality: that our planet is trying to kill us. While federal officials recently made an arrest in the Palisades Fire, the direct causes of that fire and the nearby Eaton Fire may still take years of investigation and litigation to be fully known. But even now, it can't be denied to any reasonable degree that climate change worsened the wind that made the fires spread more quickly. 

The Santa Ana winds bombarding Southern California were among the worst ever to hit the region. Their ferocity drove the embers well beyond the nominal fire danger line, particularly in Altadena. Many landed in brush left brittle and dead by the decades-long drought plaguing California. And they had even more fuel because the previous two winters had been among the wettest in the region's recent history. Such rapid swings between wet and dry or cold and hot have become so common around the world that they even have a name: climate whiplash. 

There are the conspiracy theory gurus who see this and make money off it, peddling disinformation on their podcasts and livestreams, while blaming everyone and everything but the real reasons. Many of these figures have spent decades railing against the very idea that the climate could change. And if it is changing, they claimed, human consumption and urbanization have nothing to do with it. When faced with a disaster that undeniably reflected climate change at work, their business models—which rely on sales of subscriptions and merchandise—demanded that they just keep denying it was climate change at work.

As more cities and countries deal with “once in a century” climate disasters, I have no doubt that these figures will continue to deflect attention away from human activity. They will use crackpot science, conspiracy theories, politics, and—increasingly—fake videos depicting whatever AI can generate. They will prey on their audiences' limited understanding of basic science, their inability to perceive how climate and weather differ, and their fears that globalist power brokers will somehow use the weather against them. And their message will spread with little pushback from social media platforms more concerned with virality and shareholder value than truth.

When you cover disinformation and live through an event creating a massive volume of disinformation, it's like floating outside your body on an operating table as your heart is being worked on, while also being a heart surgeon. I knew I should be trying to help. But I did not have the mental capacity, the time, or, to be honest, the interest in covering what the worst people on the internet were saying about the worst time of my life. I had very real questions about where my family would live. Thinking about my career was not a priority. 

But of course, these experiences cannot now be excised from my career. I've spent a lot of time talking about how trauma influences conspiracism; see how the isolation and boredom of covid created a new generation of conspiracy theory believers. And now I had my own trauma, and it has been a test of my abilities as a journalist and a thinker to avoid falling into the pit of despair.

At the same time, I have a much deeper understanding of the psychology at work in conspiracy belief. One of the biggest reasons conspiracy theories take off after a disaster is that they serve to make sense out of something that makes no sense. Neighborhoods aren't supposed to burn down in an era of highly trained firefighters and seemingly fireproof materials. They especially aren't supposed to burn down in Los Angeles, one of the wealthiest cities on the planet. These were seven- and eight-figure homes going up like matches. There must be a reason, people figured. Someone, or something, must be responsible.

So, as I emerge from the haze to something resembling “normal,” I feel more compassion and understanding for trauma victims who turn to conspiracy theories. Having faced the literal burning down of my life, I get the urge to assign meaning to such a calamity and point a finger at whoever we think did it to us. 

Meanwhile, the people of Altadena and Pacific Palisades continue to slowly put our lives and communities back together. The effects of both our warming planet and our disinformation crisis continue to assert themselves every day. It's still alluring to look for easy answers in outrageous conspiracy theories, but such answers are not real and offer no actual help—only the illusion of help.

It's equally tempting for someone who researches and debunks conspiracy theories to mock or belittle the people who believe these ideas. How could anyone be so dumb as to think Joe Biden caused the fire that burned down my home?

I kept my mouth shut that day at the meeting in the church, though, again, I can now sympathize much more deeply with something I'd otherwise think completely inane. 

But even a journalist who lost his house is still a journalist. So I decided early on that what I really needed to do was keep Altadena in the news. I went on TV and radio, blogged, and happily told our story to anyone who asked. I focused on the community, the impact, the people who would be working to recover long after the national spotlight moved to the next shiny object.

If there is a professional lesson to be taken from this nightmare, it might be that the people caught up in tragedies are exactly that: caught up. And those who believe this nonsense find something of value in it. They find hope and comfort and the reassurance that whoever did this to them will get what they deserve. 

I could have done it too, throwing away years of experience to embrace conspiracist nihilism in the face of unspeakable trauma. After all, those poor people going through this weren't just on my TV. 

They were my friends. They were me. They could be anyone.

A clever and well-meaning use for AI

Artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm, incorporating itself knee-deep in various aspects of our society seemingly overnight, for better or for worse. In the case of Australia's police, the intention is pure, and the goal is to prevent crime or catch suspects more effectively with the use of an AI that can translate modern, online slang, in particular, emojis. Young adults who are part of hate groups on social media that spread violent rhetoric and often act on it — who Australian police refer to as "crimefluencers" — are the main target of this new strategy.

According to The Register, Australia Federal Police (AFP) commissioner Krissy Barrett spoke to the press today, highlighting how many Gen Z and Gen Alpha individuals are lured into these spaces, pushed to perform an act of tribute just to get in, such as recording self-harm. Once part of these decentralized communities, the crimefluencers coordinate real-world attacks using emojis that are difficult to interpret for investigators.

"They are ‘crimefluencers', and are motivated by anarchy and hurting others, with most of their victims pre-teen or teenage girls," said AFP commissioner Krissy Barrett.

So, how does artificial intelligence help here? While we don't have exact details, AFP says it's developing a “prototype AI tool that will interpret emojis and Gen Z and Alpha slang in encrypted communications and chat groups,” according to commissioner Barrett. It would likely have to be a multimodal natural language model (NLM) designed to interpret semantics as distinct, individual units, then use context awareness to determine whether something is an actual clue or just harmless slang.

For instance, the skull emoji traditionally represents death or murder, but these days on the internet, it's gained more notoriety as “dying of laughter.” The pizza emoji could literally mean pizza — or, in some circles, act as code for a drug drop. This is where language embeddings come into play. If the model sees “(pizza) drop tonight?” paired with a blood emoji or certain slang terms, it could separate ordinary messages from ones actually worth flagging.

To achieve this, the AI would need to be trained on a lot of open-source social media data from platforms like Instagram and TikTok, along with internal datasets from previous investigations and synthetic chats constructed to mimic online behavior. With transformer-based NLP models like BERT, it could gradually learn how meanings shift over time and, in turn, recognize when an emoji or slang phrase actually signals something dangerous.

 




Since these groups have no unified leadership but share common interests in violence, nihilism, and sadism, with some of them even being Neo-Nazis, simply tracking down the people in charge is not going to reveal the chain beneath. The community has no center, so it has to be monitored on an individual basis, treating every possible threat with the utmost caution, and quickly working to prevent it.

The AI is just one part of that; several other efforts are ongoing with different teams exploring ways to more effectively combat new-age crime. AFP has already joined forces with the "Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group" — consisting of agencies from the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand — and has already arrested multiple suspects aged between 17 and 20, out of the 59 total that were flagged.

Barrett also shared several cases where good ol' forensics still outsmarted computers, shining light on a recent crypto-laundering bust where a data scientist manually cracked an encoded recovery phrase worth millions after they spotted a pattern AI had missed. “While computer power is essential,” she said, “it's not always as creative and innovative as a human.”

AFP is also experimenting with unorthodox forensics techniques, like trying to use cell phones buried with dead bodies to determine the age, cause, and method of death. The main goal is to estimate how long the body has been underground, and this is a collaborative effort with the University of Technology Sydney. Introducing the AI tool is simply the next phase of Australia's vision to control crime on a larger scale, folding in more tech and science as crime naturally continues to evolve.

With SpaceX's lunar lander for NASA's Artemis 3 mission facing significant delays, the agency is looking to competitors who could provide a lander sooner. Blue Origin is a leading contender, but can Jeff Bezos's company really beat Elon Musk back to the Moon?

Recent developments suggest it could. Jacqueline Cortese, Blue Origin's Senior Director of Civil Space, represented the company on a Tuesday panel at the American Astronautical Society's 2025 von Braun Space Exploration Symposium. During the event, she discussed Blue Origin's progress on its Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1) and Blue Moon Mark 2 (MK2) landers, SpaceflightNow reports.

According to Cortese, Blue Origin could launch an MK1 demonstration mission before the end of the year. MK1 is a cargo lander designed to eventually ferry up to 3 tons of payload to the lunar surface. It's a stepping stone to the MK2 crew lander, which could (theoretically) replace SpaceX's Starship Human Landing System (HLS) as the Artemis 3 lander—if it's ready first.

“Especially with MK1 and some of our preceding work we're doing, we have what we think are some good ideas about maybe a more incremental approach that could be taken advantage of for an acceleration-type scenario,” Cortese said, as SpaceflightNow reports.

SpaceX signed a $2.9 billion contract with NASA in 2021 to provide the first crewed lunar lander for the agency's Artemis program. Starship HLS—a modified version of the megarocket's upper stage—is slated to land the Artemis 3 astronauts on the Moon sometime in mid-2027.

After a rough start to Starship's 2025 launch schedule, however, unmet technical milestones have piled up. Now, experts worry that Starship HLS could be years late for a 2027 Artemis 3 Moon landing.

Starship's challenges largely stem from the fact that it's the largest, most complex launch vehicle ever built. This presents significant logistical challenges to landing on the Moon—it will literally require an elevator to bring astronauts down to the lunar surface. And as it's still in the early stages of development, its lunar landing capabilities remain unproven.

During two on-air media appearances last week, acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy said he would reopen the Artemis 3 contract to competing spaceflight companies to ensure the U.S. returns to the Moon before the end of President Trump's term. The announcement seemed to ruffle Musk's feathers, prompting the SpaceX CEO to hurl insults at Duffy via X.

“I'm going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX, like Blue Origin, and again, whatever one can get us there first, to the Moon, we're going to take,” Duffy said on CNBC.

The Blue Moon landers offer a level of simplicity Starship HLS just can't provide. Not only are they based on a largely proven concept, they're also much smaller, with a lower center of gravity and an easier dismount. What's more, they're being built by a massive team of highly equipped engineers across Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Draper, Astrobotic, and Honeybee Robotics.

NASA has already contracted Blue Origin's MK2 for the Artemis 5 mission, which won't launch for another several years. But the company is also developing plans for MK2 that could expedite Artemis 3.

During Tuesday's panel, Cortese reportedly said that an MK1 lander is undergoing final stacking at a dedicated production facility in Port Canaveral in Florida. Once stacking is complete, the spacecraft will be transported to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for a series of tests that simulate the vacuum and extreme temperature fluctuations of space.

MK1's inaugural demonstration mission—dubbed “Pathfinder”—will attempt to land at the Moon's south pole. This will allow Blue Origin to test critical systems and validate hardware for the MK2 lander. The mission will also carry two NASA payloads: SCALPSS (Stereo Cameras for Lunar-Plume Surface Studies) and LRA (Laser Retroreflective Array).

Cortese said the test flight “would launch in the next couple of weeks,” though she did not offer specifics about the timeline. If Blue Origin manages to get this mission off the ground before 2026, it could accelerate the development of MK2 ahead of its Artemis 5 schedule, as the two landers share much of the same hardware.

That said, Blue Origin will still face major hurdles to launching a crewed MK2 mission, namely demonstrating a propellant transfer, validating the spacecraft's life-support system, and acquiring crew certification. And even if NASA did select it for Artemis 3, integrating this alternative landing system into the current Artemis 3 architecture could present unforeseen challenges.

For now, the pressure remains on SpaceX to deliver a viable human landing system before mid-2027. Whether Blue Origin's progress lights a fire under Musk's company remains to be seen.

Flagship smartphones drain wallets with four-figure price tags while simultaneously draining attention spans with addictive apps designed to keep eyes glued to screens. People crave simplicity and something genuinely pocket-friendly that doesn't require a mortgage payment, but the market keeps pushing bigger, heavier, more expensive devices: The NanoPhone just crashed this party at $109, down from $199 (45% off) and delivers a fully functional Android smartphone that measures just 3.5 inches long and weighs under three ounces.

This credit card-sized device looks uncannily like a shrunken iPhone with its sleek design and button placement, and guarantees double-takes from anyone who sees you pull it from your actual coin pocket. The novelty factor alone justifies the purchase, but the legitimate functionality makes it useful rather than just a conversation piece.

The NanoPhone runs Android 10 and gives you full access to the Google Play Store. You can download apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, YouTube, Netflix, and virtually any app that works with that operating system. Its 3-inch IPS HD touchscreen displays everything clearly even though scrolling through social media on such a tiny screen is delightfully absurd. The interface mimics iOS style with a custom theme, and creates an iPhone-like look that confuses people until they see the Android navigation buttons at the bottom.

Dual SIM card slots turn this tiny phone into a useful tool for people who juggle work and personal lines or for international travelers switching between carriers. Just insert your existing SIM card from your main phone and the NanoPhone connects immediately to your 4G carrier without needing new data plans or complicated setup processes. The device works with all major US carriers including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and budget options like Cricket, Boost, Visible, and Mint Mobile. WiFi connectivity offers an alternative to cellular data, and gives you fast internet speeds when you're near networks.

The 5MP rear camera takes decent photos in good lighting. It's perfect for quick snapshots or scanning documents when your main phone isn't around. The 2MP front-facing camera handles video calls through apps like FaceTime alternatives, Zoom or WhatsApp without embarrassing video quality. Neither camera will win photography awards but they work well enough for the typical snapshots and video chats that most people use their cameras for.

The phone has 16GB of internal storage and a microSD card slot for expansion. This lets you load movies, music, photos, and apps without constantly rearranging what to keep and what to remove. The 2,000mAh battery lasts surprisingly long given the device's size, easily handling a full day of moderate use.

The physical dimensions are 3.5 inches long, 1.8 inches wide, and just 0.4 inches thick. This makes the phone pocketable in ways that modern smartphones have neglected for years. It fits comfortably in the tiny coin pocket of jean pockets, in shirt pockets, running shorts, evening clutches, or pretty much anywhere you can fit a stack of credit cards. The 2.3-ounce weight is hardly noticeable in your pocket, so you won't feel the burden of carrying a device like you do with heavier flagship phones. USB-C charging keeps the phone compatible with modern charging cables and avoids the need to find old micro-USB cords from junk drawers.

At $109, you could buy phones for your entire family and spend less than the cost of a single mid-range smartphone.

You know how Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is spending $72 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025? Well, with his company's stock in the middle of a vertigo-inducing plunge of about 8% on Wednesday afternoon—a signal that investors are getting worried—CEO Mark Zuckerberg conjured a vision of a world where Meta doesn't end up using all that stuff for its intended purpose in the near future, saying it would be fine. That infrastructure Meta is investing in is intended to come in handy if AI superintelligence is achieved soon, Zuckerberg said on an earnings call Wednesday. “If it takes longer, then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business, which continues to be able to profitably use much of the compute,” Zuckerberg said, according to The Wall Street Journal. Meta's “core business” remains ad-subsidized social media apps. Advertising accounts for almost all of its revenue, according to its own financial disclosures from earlier this year. It's not as though Meta has not deployed AI in its social media apps. (Who can forget the tragic case of “Big sis Billie”?) But the basic functions of Meta's platforms have not exactly been revolutionized by AI, unless you count all those people who now post things like Shrimp Jesus on Facebook. With that in mind, might billions of dollars spent on data center construction, expensive AI experts, and an entire GPU company be overkill, assuming it's just to “accelerate” Facebook and Instagram?And those AI expenses aren't about to shrink next year. Zuckerberg also told investors to expect 2026 to be even spendier than 2025. “I think it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity,” he said, according to the Journal “.That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities.”The worst case scenario for Meta, Mark Zuckerberg says, is that it might have to “slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build.”Gizmodo reached out to Meta for comment, and will update if we hear back.

Researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in collaboration with BostonGene, conducted the largest and most comprehensive molecular analysis of renal medullary carcinoma (RMC), a rare and aggressive form of kidney cancer, leading to the identification of TROP2 as a promising therapeutic target. 

By evaluating 25 patient samples, the researchers identified overexpression of TROP2 and several other cell-surface proteins in RMC, as well as upregulation of the Hippo pathway. These findings led to the exploration of sacituzumab govitecan, a TROP2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate.

In a small cohort of four heavily pretreated RMC patients, sacituzumab govitecan resulted in one partial response and two patients with stable disease, with a median progression-free survival of 2.9 months.

Identifying TROP2 as a therapeutic target in renal medullary carcinoma marks a pivotal step toward precision treatment for one of the most aggressive and underserved cancers."

Pavlos Msaouel, M.D., Ph.D., principal investigator, associate professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology

Renal medullary carcinoma is a fast-moving, treatment-resistant kidney cancer primarily affecting young individuals with sickle cell trait, highlighting the urgent need to understand its molecular basis to guide therapeutic development.

This study, which also characterized the RMC tumor microenvironment, supports further investigation of drugs targeting TROP2 as treatment options for this patient population.

Merck, a leading science and technology company, has entered into a partnership with Promega Corporation, a global life science solutions and service leader based in Madison, Wisconsin in the US, to co-develop novel technologies that advance drug screening and discovery.

The agreement unites Merck's strength in organoids and synthetic chemistry with Promega's market leading assay and reporter technologies. Together, the companies aim to develop assays capable of tracking cellular activity in real time using an innovative reporter system within three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures. These 3D cell cultures, also called organoids, mimic the human biology, where testing can be done in a model that is physiologically more relevant than traditional two-dimensional (2D) models.

This partnership with Promega shows what is possible when two companies with a shared commitment to science join forces.

By combining our organoid expertise with Promega's advanced reporter technology, we aim to enable high throughput screening that helps researchers identify safer and more effective drug candidates for complex diseases such as cancer - and do it faster than ever before.”

Anand Nambiar, Head of Science & Lab Solutions for the Life Science business, Merck

“Collaborating with Merck allows us to push the boundaries of drug discovery,” said Tom Livelli, VP, Life Sciences Products & Services at Promega Corporation. “By combining our technological strengths, we are helping to create more relevant and accessible models for drug discovery, with the goal of enabling new insights and eventually better outcomes for patients.”

In addition to the primary co-development agreement, Merck and Promega have signed a separate agreement to explore the integration of Merck's Duolink® with Promega's HiBiT technologies. This aims to create new workflows for studying the protein interactions inside cells, providing researchers with deeper insights into cellular signalling and supporting applications in both biologics and small molecule drug discovery.

The partnership with Promega is one of the latest steps that Merck is taking to strengthen its leadership in next-generation biology and uniting complementary expertise to deliver the next wave of breakthroughs in drug discovery. In December 2024, Merck acquired HUB Organoids B.V., a pioneer in organoid technology, which expanded Merck's capabilities in 3D cell culture and enhanced its portfolio with HUB's foundational patents, advanced model generation, and high-throughput screening services. These strategic moves position Merck as a leader in providing researchers with the tools needed to bridge the gap between laboratory discoveries and clinical success.

Scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, in collaboration with researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine, have made a breakthrough in understanding why many cancer patients develop nerve damage after chemotherapy. Their new study reveals that a stress response inside certain immune cells can trigger this debilitating side effect. This discovery could open the door to new ways to prevent or treat nerve damage in cancer patients.

The study was published online today in Science Translational Medicine.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common and often severe side effect of cancer treatment, especially with drugs like paclitaxel. It can cause tingling, numbness and pain in the hands and feet, sometimes forcing patients to stop life-saving treatment early. Up to half of all patients receiving chemotherapy may experience this condition, but until now, the exact cause has remained a mystery.

To better understand this nerve toxicity that could be painful, scientists used a well-established mouse model that closely reflects the nerve problems experienced by people undergoing cancer treatment. This model allowed researchers to observe how a specific immune cell pathway, known as IRE1α, contributes to triggering inflammation that led to neurotoxicity and pain. By blocking the IRE1α pathway in the immune cells of these mice, either through genetic techniques or with an IRE1a inhibitor, the team was able to prevent the development of nerve damage, pain and toxic inflammation.

The researchers also studied a group of patients from Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist's National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The patients were receiving chemotherapy for gynecological cancers, collecting blood samples before and after treatment to measure IRE1α activity in their immune cells. They found that patients with higher IRE1α activation were more likely to develop severe neuropathy due to chemotherapy, directly linking the mouse model findings to patient outcomes.

Our research shows that a stress response inside immune cells is a key contributor to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy that could be painful and debilitating. By targeting this pathway, we may be able to protect patients from one of the most challenging side effects of cancer treatment."

E. Alfonso Romero-Sandoval, M.D., Ph.D., professor of anesthesiology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine and study's corresponding author

"Our study opens the opportunity to further explore if this pathway could be used to predict what patients will develop this condition and therefore could help clinicians implement patient-tailored treatments," Romero-Sandoval said.

The discovery could lead to new drugs that block this pathway, helping patients stay on their cancer treatment without suffering from painful side effects.

According to Romero-Sandoval, who is a member of the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, this is the first study to show that the IRE1α stress sensor in immune cells is directly linked to nerve damage from chemotherapy.

The team plans to conduct larger clinical studies to confirm these findings and test whether the IRE1α pathway could be used as a biomarker for disease progression and if drugs that block this stress sensor can safely prevent or reduce nerve damage in cancer patients. They also hope to explore whether this approach could help with other types of nerve pain. Interestingly, an IRE1a inhibitor is currently in clinical trials to improve anti-cancer effects of chemotherapy, including paclitaxel.

This research was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense. Additional support came from the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Military veterans who develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury may have a higher mortality rate in the following years than veterans who develop epilepsy with no previous traumatic brain injury, according to a study published on October 29, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

While these findings need to be validated in future studies, we recommend that people who develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury are closely monitored, and, especially if seizures do not respond well to treatment, are prioritized for surgery or changing to new medications without delay."

Zulfi Haneef, MD, MBBS, FRCP, study author of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology

For the study, researchers looked at Veterans Health Administration database information on 210,182 veterans with epilepsy. Of those, 28,832 people had experienced a traumatic brain injury within the five years before their epilepsy diagnosis. This group was an average of 53 years old at the time of diagnosis. The remaining 181,350 people had no traumatic brain injury within five years before their diagnosis. They were an average of 61 years old at diagnosis.

The participants were followed for an average of six years. During that time, 10,780 of the people with epilepsy with traumatic brain injury died, compared to 92,621 of the people with epilepsy without traumatic brain injury.

Once researchers accounted for how long each person spent as part of the study and adjusted for other factors that could affect the mortality rate, they found that overall people with post-traumatic brain injury epilepsy were 2% more likely to die during the study than those with epilepsy without traumatic brain injury.

However, the risk varied based on the cause of the traumatic brain injury. Those with skull or facial fractures had an 18% higher risk of death during the study period; those with diffuse brain injury had a 17% higher risk; and those with localized brain injury had a 16% higher risk.

In contrast, people whose traumatic brain injury was from a concussion had a lower mortality rate than the rate for people with epilepsy with no traumatic brain injury.

Haneef said several possibilities could explain this finding. Some causes of non-traumatic brain injury epilepsy that served as the comparison group, such as stroke, infections, or tumors, have high mortality rates. If compared to the normal population, Haneef said the mortality rates would be much higher.

"It's also possible that when people develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury, they receive earlier treatment and may have more access to care and better outcomes than people who have not had a traumatic brain injury," Haneef said.

The researchers also found that people with extracerebral traumatic brain injury who developed epilepsy at a young age-or when they were in the 18-39 age range-were twice as likely to die during the study as young adults with epilepsy but no brain injury.

A limitation of the study was that information about traumatic brain injuries experienced before the people were receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration was limited.

The study was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Labman is revolutionizing accuracy, scalability, and efficiency in cancer research by integrating robotics and AI for precision image analysis.

In Vivan Therapeutics' laboratory, scientists were spending hours manually analyzing fly pupae - tiny organisms that hold critical data for cancer drug testing. Each vial of pupae required precise counting and categorization based on both shape and developmental stage.

To address this challenge, Labman engineered a sophisticated custom automation platform by integrating advanced robotics with precision imaging. The system manages vials of fly pupae, ensuring precise positioning for accurate image capture.

The novel system analyzes large volumes of pupae with precision and consistency, allowing researchers to dedicate more time to strategic tasks. This innovation has revolutionized Vivan's ability to scale its operations while preserving the accuracy and reliability essential to life-saving study.

The technology demonstrated a 98 % accuracy rate in classifying and counting fly pupae, saving 4.5 days of manual counting per patient.

Vivan Therapeutics is a pioneer in cancer treatment innovation through its novel approach to personalized medicine. By using genetically modified fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to model human cancer mutations, Vivan tests thousands of drug combinations to identify the most effective therapies for individual patients.

Vivan Therapeutics offers two main products: the Personal Discovery Process (PDP) and Tumatch software. Both systems aim to develop highly individualized cancer treatments tailored to the genetic makeup of each patient's tumor.

The Personal Discovery Process (PDP) revolutionizes cancer treatment by carrying out highly targeted research tailored to individual patients. This cutting-edge approach is akin to a large-scale clinical trial developed for just a single person.

By replicating the genetic intricacies of a patient's tumor into a population of 500,000 fruit fly ‘avatars', as many as 2,000 FDA and NICE-approved drugs can be tested, including those not traditionally prescribed for cancer treatment.

Through analysis of large datasets of tumor genetics, primarily focused on colorectal cancer, Vivan has identified around 400 genetic signatures representing real-world tumor configurations. Notably, approximately 130 of these signatures account for almost 80% of patient cases, enabling efficient modeling for personalized therapies.

While this novel approach holds tremendous potential for customized cancer treatments, the work depends on analyzing hundreds of thousands of fly pupae, a necessary but demanding manual task requiring precision and consistency.

There were only three of us working on this at the beginning, and it was incredibly time-consuming. We had to manually count and score pupae, entering data into individual Excel sheets. It was tiring and you make mistakes. We thought, there must be a better way.

Vivan partnered with Labman to design an automation system that ensures the accuracy and scalability required for Vivan's cutting-edge research. This system automates the task of sorting and analyzing fly pupae, handling vials, and capturing high-resolution images.

By examining genetic variations in fruit flies, Vivan uncovers crucial insights into how different patients respond to therapies. This work aims to ensure that cancer treatments are more effective and tailored to each patient's individual needs.

We know that the fruit flies respond to the same drugs that we do. So, you can treat the fly with the same drug that we take and they're going to respond.

The first cancer type that we're focused on is gastrointestinal, colorectal, pancreatic cancer. And so, we've already started seeding the data set for lung and we'll keep moving to more cancer types as we can. 

Laura Towart, Chief Executive Officer, Vivan Therapeutics

While Labman's platform automated the image capture of vials, Vivan Therapeutics required a solution to replace its labor-intensive, unmanageable manual counting and analysis processes.

V7 specializes in computer vision and task automation. Its flagship product, Darwin, is an AI training and data labeling platform that allows the development of machine learning models for tasks requiring image analysis. Darwin enables data labeling as well as model training and deployment for seamless inference.

Working in collaboration with V7, Andrea leveraged their Darwin platform to train an AI model capable of classifying and counting pupae with exceptional accuracy. Utilizing high-resolution images captured by Labman's system, the model accurately categorizes pupae, removing the need for manual analysis and delivering actionable data with over 98 % accuracy.

We trained the model with around 1,000 images initially, achieving an accuracy rate in the high 80s to 90s, so we thought, OK, we could go to the full project.

A company used Labman's expertise in developing custom projects to develop an innovative solution that was urgently required.

Sampled, a large biorepository and human diagnostics R&D company with operations in Piscataway, New Jersey, and Glasgow, UK, faced a significant challenge during the global COVID-19 pandemic: the need to efficiently process an extremely high volume of incoming saliva samples to satisfy the situation's demands.

To address this, Sampled collaborated with Labman Automation for a cutting-edge solution. Labman designed, constructed, and commissioned an automated system to streamline the processing of saliva samples in Spectrum saliva tubes, enabling increased throughput while minimizing the need for manual handling. Not only that, but the design, build and testing phase of the project was delivered within a record timeframe of only six weeks. 

For Sampled, the manual accessioning and registration process was slow, arduous, and labor-intensive. Chris Piccirillo, Director of Automation, stated, “We physically received thousands of saliva tubes each day and had to individually register and accession every tube, sometimes close to 100,000 a day by hand.”

The process of decapping samples, scanning barcodes, and configuring the tubes for additional processing was highly laborious and prone to human error. As the COVID-19 caseload surged, Sampled required an advanced and efficient solution to manage this immense volume of samples.

To handle these difficulties, Labman proposed a highly tailored automation system. The system was carefully engineered to suit the exact needs of Sampled's laboratory, particularly the types of tubes being processed. Its functionality included tube decapping, barcode scanning, and a unique resealing mechanism.

A distinctive property was an automated tube-sorting mechanism that maintained the correct sample order after their processing through the system, preventing costly mix-ups. “All of the features Labman created on the system were really well made”, said Chris. 

With reliability and uptime being priorities for such an operation, Labman's high-quality in-house engineering proved indispensable.

Although Spectrum saliva tubes offer a user-friendly and safe technique for COVID testing, they tend to seal shut due to the effects of the neutralizing agent released when the cap is screwed on. Labman's system addressed this challenge through the use of in-house-produced gripper fingers and a unique profile specifically developed to efficiently decap these tightly sealed Spectrum tubes, saving the hands of hundreds of workers.

The adoption of Labman's automated system had a direct impact on Sampled's operations, allowing the company to increase sample processing throughput by as many as 20,000 samples a day.

At the height of the pandemic, Sampled had to hire an additional 300-350 temporary staff to help process the samples. With the new technology, 250 fewer staff were required, substantially reducing overhead costs and boosting efficiency by reducing the acute RSI issues associated with undoing the tubes. This also decreased the risk of human interaction with COVID-19.

One thing I've always been focused on in my career is building relationships [...] I just think that you guys do a tremendous job at that.

Chris Piccirillo, Sampled

Labman is committed to building long-term relationships with its customers. “To have those relationships, whether they're short or long-term, is really important to me. All of my staff here in the robotics team and the lab staff love working with the Labman team - you guys do a tremendous job at building and maintaining those connections,” said Chris.

The relationship between Sampled and Labman extended beyond technical implementation, fostering a sense of reliability and trust.

Sampled's partnership with Labman represents an extraordinary success story. Labman's bespoke automation solution transformed the laboratory's efficiency, delivering a substantial return on investment while establishing a warm and enduring client relationship.

After validating the system's performance in NJ, Sampled commissioned a repeat for its site in Motherwell, Glasgow, reinforcing its trust in Labman's solutions. Labman's dedication to solving specific challenges through innovation and delivering dependable support has positioned the company as an important partner for Sampled, a testament to Labman's ongoing commitment to customer success.

If untreated, a disorder of high brain pressure called idiopathic intracranial hypertension can lead to vision loss. But this disorder can develop without noticeable symptoms, making it hard to catch. A new study looks at how these vision problems develop and proposes a way to predict who will develop issues. The study is published on October 29, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

The number of cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been increasing, and it mainly affects young women, so we need more information about who is more likely to develop vision problems and how that process works."

Dagmar Beier, MD, study author of the University of Southern Denmark, Odense

The disorder occurs when there is increased pressure in the fluid surrounding the brain with no apparent cause. It may cause chronic, disabling headaches, vision problems, and in rare cases, permanent vision loss. Obesity is the primary risk factor for the condition.

The study involved 154 people with intracranial hypertension with an average age of 28. Of those, 147 people had papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc in the eye due to elevated pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 69% had scotomas, which are blind spots in their vision that can be temporary or permanent. And 26% of the participants had reduced visual acuity, or sharpness of vision.

People in the study received medication for the papilledema until it was resolved. At that point, 50% still had scotomas and 13% still had reduced visual acuity. None of the participants developed blindness.

Researchers found two mechanisms that led to vision problems. In one group, higher degrees of papilledema were associated with increased thinning of the optic nerve fiber layer in the retina, causing scotoma in their peripheral visual fields. The other group had severe papilledema and problems with the macula, or the center of the retina. This resulted in reduced visual acuity that did not resolve after treatment.

The researchers also developed an assessment to help physicians predict at the time of diagnosis with intracranial hypertension who might later develop vision problems.

"This score needs to be validated by external groups before it can be considered ready for use, but we identified the severity of papilledema and the disorganization of the inner layer of the retina as major predictors for who will have persistent vision problems," Beier said.

In addition to the need for external validation of the new scoring method, another limitation of the study is that the researchers did not analyze how well the assessments of each person who rated the vision of the participants correlated with the others' ratings.

Researchers estimate that about 196 million people around the world live with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) — an eye disease that causes vision loss in mostly people over the age of 50. 

Of the people who have AMD, about 8 million globally have an advanced form of AMD called geographic atrophy. With geographic atrophy, the cells of the eye's retina become damaged and begin to die, leading to irreversible vision loss. 

While there are medications available to help slow down disease progression, there is currently no cure for AMD or geographic atrophy. People with geographic apathy learn to use and depend on low vision aids like magnifiers and special eyeglasses to help them read, identify faces, and complete everyday tasks. 

Now, a new study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows how a wireless retinal implant may help restore central vision in people with geographic atrophy. 

For this study, researchers recruited 38 people with geographic atrophy to receive the new PRIMA implant, which had been developed by Daniel Palanker, PhD, a professor of ophthalmology at Stanford University. 

The PRIMA insert had been tested in a first-in-human trial, with its results published in August 2020, showing four of five people given the PRIMA insert showed a partial, but substantial return of their central vision in the eye given the implant. 

The PRIMA system consists of a very small wireless chip that is implanted into the back of the eye, and a special pair of glasses. The chip transmits images to the glasses, allowing the person wearing them to see in real time. 

The retinal implant is photovoltaic, which means it uses natural light to power itself. 

For this study, researchers recruited 38 study participants over the age of 60 from 17 medical sites across five European countries, all who had geographic atrophy due to AMD, and vision worse than 20/320 in at least one of their eyes. 

Study participants underwent a medical procedure to have the PRIMA implant placed in one eye. Within four to five weeks, they were given the special glasses to start using. 

Scientists found that of the 32 participants who completed the trial, 26 experienced clinically meaningful improvements to their visual acuity after one year of using the PRIMA system. On average, participants regained the ability to see another five lines on the standard eye chart, with one improving by 12 lines. 

Additionally, 27 study participants reportedly regained their ability to read, using the system to read letters and numbers at home. 

“It's the first time that any attempt at vision restoration has achieved such results in a large number of patients,” José-Alain Sahel, MD, Distinguished Professor and Chairman, Department of Ophthalmology in the School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and Endowed Chair of The Eye and Ear Foundation and co-lead author of this study, said in a press release. 

“More than 80% of the patients were able to read letters and words, and some of them are reading pages in a book. I don't think we'll ever be able to restore full 20/20 vision with the implant alone, but we are investigating tricks that could further improve people's quality of life and take them above the threshold for legal blindness. One of the main requests we hear from patients is to be able to recognize faces and emotions again, and that's something we're working toward,” he said. 

Medical News Today had the opportunity to speak with Benjamin Bert, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study, who commented it is great to have new technologies being developed to help treat vision loss. 

“This particular study expands the information about the PRIMA system, which is fascinating because it utilizes the remaining functional retinal anatomy while providing an artificial replacement for the damaged photoreceptor layer occurring in geographic atrophy caused by AMD,” Bert explained. 

“As the population is aging and people are living longer, age-related conditions are increasing in prevalence. For that reason, it is important to continue to work on ways to help restore or at least partially restore vision for people suffering from age-related conditions like AMD. Any improvement in vision can help people remain independent as they age and help avoid trips and falls.” — Benjamin Bert, MD

“In order to be comfortable in offering this to patients, it would be nice to know the longevity of the device, long-term support for the device, modifications to the surgical procedure to minimize complications, and the potential future prospects for upgrading the technology,” he added. 

MNT also spoke with Jonathan Gloth, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist and fellowship trained vitreoretinal surgeon at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Ocean University Medical Center in New Jersey, who found this to be a promising study for patients with geographic atrophy. 

“Though the initial sample size is small (38 patients) in the recently published article, 80% of patients achieved clinically significant visual improvement,” Gloth said. “This retinal implant is placed in a better location, the subretinal space, which affords these patients higher resolution and better visual acuity than previously studied prosthetic retinal implants.” 

“It is imperative that we find ways to improve vision in patients with geographic atrophy as it affects over a million people in the United States and 8 million people worldwide. These patients suffer profound vision loss and lose the ability to read, drive, and recognize faces.”— Jonathan Gloth, MD

“This study will have to be reproduced at a larger scale to further assess the safety of the device,” Gloth added. “81% of patients in this study suffered serious adverse effects. As retina specialists become more familiar with the surgical implantation technique, I expect this compaction rate to decline.”

Even when blood pressure is well controlled, older adults whose blood pressure fluctuates widely from one heartbeat to the next may be at greater risk for brain shrinkage and nerve cell injury, according to a new study led by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.

The study, first published online in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease on October 17, reveals that short-term "dynamic instability" in blood pressure - moment-to-moment changes measured over just minutes - is linked to loss of brain tissue in regions critical for memory and cognition, as well as to blood biomarkers of nerve cell damage.

"Our findings show that even when average blood pressure is normal, instability from one heartbeat to the next may place stress on the brain," said USC Leonard Davis School Professor of Gerontology and Medicine Daniel Nation, senior author of the study. "These moment-to-moment swings appear to be associated with the same kinds of brain changes we see in early neurodegeneration."

While high average blood pressure has long been known to increase the risk of dementia, this study focuses on blood pressure variability, or how much blood pressure rises and falls over short time periods. Recent evidence suggests that such fluctuations can strain small blood vessels in the brain and reduce their ability to deliver steady blood flow.

In this study, the researchers combined two complementary measures:

Together, these measures indicate how much blood flow changes over a short period of time, or what the researchers call "blood pressure dynamic instability."

"Blood pressure isn't static; it's always adapting to the body's needs," Nation explained.

But as we age, that regulation can become less precise. This study suggests that excessive fluctuations could be a sign of vascular aging that contributes to brain injury."

Daniel Nation, Leonard Davis School Professor of Gerontology and Medicine, University of Southern California

The study included 105 community-dwelling older adults between ages 55 and 89 who were generally healthy and had no major neurological disease. During MRI scans, participants' blood pressure was monitored continuously using a finger cuff device that recorded every beat for seven minutes. Researchers then analyzed how these fine-scale fluctuations related to brain structure and blood biomarkers linked to neurodegeneration.

MRI scans revealed that participants with both high ARV and high ASI, which indicates unstable pressure and stiff arteries, had smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes. These two brain regions are vital for learning and memory and are among the first affected by Alzheimer's disease. Blood samples showed that the same individuals had higher levels of neurofilament light (NfL), a blood-based marker that rises when nerve cells are damaged.

Importantly, these findings remained significant even after accounting for participants' age, sex, and average blood pressure, suggesting that fluctuations themselves, not just overall pressure, may be a key risk factor.

In addition, the brain changes appeared more pronounced on the left side, consistent with previous research showing that the left hemisphere may be more vulnerable to vascular stress and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The researchers speculate that differences in blood vessel anatomy or blood flow demands between hemispheres might make the left side more susceptible.

The findings open a new window into how cardiovascular changes contribute to cognitive decline and may offer novel prevention strategies.

"Traditionally, we've focused on lowering average blood pressure numbers," said Trevor Lohman, USC research assistant professor of neurology and gerontology and first author of the study. "But this study suggests we should also be looking at how stable blood pressure is from moment to moment. Reducing these fluctuations could help protect the brain, even in people whose average readings look fine."

Future research will explore whether interventions that stabilize blood pressure, such as tailored medication timing, exercise, or stress reduction, can slow brain aging and reduce dementia risk. The authors also note that because this was a cross-sectional study, it cannot prove cause and effect, necessitating larger, long-term studies that closely examine the links between cardiovascular and brain health.

"Our results underscore how closely connected the heart and brain are," Lohman said. "Maintaining steady, healthy blood flow could be one of the best ways to support brain health as we age."

Patients with weak heart function who receive stem cell therapy shortly after a heart attack are at lower risk of developing heart failure and related hospital stays compared with standard care, finds a clinical trial published by The BMJ today.

The researchers say the findings suggest this technique may be a valuable add-on procedure for this particular group of patients after a heart attack to prevent subsequent heart failure and reduce the risk of future adverse events.

Advances in heart attack management have improved survival rates considerably, but this has also led to rising rates of subsequent heart failure. While recent studies have indicated that stem cell therapy may reduce rates of heart failure after a heart attack, clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits.

To address this gap, the researchers set out to assess the impact of delivering stem cells directly into coronary arteries (known as intracoronary infusion) after a heart attack on the development of heart failure over three years.

Their findings are based on 396 patients (average age 57-59 years) with no previous heart conditions at three teaching hospitals in Iran. They had all experienced a first heart attack (myocardial infarction) leading to extensive heart muscle damage and weakened heart function - where the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber, is too weak to pump blood out to the body as effectively as it should.

Of these, 136 patients in the intervention group received an intracoronary infusion of allogenic Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells within 3-7 days of their heart attack in addition to standard care. The remaining 260 control group patients received standard care alone.

Factors such as age, sex, baseline heart function, smoking status, obesity, existing high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems were taken into account, and patients were monitored for an average of 33 months.

Compared with the control group, intracoronary infusion of stem cells was associated with reduced rates of heart failure (2.77 vs 6.48 per 100 person years), readmission to hospital for heart failure (0.92 vs 4.20 per 100 person years), and a combined measure of cardiovascular death and readmission for heart attack or heart failure (2.8 vs 7.16 per 100 person years).

The intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on readmission to hospital for heart attack (1.23 vs 3.06 per 100 person years), death from any cause (1.81 vs 1.66 per 100 person years), or cardiovascular death (0.91 vs 1.33 per 100 person-years).

However, by six months heart function in the intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement from baseline at six months compared with the control group.

This was a large trial with long term follow-up and clinically meaningful outcome measures, but the researchers acknowledge several limitations to their findings. These include the inability to do a sham procedure for the control group, which would have allowed for a double blinded study design instead of a single blinded format. Nor did they assess heart failure biomarkers or investigate the physiological effects of the intervention on heart tissue.

Nevertheless, they say these results suggest that this technique "may serve as a valuable adjunctive procedure after myocardial infarction to prevent the development of heart failure and reduce the risk of future adverse events."

Additional trials confirming this finding are needed as well as further research "to explore the underlying mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cells therapy and to optimize its application in clinical practice," they add.

A large French cohort study reveals that eating patterns with lower environmental footprints not only protect the planet but also cut the risk of major chronic diseases, a double win for people and the planet.



Study: Association between dietary environmental pressures and major chronic diseases: assessment from the prospective NutriNet-Santé cohort. Image Credit: metamorworks / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in The Lancet Regional Health, researchers investigated links between diet-related environmental pressures and human health.

The study leveraged a large-scale prospective study of over 34,077 French adults and found that for each one-standard-deviation increase in the composite EPI, the risk of developing cancer (HR 1.15 [95% CI 1.03–1.28]), coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes (HR 1.50 [1.29–1.73]) increased significantly. No significant association was observed with stroke or all-cause mortality.

These findings suggest that diets with lower overall environmental pressures are associated with better health outcomes and that sustainable food systems are critical to planetary and public health.

"Co-benefits" refers to the increasingly popular concept that postulates that a single action (e.g., consciously choosing sustainable foods over their unsustainable alternatives) can simultaneously benefit both human health and the environment.

The concept has now become a central topic in climate and health discussions, with decades of research suggesting that dietary patterns are a significant factor in the rising global burden of chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes [T2D]).

Unfortunately, recent research has found that the current global agri-food system is a primary driver of environmental damage, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe), land degradation, and freshwater use.

Comparative studies examining the environmental impacts of different food products have shown that plant-based diets are generally better for the planet than their animal-derived counterparts. However, most of these studies have focused on only one or two environmental indicators, such as GHGe, limiting their generalizability in the broader sustainability context.

A comprehensive investigation of a broad spectrum of environmental pressures and their associations with human health would provide policymakers and public health agencies with the knowledge required to optimize sustainable dietary advice, thereby improving outcomes both for the environment and supporting human health.

However, not all environmental indicators were aligned with lower health risk: higher water use was linked to lower cancer risk, and higher ecological infrastructure was positively associated with several disease risks.

The present study addressed this knowledge gap by leveraging prospective cohort data from the NutriNet-Santé cohort, an extensive, web-based population study in France. Screening of NutriNet-Santé cohort participant data identified 34,077 adult participants who met study requirements (age> 15). The study critically included long-term health data (median follow-up time = 8.39 years).

Diet was measured once at baseline in 2014 using a 264-item organic-capable Food Frequency Questionnaire (Org-FFQ), which logged participants' dietary habits and how often those foods were organic versus conventionally produced.

Additionally, participants' sociodemographic information (for statistical model correction) and detailed medical histories (for long-term health outcomes analyses) were collected. This data was then merged with environmental databases to calculate the impact of each person's diet across six distinct indicators:

Finally, the outcomes of these individual indicators were combined into a single synthetic score, the Environmental Pressures Index (EPI), with higher scores indicating greater, more harmful environmental impact.

Weighted multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with extensive covariate adjustment, proportional-hazards checks via Schoenfeld residuals, dose–response assessed using restricted cubic splines, and marginal structural models in sensitivity analyses were leveraged to elucidate if a high EPI score was associated with a participant's future risk of developing chronic diseases.

Study findings revealed a clear and positive association between the environmental and health impacts of different foods; a diet worse for the environment was also observed to result in suboptimal health outcomes.

Specifically, statistical models revealed that for every one-standard-deviation increase in an individual's EPI score, their risk of developing cancer (any) rose by 15% (HR 1.15). The results were even more stark for metabolic and cardiovascular health: the risk of coronary heart disease and T2D both increased by 50% (HR 1.50) for every SD increase.

No statistically significant associations were found for stroke or all-cause mortality during the follow-up period.

The study further established patterns between diets and health outcomes; participants with the highest-pressure (high-EPI) diets were observed to consume significantly more red meats (pork, beef, and lamb), poultry, and processed meats.

Conversely, those on the lowest-pressure (low-EPI) diets ate more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, aligning closely with sustainable eating plans like the increasingly popular EAT-Lancet diet.

Higher pesticide treatment frequency was positively associated with cancer, CVD, and T2D risks, whereas higher water use, reflecting greater fruit and vegetable intake, was linked to lower cancer risk. Ecological infrastructure scores, capturing biodiversity-related pressures, showed paradoxical positive associations with several chronic diseases. Although low-EPI diets were not strictly vegetarian, they tended to be more plant-rich and less reliant on animal-based foods, reflecting broader sustainable dietary patterns.

The study also accounted for farming methods, distinguishing between organic and conventional production, ensuring that these were integrated into environmental impact estimates. Stroke analyses were acknowledged to have lower statistical power due to fewer incident cases, potentially limiting precision.

The present study provides strong, comprehensive evidence supporting a "win-win" scenario: diets with a low overall environmental footprint are associated with significant health benefits. While the study was likely biased to include health-conscious volunteers with better overall dietary choices than the population mean, these findings reinforce the idea that sustainable food systems are a critical component of public health.

The study evaluated environmental pressures rather than labelling diets as vegetarian or non-vegetarian, underscoring that the health and environmental advantages arise from overall dietary composition rather than categorical diet type. By demonstrating the consistency of findings in sensitivity analyses and marginal structural models, the authors reinforced the robustness of these associations.

Real-world data from over 14,000 Italian adults reveal that GLP-1 receptor agonists can induce remission in type 2 diabetes, with one clinically balanced definition linking drug use to reduced cardiovascular and microvascular risks.

In a recent study published in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe, researchers examined the clinical characteristics, frequency, and outcomes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission following initiation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA).

T2D is a metabolic disorder that can lead to a substantially high burden without effective intervention due to macrovascular and microvascular complications. The prevalence of T2D has reached pandemic levels and is projected to increase.

T2D remission has emerged as a realistic goal, especially with interventions that lead to significant weight loss. GLP-1RAs have been effective in reducing glycemia, cardiovascular and renal risk, and body weight.

The possibility of T2D remission with GLP-1RAs has attracted attention, particularly following the development of dual incretin receptor agonists. Despite the increasing clinical use of GLP-1RAs, evidence on the clinical correlates and frequency of T2D remission is limited.

In this multicenter Italian study, researchers analyzed clinical characteristics, remission frequency, and outcomes using different definitions of T2D remission after GLP-1RA initiation. The GLP-1RA for Simplification in Diabetes (GLIMPLES) study collected retrospective electronic health record data of T2D patients who started GLP-1RAs between January 2010 and January 2022. The index date corresponded to the first GLP-1RA prescription. Remission was evaluated post-index date according to four definitions.

R1: HbA1c <6.5% for ≥3 months without glucose-lowering medication.

R2: Same as R1 but allowing continued GLP-1RA use.

R3: Same as R1 but without new glucose-lowering medications compared to baseline.

R4: Same as R1 regardless of ongoing pharmacotherapy.

Participants were classified as being in remission or not based on these definitions. The primary objective was to assess remission frequency, while secondary objectives included evaluating clinical predictors and comparing intermediate outcomes and complications between groups.

Intermediate endpoints included blood pressure, body weight, HbA1c, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Complications assessed included microangiopathy, macroangiopathy, and cardiovascular events. Baseline comparisons used Chi-squared and Student's t tests. Logistic regression examined associations between GLP-1RA type and remission, while Cox proportional hazard models compared time-to-event outcomes.

A total of 14,141 T2D patients initiating GLP-1RA therapy were included in the analysis. The average participant was 60 years old with a 10-year diabetes history, a BMI of 32 kg/m², and a baseline HbA1c of 8.1%. Common baseline treatments included metformin, insulin, and sulfonylureas. GLP-1RAs used were dulaglutide (50.5%), liraglutide (24.9%), semaglutide (12.1%), exenatide (11%), and lixisenatide (1.4%). Nearly 25% of participants switched GLP-1RAs during follow-up.

The mean follow-up duration was four years. Remission occurred in 5.8% (R1), 6.2% (R2), 12.2% (R3), and 18.3% (R4) of participants. The time to remission averaged six months across definitions. Remission lasted longer under R3 (9.3 months) and R4 (10.1 months) than under R1 (6.5 months) and R2 (6.6 months).

Average weight loss varied by GLP-1RA: semaglutide (3.9 kg), exenatide (3.3 kg), dulaglutide (3.1 kg), liraglutide (3 kg), and lixisenatide (2.8 kg). No single GLP-1RA was consistently superior in achieving remission, though dulaglutide showed positive associations with R1–R3, and semaglutide correlated negatively with R1–R2. These differences were not interpreted as evidence of comparative efficacy due to treatment switching and differing availability periods.

Remission was more likely among patients with shorter diabetes duration, higher BMI, fewer complications, and lower baseline insulin/SGLT2 inhibitor use. Individuals achieving remission demonstrated modest but significant improvements in body weight (–2 kg), HbA1c (–0.9 to –1.0%), blood pressure (–1 to –2 mmHg), and triglycerides (–15 mg/dL) across remission definitions.

Changes in eGFR were similar across definitions, but R3 was associated with slower UACR progression (~30% less). New-onset microangiopathy was 12–16% lower in participants with R1–R3, suggesting a potential metabolic memory effect. Moreover, R3 was associated with fewer cardiovascular events (HR 0.65), though remission was not associated with differences in macroangiopathy.

T2D remission occurred in a notable proportion of GLP-1RA users, with outcomes varying by definition. The R1 definition showed 5.8% remission, while the permissive criteria (R4) reached 18.3%. Among definitions, R3 represented the most balanced measure, offering moderate prevalence (12.2%), longer durability (9.3 months), and improved microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes.

Limitations included retrospective design, absence of mortality data, lack of event adjudication, potential attrition bias, and medication discontinuation not guided by protocol. These factors may influence observed remission rates and outcomes.

Mohamed Salah put pen to paper on a new Liverpool contract earlier in the summer. However, the Reds hitman has made a dire start to the season having scored just three league goals as Liverpool's title defence lies in tatters. The decision to hand Salah a new deal has been criticised and heightened speculation that the champions could cut their losses on the 33-year-old.

Salah wasn't included in the Liverpool matchday squad for Wednesday's disastrous 3-0 EFL Cup loss to Crystal Palace. Head coach Arne Slot opted to name an inexperienced XI for the welcome of the Eagles, who capitalised ruthlessly to set up a fifth round meeting with league leaders Arsenal.

The result means Liverpool have lost six of their last seven competitive outings, with a 5-1 Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt the sole win in that run. The streak leaves the Reds seven points off league leaders Arsenal and out of a domestic cup competition.

And Salah, who scored his first goal in over a month in the 3-2 loss to Brentford on Saturday night, has struggled for consistency in Slot's second season at Anfield. However, while he has been linked with a move to Al-Ahly, the Egyptian side are not in contention to sign Salah.

The Egyptian giants have a presidential election on Friday with Yasseen Mansour, the vice presidential candidate, said to be leading negotiations to sign Salah. However, former Al-Ahly winger and director of football, Sayed Abdel Hafeez, has poured cold water on any reports linking Salah with a return to his homeland.

Hafeez is in contention to be part of the club's new board, but he has dismissed talk of an approach for Salah and made it clear no official has reached out to the player's camp to try and lure the forward away from Liverpool.

"Mohamed Salah is a very big star and has done things that are difficult for any player in the Arab world to do. He's focusing on his professional career," Hafeez said.

"Linking Salah to Al-Ahly is a media effort, and he's a player who has honoured Egyptian football and all Arabs.

"Let's talk realistically. Salah renewed his contract with Liverpool months ago. There is no official at Al-Ahly who talked about this matter. This matter was only circulated in the media. We will focus on the team's priorities. I wish Salah success."

Former Chelsea striker and Sky Sports pundit Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and believes that Salah is no longer the main man at Liverpool and has identified the club's problem. The Reds have a tricky run of games between now and the November international break as they take on Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City over the next week.

"Slot is looking for his best XI," Hasselbaink started as he outlined the reasoning behind Liverpool's struggles. "Then, on top of that, Van Dijk is not having his best time. Konate is showing some fight, Kerkez has not settled in yet and Bradley is Mr Liverpool but is also still learning the game, and he is playing in a side that is not performing well so you can't expect a young boy to carry the side.

"In the middle, you now have a real No.10, so you have to play differently. There are so many things that are not right. You have Salah, who is sulking a little bit; a, because he's not playing well and b, he's also not really the main man anymore. Players like Ekitike have come in. Normally, when Salah is open and free, he gets the ball from everyone. Ekitike is going for himself and looking for his own opportunities.

"It is normal for new players because they want to show they are worth the price tag, and they want to show they can play for Liverpool, but the whole concept is not right; it doesn't feel right at the moment. It is for Slot to come and make it right, and at the moment, he is struggling with that."

Salah was a number of first team players who missed out for Liverpool on Wednesday night as Slot named a much-changed team for the Palace clash.

Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch, Ibrahima Konate and Cody Gakpo also failed to make the matchday squad, though the quartet, and Salah, are expected to return to the side for Saturday's game against Aston Villa.

Paris Saint-Germain are moving swiftly to extend the contract of club prodigy Senny Mayulu. The 19-year-old midfielder who scored in the 2025 Champions League final is being monitored by Premier League giants Manchester City and Chelsea as his current contract expires in 2027. However, the French champions are finalising a contract extension that could secure the future of one of Europe's most exciting young talents.

The Parisian club are quietly working to secure their long-term future and that means keeping Mayulu, the French prodigy who exploded onto the scene last season. Having risen through the club's academy since 2018, Mayulu became a symbol of PSG's renewed focus on developing local talent rather than losing them early, as seen with past departures like Kingsley Coman and Moussa Diaby.

At just 19 years old, Mayulu has already earned his place in coach Luis Enrique's rotation, impressing with his creativity, ambidexterity, and ability to handle pressure. The midfielder's technique and tactical maturity have drawn comparisons to Warren Zaire-Emery, another PSG academy success. With Mayulu's contract extension, PSG not only wants to secure the talent they have but also intent to retain Parisian roots in a superstar-filled squad.

According to transfer specialist Nicolo Schira, PSG are now finalising a new three-year contract extension for Mayulu amid persistent interest from City, Chelsea and Tottenham. Scouts from all three English clubs have reportedly monitored his progress since late last season, viewing him as one of France's most complete young midfielders, who is equally capable of dictating tempo or breaking lines.

However, Mayulu's priority remains clear. He wants to continue growing in Paris, surrounded by mentors like Enrique and Marquinhos, and within the environment that shaped him. “Paris is home,” a source close to the player told L'Equipe, emphasising his desire to repay the club that trusted him. 

Mayulu's rise has been nothing short of meteoric. After debuting professionally in January 2024, he made 39 appearances in the 2024-25 season, scoring six goals and registering three assists across all competitions. His defining moment came in the 2025 Champions League final, when he came off the bench to score PSG's fifth goal in a 5-0 rout over Inter, becoming the youngest French player ever to score in a Champions League final at just 19 years and 14 days old.

That goal not only rounded off PSG's capture of a first European title but also announced Mayulu as a top prospect. By the end of the campaign, he had also lifted his second Ligue 1 and Coupe de France titles, contributing key goals in each tournament. Across his senior PSG career so far, Mayulu has 54 appearances, nine goals, and five assists to his tally.

With his current deal running until June 2027, PSG's push for an extension is more about protection than urgency. The club want to ensure Mayulu remains untouchable amid Premier League interest, mirroring their approach with Zaire-Emery. Enrique, a long-time admirer of technically gifted and disciplined players, reportedly sees Mayulu as a cornerstone for the next phase of PSG's evolution.

Internationally, Mayulu continues to rise through France's youth ranks, already a key figure for the U20 national team after success with the U18s. If his trajectory continues, a senior call-up seems inevitable.

Barcelona have identified Victor Osimhen as a potential successor to the ageing Robert Lewandowski, who is expected to leave the reigning La Liga champions at the end of the season. Osimhen joined Galatasaray permanently from Napoli ahead of the 2025-26 season in a record-breaking move, but he could return to one of Europe's big five leagues next season if Barca are serious about signing him.

According to a report from Catalan outlet Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona have set their sights on Osimhen and are considering signing the former Napoli frontman next summer. The reigning La Liga champions have made acquiring a new striker one of their top priorities while planning in advance for the 2026-27 season and beyond, in light of the possibility that the ongoing season will be Lewandowski's last in the Blaugrana colours. 

Osimhen's potential move to Barcelona will mark his return to one of Europe's most elite clubs, having spent the 2024-25 season on loan in the Turkish Super Lig at Galatasaray. After scoring 37 goals in 41 matches across all competitions, the Turkish champions fought tooth and nail to make the striker's signing permanent over the summer.

Barcelona will be in dire need of rejuvenating their frontline ahead of the 2026-27 season, owing to recent reports which claim that Barcelona are unwilling to renew Lewandowski's deal. Having turned 37 years old in August, the former Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich star has shown a dramatic decline in both his performances as well as his ability to cope with the demands of the intensity required to compete at the highest level in Europe. 

The Catalans made a surprise swoop in the summer of 2022 by signing Lewandowski from Bayern Munich. It would be naive to suggest that his spell in Catalunya has been underwhelming. He won the Pichichi in his debut campaign, scoring 23 goals in La Liga and 33 goals in all competitions to end Barcelona's four-year wait for a league title. He reached the milestone of a century of goals for Barcelona in the final game of the 2024-25 season, taking just 147 games to achieve the feat. Even though he finished the previous season with 42 goals in 52 games, his contract was already extended in February until June 30, 2026, with reports claiming that the Polish international wished to retire at Barca.

Things, however, have changed quite a lot since the end of last season. Lewandowski is no more a shoo-in in head coach Hansi Flick's starting XI, with the 37-year-old happy with a reduced role. His struggles with injuries, too, have played a big factor in keeping him out of the lineup. He has already missed four games this season, in addition to the five he missed towards the end of last season. Nevertheless, there is optimism for Flick and Barca after returning to team training earlier this week.

Rumours suggest that a move to Saudi Arabia next season could be on the cards. Pini Zahavi, Lewandowski's agent, has denied any such reports. "Lewandowski's contract with Barcelona expires in the summer of 2026, and no decisions have been made yet," he said. "We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming days. There's nothing official regarding negotiations with Saudi Arabian teams. There are no offers at this time."

Pulling off Osimhen's transfer will test Barcelona's financial capacity to the hilt. The Nigerian international currently earns €15 million (£13m/$17.5m) per annual, in addition €1m as loyalty bonus and €5m in image rights compensation. He is, therefore, the highest-paid player in Super Lig history. Galatasaray broke the bank to land Osimhen's signature, splurging a league-record €75m (£65m/$88m) to sign him on a four-year contract. 

It appears unlikely that a player with such a hefty price tag will depart without specific conditions being met – chief among them, the player's own desire for a new challenge. Likewise, Galatasaray are not expected to part ways with him for anything less than a substantial offer.

Any potential pursuit of Osimhen will ultimately depend on the club's financial standing, with the hierarchy fully aware that investing in a proven goal scorer represents a major financial commitment. The club will also be mindful of not getting a big-money signing unless they are fully confident of avoiding registration drama, which is contingent on the club meeting the 1:1 rule of La Liga. As things stand, the Catalan giants are not there yet.

This context helps explain why sporting director Deco has publicly played down the prospect of signing a new No.9, unless, of course, an exceptional market opportunity presents itself. “Perhaps you can do without one. This isn't the time to talk about signings. Ferran can play as a 9,” said Deco. “PSG won the Champions League without a penalty-area player. Talking about a ‘9' is a bit of a mistake, although there are good players.”

The Catalan giants have been linked with a number of strikers over the past few months. While it remains to be seen if they can get either of these signings over the line, speculation suggests that the likes of Harry Kane, Etta Eyong, Dusan Vlahovic, Erling Haaland, Serhou Guirassy and Julian Alvarez are on Barca's shortlist for next season.

Pep Guardiola delivered a worrying update on Erling Haaland's injury status ahead of Manchester City's Premier League clash with Bournemouth. The 24-year-old marksman sat out City's 3-1 Carabao Cup victory over Swansea midweek, a result that booked their place in the quarter-finals. But it is still uncertain whether he will be fit to face Bournemouth this weekend at the Etihad.

Haaland endured a rare off-day at Villa Park, squandering several golden chances as Pep Guardiola's men stumbled to their first defeat in six games. The prolific No. 9 saw an early strike denied by Emiliano Martínez before having another effort ruled out for offside. His evening went from bad to worse when he collided heavily with the post late in the game. The sight of Haaland trudging off down the tunnel with his head bowed and shoulders slumped left fans fearing the worst. Those fears were partially realised when he failed to make the squad for the trip to Swansea, where Guardiola's men came from behind to seal a victory without their talisman. 

Guardiola knows how vital Haaland has been to his team this season. The Norwegian has already smashed home 15 goals across just 12 appearances in the Premier League and Champions League. No other City player has managed more than a single goal in those competitions, emphasising just how dependent the champions have become on their towering striker. When pressed for an update after the Swansea victory, Guardiola's response did little to calm nerves among City supporters.

“I don't know yet. I hope so,” he said tersely when asked if Haaland would be ready to face the Cherries at the Etihad.

Unai Emery's Aston Villa deserve credit for how they nullified Haaland. The Spanish manager revealed that his side had worked meticulously to cut off service to the Norwegian and deny him space to operate.

"We tried tactically and in individual performance to get duels with him, intelligently, with the power we showed," Emery said. "Then we had some help from defensive cover and also the goalkeeper. We needed everything to stop him."

The plan certainly worked as Villa became only the second team, after Tottenham, to keep Haaland off the scoresheet this season. It is a remarkable feat given his ruthless form in front of goal in the current campaign. 

In Haaland's absence, Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush led the line against Swansea and took his chance brilliantly. The versatile attacker netted his first goal of the campaign in a lively display that helped City advance to the next round. Guardiola was full of praise for the 25-year-old, who recently returned from injury.

"With Erling, he knows perfectly how to be patient, how to be in small spaces, how to be consistent, to go to the ones in behind," Guardiola gushed postgame. "Marmoush has been injured for a long time and of course, playing in the position that Erling plays, and Erling is important, but we know in many games we need both and having him back is so nice."

The Egyptian has not started a league game since August but could be handed another opportunity against Bournemouth if Haaland isn't passed fit.

City currently sit fifth in the table, four points behind leaders Arsenal, and the pressure is building. Guardiola's men face a crucial run of home games before the next international break, starting with Bournemouth in the league, Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, and then a blockbuster clash with Liverpool. The reigning champions can ill afford to drop further ground in the title race, especially with Arsenal refusing to slip up. Dortmund's visit to Manchester next month will mark Haaland's reunion with his former club, and Guardiola will desperately want his superstar firing on all cylinders for that occasion. Bournemouth also arrive at the Etihad in fine form. The Cherries have been one of the league's surprise packages, sitting just four points off top spot and unbeaten since the opening weekend defeat at Anfield. A tough fight awaits Guardiola's men on Sunday.

It's official. The Oakland Roots and Soul training facility at Harbor Bay Business Park will serve as a Team Base Camp (TBC) for FIFA World Cup 26, which will take place June 11 to July 29 next year. TBCs are the facilities and hotels that will be the “home away from home” for each of the competing national teams, their delegations, media and broadcast, and fans.

This prestigious designation positions Alameda to host one of the world's national teams as they prepare for the prestigious tournament. National teams will select their TBC after the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw on December 5. The World Cup will feature 48 teams and 104 matches in 16 host cities throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

“Alameda is the perfect location for a national team to prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup games,” said Alameda Mayor Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft. “We are excited to welcome talented players and passionate fans to the Bay Area, which is currently experiencing a renaissance of business growth and revitalized retail and entertainment offerings. This event will shine a global spotlight on our beautiful waterfront community and the entire region.”

Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara is set to host six matches from June 13 to July 1, 2026.

As previously reported by Karin K. Jensen in the Alameda Post, financial support for hosting a FIFA World Cup team was unanimously authorized by City Council on July 15, in the form of a Transient Occupancy Tax (also known as a hotel tax) sharing agreement with the Roots and Soul in an amount not to exceed $150,000. Both Council and public commenters strongly supported this opportunity to showcase Alameda and support local businesses.

With more than 200 countries participating in qualification rounds and an estimated viewership of 6 billion people tuning in to watch the finals, FIFA World Cup 26 presents a substantial economic opportunity, the Post report stated. FIFA estimates a team base camp could attract 60,000 to 80,000 visitors and 30,000 hotel nights, significantly boosting local hotel and sales tax revenue.

Soccer's lawmakers are reportedly considering extending the powers of video assistant referees (VAR), a move which would ensure that the influence of the sport's most divisive decision-makers falls under even more scrutiny.

When VAR was introduced ahead of the 2018 World Cup, it was given the specifically vague brief of only ruling on “clear and obvious” errors in relation to:

As outlined by IFAB, the International Football Association Board, VAR cannot intervene on second yellow cards which lead to a sending off. The organization's advisory panel discussed the prospect of changing this during a regular review meeting this week,

It remains to be seen if this suggestion will escape the realm of theory and be put into practice at this summer's World Cup. An official proposal is expected to be submitted ahead of IFAB's Annual Business Meeting in January.

Appeals to bring second yellow cards under the remit of VAR have been lodged since the system's inception, it has been reported. However, Premier League referees chief Howard Webb tread a cautious line when discussing the prospect earlier this season.

“The message we get is ‘less is more' with VAR, and we've done pretty well in aligning our delivery with that expectation,” Webb crowed to BBC Sport. “If the game, or the people involved, tell us that greater use would be better for the game, then of course I'd be open—but we need to think carefully about the consequences, the ripple effects.

“If you are talking about yellow cards that are delivered incorrectly, which could be impactful on the game, then you also have to think about wrongly not-issued yellow cards.

“I understand the impact of a wrongly awarded corner that's clearly wrong—easy to see on video—and the impact of a wrongly issued yellow card. But equally there's also a feeling that VAR already exists to rectify clear errors in big situations, so we'll have those discussions and make sure to consult with the English game as well.”

IFAB have been battling soccer's slowing game clock for years. Ahead of the 2025–26 campaign, the game's lawmakers introduced a countdown measure to ensure that goalkeepers were only allowed to be in control of the ball for eight seconds. Referees have been advised to provide a visual five-second countdown by lowering a raised arm.

Burnley's Martin Dúbravka became the first player in Premier League history to be counted out in an opening weekend defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, yet the law has scarcely been implemented in England's top flight since. Nevertheless, IFAB claim this rule change has received “positive global feedback” and are considering stretching countdowns to other aspects of the sport.

Goal kicks and throw-ins could potentially be played out against a clock in the near future.

Throw-ins have come under particular scrutiny in England's top flight this season. The importance of this set-piece scenario has swollen over the summer, with clubs increasingly willing to not only hurl the ball directly into the opposition box at any given opportunity, but take a great deal of time preparing for themselves for these setups.

Brentford, the Premier League's chief exponents of the long-throw as Liverpool recently discovered, have spent more than 70 combined minutes preparing for throw-ins across the first nine games of the new season. The Bees represent an extreme, but it takes an average Premier League side more than 17 seconds to prepare for each throw-in. 

The threat of a countdown could lower that ratio, at least in the first week after it has been introduced.

As 2025 has unfolded the line between artificial intelligence and reality has become increasingly blurred. Never has it been so difficult to discern what's real and fake on the internet. 

There has not been a better example of this than earlier this week when an incredible video of the world's first 'skyscraper stadium' in Saudi Arabia went viral on social media, gaining more than 50 million views - and coverage from news outlets across the globe. 

It showed a design of the Gulf state's Neom Sky Stadium, announced last year, which is expected to sit 1,000 feet above ground level, boast a capacity of 46,000 and play host to the 2034 World Cup in the Middle East. The venue is one of 15 set to feature at the tournament - just four of which have already been built. 

The Saudis promised 'one of a kind' stadiums when they were controversially awarded football's most prestigious event back in December. So when fans were offered their first look at the groundbreaking pitch in the clouds, they were fascinated by what they saw.

But the incredible video they were watching was not the elaborate work of Saudi Arabia, or the company funding the stadium, at all. 

No, it was made in just two minutes a couple of weeks earlier by 34-year-old Liam Hawes, from East Sussex, as he settled down for a good night's sleep in bed. 

A design of Saudi Arabia's 'sky stadium' fooled more than 50 million people earlier this week

The video was however not the elaborate work of the Saudis. No, it was created by 34-year-old Liam Hawes in bed

He posted the video on his 'Hypora Ultraworks' Facebook page before it gained a huge amount of traction and went worldwide. 

Since Liam started the account earlier this month - on which he regularly posts conceptual clips of grand designs - it has gained almost 350 million views. Yet despite such levels of popularity, the Seaford resident has not made a penny because he can't monetise content from Facebook. 

He told Daily Mail Sport on Thursday: 'It was crazy. Two weeks ago while I was on my phone before bed I just had the idea pop in my head. I got this concept up and before you know it, it's going all around the world. We had 13,000 people share it to start with and after that there was no containment really.'

Liam did a fantastic job, and fooled media outlets across the globe. 'I saw all sorts of publications and social media accounts spreading that the video was supposedly the official Saudi Arabia skyscraper stadium for the World Cup,' he said. 'I was like, I have no idea what's going on here. I had no idea about the Saudis' project. 

'Before you know it, I've had my friends and even my mum calling saying, "Isn't that video on the news that thing you designed?" It was crazy.' 

Revealing how he made the clip, Liam added: 'I own a small media company and I just figured that I should learn about AI. I just used an image designer. 

'I was in bed before going to sleep, I was playing around with the idea of stadiums on top of skyscrapers because it's something that would be recognised around the world. 

'It took literally a couple of minutes to put together. Probably two or three minutes and suddenly people think it's an official Saudi Arabian concept. The video cost about 35p to make and I did it on my phone.' 

Liam fooled a host of publications from across the globe with the AI hoax





While Liam's concept is a hoax, the Gulf state's plan to erect the world's first skyscraper stadium is anything but. 

The Neom Sky Stadium is part of a project in the country called 'The Line', which is to be a smart city in the north-western region of Neom. The area is expected to be car-free and only as long as the Empire State Building is high. 

According to the company's Facebook page, the ground will boast a capacity of almost 50,000, four training sites and offer north of 2,000 corporate and box seats. 

Concept designs released on the same page back in December show a futuristic, illuminated stadium squeezed into 'The Line'. 

Eight of the 2034 World Cup's other venues will be situated in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. One of those is the 92,760 capacity King Salman International Stadium, also yet to be constructed, where the opening game and final will be played. 

Other venues include the Qiddiya Coast Stadium and the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium, which will be located on a rooftop.

The nation will be the second in the Middle East to host a World Cup in a little over a decade after the tournament went to Qatar three years ago.

That event was the first to ever take place in the winter, a decision made due to the incredibly warm conditions in that part of the world. 

And it was revealed earlier this month that the Saudi World Cup could too be held between the months of November and December, when temperatures are considerably lower than those of the summer months.

Liam has created a host of grand designs using AI on his 'Hypora Ultraworks' Facebook account

Speaking in early October, FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed football fans need to have an 'open mind' about when the sport's most highly anticipated event takes place.

'It's not just about one World Cup, it's a general reflection, even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think,' he said.

'Actually, the best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe.

'Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to have an open mind.

'It is a fact that in the world, if you want to play at the same time everywhere, you can play in March or in October, most likely. Because in December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part of the world.

'We need to consider all these elements when we speak about national team competitions, national team release, about club competitions, and see how we can make it better for the benefit of everyone.'

The international match calendar is currently fixed until 2030, with the next two editions of the men's World Cup taking place in the northern hemisphere summer. 

The United States, Canada and Mexico are hosting next year's event in June and July.

Kick-off times are expected to be 5pm BST, 8pm, 11pm and 2am, mirroring this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

That tournament was beset by heat issues, so the marquee matches at the World Cup are set to be in the later slots to aid player welfare.

Images which emerged last year on Neom's official Facebook page showed a very different design of the sky stadium

Works are expected to begin on the ground in 2027 with a view to completion in 2032

Neom Sky Stadium will boast some 46,000 seats, according to plans

It will also feature more than 2,000 box seats and four 'training sites'

Speaking about what the World Cup could learn from the Club World Cup, FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani admitted it was 'kick-off times'.

Elaborating further, he told the Leaders Conference in Twickenham: 'Kick-off times are always an issue in our region because summers are hot in Canada and US.

'We're having conversations daily with European media and other world media, in terms of what's best and which are the stadiums that you can play at 3pm. That's all in the mix now.

'Once the actual schedule comes out after the draw, we will do our best to ensure it's taken into consideration. Will it be that every game will be absolutely perfect from a kick-off time, from a TV perspective? I don't know.'

Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been confirmed as co-hosts of the 2030 tournament.

Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay will also hold matches to mark the centenary edition of the World Cup, which was won by the latter.

Dallas will get a World Cup warm-up when the Perot Museum of Nature and Science unveils a new exhibit on the science of soccer.

“Soccer: More Than a Game” will let visitors build a team, test their kicks, study strategy and see how innovation is reshaping the sport, said Linda Silver, the Perot's chief executive officer. The exhibit opens next March, a few months before the FIFA World Cup — the biggest tournament in soccer — comes to North Texas.

“Soccer: More Than a Game” will greet visitors to its 10,000-square-foot space with hands-on stations including maker kiosks where users  can build a mini soccer stadium with Lego-like blocks and scan it into a digital model. The exercise pushes designers to consider energy and water efficiency in their stadium builds.

On the health side, visitors can try “virtual surgery” such as repairing an injured knee. Think the game Operation, but scaled up. 

The exhibit, Silver said, “highlights the importance of kinesiology and the medical side of keeping our athletes in the best shape that they can be in and as safe as they can be as they play these games.”

Visitors can also dive into game strategy and the analytics behind player and team performance in the Coaching Lab for Excellence in Athletics, Technology and Science, or CLEATS for short. 

The exhibit first took shape in 2022, when Dallas was named a 2026 FIFA World Cup host city. Since then, the Perot has collaborated with Mexico City's Museo Interactivo de Economía, which is known for its interactive takes on economics, finance and sustainability. A companion exhibit at the Mexico museum will further explore the cultural and economic impact of soccer across North America.

The Perot has done the designs for “Soccer: More Than a Game,” Silver said, and the exhibit is now being built in Salt Lake City. It will be open in Dallas from March 7 to Sept. 7, 2026. Offerings will be in both English and Spanish.

With over a million tickets sold for next summer's World Cup, and millions of tourists expected to pour into North Texas, Silver said the Perot aims to welcome returning and first-time visitors — and maybe convert a few non-soccer fans.

“We think we're going to get a lot of soccer fans who might be coming to Dallas to see the game who will appreciate this,” Silver said. “But we also think we will get some people interested who maybe weren't sports fans before because they will learn all of the work that goes on off the field.”

Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi moved to Inter Miami in 2023 after being linked with a switch to Saudi Arabia. That followed a two-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain, the club he joined in 2021 after ending his long association with Barcelona.

Saudi Arabia declined an offer to sign Lionel Messi for a short-term stint in the Saudi Pro League before next year's World Cup, according to a senior sports official.

"During the last Club World Cup, Messi's team contacted me and offered for him to play in Saudi Arabia because the MLS will stop for nearly four months," Abdullah Hammad, CEO of the Mahd Sports Academy, said during a podcast with Saudi platform Thmanyah.

"The player wanted to remain in shape and prepare himself for the upcoming 2026 World Cup."

"This happened with David Beckham when he was with Los Angeles Galaxy and went to AC Milan (in 2010)," he added.

Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi moved to Inter Miami in 2023 after being linked with a switch to Saudi Arabia. That followed a two-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain, the club he joined in 2021 after ending his long association with Barcelona.

Hammad explained that he relayed the offer to the minister of sports, who rejected it. "The minister made it clear that the Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments," he said.

In response to a question about whether Saudi Arabia had rejected Messi, he replied: "That's true."

Since the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr after the last World Cup, the Saudi league has attracted numerous stars from major European clubs, including Neymar and Karim Benzema, while the kingdom has been awarded the hosting rights for the 2034 World Cup.

International soccer stars won't be the only ones expected to perform at their best next summer.

Atlanta and other 2026 World Cup host cities will have to prove they're worthy of an international stage under the scrutiny of billions of onlookers. It's a spotlight Atlanta hasn't seen since the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games, an event that redefined downtown and the city's global image.

Get unrivaled matchday access

With two matches of a three-match camp in the books, the USWNT now faces New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo. This fall camp came after a long hiatus with a 113-day gap separating the July 2 win vs. Canada from this week's first match against Portugal on Oct. 23. On Oct. 23, the U.S. scored early with a beautiful strike from Rose Lavelle in the first match but couldn't shake all the rust off and ultimately fell 2-1 to the European side. Back to it on Sunday, the USWNT — fielding a young and inexperienced team that averaged 21.7 years old and 19.2 caps per player at the start of the match — marched into East Hartford, Conn. and buried goals early and late to beat Portugal, 3-1. Portugal took just one shot on goal in the second match, and it went into the net. On Oct. 26, Olivia Moultrie struck in the first minute and the 10th, her second, enabling the USA to take the lead after the third Portugal header goal of the two-game series. From then on, the U.S. held the line until the end of the match and, in the 82nd minute, Sam Coffey called game with a sublime finish off a corner from Ally Sentnor.

The USWNT now holds a 9W-3L-0D record on the year and a 11W-1L-1D record against Portugal. The USA will finish the three-game set with a match against New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo., on Wednesday, Oct. 29, in the team's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium (8 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. CT, on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports).

October Matches vs. Portugal & New Zealand

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 3) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4)

DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 3/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 69/1), Eva Gaetino (Paris St-Germain, FRA; 1) Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 8/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 3/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 112/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 40/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 168/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 114/26), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 10/4), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 28/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 10/1)

FORWARDS (6): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 9/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 25/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 14/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 10/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/3)

In the last FIFA window, Emma Hayes gave five players their first caps – goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza. All but Rodriguez and Meza are back on this roster, which features just one first-time call-up in Kennedy Wesley. Rodriguez and Meza, who started on June 29 vs. Ireland, became the 23rd and 24th players to debut under Hayes in her 27 games at the helm, a remarkable ratio for the Olympic champion head coach. Hayes has given 28 total players their first USWNT call-ups, but she also gave a first cap to a player who did not get a first call-up under her, as Lily Yohannes earned her first call-up under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore but did not see action under Kilgore. The 24 players who have earned their first USWNT caps under Emma Hayes are: Sam Staab, Lily Yohannes, Croix Bethune, Yazmeen Ryan, Hal Hershfelt, Emily Sams, Emma Sears, Mandy McGlynn, Alyssa Malonson, Eva Gaetino, Ally Sentnor, Tara McKeown, Michelle Cooper, Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Avery Patterson, Lo'eau LaBonta, Kerry Abello, Claudia Dickey, Lilly Reale, Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza and Izzy Rodriguez.

Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and joined the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window. After Trinity Rodman's withdrawal from the October camp roster due to injury, the USWNT entered camp with 25 players. Confident in her players at both the senior and U-23 rosters, and once again emphasizing the importance of the U-23 program, Hayes looked to the oldest of the USA's Youth National Teams to fill the 26th spot. With the U-23s training at the same facility as the USWNT, a call-up could easily be made. With all this in mind, Hayes attended U-23 trainings to assess the players, and, with all of her U-23 teammates looking on, informed Gaetino after one of those trainings that she would be joining the senior team for the rest of camp. The 22-year-old Michigan native was with the senior team for the 2024 SheBelieves Cup, but did not see action, and then earned her first and only cap in a 90-minute performance against Argentina on Oct. 30, 2024 — helping the U.S. squad to a 3-0 win that night. The 5-foot-11 central defender is in her second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Première Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has compiled a record of 22W-3L-2D through her first 27 matches at the helm of the USWNT and guided the USA to five consecutive shutouts before seeing that streak end against Germany in the group stage of the Olympics. It was the second-longest shutout streak to open the tenure of any full-time USWNT head coach, trailing only the nine consecutive shutouts that opened the Greg Ryan era. Ater the 3-0 opening game win over Zambia at the Olympics, Hayes became the first USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals and joined Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first six matches at a major tournament. Dorrance won all six games with the USWNT at the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Hayes joins three other USWNT head coaches of the last eight in USWNT history who won their first major competition (Anson Dorrance – 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Pia Sundhage – 2008 Olympics, Jill Ellis – 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup). The gold medal victory in Paris came in Hayes' 10th match at the helm of the USWNT, the fewest matches before winning a World Cup or Olympics by any head coach in women's soccer history. Hayes picked up her first world honor as head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team when she won the Ballon d'Or as the 2024 Women's Soccer Coach of the Year. France Football, the top soccer magazine in France and one of the most reputable in Europe, has been awarding the Ballon d'Or to men's players since 1956 and to women's players since 2018, but 2024 was the first year it has given out awards to coaches of men's and women's soccer. Hayes then followed that up by winning The Best FIFA Women's Coach award. Hayes won that award in 2021 and finished second to England head coach Sarina Wiegman in 2023.

Thursday's matchup will be the 22nd meeting all-time between the two teams. The U.S. leads the matchup record 19W-1L-1D and a 75-goal gap between the two teams. The most recent meetings between the teams came in January of 2023 when the USA visited New Zealand before the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The USA won both matches handily, 4-0 in Wellington and 5-0 in Auckland. Of the players who scored those nine goals over those two games, only Rose Lavelle, who scored twice in Auckland (while wearing the captain's armband) is on this roster.

 Before those matches, the USA and New Zealand met most recently about 11 months before on Feb. 20, 2022, on the second matchday of the SheBelieves Cup in Carson, Calif. The USA won 5-0 in a match that featured a highly unusual and painful to watch three own goals from one player – defender Meikayla Moore who currently plays for Calgary Wild FC in Canada – along with scores from Ashley Hatch and Mallory Pugh.

The USA and New Zealand met in four consecutive Olympic Games: 2020, 2016, 2012, and 2008. New Zealand and the USA met in the middle game of group play at the delayed 2020 Olympics with the Americans rolling to a 6-1 victory as Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Christen Press and Alex Morgan scored while the USA forced the Football Ferns into two own goals. The teams also met in the opening game of the group stage match at the 2016 Olympics, the quarterfinal of the 2012 Olympics and in group play at the 2008 Olympics. In Brazil, the USA picked up a 2-0 win behind first-half goals from Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan. In England, the USA won 2-0 on goals from Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. In China, the USA won 4-0 on goals from Heather O'Reilly, Amy Rodriguez, Lindsey Tarpley and Angela Hucles. O'Reilly scored 40 seconds into the match which was the fastest goal in Olympic history until Canada's Janine Beckie scored 20 seconds into the 2016 Olympic match against Australia.

For nearly four decades, the Rolex Paris Masters has been where the season's final sparks fly. A place where champions rise to deliver another dazzling performance, where the crowd's roar bounces off the roof and the lights pulse with every forehand.

Few tournaments blend elegance and energetic chaos quite like Paris. So it feels fitting that, for its 40th edition, the event has moved to La Défense Arena, Europe's largest indoor sports venue and a bold new stage for indoor tennis.

“It's stunning. If you like tennis, this is the place to be right now,” said Felix Auger-Aliassime, the No. 10 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “You can see all the players with so many matches, which is great. Honestly, the attention to detail is second to none. Even the seats for the players, everything is stitched on. It's beautiful.”

The numbers alone tell the story. The 17,500-seat centre court makes it the second-largest year-round tennis court in the world, behind only Arthur Ashe Stadium at the US Open.

Situated in the heart of Paris's business district, the Arena's interior is divided by 9,000 square metres of blackout curtains, creating a sleek amphitheatre feel. Within those walls are three additional match courts, a practice court and a dedicated gym and warm-up zone for players.

“I think it was great timing to move to our new home, to rewrite our story, to reinvent ourselves and get bigger,” said Cedric Pioline, Tournament Director. “We have a new venue with a new setup. The identity of the tournament will be closer to events such as Roland Garros, where there's a lot of noise, a lot of life. This is the direction we are going.”

Watch Cedric Pioline talk through new era at La Défense Arena

There has never been a shortage of atmosphere at France's ATP Masters 1000 event. Last year, Alexander Zverev silenced two home favourites in front of passionate Parisian crowds on his way to the title.

Returning to the French capital this year, the German knew exactly what awaited him — intensity, noise, and emotion, despite the change of venue.

“I just enjoy playing in front of an atmosphere. Whether it's for me — of course it's always nicer when the fans are cheering for you — but I also enjoy it when the fans are cheering against you, because there is still energy there, there is still noise,” Zverev told ATPTour.com. “Whether it's for me or for somebody else, it's always nicer to play in big stadiums than small ones. It's something you always dreamed of as a kid.”

No tournament crowd in the world sounds quite like Paris. Impatient, theatrical, passionate — it's a crowd that lives each point. At La Défense, that heartbeat is multiplied. The expanded stands and the acoustic design turn every ‘Allez' chant into a rolling wave. For players, it's a new kind of electricity.



Still, the move wasn't made lightly. The Accor Arena in Bercy, the event's longtime home, was rich in history: Novak Djokovic's record seven titles, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's 2008 breakthrough, the pounding bass that signalled the start and end of matches.

Bercy gave the Rolex Paris Masters its claustrophobic intensity — the sense that anything could happen when the lights dimmed and the music hit. But if those moments belong to memory, they also make the move feel earned.

The tournament has always been about evolution: From smoky halls to global stage, from wood to carbon, from Bercy's intimacy to La Défense's scale.

“For the first edition at La Défense Arena, the atmosphere is electric and the ‘Tribune Bleu' sets the courts alight,” said Charles Tonnelier, a fan from the 12th arrondissement of Paris. “Life off the courts is also very enjoyable, with well-chosen activities contributing to the overall festive atmosphere.”

The “Tribune Bleu”, a group of die-hard French supporters is a new element of the setup. They flood the stands, lifting home players and energising the crowd with their drums and vuvuzelas. The sound swells, chants echo, and colour fills the stands in ways Bercy's tighter structure never allowed.

As the ATP Tour season reaches its final stretch, that intensity gives French players a crucial boost. Last year, Ugo Humbert drew on the home energy to defeat Carlos Alcaraz en route to his first ATP Masters 1000 final.

“As a tournament organiser, we always want French tennis players to be supported by the crowd because this adds value to the tournament,” Pioline told ATPTour.com. “Everyone wants to play well. French tennis players want to play well. We saw what happened with Humbert. We saw how much the crowd cheered for him. It is always something that is important.”

At La Défense Arena, it's still unmistakably the Rolex Paris Masters. It's still that late-season drama as players chase qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals, still that mix of sweat, glamour and high-stakes tension.

But now, it feels reborn. The arena's glow reflects off the glass skyscrapers outside, the crowd surges as the lights fade to green, and the echoes of Paris's sporting heart fill the air once again.

The stage is larger now. The chaos echoes deeper. The atmosphere, somehow, even more alive.

Aryna Sabalenka: The US Open champ brings momentum and, as world No. 1, seeks to put an exclamation point on a great year. Her tour-leading 57 match wins speaks to her sustained year-long dominance and confidence heading into the final tournament of the season. She arrives to Riyadh fresh and eager to take home a title she's never won.Amanda Anisimova: With her recent victory in Beijing followed by two weeks off this two-time WTA 1000 champ and two-time Slam finalist is rested, match-tough, and keen to make a statement on a medium-fast hard court, one that should fit her first-strike style like a glove.Elena Rybakina: Rybakina kicked into high gear at the last minute to clinch a spot in Riyadh. At the end of a challenging year, she is now serving big and showing the easy power and quiet intensity that make her a potential champion everywhere she goes.Jasmine Paolini: This late bloomer followed up career year in 2025 with more consistency in 2025, proving herself a worthy Top 10 player with big wins in Rome and at the Billie Jean King Cup. Back in Riyadh for a second time, she carries the experience she gained from this event last year, and the Italian is plenty capable of causing a few upsets.

Aryna Sabalenka: She's been one of the most consistent players all season, and will be hungry to go deeper than her 2024 semifinal finish this year. Her aggressive, first-strike game is well suited for Riyadh's indoor conditions.Amanda Anisimova: Since her comeback, Amanda has been extremely impressive and fearless. Her resilience and deep runs at major events this year make her well-suited to handle the pressure of competing in her maiden WTA Finals.Elena Rybakina: When her serve is clicking, she can beat anyone. She was so clutch these past few weeks to secure the eighth spot, the Kazakh is riding a huge wave of confidence right now.Madison Keys: She is capable of taking the racquet out of anyone's hand when she's in a rhythm on the serve and forehand. After nearly a decade since her last WTA Finals, she returns as a Grand Slam champ, competing with renewed purpose.

Aryna Sabalenka has a winning record against everyone in her Group, is the No. 1 player in the world, won the last Major of the year and should be well-rested to check off another box with her first year-end championship.Amanda Anisimova was one of the first women to arrive in Riyadh and has won 12 of her last 13 matches on Tour, including the China Open title in Beijing. She's never played two of the three other women in her group, but got a big win over Iga Swiatek at the US Open. Her pure ball striking should translate well on these courts.Jessica Pegula has a winning record against two of the other three women in her group, including a perfect 5-0 against Jasmine Paolini. She just ended Aryna Sabalenka's 20-match winning streak in Wuhan a few weeks ago. That should give her confidence to make a run at the title.Madison Keys beat two of the three other women in her group on the way to her first Major title at the Australian Open this year. She is a big hitter that can make every match on her terms. Bookending the year with big titles in Melbourne and Riyadh would be the perfect way to script her best season yet.

A season highlighted by a singles title in her native Italy and four doubles titles, including Roland Garros, Jasmine Paolini proved she belongs in elite company. She punched her tickets in both fields at the WTA Finals once again, seeking to advance out of the group stage in Riyadh.

Editor's note: Starting Monday, Oct. 20, we're publishing Road to the WTA Finals, an eight-part snapshot of the qualifiers and the form they bring to Riyadh. Check back all week for new installments.

More from the WTA Finals

After cementing her status as a Top 10 player in 2024, Jasmine Paolini came into 2025 with lofty expectations.

Would she win her first Grand Slam after two near misses in Paris and London last year?

Paolini would end up winning a major -- the French Open doubles title, with Italian countrywoman Sara Errani -- but couldn't replicate her singles success, never advancing past the fourth round at a Slam.

The World No. 8 did, however, deliver another consistent campaign worthy of a Top 10 player, reaching the semifinals in Miami, the final in Cincinnati and, most recently, the semis in Wuhan.

Her season highlight came in Rome, where she defeated Coco Gauff in the final to win her second career WTA 1000 title and become the first Italian woman to win the country's premier tournament in 40 years.

The 29-year-old won more matches this year than she did last year, and posted a higher winning percentage -- all while grinding through another grueling doubles schedule, one that yielded four more titles and propelled her to No. 3 in the world.

Speaking of doubles, Paolini is also in the WTA Finals doubles field (alongside Errani), punching her tickets in both fields for the second straight year.

We'll be seeing plenty of Paolini in Riyadh, which is always a good thing. 

2025 Record: 43-18 (32-10 in doubles)

2025 Titles: Rome (1000), Doha (1000, in doubles), Rome (1000, in doubles), French Open (Grand Slam, in doubles), Beijing (1000, in doubles)

Previous WTA Finals Appearances: 2024 (lost in group stage in singles and doubles)

Best WTA Finals Result: Paolini couldn't get out of the group stage in either singles or doubles last year, winning just two of her six matches. Her lone singles victory -- a 7-6 (5), 6-4 win over Elena Rybakina -- was sandwiched between straight-set losses to Zheng Qinwen and Aryna Sabalenka.

Defining Moment of 2025: The win in Rome was an especially memorable one, both for Paolini and for a tennis-loving nation that hadn't seen a female champion at this tournament in four decades. Paolini dropped just one set all tournament and, in front of Italian president Sergio Mattarella, handled Gauff with relative ease in just 89 minutes. Though she'd won a WTA 1000 title once before, in Dubai, this must be the biggest of her career to date.

Notable Stat: In addition to becoming the first Italian singles champion in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, Paolini became the first player to win both the singles and doubles titles at this tournament since Monica Seles in 1990.

Defining Quote of 2025: “It doesn't seem real to me. I came here as a kid to see this tournament but winning it and holding up this trophy wasn't even in my dreams.” -- Paolini after winning the Internazionali BNL d'Italia

Brad Kallet: Paolini is one of the most likable players on tour. Always smiling. Always laughing. Always seeming to enjoy the moment. But make no mistake about it: She's ferocious and, when locked in, can dominate anyone. We saw that most recently in Wuhan, in her quarterfinal match against Iga Swiatek. Coming into the match 0-6 against the six-time Grand Slam champion, Paolini looked unstoppable, dropping just three games in 65 minutes. She can play big and win big ... and she'll need to rise to that level again in Riyadh.

Greg Garber: Great point, Brad. Paolini proved against Swiatek that even at this relatively late stage in her career, she's developing a big-game presence. Look how far she's come in the past month in China. On the WTA Finals bubble, she reached the quarterfinals in Beijing and the semifinals in Wuhan and Ningbo. By winning eight of 11 matches, she's going back to Riyadh. A year ago, as the No. 4 seed, Paolini lost round-robin matches to Zheng and Sabalenka. She'll be keen to take the next step.

A season highlighted by a singles title in her native Italy and four doubles titles, including Roland Garros, Jasmine Paolini proved she belongs in elite company. She punched her tickets in both fields at the WTA Finals once again, seeking to advance out of the group stage in Riyadh.

Calm, determined, and quietly ambitious, 19-year-old Kaitlin Quevedo entered the Hamburg Ladies & Gents Cup as the tournament's top seed—and lived up to expectations with an impressive run to the final, finishing as the runner-up after a strong week of tennis.Born in Naples, Florida, Quevedo's international background has shaped both her tennis and her perspective. Her mother is US-American, her father hails from Gran Canaria, and two years ago she made the decision to represent Spain—a move that marked a turning point in her young career.Read More: Justin Engel: German teenager hopes home Hamburg triumph leads to bigger and better things“Since I was born, I have double nationality," says Quevedo. "Two years ago, I moved to Spain and started to train at TEC Carles Ferrer Salat Academy in Barcelona. When I went there, I got the opportunity by the Federation, and I changed my nationality. At this moment, I was looking for change, and it was great timing.”

Now ranked World No. 156—with a career high of No. 152 earlier this month—Quevedo has already captured nine ITF World Tennis Tour titles, including her biggest triumph at the ITF W100 DISA Gran Canaria-Maspalomas in August.“It was incredible,” she recalled. “I never felt such emotions when I won the final. I had confidence when I arrived at the tournament and I really wanted to win it. I went match by match, as you never know what happened. Every day I had a lot of support. My family was there. I really felt like being at home. It was such a good environment, just insane.”Read More: ATP Challenger Tour prize money set to rise to record-high $32.4 million in 2026Returning to Hamburg this week brings back good memories for Quevedo. “I played here last year,” she said with a smile. “I like the club, the courts, the tournament and the organization. It fits my game style well. We knew how everything was and I am excited to be back.”Her game style—a combination of power, control, and relentless intensity—has become her trademark. “Definitely physical,” she explained. “I am starting to become more aggressive as well. I like to build the point, to play heavy, open the court and to step in. I am working on going more to the net. I feel like I have all the shots and slowly becoming more aggressive as well.”

“With every match I learn something, evolve and keep improving. The good thing is, I keep… playing bigger tournaments against even better players. They push you more. They show you what you really have to work on.”© 2025 Ion Alcoba Beitia

Transitioning from juniors, where she was once world No. 5, to the professional level has not been without its challenges.“For sure, just getting more experience and playing as many tournaments and matches as possible against the best players,” she said. “With every match I learn something, evolve and keep improving. The good thing is, I keep going up and play bigger tournaments against even better players. They push you more. They show you what you really have to work on.”The shift from junior to the Pro Circuit came with a steep learning curve. “Everyone wants to win. You don't play against girls anymore; you start playing against women and tennis is their job. They fight until the very last point. It feels more challenging, as they have more hunger and have more experience. And you are just coming on, they don't know you. Sometimes I felt uncomfortable at tournaments and settings where I didn't feel like I belonged. But it slowly became better.”Despite the pressures of her early success, Quevedo keeps a clear mind and a humble attitude. “When I played Juniors, I still played for the US. Getting into the Top 5 was incredible. I had to fight a lot but slowly you consolidate yourself. For me it was important to get into the Top 5. It opens you to many opportunities.”

Now based in Barcelona, Quevedo trains full time in Spain but still holds a deep connection to her roots in the Canary Islands. “I am not that often in Gran Canaria, as it is a three-hour flight and it's not that you go there just over the weekend. I go a few times a year. For sure, for Christmas. When I have time, I really love to go there and spend time with my family and enjoy the food.”Off the court, she admits that tennis still dominates her life. “To be honest, I just really like tennis,” she laughed. “But I am studying right now about nutrition. Of course, I also like to spend time with my friends and family.”Role models and the ‘Rafa Moment'Her inspirations are as diverse as her background. “There is a combination of players I really like. I like the mentality of Rafa Nadal. We watched him a lot and it's insane to see how he fought for every point. On the girls' side, I like Iga Swiatek. Some of the younger players like (Mirra) Andreeva and (Joao) Fonseca are also inspiring because I was with them in Juniors and it's nice to see when they are doing so well. It's also motivation to do it the same way.”And yes—she's already had her Rafa moment. “I took a picture with Rafa, but I didn't speak to him. I hope to do so one day.”As for her goals, Quevedo is focused yet idealistic. “I want to finish inside the Top 150 this season. I am almost there. Next year, I will have the chance to play all the Grand Slams, and my dream is to play against the best players and become No. 1."But I want to improve every day not only as a tennis player, but also as a person. I would like to raise my voice when I am professional and at the top for things going on around the world. What I find very important is social equality. To deal with poverty and people who are in hunger, especially kids. I think it is important to raise awareness about it. That's another motivation for me.”

Seventeen-year-olds Lilli Tagger and Mia Pohankova are moving in lockstep early in their professional careers.

Pohankova claimed her first ITF title last October in her native Slovakia. Austria's Tagger followed suit shortly after, winning her first pro title in Spain this April. In the final, she defeated soon-to-be breakout star Lois Boisson.

Tagger continued her clay-court dominance by capturing the 2025 French Open girls' singles title, going from unseeded to champion without dropping a set. One month later, Pohankova matched the feat at Wimbledon, also winning the girls' singles crown despite entering unseeded.

So, it's little surprise that with both making their first WTA main-draw appearances this week via wild card -- Tagger in Jiujiang and Pohankova in Chennai -- they each earned first-round victories in their WTA debuts.

Tagger defeated China's Zhu Chenting on Tuesday, while Pohankova ousted former Top 100 player Nao Hibino to reach the second round in Chennai. They join this year's Australian Open girls' singles champion Wakana Sonobe in accomplishing the feat, after Sonobe won in her debut earlier this year in Abu Dhabi.

Tagger went one better Wednesday, upsetting world No. 89 Elisabetta Cocciaretto in straight sets for her first Top 100 win.

“It was an amazing match,” Tagger said afterwards. “I had a lot of fun out there. I still can't believe I won in the end, but I'm super happy with my performance and I can't wait for the next match. It was my first win against a top 100 player, which feels amazing. It was a lot of fun to play against her.”

The victory adds to a growing list of achievements for the young Austrian, who has also gained notoriety in tennis circles for her one-handed backhand, which has drawn comparisons to the one displayed by her coach, 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone, in her own playing days.

Tagger is one of just eight women ranked inside the top 300 of the PIF WTA Rankings to feature a one-handed backhand.

She is 32-8 across all levels this season, with three ITF titles -- two at the W75 level -- in addition to her junior Grand Slam. Her two wins in Jiujiang have pushed her inside the top 200 of the live rankings for the first time.

Pohankova, meanwhile, has made the most of a smaller sample size on the pro circuit this season. In addition to her Wimbledon junior title, she reached the girls' doubles semifinals at the French Open, partnering with none other than Tagger herself.

The pair fell in two tightly contested sets to eventual champions Eva Bennemann and Sonja Zhenikhova.

Overall, Pohankova is 8-4 across all levels in 2025, with two ITF quarterfinals and two wins over top 200 opponents as she aims to return to, and then surpass, her career-best ranking of No. 394.

Rankings aside, both players are looking to build on their WTA win totals in the coming days. For now, they'll settle for soaking in the WTA Tour experience.

“The tournament is amazing,” Tagger said. “I'm really, really happy I get the chance to play the main draw here. I haven't seen much of the city yet, but maybe in the next few days, when I have time, I'll go visit it a little bit.”

And who knows, perhaps a maiden WTA title is on the horizon for one, or both.

Alexander Bublik is one of the game's most creative shotmakers, always finding new ways to entertain fans with his impressive racquet skills. But how will he handle “an impossibly small racquet” in the latest Lexus ATP Head2Head Challenge?



Bublik faces series host Natalie Pike in three lighthearted and entertaining battles while at the Rolex Paris Masters. One round even forces Bublik to hold the mini racquet with his non-dominant hand. Can his touch and timing still hold up?



Just when it seems the tasks cannot get any tougher, the final round takes it to a whole new level with what might be the tiniest racquet you will ever see. Watch the video below to find out who wins!

She also announced an $11.5 million donation to the fight world hunger and climate change.

	Hannah Dailey



Billie Eilish has never been shy about speaking her mind, but at WSJ Magazine‘s 2025 Innovator Awards, she put her money where her mouth is while calling out the world's billionaires — some of whom were in the room.


	At the event in New York City on Wednesday (Oct. 29), Stephen Colbert presented the pop star with the publication's music innovator award. Before Eilish took the stage, the late-night host also announced that the guest of honor had raised a whopping $11.5 million for organizations addressing food insecurity and climate change through her ongoing Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour.

	











	Eilish then took the podium to accept the honor, looking out at a room of supremely wealthy and powerful guests — including Mark Zuckerberg, whose Forbes-estimated net worth of $228 billion makes him the fifth richest man on the planet. The Meta owner was in attendance to support his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, who was honored Wednesday night for her philanthropy work as head of CZI.


	“People need empathy and help in our country,” the nine-time Grammy winner said in her remarks.


	She proceeded to deliver a blunt call to action directly to the heavy hitters in the room. “I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things and give it to some people that need it,” Eilish told the crowd. “Love you all, but there's a few people in here that have a lot more money than me. If you are a billionaire, why are you a billionaire?”

	











	“No hate, but give your money away, shorties,” she added.


Billboard has reached out to Meta for comment.


	The event took place on the same day Eilish's interview with WSJ Magazine went live online. In addition to opening up about touring life and revealing that she almost scrapped one of her biggest hits to date from album Hit Me Hard and Soft, the two-time Oscar winner told the publication about her passion for the environment.


	“You can literally make all the same s–t with sustainable materials, and people just aren't doing it,” she said of the fashion industry in particular. “The main thing that I've learned in working with so many companies and making my own merch and my perfume is that everyone can actually do it. It's just that mostly they don't.”


	Eilish's $11.5 million donation will be funneled into her Changemaker Program, which benefits organizations working to address world hunger and environmental issues. Beyond raising money through her tour, the singer also provides plant-based food options at her shows, uses biodegradable confetti during her set, sells merch made out of recycled cotton and encourages fans to bring reusable water bottles and take public transport to the venues at which she plays.


	She's also previously called out wastefulness in the music industry specifically. “I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable,” Eilish told Billboard in 2024. “And then it's some of the biggest artists in the world making f–king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more.”

Looks like Taylor Sheridan isn't done with Paramount just yet. Despite news breaking over the weekend that Sheridan would soon be moving on and relocating his TV and Film deal to NBCUniversal, he's first going to tackle what is meant to be a major tentpole blockbuster for the studio.

Sheridan will write the adaptation of the live-action feature film based on the “Call of Duty” war video game franchise, Paramount announced Thursday. Peter Berg, the director of films like “Lone Survivor,” “Patriot's Day,” and “Deepwater Horizon” and the creator of “Friday Night Lights,” will direct the film and co-write the script with Sheridan. Berg also produced both of Sheridan's “Hell or High Water,” which Sheridan wrote, and “Wind River,” which Sheridan both wrote and directed.

Sheridan, Berg, and Sheridan's frequent collaborator David Glasser will all produce the film. Paramount announced the “Call of Duty” movie would be in the works early last month and is developing it with game maker Activision. 

 










“Call of Duty” is one of the most successful video game franchises of all-time, being the best selling game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years and selling over 500 million copies globally across its many iterations.

For as prolific as Sheridan has been on the TV front, his movie output has been slow in comparison. His last feature was the 2021 forest fire drama starring Angelina Jolie “Those Who Wish Me Dead,” which fizzled at the box office. He was also credited on the Tom Clancy adaptation “Without Remorse” also from 2021. Stefano Sollima, who also directed the sequel to Sheridan's other script “Sicario” as well as “Without Remorse,” was at one point attached to direct a “Call of Duty” movie, but it never materialized. 

Sheridan, Berg, and company aren't the only fans of the franchise. When the “Call of Duty” movie was announced at Paramount, Puck reported that Activision before selling the rights to Paramount had rejected a pitch from Steven Spielberg to adapt it. The look of the “Call of Duty” games have probably already borrowed enough from Spielberg's oeuvre to justify him also directing an adaptation. 

Sheridan has one other feature script in the works, “F.A.S.T.,” which is set at Warner Bros. and is being directed by Ben Richardson. As was reported over the weekend, Sheridan will strike a new deal for film with NBCUniversal once his film deal is meant to expire with Paramount early next year, but he's locked up for TV until 2028.

EXCLUSIVE: After landing the rights to turn one of the world's biggest video games into an epic movie, Paramount has now landed two A-list filmmakers to develop it. Sources tell Deadline that Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and Peter Berg have joined Paramount and Activision to develop and produce a Call of Duty movie, with Paramount distributing a live-action feature film.


	The pic will be designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what players love about the games, a series of first-person shooters centered on military campaigns, while expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences. Berg and Sheridan will co-write, with Berg on board to direct. Berg will produce with his team, and Sheridan is also producing alongside David Glasser.

	











	Sheridan and Berg are lifelong friends and previously worked together on projects including Hell or High Water, which received four Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Sheridan. They also partnered on Wind River.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline has been hearing since the summer that Paramount was eyeing these two as collaborators but Sheridan was still deciding whether he would write the script or just produce. In recent weeks he felt the need to do both and will now team with Berg.


	Berg and Sheridan seem to be perfect fits to bring the project to life given their previous works, specifically when it comes to the military. Whether it's Berg's acclaimed Lone Survivor or Sheridan's hit Paramount+ series Lioness, both filmmakers have shown how to deliver the goods in the genre.

	











Call of Duty, one of the most successful video game franchises of all-time, has been the No. 1 bestselling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years with more 500 million copies sold globally. It reaches hundreds of millions of players worldwide.


	Berg series credits include Painkiller and American Primeval. He wrote, directed and produced The Mosquito Bowl, an epic World War II drama for Netflix based on Buzz Bissinger's bestselling book, which recently wrapped production. He is also executive producing a Friday Night Lights reboot. Through Film 47, Berg continues to helm major commercial campaigns. He is represented by WME and David Matlof.


	Sheridan, who made news this past week when he signed a massive five-year deal with NBCUniversal that will see him exit Paramount in 2019, has long list of Paramount-based TV credits including creating the hit series Yellowstone as well as Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, 1883, 1923, Lioness and Landman; the second season of Landman premieres next month.


	He currently has numerous projects in various stages of development and production including F.A.S.T., an original thriller starring Brandon Sklenar and directed by Ben Richardson, set for release with Warner Bros in April 2027.


	He is repped by CAA and LBI Entertainment.

Park Chan-wook‘s unemployment revenge satire “No Other Choice” left the Venice Film Festival awards, to the chagrin of many, empty-handed. But the Neon release, and the company's second partnership with the Korean director since the 2023 re-release of “Oldboy,” has been picking up steam at subsequent festivals. Starring Lee Byung-hun as a paper-processing expert who hatches a dark scheme to become the only standing specialist in his field, “No Other Choice” won the International Audience Award at Toronto. 

As of earlier this week, the film is also up for three Gotham Awards: Best International Feature, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Outstanding Lead Performance for Lee. But as announced on Thursday, October 30, Park Chan-wook will next receive an SFFILM tribute in San Francisco, at SFMOMA, on November 20 with an in-person conversation and screening of “No Other Choice.” The event will take place at the Phyllis Wattis Theater.

“With ‘No Other Choice,' Director Park returns to the satirical tone seen in ‘Sympathy for Lady Vengeance' and ‘Stoker.' He spent 20 years making this film, a dark comedy about a man desperate to rejoin the workforce at any cost,” said Jessie Fairbanks, SFFILM's director of programming. “I am thrilled to celebrate Director Park with this 2025 SFFILM Presents Tribute for both his body of work and this new entry. ‘No Other Choice' is another shining example of Park's visual elegance and his idiosyncratic reflections on capitalism, modern masculinity, and technological advances.”

 










Executive director Anne Lai added, “With the roots of our organization firmly planted in bringing international films to audiences here in the Bay, it is a deep honor to welcome and celebrate Park Chan-wook. The experience of being in a theater to not only hear from a cinematic master, but to see his latest film, will surely be a special one for audiences new to and familiar with his great work.”

The tribute is part of the SFFILM arts organization's annual screening series, SFFILM Presents, which gives early, exclusive access to first-run films to Bay Area audiences. The SFFILM Presents series also features award and tribute programs, including SF Honors and the Sloan Science in Cinema Prize, which this year will go to Guillermo del Toro for “Frankenstein” on Wednesday, November 12.

“No Other Choice” opens in theaters from Neon on December 25.

Lottie Moss flaunted her lower back “tramp stamp” tattoo in a daring backless look during a recent Greek getaway, posting a series of throwbacks to the September trip on Instagram Wednesday.

“I miss the sun:( ☀️,” the model, 27, captioned a Story showing off the look from behind, her long blond hair falling below her waist.

In a second shot, her skirt is tugged lower to reveal the ink at her tailbone.

Posing at the Amirandes Grecotel in Crete, Moss wore the Outcast Camillo top ($67) and matching maxi skirt ($73) in cream, both pieces featuring metal hardware and semicircle cut-outs at the front. 

Moss debuted the tattoo — a winged heart design with a dainty bow at the center — in September 2022, posting a photo of herself in a thong with the caption, “I got the cutest tramp stamp ever.”

Kate Moss' younger half-sister has never been shy about her body art, though she's had a complicated relationship with tattoos in recent years.

In December 2022, Moss debuted a face tattoo — the word “Lover” under her left eye — which she later removed.

“Since rehab, I've been on a journey of self-discovery. I've spent a lot of time in Bali, surrounded by nature, reading alone or spending time with like-minded people — and learning to love myself again while finally being free from my former life,” she told Glamour UK shortly after getting the facial ink.

“That's why I decided to get my face tattoo; the word ‘lover' under my eye,” she continued. “Yes, it was impulsive, but after years of being so controlled, it was my way of expressing that I am free. I'm no longer controlled.”

She later revealed in a TikTok video that she got the face tattoo to “rebel so hard away from an industry that made her sad all the time.”

Moss has been open about her struggles with addiction and mental health. In January 2024, she posted an emotional video on TikTok revealing her battle with substance abuse, telling followers she was “crying while being vulnerable.”

“Before, when I was going through a lot of stuff, I just felt stuck, like I wasn't growing,” she told The Mirror earlier this year. “It's like I've suddenly taken on board all my life lessons. I understand why I am where I am.”

The model also announced she was quitting OnlyFans, though she reported making £30,000 ($39,500) per month on the adult content platform she joined in 2021.

The protagonist of “Train Dreams,” Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton), is a quiet man, but arguably one of the most important supporting characters in the latest movie by director Clint Bentley doesn't have a single line of dialogue. Visions of the Western United States —its woods and landscapes— both entice and haunt Grainier throughout his life, evoking unanswerable beauty and heartbreak that circle around and around the logger and railroad worker, nonlinearly over the course of the film. (Listen to an exclusive track from the score below.)

 










Creating an emotional throughline for a film that embraces the lyrical, dreamlike quality of its title gave composer Bryce Dessner enough of a challenge to disrupt how composers usually create a movie score.

“A lot of times [composing] is kind of wedging into a corner of ‘you've got 40 seconds to say something' or whatever. But I felt like the music in this needed more development. It needed to simmer in its own juices a bit more and be more like a composition. So half of the score I did where I had some images — I had still photography from the set and a couple of sequences I was watching — but I was pretty much writing and then recording off picture,” Dessner told IndieWire. 

 










Dessner also deliberately went off-piste when choosing how to record the “Train Dreams” score to evoke the slower, older sense of connection to the world that the film explores. “[As part of] trying to access this older way of working, I was working in recording studios that were not set up for film. It was pretty funny. Getting a monitor into the live room was kind of a challenge, where normally that's the first thing there,” Dessner said. “These older studios have this gear from the ‘30s and ‘40s, and the old analog boards and microphones, so you can kind of hear it on the score, a little bit of a crackle in the sound.” 

Much like the film's protagonist, there is not a lot that would be outwardly pushy or loudly experimental about Dessner's music on “Train Dreams.” A lot of it is simple, disciplined, ruminating in a way that won't surprise anyone aware of his work with The National. But having the freedom to let the music breathe and develop allows the score to feel emotionally expressive, and never didactic. 

“A lot of times, composers and editors end up being problem solvers to put out a fire or bridge something; the first act's good, but there's a tricky section in the middle, things like that. That's not really the case with Clint and Greg. They're really fine filmmakers. They're really bold filmmakers. Their scripts are kind of airtight,” Dessner said. “Music can do the thing that words struggle to do, and the film itself is also really emotional, but it's not hitting it over the head with it, you know?” 

 










Which is not to say that Dessner didn't get to play around and push the music of “Train Dreams” any. “I did try some things I haven't done in film scores before — some of the more outlying, stranger harmonic ideas are pushing it, I would say, pretty far. Then, in a similar way, there's really simple music in there. Really kind of like folk songs,” Dessner said. 

Honing in on American folk music of the early 20th Century wasn't just logical given the period in which “Train Dreams” is set. The score's spirit — the African American musical tradition coming out of slavery and the Civil War, merging with other immigrant cultures of Ireland, Scotland, and other places —  aligns with the spirit of the film, too, so much wrapped up in how Grainier affects and is affected by the changing American landscape. 

“You know, people say America is a melting pot, and if you talk about the music, it's really true,” Dessner said. “It's almost impossible to distinguish where all of this comes from when it gets all mixed up. And in terms of American identity, it's fundamental. The way that the music and the landscape of America — you know, if I had to say the two unique things about the American experience, it would be those two things,” Dessner said.

 










Listen to an exclusive track from the score below.

“Train Dreams” opens in select theaters on November 7 before streaming on Netflix November 21.

Ella Emhoff stunned in a totally sheer dress on Wednesday night.

In a total departure from her go-to menswear vibe, the former first daughter attended the WSJ Innovator Awards in New York City wearing a black lace gown from Helsa with nothing underneath but a visible black thong.

Slung over her shoulder was the GG Emblem shoulder bag from Gucci with black leather Jimmy Choo Staz Pumps to match.

During her time in the public eye, Emhoff has made her mark with a personal style that sticks strongly in the borrowed-from-the-boys camp.

A lover of designers like Thom Browne and Proenza Schouler, the 26-year-old often reaches for tailored separates, menswear styles, and a jeans and blazer combination that would make Diane Keaton proud.

As such, her choice of a feminine, lace, see-through dress that leaves little to the imagination was a head-turner.

Emhoff has been out and about quite a bit this month, most recently in attendance at the WWD Honors the night before.

For that event, she chose a plaid double-breasted blazer and a contrasting check midi skirt.

Earlier in the day, she also hit the carpet at the Town & Country Philanthropy Summit, dressed down with a pair of straight-leg jeans and another checked blazer.

While Emhoff did enter sheer outfit territory during the 2021 Met Gala, it was with strategically placed crystal embellishments and a pair of oversized paper bag waist pants.

Could this lace look be a shift in Emhoff's signature style? Or simply a night off? 

Only time will tell …

	It's fair to say that Billie Eilish does well for herself. The 23-year-old musician is currently in the final three-week stretch of the Hit Me Hard and Soft tour, an extensive international run with 106 sold-out shows. Her third studio album has received a two-times platinum certification from RIAA with 2 million copies sold. She will also be donating $11.5 million from the tour to various organizations and charities.


	Stephen Colbert revealed the news while presenting Eilish with the Wall Street Journal Magazine's Music Innovator of the Year award in New York on Wednesday, Oct. 29. The proceeds will benefit organizations and projects that support food equity, climate justice, reducing carbon pollution, and conducting crucial environmental work in combating the climate crisis.


	While accepting the award in a room of affluent figures — including Mark Zuckerberg, who has a net worth of more than $225 billion — Eilish wondered aloud about why people who have the resources to help others often fail to do so.

	“We're in a time right now when the world is really, really bad and really dark,” Eilish said. “People need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country. I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things and maybe give it to some people that need it.”


	After a light round of applause from the audience that also hosted creative figures like Spike Lee and Questlove, Eilish continued: “Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me. If you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away.”

	Last year, Eilish spoke with Rolling Stone about her stance on responsibility and advocacy in her career. “I have never had an interest in being a role model, ever,” she said. “If you're going to think I'm a role model, think I'm a role model in terms of trying to save the environment, and being more conscious of the way that you live, and your carbon footprint, and your contribution to animal agriculture.”


	In 2022, Eilish signed an open letter from Global Citizen urging the most powerful governments, private sector leaders, and billionaires to commit to breaking systemic barriers that keep people in poverty and take climate action.

The 'Yellowstone' signed a film deal with NBCU that will kick in next year, with a series deal expected to follow in 2029.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Let's get this out of the way first: NBCUniversal and the prolific Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan have a deal that will see the multi-hyphenate leave Paramount for NBCU. There's a film deal, which will kick in next year, and a series deal, expected to begin once Sheridan's Paramount obligations are over after 2028.


	That being said, neither NBCUniversal, Paramount, or Sheridan have officially confirmed his looming departure, or that the new deal actually exists.




	That isn't stopping Comcast's co-CEO Mike Cavanagh from citing Sheridan as proof that the company is able to cut deals with the biggest names in entertainment, when grilled by a Wall Street analyst Thursday about the company's “competitive position” in the marketplace.

	“You've seen lots of news lately about us attracting the NBA, Taylor, Sheridan and the like over the long term,” Cavanagh said, acknowledging both the ample news coverage of Sheridan and the unusually long timeframe in which the deals span (the NBA deal, likewise, runs into 2036). Sports, movies and original shows will be a key driver for the company moving forward, he added.


	“Just look at the partners we've attracted on the talent side, from again, Taylor Sheridan and [Blumhouse founder] Jason Blum and [Illumination founder] Chris Meledandri and Steven Spielberg and Jordan Peele  and Christopher Nolan coming up,” he added later. “So obviously, pay one movies and originals are a piece of the pie of driving scale in Peacock and likewise, sports has been very successful for us. It's live as a lot of the coverage is had, and it's hard to build the kind of portfolio that we have.”

	











	Cavanagh's comments are the first time anyone on any side of the deal has acknowledged Sheridan's looming move, though as The Hollywood Reporter noted in a behind the scenes story about the negotiations, NBCUniversal content chief Donna Langley had been pursuing a deal with Sheridan for months.


	Langley “had multiple meetings with the hitmaker over the summer and who gradually became the Sheridan Whisperer. Initially, Langley approached Sheridan about a film deal, but the conversation expanded to include television and streaming in August when it became clear he was having serious doubts about reupping his TV deal with the new Paramount.”


	At some point, NBCUniversal and Sheridan will make that film (and eventually series) deal official, but for now, Wall Street can rest easy knowing that it isn't fake news. After all, the co-CEO said so.

EXCLUSIVE: The revived Paramount Television Studios is taking shape. Matt Thunell, President of the streaming-focused production unit of the post-merger Paramount Skydance, has assembled his senior executive team. It draws largely from the rosters of Skydance Television and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, the two main entities that were combined into the new studio, along with Nickelodeon live-action and Awesomeness. He unveiled the structure in a company memo, a copy of which was obtained by Deadline.


	“As we move forward in this new incarnation of Paramount Television Studios, we must make changes to position our business for growth and success,” Thunell said in the email, which you can read in full below. “To do that, we're evolving our organization to better serve creators, audiences, and partners around the world through a new, streamlined structure. ” 

	











	That structure includes department heads in areas such as Creative, Production, Business Affairs & Legal, Finance & BA, with some functions, including Talent & Casting and Corporate, handled though Paramount Pictures under whose umbrella PTVS sits. Since there were senior executives in those fields on both the Skydance and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios side, combining the teams has resulted in departures, along with an arrival of a Netflix VP. The exiting executives were part of the 1,000 layoffs across Paramount on Wednesday.




			Watch on Deadline		







	One area where the top executives from both sides are staying on is Creative. Skydance Television's EVP, Head of Development Shelley Zimmerman  and EVP, Head of Current Carolyn Harris will assume the same roles at Paramount TV Studios. 

	











	Meanwhile, Keith Cox, President of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, will continue to oversee the series under his purview, including the slate of Taylor Sheridan, and Emily In Paris. Years ago, when he was at Paramount Network, Cox bought Yellowstone in the room and has remained a main liaison for the prolific creator who will be based at PTVS until his overall deal comes to an end in December 2028 and Sheridan moves to NBCUniversal. Zimmerman, Harris and Cox will all report to Thunell.


	The new Paramount Television Studios, launched following the completion of Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global in August, is overseen by Dana Goldberg, Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Chair of Paramount Television. Both Goldberg and Thunell come from Skydance — where she was CCO and he was President of Television — with several executives on Thunell's team there transitioning to PTVS.


	In addition to Zimmerman and Harris, that includes Drew Brown, EVP, Physical Production for Skydance TV, who has been named Head of Production for PTVS, reporting to Thunell. 


Keri Flint, EVP and Head of Global Production for Showtime/MTVE, is departing after for more than two decades with the company.


	Executives from Paramount Global will lead PTVS' Legal and Business Affairs operations. The roles will be split. Virginia Lazalde-McPherson, who a couple of months ago was promoted to Chief Acquisitions Officer for Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, will serve as Head of BA. She has held Head of BA positions at Showtime and YouTube Originals. 


Lance McPherson, EVP, Deputy General Counsel and Head of Business & Legal Affairs for Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, will become EVP, Legal Affairs for PTVS.


	Stepping down is Jeff Hegedus EVP, TV Business & Legal Affairs for Skydance, whom Thunell called “a selfless mentor and a steadfast colleague.”


	Thunell went outside of Paramount in search of Head of Finance, bringing in Mel Rauch, with whom he had worked closely at  Netflix where she served as VP of EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) Content Finance & Strategy. 


Arturo Reyes, EVP and Global Head of Production Finance at Skydance, will become Head of Production Finance for PTVS, reporting to Rauch.  


	Leaving is Candice Brancazio, CFO, Paramount Media Networks, Showtime/MTVE Studios. Matt Hengemuhle also is departing his role as SVP, Financial Planning & Analysis but will remain at Paramount, transitioning to the Direct to Consumer business. PTVS will appoint a FP&A lead soon.


	Also stepping down is Shauna Phelan, EVP, Head of Live-Action Series, Films & Talent, Nickelodeon and Awesomeness TV, who has held leadership positions across the two divisions for seven years. She is in talks to become a producer on some of the high-profile projects she has developed. 


	It is unclear whether a dedicated PTVS executive will succeed her in overseeing the slate, which includes the newly ordered by Netflix Victorious spinoff Hollywood Arts, or will that be a group effort.


	“Going forward, we remain committed to creating high-quality content for kids, teens and families — building on our incredible IP, championing new ideas, and operating as one unified team,” Thunell said.


Tricia Wood, EVP Casting for Paramount Pictures, will expand her role to also oversee casting for PTVS. 


	“We believe this structure will encourage on-screen talent to work more seamlessly across our Features and Television Series,” Thunell said. 

	











	As a result, Trevor Rose, EVP, Head of Global Talent and Content Development for Showtime/MTVE, will be leaving the studio but staying at Paramount in the TV Media group that includes CBS, CBS Studios and the cable entertainment networks. 


	Other Paramount Pictures executives who will expand their purviews to include PTVS oversight include COO Courtney Armstrong, CFO Mark Badagliacca, EVP Human Resources Talia Robinson, and EVP Global Communications & Media Relations Brooke Robertson.   


	Skydance's SVP Marketing and publicity Dawn Lach will transition to PTVS as SVP, Global Communications & Publicity, reporting to Robertson.


	“I know these are a lot of changes, but I am confident this new structure will strengthen collaboration, streamline decision-making, and super-charge our growth,” Thunell said about the new structure while also thanking the departing executives. 


	Paramount TV Studios' blended slate includes such series as Landman, Tulsa King, Lioness and Mayor of Kingstown — all from Sheridan; The Agency, MobLand, and School Spirits for Paramount+; Dexter: Resurrection for Showtime; Reacher, Cross, and The Runarounds for Prime Video; Foundation for Apple TV+; Emily in Paris and XO, Kitty for Netflix; and The Road for CBS.


	Upcoming series include spinoffs Hollywood Arts, Yellowstone offshoots Y: Marshals, The Dutton Ranch, The Madison, and Reacher spinoff Neagley, as well as Ride or Die for Prime Video and Neuromancer, 12 12 12, and Brothers for Apple TV.


	Since the new Paramount TV Studios incarnation's launch, it has landed its first series greenlights, from Paramount+ for the limited series 9/12 starring Jeremy Strong, which originated at Skydance, and from Netflix for Hollywood Arts. It also got a Season 2 renewal for Dexter: Resurrection. 


	Additionally, the studio signed its first talent deal, a first-look pact with Jessica Biel's Iron Ocean, which stemmed from initial conversations at Skydance Television. And it will be the TV home of the Duffer brothers when they come to Paramount from Netflix in April for a big four-year exclusive film, TV and streaming deal. 


	PTVS, which focuses on streaming projects, is functioning alongside Paramount's other major TV production entity, CBS Studios.


_______________________________________________________________________


	Here is Thunell's memo:


	Team, 


	Over the last few months, we've brought together teams from Skydance, MTV Entertainment Studios, Showtime, Awesomeness, and Nickelodeon into one studio focused on making world-class television series. As we move forward in this new incarnation of Paramount Television Studios, we must make changes to position our business for growth and success. To do that, we're evolving our organization to better serve creators, audiences, and partners around the world through a new, streamlined structure.  


	Our studio has an enviable roster of senior executive talent, and after spending time with everyone, I've made key leadership decisions to ensure we achieve our ambitious goals. But this means we must also say goodbye to colleagues we deeply admire and respect. In the spirit of transparency, I want to share the following updates on our new leadership structure: 


	 Production 


	·                     Drew Brown, currently EVP, Physical Production for Skydance, will be the new PTVS Head of Production, reporting to me. Drew is a seasoned executive who has been instrumental in some of Skydance's biggest shows including Reacher for Prime Video. Prior to Skydance, he led Production at AMC Studios, where he was a driving force on series including The Walking Dead.  

	











	·                     With this change, Keri Flint, EVP and Head of Global Production for MTVE/Showtime, will be stepping down. Keri has been with the company for more than two decades, and in that time, she has been an incredibly valued member of our team. Her credits and accomplishments are too numerous to count; we thank her for her lasting impact. 


Creative 


	·                     Shelley Zimmerman and Carolyn Harris will continue in their roles as EVP, Head of Development and EVP, Head of Current, respectively, and will continue to report to me. 


	·                     Keith Cox, currently President of MTVE Studios & Showtime and a champion of Yellowstone since day one, will continue to oversee our expansive lineup of shows from the Taylorverse and will report to me. 


Corporate Functions 


	·                     COO Courtney Armstrong, CFO Mark Badagliacca, EVP Human Resources Talia Robinson, and EVP Global Communications & Media Relations Brooke Robertson are expanding their respective purviews to encompass PTVS, in addition to their current roles at Paramount Pictures. A key strategic initiative for our studio is deeper partnership and collaboration with our Features colleagues. Placing these leaders across the entire studio is an important first step in achieving this goal.   


	·                     Dawn Lach, SVP, Global Communications & Publicity, will transition from Skydance TV to PTVS, reporting to Brooke.  


Business Affairs & Legal Affairs 


	·                     Moving forward, Business Affairs and Legal Affairs will operate as two distinct groups. Our Head of Business Affairs will be Virginia Lazalde McPherson, who previously served as EVP, Business Affairs at Showtime, and was Global Head of Business Affairs at YouTube Originals prior to that. Bringing a wealth of experience and top-notch relationships, I'm excited to partner with Virginia in this new role.  


	·                     Lance McPherson will transition from his role as EVP, Deputy General Counsel and Head of Business & Legal Affairs to EVP, Legal Affairs. He will oversee all legal efforts for our studio going forward.  


	·                     Jeff Hegedus  is stepping down from his role as EVP, TV Business & Legal Affairs for Skydance. Jeff is known as a selfless mentor and a steadfast colleague. I thank him for his leadership and dedication during long tenure at Skydance. 


Finance 


	·                     Mel Rauch will be joining the team as Head of Finance. Previously, Mel was at Netflix, where she served as VP of EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) Content Finance & Strategy. I worked closely with Mel at Netflix for many years, where she was beloved as a creative problem solver and trusted business partner.  

	











	·                     Reporting into Mel will be Arturo Reyes, who will transition from his current role as EVP and Global Head of Production Finance at Skydance into his new role as Head of Production Finance for PTVS.  


	·                     Candice Brancazio, CFO, Paramount Media Networks, Showtime & MTVE, and Matt Hengemuhle, SVP, FP&A, will be exiting their respective roles, with Matt taking on a new remit in our Direct to Consumer business. We're grateful for their leadership and contributions and we will be announcing a new FP&A lead for our studio soon.  


Talent & Casting 


	·                     Trevor Rose will depart from his role as EVP, Head of Global Talent and Content Development for Showtime/MTVE and is moving to a leadership role in our TV Media group. With this, Tricia Wood will be expanding her role as EVP, Casting for Paramount Pictures to also oversee casting for PTVS. We believe this structure will encourage on-screen talent to work more seamlessly across our Features and Television Series.


Nickelodeon Live-Action and Awesomeness 


	·                     Shauna Phelan, EVP, Head of Live Action Series, Films & Talent, Nickelodeon and Awesomeness TV will be stepping down. Shauna has been a longtime leader of the Nickelodeon and Awesomeness teams and has been pivotal in shaping those brands. Thankfully, Shauna is not going far, as we are in discussions with her about working with us as a producer on some of our most important titles. Going forward, we remain committed to creating high-quality content for kids, teens and families — building on our incredible IP, championing new ideas, and operating as one unified team.  


	I know these are a lot of changes, but I am confident this new structure will strengthen collaboration, streamline decision-making, and super-charge our growth. In the coming weeks, we will continue the integration process, spending time on creative and business strategy under our new leadership team —more on that work soon.  


	Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues who are transitioning out of their roles. They have each contributed enormously to our organization, and we are grateful for their leadership, partnership, and many achievements. Please join me in wishing them the very best. 


	Thank you, as always, for your passion, resilience, and commitment. I cannot wait for all that we will accomplish together.  With gratitude,


	Matt

Just an idea: What if we stopped manufacturing Ghostface masks? Would that help? It feels like it might help!

After weathering all sorts of behind-the-scenes and also very-much-in-the-public-eye drama, the seventh entry in the venerable “Scream” franchise today offers up its first trailer. And while there's stuff to celebrate here, like the return of original final girl Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), original screenwriter Kevin Williamson behind the camera, and some small town chills, much of this first look feels a bit been-there, done-that.

 










Per the film‘s official synopsis: “When a new Ghostface killer emerges in the quiet town where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has built a new life, her darkest fears are realized as her daughter (Isabel May) becomes the next target. Determined to protect her family, Sidney must face the horrors of her past to put an end to the bloodshed once and for all.”

The film stars Campbell, Courteney Cox, Isabel May, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Anna Camp, Joel McHale, Mckenna Grace, Michelle Randolph, Jimmy Tatro, Asa Germann, Celeste O'Connor, Sam Rechner, Ethan Embry, Tim Simons, and Mark Consuelos. “Scream 7” marks the first time original screenwriter Kevin Williamson will direct a franchise outing, this time with a story by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick, with the final screenplay coming from Williamson and Busick.

 










The seventh film in the franchise was originally going to look much different, but after the departures of both stars Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega (who lead the revamped franchise in the fifth and sixth entries) and director Christopher Landon, we're guessing this new “Scream” is a brand new monster. 

Landon told Vanity Fair last year that he and his family endured death threats and “abuse” after “Scream” franchise actress Melissa Barrera was fired by production company Spyglass for her pro-Palestine comments. According to Landon, fans conflated Spyglass' decision with his own personal politics; at the time, Landon wrote on Twitter in a since-deleted statement about Barrera's firing, “Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.” Landon left the project in 2023.

After Barrera was let go, her “Scream” co-star Jenna Ortega decided to leave the franchise as well. It was originally reported that “Scream VII” conflicted with Ortega's “Wednesday” Season 2 shoot after the SAG-AFTRA strikes; Ortega recently clarified to The Cut that her exit had “nothing to do with pay or scheduling” and it was Barrera's firing that was the reason for her decision to leave. “Scream 7” will hit theaters on Friday, February 27. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Home sweet home?

Megan Thee Stallion and her NBA star boyfriend, Klay Thompson, hinted that they made a major move in their relationship by purchasing a home together. 

Taking to Instagram Wednesday, the “Savage” rapper posted a photo of her and Thompson's hands forming a heart as Megan held a pair of house keys.

Behind their hands was a gorgeous white home that had large windows.

Though it's unclear if the “Hot Girl Summer” emcee, 30, and the Dallas Mavericks player, 35, purchased the home together, fans took to the comments section of Megan's post to congratulate her on becoming a homeowner.

“She said she made that house a home… she be cooking for him daily… yall the signs were THERE!!!” wrote one user, referring to the lyrics from Megan's new single, “LOVER GIRL.”

“A HOUSEEE OMG MEGANNNNN🥹🥹,” added another.

“Y'all got a house together😩😭😭😍😍❤️❤️❤️,” commented a third person.

“Niece, is you shacking??? Congratulations!!” said a fourth netizen.

Page Six has reached out to both Megan and Thompson's reps but did not immediately hear back.

In July, TMZ reported that Megan and Thompson were dating after several eagle-eyed fans spotted the athlete in the back of one of her photos.

Thompson then confirmed the reports by posting a photo of him kissing the Grammy winner and holding hands. 

Megan and the former Golden State Warriors star then had a PDA-packed date night while grabbing dinner at New York City hotspot Carbone.

In photos obtained by Page Six, the pair was seen holding hands as they exited the Italian restaurant in the wee hours of the morning in July.

That same month, the couple made their red carpet debut at Megan's inaugural Pete & Thomas Foundation Gala in NYC.

In an exclusive interview with Page Six, the “WAP” emcee gushed over her new beau, saying she had “never dated somebody so kind.”

“This is my first relationship where I've ever been with somebody who's genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told us on the red carpet. 

“I just never dated somebody like him before and I'm just grateful that he's here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”

A lip reader exclusively told us that throughout the night, Megan tried to ensure that Thompson was doing well amid all the chaos of the photographers.

“You OK, babe?” the Chicas Divertidas Tequila founder asked her date, according to body language expert Nicola Hickling.

Hickling then claimed the four-time NBA champion reassured his lady, “Everything's alright, babe.”

	On the first night, months ago, Prim thought she would just head down to see what the protests were all about. She left her job as a nursing assistant, still in her scrubs and N95 mask, and drove to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Macadam Street in South Portland, where demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies had started to flare up. She thought she might be able to take some photos. When she arrived, there weren't many people there — a few knots of protesters on the sidewalks, huddled next to a smattering of residential buildings and a car parts shop. Macadam Street was empty. Prim went to cross, and was almost immediately shot at. Rubber bullets, pepper balls, and other projectiles whizzed by. From across the street, two black-clad protesters yelled at her. “Come to us! Come to us!” Stumbling and ducking, she made her way over. They told her the rules: ICE is over there. We are over here. They will shoot you if they can. 

	











	Four months later, Prim, who is 46, no longer works as a nursing assistant, and no longer wears scrubs. Instead, every night she dresses in black, in a helmet and gas mask, and works as a street medic treating the constant injuries of protesters in Portland. She has been shot in the head with non-lethal projectiles and breathed so much tear gas she coughed up blood. She doesn't use her real name in interviews, or even on the street (Prim is one of several pseudonyms). Prim the nursing assistant didn't know anything about the concept of “black bloc,” where protesters dress in nondescript black clothing to hide their identities. Prim the street medic wears it every night, attempting to conceal her identity from a government that has made it explicitly clear that she is an enemy of the state.

	











	For the past 10 years, the core of many of America's myriad protest movements has been dedicated activists who promote an ethos of “anti-fascism,” a nebulous term that has been used in opposition to police violence, brutal immigration policies, and widespread oppression of minority groups like the LGBTQ community. The right has taken this ideology and made it into a boogeyman: the specter of “antifa,” a shadowy network of far-left radicals hell bent on tearing apart the country. Antifa, as the right describes it, does not exist. There are no central leaders, no national organizations, no official members. But the term stuck, and the second Trump administration is determined to use a fabricated enemy to usher in a new wave of repression that could stifle dissent for years to come.

	On September 22, the Trump administration issued a decree that designated “antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization, claiming it is a “militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government.” Three days later, the administration issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, a sweeping document that links anti-fascist organizing with several instances of political violence, including the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and lays out an extremely broad framework potentially allowing federal law enforcement to prosecute any entity deemed to be supportive of that ideology. Now, anti-fascist activists around the country say that the two proclamations have ratcheted up pressure they've felt for years, making street-level organizing more dangerous than ever before.


	“It's completely changed [since NSPM-7],” Prim says. “We now have an open target on us.” 


	The ICE agents that clash with protesters in Portland, she says, are barely trained and quickly resort to violence. They fire rubber bullets at protesters' heads and slip rock-hard marbles into the hoppers of their pepper-ball guns. They're often joined by a motley assortment of right-wing agitators — big-rig drivers who menace crowds on the street, right-wing “journalists” who try to infiltrate groups of protesters and dox them online, and the dregs of street gangs like the Proud Boys who show up spoiling for fights. The situation, Prim says, feels more dire by the day.

	“A lot of us on the ground have already made wills,” Prim says. “I said goodbye to my brother two weeks ago, just in case. He knows there's a good chance I don't make it out of this.”

	











	Portland's protests, for the time being, are persisting in the face of Trump's new proclamation and ICE's heightened use of force. But in other parts of the country, NSPM-7's effects have driven organizing networks completely underground. Activists have wiped group chats and canceled meetings, scrubbing their online presences and often taking a step back from organizing. Almost everyone Rolling Stone spoke to for this story asked to use a pseudonym for fear of retribution. Others spoke on background or off the record. Anti-fascist networks have always had a strong security culture — encrypted messaging apps are the norm, and people are guarded with their identities — but the administration's broad declaration of “antifa” as terrorists has pushed those practices into overdrive. 


	“This shit is not new, it's just more overt now,” says Ned, an Appalachian anarchist who is dedicated to arming marginalized communities, like queer and trans people, with firearms. Trump's rhetoric has spooked many people he works with, and inspired others to formalize their security plans and protocols. But while online chatter may be more reserved, he says his actual work — hosting range days for queer and trans people to learn to shoot, and distributing information on how to 3D print weapons from scratch at home — is busier than ever. 


	“Direct action has been driven even further underground,” Ned says. “If anything there's more of it, it's just not online.”


	But real life can get messy, fast. Trump's initial proclamations came in the immediate wake of the Charlie Kirk shooting, and referenced instances of violence like Luigi Mangione's killing of health care CEO Brian Thompson. While the everyday activities of most anti-fascist activists are still overwhelmingly peaceful, the Trump administration has capitalized on every instance of political violence and used them to usher in new crackdowns and waves of propaganda. In early October — as the president was busy claiming that activist “thugs” were turning cities like Portland into “war zones” —  the administration hosted a rouges' gallery of far-right influencers and media figures at the White House to give them a forum to decry “antifa,” using them to further push its message that the group was a national threat. 


	The administration's stance is evident in its response to real-life violence, as well, which has left activists on the ground scrambling. In Texas, for instance, shootings at two ICE facilities prompted a swift and total crackdown, demolishing fragile networks of activists and bringing a new wave of federal charges. One of the shootings, an attack on ICE officers outside of a detention facility south of Dallas, was perpetrated by a man formerly associated with a loose network of left-wing gun-rights organizations that rose to prominence in 2023. The government arrested at least 14 people in connection with the shooting, charging 11 of them with attempted murder and “terrorism-related offenses,” per The Washington Post.  Discords, group chats, and social media accounts were scrubbed overnight, as the FBI raided houses. One source told me that even innocuous, long-standing groups like local Food Not Bombs chapters started wiping data and battening down the hatches, fearing that the federal crackdown wouldn't stay contained to those accused of an actual crime.

	











	“People got scared, and they haven't really come back,” said Corey Lyon, a local journalist who has covered protests throughout Texas. “A lot of the community that was built around activism, around helping our community, has been completely gutted.”


	Part of the reason these crackdowns have been effective is that they've been tested before — including in Atlanta, where the state of Georgia's campaign to label protesters as domestic terrorists has crushed the structure, if not the spirit, of the Stop Cop City movement. The movement began in 2022, when the city of Atlanta released plans to build an expansive police training facility in a forested area of land on the outskirts of the city. In response, a flourishing protest encampment sprang up in the forest, morphing into a years-long battle between police and activists that left one person, Manuel “Tortugita” Teran, dead after a police shooting. In a shocking weaponization of the justice system, Georgia Attorney General Christopher Carr used a 2017 statute passed after the Dylann Roof shootings to arrest and charge dozens of protesters with “domestic terrorism,” holding them in pre-trial detention for lengthy periods and snarling them in a legal web of denied bail, compounding charges, and jurisdictional chaos. Carr then went after the activists' support networks, bringing RICO charges against a local bail fund and several other community organizers.


	President Trump has clearly learned from these tactics, floating the idea of slamming George Soros and various networks of left-wing nonprofits with RICO charges based on their connections to protests. In Georgia, many of the charges, and many of the cases entirely, have been dropped or shot down by rational judges. But activists say that the initial shock of prosecution was the whole point.


	“The formal legal underpinnings of these tactics can't hold water,” says Marlon Kautz, a spokesperson for the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, the bail relief organization that was slapped with RICO charges. “But that doesn't matter, because the goal is not successful prosecution, it's the disruption of their political adversaries.” 


	Kautz himself was arrested in May 2023, when a joint task force of Georgia authorities raided his house in SWAT gear. From his bedroom, he heard officers discussing whether or not to throw a flash bang grenade through the front door. The point of all this, Kautz says, is to create fear. 

	











	“The objective is to make [activists] feel as if the safest smartest thing to do is to disengage with political activism until things cool down,” Kautz says. “The challenge is how to continue being an activist in the face of that fear. Because giving in to that fear is just defeat. There is no way to succeed by taking a step back or keeping your head down for a while.”


	In Portland, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and many other cities, plenty of activists aren't keeping their heads down. Some protesters have taken to showing up in whimsical costumes: inflatable frogs, chicken suits, giant foam hot dogs, and more. Many of these protests are peaceful, especially the ones that draw large crowds of everyday Americans upset with Trump's increasingly authoritarian administration. But there are always men in uniforms with guns. There are always fingers on triggers. 


	“We can't predict what is going to happen,” Prim, the medic in Portland, says. “All we can do is be as mentally prepared as possible — to take care of each other not only on the ground, but outside of it as well.”

	Prim isn't alone. In Atlanta, new groups of activists have taken up the mantle of those facing court cases. While Texas' highly-visible left-wing gun clubs may have faded, range days for vulnerable groups and 3D-printed schematics for weapons are more popular than ever. Some anti-fascists have dropped out of activism entirely in response to the Trump administration's crackdown, but plenty are staying busy, learning to adjust to a new, openly-hostile government. Some are peaceful. Some are not. All of them want to stop what they see as the rise of a fascist regime in the United States.


	“They paint us as these thugs and delinquents, these terrorists,” Prim says later, in a message on Signal, the encrypted messaging app. “It is us who know who the real terrorists are.”

Dean Lewis issued an apology Thursday following viral allegations that the Australian singer-songwriter behaved inappropriately with female fans.


	In recent weeks, several women who claim to have had interactions with Lewis over the past decade have shared their experiences on TikTok, providing screenshots and phone recordings that appear to show Lewis sexting, flirting, and arranging meet-ups with female fans.


	In his statement Thursday, Lewis — an award-winning singer in his native Australia whose hits “Waves” and “Be Alright” led him to a stint performing and collaborating with the Jonas Brothers — acknowledged the accusations and apologized for his behavior, but reiterated that he did nothing “illegal” with women he thought were “consenting adults.”


	“I understand why people are angry and disappointed after learning embarrassing details of intimate, private conversations and relationships I've had with consenting adults over the past decade, but I want to emphasize that none of this is illegal,” Lewis wrote.

	“The individuals leading the campaign against me have repeatedly acknowledged this, and I'm hurt by any suggestion that I've done things that have crossed into illegality. At the same time, I realize I've made an incredible mess, people are genuinely hurt, and I need to make changes.”


	Lewis admitted, “I've been flirty with adult women of all different ages, in-person, online, and over text. Occasionally, that flirting leads to consensual intimate encounters or relationships that I thought were private. And like anyone who has ever dated, been in a relationship, or just sent dumb flirty texts (and yes, sometimes sexts), I've done and said incredibly stupid, insensitive, and embarrassing things that I'm mortified by when looking back.”

	











	Lewis called the viral allegations against him and the fans' reaction to the TikTok videos an “overdue wake-up call.”


	“In the past few days, social media has made public a decade-plus of private conversations with a number of women, all of adult age. I don't fault these individuals for having hard feelings, and I don't want anyone defending me,” Lewis said. “I was breathtakingly dumb texting and flirting in the manner I have over many years. I should have been more sensitive that not everyone might look at our interactions the way I often did. From the bottom of my heart, I want to sincerely apologize to those I've hurt.”

	Lewis promised to make “a lot of changes” going forward, including enrolling in “intense therapy” in order to make “better choices and dramatically shift my approach to dating, relationships, and showing greater care to the women in my life.” He also said he would formulate “a whole new set of rules” regarding how he engaged with fans.


	“I know it's too much to ask for grace and forgiveness at this moment, but in time I hope to re-earn the trust of those I've hurt, and do better by those I've disappointed,” Lewis wrote. “I'm going to look after myself for a little bit while I get my head and life in order.”

Comcast, led by Brian Roberts and Michael Cavanagh, reports its third-quarter financials and operating updates.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Peacock, the streaming service of Comcast's entertainment unit NBCUniversal, narrowed its third-quarter loss to $217 million compared with $436 million in the year-ago period. The streamer, which unveiled new programming like The Paper and M3GAN 2.0 in the quarter, ended September with 41 million paying subscribers, unchanged from the end of June, and also the end of March, and compared with 36 million a year ago, the company said Thursday.


	Peacock revenue dropped slightly to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, compared with $1.5 billion in the year-ago period when the Paris Olympics boosted results. The loss on the adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) line of the earnings update was down from the year-ago period after the streamer had lost only $101 million in the second quarter.

	Adjusted EBITDA for the company's Media unit, to which Peacock belongs, increased 28 percent in the third quarter to $832 million as a 24 percent decline in operating expenses compared to when the Olympics period a year earlier more than offset a 20 percent revenue decrease to $6.59 billion. When excluding Olympics revenue from the year-ago period, revenue would have been up 4.2 percent. Media unit ad revenue fell 41 percent, but was up 2.6 percent when adjusted for the Olympics.


	“The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower sports programming costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year period and a decrease in other sports programming costs for our domestic television networks, mainly reflecting lower sports volumes compared to the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in sports costs for our international networks,” the company said. 


	Revenue for the Studios unit increased 6 percent to $3 billion, “primarily due to higher content licensing revenue,” Comcast said.” Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios, partially offset by the timing of when content was made available by our film studios. Theatrical revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from an increased number of releases in the current quarter, including the successful release of Jurassic World Rebirth.”


	Adjusted EBITDA for the Studios segment dropped 22 percent to $365 million due to an 11.7 percent increase in operating expenses, which more than offset a 6 percent revenue gain. The increase in operating expenses was “primarily driven by higher programming and production expenses, mainly due to higher costs associated with content licensing sales, and higher marketing and promotion expenses due to increased spending on recent and upcoming theatrical film releases,” the company said.

	











	Theme parks were a key growth driver of the latest period. Revenue jumped 18.7 percent to $2.71 billion “primarily due to higher revenue at domestic theme parks, driven by the successful opening of Epic Universe in May.” Adjusted EBITDA for theme parks rose 13 percent to $958 million, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset a 22 percent increase in operating expenses, which was primarily due to operating costs associated with Epic Universe.


The planned Versant transaction, which will separate most of the conglomerate's cable networks from the rest of its operations, cost Comcast money again in the three months ended Sept. 30. “Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction and transaction-related costs associated with the proposed separation of Versant, as well as other operating and administrative expenses related to our investment portfolio,” the company disclosed. It listed $26 million in transaction costs, plus $90 million in transaction-related costs, for a total of $116 million in the third quarter. For the year to date, it recorded $277 million in such costs.


	Comcast will retain NBCUniversal's Peacock, the NBC broadcast network, the Bravo cable channel, and the studios in the separation, while the rest of the cable brands, along with such digital assets as Golf Now and Rotten Tomatoes, will form Versant.

	











	Comcast is run by chairman and CEO Brian Roberts and president Michael Cavanagh, who will in the new year be elevated to the role of co-CEO.


	Cavanagh, in prepared remarks on the company's earnings call, spent some time leaning into sports as a key driver of its media business post-Versant spin.


	“We're proud of the sports portfolio we've built. Each property adds value across our entire media ecosystem, driving NBC distribution, helping Peacock attract and retain subscribers, and powering our advertising business,” Cavanagh said. “As audiences continue to shift from linear to streaming, the multiple benefits of sports becomes an even greater advantage. Live sports continue to deliver strong viewership and ad performance across broadcast and streaming. Momentum at Peacock remains solid, and retention has held steady, even after our $3 price increase, running linear and streaming as one, integrated media business gives us real scale and flexibility. It allows us to align programming, marketing, promotion and monetization across NBC, Peacock and our studios, and as we near completion of the verse and spin, NBCUniversal's media business will be more focused and well positioned to grow.”


	In the core cable systems business, total domestic broadband customer net losses came to 104,000 in the latest quarter, total domestic wireless line net additions were 414,000 and total domestic video customer net losses hit 257,000.


	“In Content & Experiences, we're building momentum across NBC and Peacock as we head into one of the most exciting stretches of live sports in our history, including robust NBA coverage, which just began last week,” Roberts said. “The early success of Epic Universe contributed to 19 percent revenue growth at our theme parks, reflecting the strength of our newest attractions and the enduring appeal of the Universal brand.”

	











	Cavanagh also discussed the reported interest in Warner Bros. Discovery, suggesting that the company could be acquisitive, though the bar remains high.


	“You can expect that any view we would have about other media assets that could be complementary to our existing media business would be of the same sort. So in this case, it would be streaming assets and studio assets, since there's no other parks assets out there,” Cavanagh said. “So I think in light of that, what we'd be looking for and what we're going to look like post-divest and spin, I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that's out there.”

Mike Cavanagh was asked about the reported interest in Warner Bros. Discovery, adding that the bar remains high for any deals.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Comcast is very much interested in M&A dealmaking, but it still has a “high bar” for potential acquisitions, co-CEO Mike Cavanagh told Wall Street analysts Thursday.


	Cavanagh was asked about reports that Comcast may be interested in pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery, and whether Comcast would be able to get a deal through given the current regulatory regime. The executive noted the looming Versant spinoff, and that with NBC, theme parks and Peacock left as the media assets, that is the rubric through which they would examine any deals.

	With Versant set up “to pursue strategies that didn't fit inside the new NBC media business,” any deals would need to plug into what the company is keeping. He also suggested that Comcast is not as concerned about regulatory issues as some observers are.


	“You can expect that any view we would have about other media assets that could be complementary to our existing media business would be of the same sort. So in this case, it would be streaming assets and studio assets, since there's no other parks assets out there,” Cavanagh said. “So I think in light of that, what we'd be looking for and what we're going to look like post-divest and spin, I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that's out there.”

	The comments certainly suggest that Comcast would be interested in WBD's streaming and studios business if it follows through with its own split, a move that would likely impact Paramount's ongoing efforts to cut a deal with WBD for the entire company.

	











	Cavanagh noted, however, that the company won't be doing deals for deals' sake.


	“The bar is very high for us to pursue any M&A transactions, given how strongly we feel about the businesses we have, the strategies we're pursuing and the opportunities we have ahead of us. So that continues to be an important anchor point for how we think about things,” Cavanagh said. “You should expect us to look at things that are trading in the space around our industry, it's our job to try to figure out if there's ways to add value. But I would point out that with the Versant spin, we've set the NBC media business up, pairing Peacock on the streaming side with NBC broadcast. You've seen lots of news lately about us attracting the NBA, Taylor, Sheridan and the like, over the long term, and you put that business alongside, you know, one of the finest studio businesses in the industry, and our parks business, and I think the strategies we have are really sound and durable without M&A.”

Cheryl Hines is no longer close with her “Curb Your Enthusiasm” co-star Larry David after the actress went full “MAGA.”

“Well, I haven't talked to him in a while,” Hines, who played David's wife for all 12 seasons of the hit HBO Max show, said on the “Hot Mics with Billy Bush” podcast Monday. 

The “Suburgatory” alum, 68, said she and the comedian, 78, “probably” haven't spoken since attending an event for the Season 12 finale last year.

“I love Larry, and I think Larry loves me,” she shared. “I think it's just politics, it makes conversations.”

Page Six has reached out to David's rep for comment, but did not immediately hear back. 

On Wednesday, the Daily Mail reported that Hines' Hollywood friends are stunned by the actress's transformation from liberal to conservative “MAGA” views.

“It's so hard to make sense in my head because she was so liberal before,” a longtime Hollywood pal of Hines, who is married to US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., reportedly told the outlet.

“And now, she's married to a member of the Trump administration and she's literally defending his ridiculous s–t on ‘The View,'” they added.

Hines' friends are said to be appalled that she's “gone MAGA” after years of being a longtime Democrat.

Insiders close to the “RV” star said her switch up to becoming a fully supportive wife after publicly distancing herself from Kennedy's controversial views is “beyond comprehension.”

In August, the Daily Mail reported that Hines had been “iced out” of David's new HBO show — which Michelle and Barack Obama will produce.

The series will feature six half-hour episodes, and many of the stars from “Curb Your Enthusiasm” are expected to reunite on set.

However, the outlet reported that the Obamas are “vehemently opposed” to Hines being a part of the project due to her political alliances with Kennedy and President Trump.

A source said Hines is now facing “the cancel culture wrath of her beloved Hollywood at the highest level of progressive political power.”

“The Obamas are adamant that anyone politically connected to Trump – who they despise – should not have a role in any of their lucrative media projects,” a well-connected source told the Daily Mail. 

“That clearly would include Cheryl. Worse for her in the Obamas' eyes — and Larry's, too — she dropped her affiliation with the Democrat Party and calls herself an Independent and has an amicable friendship with Donald Trump.”

Swift paid tribute to sparkle-loving Mackie, 85, by wearing a look from the "Jewel Finale" from the Las Vegas show "Jubilee!"

	Beloved Hollywood fashion designer Bob Mackie is over the moon that Taylor Swift is repping one of his famously rhinestone-encrusted creations on the cover of her The Life of a Showgirl album. Speaking to E! News, Mackie, 85, said he was “kind of shocked” that the singer picked a real-life showgirl outfit he designed for the face of her 12th LP.

	“Because I was thinking Taylor Swift to be this little girl who used to write songs about fairytale princesses,” said Mackie. “She's amazing and much taller than I thought she would be and older than I thought she was. I thought she was still 14 or something. Not true!”

	“Sultan of Sequins” Mackie, whose legendarily sparkly, jewel-encrusted costumes have been worn by everyone from Diana Ross to Elton John, Whitney Houston, Miley Cyrus, Judy Garland, Beyoncé, Liza Minelli and, perhaps most famously, Cher, paid tribute to the cover shot in an August Instagram post describing its provenance. 


	“The ensemble worn by @taylorswift was designed by Bob Mackie for the ‘Jewel Finale' of the Las Vegas show Jubilee! Produced by Don Arden; the show featured over 1,000 costumes based on Florenz Ziegfeld stage shows with elaborate couture costumes worn by the showgirls,” he wrote. “It was the longest running showgirl spectacular in history and ran from 1981 to 2016.” 

	











	Mackie also provided some of the details of the the elaborate get-up and an image of one of the Vegas performers wearing a version of it, explaining, “The bra, undergarments, and armbands are all French wirework and backed with a blush fabric for a nude illusion. The bra and underwear have set stones and drops at the under-bust of the bra and the waistline of the underwear.”

Nine years and five seasons later, Netflix‘s flagship series is finally coming to an end. “Stranger Things” will debut its fifth and final season this November, and the streamer has released a new trailer for the installment, promising a huge final battle for the beloved cast of characters.

Set in the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the nostalgic days of the 1980s, “Stranger Things” follows a group of civilians — ranging from adults to teenagers — who encounter threats from the Upside Down, an alternate dimension teaming with monsters. Season 4 saw the cast confront the mysterious Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), an incredibly powerful telepath, in a battle that left Hawkins devastated and expanded the rift between the Earth and the Upside Down.

The trailer for Season 4 shows a bit of the fallout from the events of Season 4, as Hawkins is now under military quarantine from the United States government to contain the monsters of the Upside Down. In order to save the town, the kids agree to go on one final adventure to find and kill Vecna, who himself has plans involving Will Byers (Noah Schnapp).

The logline for the season reads: “The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will's disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they've faced before. To end this nightmare, they'll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.” 

“Stranger Things” first premiered in July 2016, receiving critical acclaim and becoming a massive word-of-mouth hit for the streamer. Currently, the fourth season is the most-watched season of TV in Netflix's history according to its own internal metrics, only ranking behind Season 1 of “Wednesday” and the limited series “Adolescence.” The series has also spawned a large multimedia franchise, including an ongoing Broadway stage production, “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” and an upcoming animated series, “Stranger Things: Tales From '85.”

The series was created by identical twin team Matt and Ross Duffer, who also showrun and executive produce the series via their Upside Down Productions banner. Following the conclusion of the final season, the two will depart Netflix for Paramount, where they signed a four-year deal to produce new content for the studio. Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen also produce. 

 










Season 5 features a huge ensemble cast that includes Bower, Schnapp, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Brett Gelman, Cara Buono, Amybeth McNulty, Nell Fisher, Jake Connelly, Alex Breaux, and Linda Hamilton. The season will be split into three parts: the first, consisting of four episodes, will arrive on November 26. Three more episodes will debut on Christmas, and the finale arrives on New Year's Eve. Each volume will debut on the streamer at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET.

“Can you just choke me, like, real quick?” Maia (Rachel Sennott) asks her boyfriend, Dylan (Josh Hutcherson), in the midst of a spirited round of morning sex. The choking Maia likes, and it's an easy gift to give on her birthday. But the quickness is a necessity. Shortly after things heat up, an earthquake hits. Dylan's eyes go wide, and he reaches for his buzzing phone to check his seismology app. “Baby, this is the big one!” But Maia is unfazed. She doesn't stop. She's focused on what she wants. “If we're going to die, I just want to come.”

 










As much as I hate to tip the opening scene of an new comedy — and there are plenty more jokes to appreciate, I promise — few introductions so neatly incorporate the major motifs that make up the ensuing series. In “I Love LA,” there's a relationship that, in the moment, is mainly transactional, even if it's also only sporadically working toward the same goal. There are characters who invite judgement from the audience, whether it's disbelief over Maia's lack of concern for her own safety (not to mention Dylan's), or it's admiration for Maia's unflappable determination to get what she wants. (You can judge Dylan, too, as I did simply for using a seismology app.) And then there are the satiric quips, the candid carnality, and the love-it-or-leave-it depiction of life in Los Angeles.

Following her breakthrough in “Shiva Baby” and the cult adoration of “Bottoms,” Sennott's HBO series is easy to frame as the next step in becoming what Hannah Horvath called “a voice of a generation.” The similarities between “I Love LA” and “Girls” (including much of what's mentioned above) make it easy to compare this Gen-Z comedy to that early millennial touchstone, especially as the ensemble fills out and the narrative settles in.

Still, Sennott's HBO debut largely avoids the reductive label of “Girls: LA” by piling on its own steady (and stealthy) jokes, leaning into influencer culture's vacuous reach, and embracing its characters with surprising sincerity. The warm, relatable territory where the first season ends up doesn't fully square with the savage satire promised by the pilot. But the combination of empathy and acrimony is endearing in its own right, making it difficult not to be won over by a tightknit crew out to get theirs before the world comes crashing down on top of them.

Joining Maia for her pivotal birthday are her two local best friends, Charlie (Jordan Firstman) and Alani (True Whitaker) — respectively, an on-the-rise fashion designer with a smattering of star clients and the nepo baby of a famous filmmaker who gave her a job (in title only) at his studio. Befitting her privileged, blinkered upbringing, Alani makes for an outstanding airhead, and she regularly shares fascinating glimpses into her curious, calcified mind — like when she's out to dinner and suggests moving her uneaten carrots closer to her uneaten rabbit “as a veneration, or a little offering.” Charlie, on the other hand, is sharp. His cutting observations are a regular highlight, like when he slags a frenemy for drawing out her 15 minutes of fame: “She's bread-crumbing the posts out like it's her Midwestern wedding photos.”

 










Spoken shade amongst the group is as plentiful as actual shade is absent in LA's concrete desert, and the trio tosses it around with the casual dominance of Shohei Ohtani. Their online parlance is punctuated by empty enthusiasms, vicious aspersions, and obvious hypocrisies that rarely matter. The group will pump each other up (often, by taking others down), and any reversal of previously stated beliefs are automatically ignored for the sake of the friendship. That, or the past has already been forgotten. Because so much in their professional lives pivot on what's in and what's out, day by day, moment by moment, people's thoughts and feelings can be treated as equally immaterial, even disposable — the result of growing up terminally online and importing that slippery, spinning world of social media into their real ongoing lives.

That troubling temptation to treat your phone like a magic portal to a better life finds an ideal personification in Tallulah (Odessa A'zion). When Maia's old college friend from New York shows up in her apartment as a birthday surprise, the model/influencer is all bubbly enthusiasm — despite the fact that Maia just blocked her on Instagram that morning. Yes, Tallulah is the aforementioned bread-crumber, but she's got enough online followers and offline charisma to unlock a few doors, including Maia and Dylan's, where she's decided to crash for the weekend — and maybe beyond. 

 










At first, Maia vents her frustrations with her attention-seeking friend. “She just sucks up all the oxygen in the room and makes everything about her!” Maia says, shortly before Tallulah does it again. But when she realizes all that narcissism can be deployed to her advantage, things change: Tallulah needs a manager. Maia needs a client. They both want to move up in the world, and they both think the other one is holding the ladder.

Whether they pull each other up or tear each other down provides the tension driving most of Season 1's drama. Sennott and A'zion (Pamela Adlon's middle daughter, soon to be seen in “Marty Supreme”) are electric together, especially when trading passive aggressive attacks, but you're never rooting for an implosion; not after the actors vividly establish their characters' genuine bond, which goes a long way toward wanting their strange, superficial dreams to somehow work out. There's less to worry about with Charlie, whose talent is proven, and Alani, who was born rich enough to thrive in ignorance, but they still feel substantial and, just as critically, really bring the laughs.

“I Love LA” takes a few too many easy shots at the city's superficial subculture of fame-chasers obsessed with selfies and beach trips. There's room for more incisive, challenging commentary, and the first season is missing a complete episode that makes you sit up and say, “Yes!,” the way “The Return” or “Vagina Panic” did for “Girls.” 

 










But Sennott and co-showrunner Emma Barrie weave clever arcs into memorable episodes centered on a Hollywood Hills party, a trip to New York City, and a Ritz cracker campaign. Pilot director and executive producer Lorene Scafaria brings her hard-edged clarity to a crew that wouldn't settle for anything less than brutal honesty (so long as it also caught their good sides, which she does). Her episodes are alive and exciting, especially the premiere, and she gets the best out of exquisite guest stars like Leighton Meester (perfectly cast as Maia's queen-bee boss) and Moses Ingram (as a flirty chef who falls for Tallulah). 

Even if “L.A.” doesn't quite earn those four little letters every TV fan wants to say when they try out a smart new show, there's a lot to like here, and that's what really matters in a debut season. Time will tell if Sennott's creation has the stamina and footprint of its forebears, or if it's more in line with this generation's succinct series' length and segmented audience impact. But one thing is clear already: This influencer's going her own way.

“I Love LA” premieres Sunday, November 2 at 10:30 p.m. ET on HBO. New episodes will be released weekly.

UPDATED: Netflix has launched its second trailer for Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 1.


	The new trailer opens on the Upside Down version of the Hawkins Library, covered in slimy vines. Viewers may recall that this is where Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) was found after that fateful night he went missing in Season 1 of the Netflix tentpole series.


	A Demogorgon bows before Vecna, covered in similar vines to the alternate dimension as the villain declares, “At long last, we can begin.”


	Cue Queen's “Who Wants To Live Forever” and cut to Gaten Matarazzo's Dustin Henderson biking to Hawkins High School, proudly wearing his Hellfire Club shirt from the late Eddie Munson's (Joseph Quinn) Dungeons and Dragons group.

	A ravaged downtown Hawkins, still healing from the devastation at the end of Season 4 when Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) tried to open four gates from the Upside Down and swallow Hawkins whole can also be spotted.


	Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) sit atop the WSQK building where Mike reveals that Hawkins residents are “stuck” in the fenced-in town crawling with military.


	All elements of the main crew are back together with the four boys working together with Steve Harrington (Joe Keery), Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke). Hopper and Eleven look to be navigating The Upside Down together as the psionic hero uses her returned powers to leap into the air.

	“This isn't like one of your campaigns,” Eleven tells Mike. “You don't get to write the ending, not this time.”


	Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin) can be spotted holding Max Mayfield's (Sadie Sink) comatose body in an elevator as a demodog runs at them. He later looks to be in a tunnel facing a Demogorgon. 


	“He's planning to end our world, and he's not gonna stop til we're drained of every last ounce of suffering,” Nancy says.


	“We stay true to ourselves, we stay true to our friends,” Dustin says. “No matter the cost.”

	A showdown is coming as Vecna — rocking some new and improved red vine armor — can be seen levitating Will's paralyzed body telling him “You are going to help me one last time.”


PREVIOUS, July 16: Netflix has dropped the first trailer for the final chapter of Stranger Things, and it teases an epic showdown in Hawkins. The streamer also dropped 12 new photos for the final season, which you can view here.


	We see the first footage of Linda Hamilton as Dr. Kay, and demogorgons popping out everywhere.

	Picking up in the fall of 1987, Hawkins looks like a Hellscape, the town scarred by the opening of the Rifts to the Upside Down and our heroes united by a single goal: to find and kill Vecna. “But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will's disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they've faced before. To end this nightmare, they'll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time,” reads the official synopsis.

	Netflix reveals upcoming episodes will also provide more intel about the mysterious Upside Down. Back in Season 1, series creators Matt and Ross Duffer wrote a 25-page document that delved into the mythology of the cryptic alternate dimension. While some of that lore has already been unveiled, we can expect more details to emerge in the final season.


	“The last remaining questions that are answered in that document, we've punted a couple of those to have some big reveals in Season 5,” Ross Duffer said previously. “And that's really going to affect what Season 5 is about.”

	The cast includes Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers), David Harbour (Jim Hopper), Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven), Finn Wolfhard (Mike Wheeler), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson), Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas Sinclair), Noah Schnapp (Will Byers), Sadie Sink (Max Mayfield), Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler), Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers), Joe Keery (Steve Harrington), Maya Hawke (Robin Buckley), Priah Ferguson (Erica Sinclair), Brett Gelman (Murray), Jamie Campbell Bower (Vecna), Cara Buono (Karen Wheeler), Amybeth McNulty (Vickie), Nell Fisher (Holly Wheeler), Jake Connelly (Derek Turnbow), Alex Breaux (Lt. Akers) and Hamilton.

	











Stranger Things is produced by Upside Down Pictures & 21 Laps Entertainment with The Duffer Brothers serving as executive producers, alongside Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen.

SiriusXM reported third-quarter revenue of $2.16 billion, above analyst expectations but down 1% from the prior-year period.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


SiriusXM reported third-quarter revenue of $2.16 billion, above analyst expectations but down 1 percent from the prior-year period, and net income of $297 million, after reporting a net loss of $2.96 billion a year ago. 


	The company reported earnings per share of $0.84, above analyst expectations and compared to a loss of $8.74 in the third quarter of 2024. The year ago net loss included a $3.36 billion noncash goodwill impairment related to the Liberty Media transaction.




	The satellite radio company reported 33 million total subscribers, down 40,000 paid subscribers from a year ago. Monthly churn improved slightly year-over-year, reaching 1.6 percent. The lower subscriber base led to a $13 million decrease in subscriber revenue this quarter.

					MrBallen Podcast Moves to SiriusXM (Exclusive)		
			









	In the prior quarter, the company extended its agreement with Andy Cohen, renewed its agreement with Megyn Kelly and saw Stephen A. Smith debut on the platform. SiriusXM also recently signed popular podcasts Morbid and The MrBallen Podcast. Podcasting advertising was again a bright spot, with the company seeing ad revenue in that sector up 50 percent, while overall ad revenue grew just 1 percent year over year. The podcast segment helped offset declines in music streaming ad revenue (SiriusXM also owns music-streaming site Pandora).

	Asked about the possibility of additional advertising for podcasts on video, Scott Greenstein, chief content officer at SiriusXM said the company has seen “enormous growth” on YouTube and pointed to the Spotify announcement with Netflix.

	











	“With our lineup of content, there's no shortage of opportunity where we'll go in video right now,” Greenstein said. “We like the way we're monetizing. We're flexible. We can have video behind the paywall. We can have video with YouTube or any distribution partner.”


	“Most of our engagement, of course, is in the car, right? And we believe we still have lots of opportunity with audio in the car, but that video is a great compliment. And to the extent we can work, like Scott said, with other partners, especially where we've seen success with YouTube, it gives us a real opportunity to build complementary engagement outside of the car, and even promote back to SiriusXM content in audio in the car,” said Jennifer Witz, chief executive officer of SiriusXM.


	The company increased its 2025 guidance for revenue to $8.525 billion and its adjusted EBITDA to about $2.625 billion and free cash flow to approximately $1.225 billion.


	“This was a quarter of meaningful progress for SiriusXM,” Witz said. “We're enhancing the subscriber experience through new content, deeper personalization, and continued innovation across every stage of the customer journey, driving greater engagement and value for our listeners. At the same time, we're scaling our digital advertising business and strengthening our leadership in podcasting. Across each of these areas, we're leveraging our unique assets to deliver sustainable profitability and long-term value for our shareholders — a strategy that is already delivering as we raise our full year guidance.”

Sydney Sweeney left little to the imagination with her most daring red carpet look to date.

The actress sizzled in a sparkling — and completely sheer — silver gown at Variety's 2025 Power of Women event Wednesday night.

The floor-length ensemble, designed by Christian Cowan, hugged Sweeney's curves with a cinched waist.

The iridescent number, which the 28-year-old paired with diamond earrings and silver Jimmy Choo stiletto sandals, laced up the back.

The “Euphoria” star's recent hair transformation, a dramatic blond bob, was on full display as she posed in the naked dress.

Social media users raved over the look, with one X user calling Sweeney an “absolute showstopper.”

Following the step-and-repeat, the “White Lotus” alum made a speech about being “underestimated” in the industry.

“I know what it feels like … to have people define you before you've had a chance to define yourself,” she told attendees. “I know what it feels like to have to prove that you deserve to be here, to be seen, to be taken seriously.

“Every one of us has our own fight,” Sweeney continued. “Strength doesn't look loud sometimes, and sometimes it's about getting up again and again, no matter who is watching.”

She concluded by telling young women not to “shrink themselves,” urging them to believe their “power is already within.”

The Emmy nominee shared the speech via Instagram, dedicating her words to boxer Christy Martin, whom she portrays in the “Christy” biopic, as well as “all the women who inspire us in big and small ways.”

Ahead of Wednesday's gathering, Sweeney spoke to Variety for a lengthy profile.

In the interview, the “Anyone But You” star dispelled online speculation that she has undergone plastic surgery to change her appearance.

“I've never gotten anything done,” she insisted to the outlet on Monday. “I'm absolutely terrified of needles. No tattoos. Nothing.”

Sweeney noted, “I'm going to age gracefully.”

The “Handmaid's Tale” alum clapped back at viral “comparison photos,” explaining, “I'm like, ‘I'm 12 in that photo. Of course, I'm going to look different. I have makeup on now and I'm 15 years older.'”

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Rita Ora and Ella Purnell have been unveiled for the lead voice cast roles of Harald Zwart's animated viking girls adventure ViQueens as Sola Media gear up to launch sales at the AFM.


	Billed as a high-energy adventure-comedy, ViQueens follows two fearless Viking girls, Ingrid (Purnell) and Hedvig (Ora), as they defy tradition to return a stowaway boy to China.


	Their journey spans icy fjords, Byzantine intrigue, and the fabled Silk Road, blending Viking grit with ancient Chinese wisdom, unexpected alliances, and a touch of magic.

	Annie Award-winning composer Christophe Beck, whose scores for Frozen and Frozen II are known to hundreds of millions worldwide, with other credits including Buffy The Vampire Slayer, has written the original score for the film.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Sola Media has unveiled a first look for the film as it gears up to launch international sales in L.A.


	The feature marks Dutch-Norwegian director Zwart's first animated feature after live-action titles such as World War Two drama The 12th Man; fantasy adventure The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and The Karate Kid, starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith.


	Purnell arrives fresh from Yellowjackets, with past voice roles including Jinx in the hit animated series Arcane, while UK pop artist Ora lent her voice to the character of Wondering Blade in the Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight series and was also in the voice cast of Pokémon: Detective Pikachu.


	Sola Media will unveil an exclusive teaser at the AFM for the film, which is scheduled for delivery in the last quarter of 2026, with a home territory release slated for December 26, 2026.

	











	Additional cast include Steve Speirs as King Erik, Anton Lesser as the scheming brother Lars, and Alan Carr as the Bard, a lyrically challenged royal scribe.


ViQueens is produced by Veslemoey Zwart of Zwart Arbeid (The 12th Man, Troll, and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones), with executive producers Torgeir Sanders of Gimpville (Troll, Troll Hunter), Robert Chandler of Space Age Films (The Amazing Maurice, The Canterville Ghost), Peter Clausen of OPCM (Lilyhammer, Jo Nesbø's Harry Hole, Troll and Billionaires Island), and Andrew Williams of Vamonos and Solveig Langeland of Sola Media. 


	“As a Norwegian, I was often urged to make a Viking film,” said director Harald Zwart. “But the usual dark, violent portrayals never appealed to me. When Veslemøy brought me the idea for ViQueens, it offered a fresh perspective — a story about how Norway, once feared, is now best known for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize. That transformation, imagined through the journey of two brave young girls, completely captivated me. It was the Viking story I had been waiting to tell.”


	“ViQueens delivers exactly the kind of striking storytelling we're passionate about championing,” added Langeland, Managing Director of Sola Media. “It's fresh, fun and emotionally resonant – with rich visuals, cross-cultural themes and a world-class team behind it. This is the kind of film that will travel widely.”


	Zwart Arbeid – a tongue-in-cheek name that means “under-the-table work” in Norwegian – is the joint company of wife and husband team Veslemoey Ruud Zwart and Harald Zwart.


	With countless award-winning commercials, music videos and features to their name, the Zwarts have built a reputation for high-quality storytelling across genres. 


	Zwart Arbeid also produced Long Flat Balls, the most successful comedy franchise in Scandinavian cinema, and as well as World War Two epic The 12th Man, which sold to over 100 countries and remains one of the highest-grossing films in Norwegian box office history.


	The company operates offices in L.A. and Norway.

It's been fully two years since Hollywood indulged itself with a movie that was mostly about how goddamn scary bears are—ah, Cocaine Bear, were we ever so young?—and apparently it's that time once again. Variety reports that Mia Goth, Zach Galifianakis, and Dan Stevens have signed on for a new bear-adjacent revenge movie titled Hey Bear, about a woman (Goth, fresh off a more sympathetic take toward potentially lethal Creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein) who decides to take deadly revenge on a bear after it kills her husband (Stevens), and then, instead of being euthanized, is simply transferred to another national park.

While that's interesting enough, the really noteworthy thing about the film is that it's being directed by Jonathan Krisel, who made a name for himself as one of the primary creative voices—including serving as director—on both Portlandia and Galifianakis' show Baskets. Krisel's been on the verge of breaking into film for years at this point, having been attached to a Sesame Street movie that was first floated back in 2019, and a Detective Pikachu sequel that never seemed to get off the ground. Now, he's apparently doing “Grizzly Man if it was fictitious and the Grizzly Man's wife decided she was going to kill that fucking bear,” having spent the intervening years since his last big Hollywood push working on shows like Moonbase 8 and The English Teacher.

Hey Bear will serve as an obvious reunion for Krisel and Galifianakis, who's playing a “socially awkward park ranger” who ends up accompanying Goth's Claire on her quest for bear assassination. Written by regular Nathan Fielder collaborator Carrie Kemper (fresh off both The Curse and The Rehearsal), the film is being described as a “coming of rage” comedy, centered on Goth's character coming out of her shell through the power of murder, which is the sort of clever phrasing that we're going to be mildly, irrationally angry about for the rest of the week.

Alice Yaxley is standing by her fiancé through one of the most challenging moments of their lives.The 24-year-old model, who is expecting her first child with “Made in Chelsea” star Sam Vanderpump, opened up about how emotional it was to watch his health battle unfold on television.

I really need to start doing some maternity shoots😂 i have too much time on my hands #pregnancy #juicer #juicepress 

In a TikTok video shared Tuesday, Yaxley admitted she broke down after watching the latest episode. “I don't usually watch Made in Chelsea because it cringes me out,” she said while making fresh orange juice. “But I did watch last night because it was a very emotional one from Sam. I couldn't deal with it. It really made me cry.”

She tried to lighten the mood, adding with a small laugh, “I'm not going to the gym at the moment, so this is probably a really good arm workout for me.”

The couple, who announced their pregnancy last month, said the news came as a surprise since Yaxley has polycystic ovaries.

Sam Vanderpump might just have four or five years to live if he doesn't find an organ donor.  He's been diagnosed with irreversible late-stage liver disease.  Sam was born with the rare conditions congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver and polycystic kidney disease. They were dormant in his body until he got the flu in December and, coupled with asthma, his organs struggled to cope. #samvanderpump #madeinchelsea #liverdisease #vanderpump 

The 28-year-old “Made in Chelsea” star, who is the nephew of reality icon Lisa Vanderpump, revealed on Monday's episode that he has been diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. The condition, he shared, could limit his life expectancy to only four or five years without a transplant.

“There is no hope of my liver getting better,” Vanderpump told fellow cast member Ollie Locke on the E4 show, as shared by Daily Mail. “He said I wouldn't be having this call with you if I thought you could make it through the next four or five years. They're sending me for a liver transplant assessment, so yeah.”

Despite the grim news, Vanderpump remains optimistic. “The way I look at it is I'm healthy now,” he said. “Hopefully I will remain healthy until I get a call, go in for surgery, and then wake up and be healthier.”

A post shared by Kidney Research UK (@kidney_research_uk)

Vanderpump was born with two rare conditions: congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver and polycystic kidney disease. They remained dormant until a flu infection in December triggered organ failure. Combined with asthma, the illness caused his body to struggle to recover.

Earlier this year, Vanderpump shared that he “nearly died” after his liver and kidneys failed, leading to sepsis. He credited Alice for saving his life after she called an ambulance when he became delirious.

“They told me if I had gotten to the hospital 24–48 hours later, I wouldn't have made it,” he told MailOnline. “By calling the ambulance, my girlfriend literally saved my life.”

Doctors discovered his liver enzymes were dangerously high and his white cell count had doubled. “They told me I was the sickest patient on the ward,” he recalled.

A post shared by NHS Organ Donation (@nhsorgandonor)

Vanderpump's openness about his illness has inspired public support and renewed attention on organ donation. After the episode aired, the producers of “Made in Chelsea” released a statement on social media encouraging fans to register as donors.

“You may have seen in tonight's episode that Sam Vanderpump needs an organ transplant,” the post read. “Our thoughts are with Sam and his family as they face this news. We hope that his courage in speaking out will inspire others.”

A post shared by Sam Vanderpump (@samvanderpump)

The post continued, “Thousands of people are currently waiting for a life-saving transplant. If you want to be an organ donor and save lives after your death, please confirm your decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register and make sure your loved ones know.”

For now, Vanderpump is focused on staying strong for his fiancée and their unborn child. “I'm healthy now,” he said on the show. “Hopefully I'll remain that way until it's time for surgery.”

Je suis très touché par le courage de Sam Vanderpump et de sa fiancée Alice face à ce diagnostic si difficile. Leur histoire met en lumière l'importance cruciale du don d'organes. En lisant l'article, je me suis demandé comment fonctionne exactement le processus d'allocation des greffons pour les personnes en attente, surtout avec la récente baisse des dons évoquée. J'ai trouvé un article très détaillé, “UK Transplant: A Practitioner's Insight into Decreased Donor Allocation and the Waiting List for Members”, qui offre un point de vue interne fascinant sur les défis actuels. Est-ce que quelqu'un sait si ces contraintes logistiques et cette augmentation des critères de sélection, comme décrit ici https://uktransplant.org/uk-transplant-decreased-donor-allocation-waiting-list-members-insider-view, ont un impact direct sur les temps d'attente pour des maladies rares comme celle de Sam ? Cela aiderait à mieux comprendre le parcours des patients.

“Real Housewives of Potomac” alum Nneka Ihim battled Hurricane Melissa from a balcony while giving fans a wind-whipped update. 

Ihim — who is vacationing in Montego Bay — took to Instagram on Tuesday in a black Alo crop top and matching shorts as wind gusts pummeled her.

“Hey guys, I'm just doing a quick follow-up,” she shared while standing on a hotel balcony, adding that “a lot of people have been messaging me, asking me how and why am I still in Jamaica.”

Ihim went on to explain that when she “heard that the storm was coming,” she and her party “were trying to exit as soon as possible, but the country of Jamaica closed the airport.”

“So not the airline, not American Airlines, not United Airlines, not Delta. The country closed the airports two days ago,” she added as she gripped the balcony's railing.

“The skies were clear, the beach water was blue, the weather was perfect,” Ihim divulged. 

“It's been perfect for the past two days. So we still don't even know why the airport was closed because the weather was great for flying.” 

Ihim shared that the hotel and resort she'd been staying at had “been very accommodating.”

“They've done their best to take care of us and accommodate us, and they're in very good spirits,” Ihim said. 

“They're playing music, they're playing games and trying to keep us distracted from what's going on outside, but I'm not here by choice.”

Ihim — who appeared on the Bravo series during Season 8 between 2023 and 2024 — said the resort had done “their best to keep food and water available for us.”

Gripping her athletic visor as the hurricane-force winds continued, the Bravolebrity said, “The country closed the airport, so I'm hoping to leave by Thursday. Stay tuned for more updates.”

Fellow “RHOP” alum Candiace Dillard Bassett weighed in with a supportive comment. 

“Thank God the resort is being accommodating! Praying for your safe return!!!!!” she wrote. 

Others were alarmed to see Ihim standing outside in such volatile weather. “Nneka please go inside 😩😩😩” urged one follower, while another wrote, “Girl get inside!”

“Pls pack ur bags & head home🙃🥹” a third remarked, with a fourth chiming in, “Omg stay safe sis❤️.”

Prior to the storm, on Saturday, Ihim took to Instagram to share a sweet vacation photo with baby Noah, whom she welcomed with husband Dr. Ikenna Ihim in May. 

“Vacationing with my honey is my new favorite hobby ♥️” Nneka wrote alongside a beach pic of herself holding her baby while rocking a bikini.

	Late last week, some of Jamaica's most storied musicians — including former Wailers guitarist Earl “Chinna” Smith and DJ U Brown — were gathered at Anchor, a recording studio in Kingston. But their session, backing Harper Simon, Paul's son, was cut short. “The hurricane was hitting the next day and the airports were closing,” says producer Wayne Jobson, who was overseeing the work. Jobson then received a text from saxophonist Dean Fraser, who was also at the session: “This is going to be bad. We just have to wait and see. Then get busy.”


	Once it made landfall on Tuesday, Hurricane Melissa, the Category 5 storm that barreled through Jamaica, tore roofs from houses, flooded hospitals and streets, and left as much as 80 percent of the country without power. The storm impacted every aspect of life in Jamaica, including the reggae community that's been integral to its culture and reputation. And like the country itself, Jamaica's reggae circle is beginning to come to terms with the devastation wrought by a monster of a hurricane.

	











	In the two days after Melissa passed and moved on to wreak havoc in Cuba, the effects were still being felt in Jamaica. The capital city of Kingston, located on the east coast and home to much of its reggae history and legacy, wasn't hit as hard as other, western parts of the country. “We had a few cancellations and some travel disruptions, but the property has thankfully stood strong,” says Jon Baker, owner of GeeJam Studios in nearby Port Antonio, where Coldplay, Drake, and the Rolling Stones have recorded. “GeeJam was built to handle this weather.”

	According to Rohan Marley, Bob's son, the Bob Marley Museum and legendary Tuff Gong studio in Kingston were not significantly impacted by the storm. All of the Marley properties on the island, especially the museum on Hope Road, are now being used as a relief center for those in need of food and supplies. “That's what we call the meaning of hope, you know,” says Marley (who is based in Miami and wasn't in Jamaica when Melissa hit). “We don't think of that [business] side of it. We think more what we can do now and how we can mobilize and assist the best we can.”

	But other parts of the reggae community, especially in the western part of the country, weren't as fortunate. “All the studios are shut down and nobody is working,” says Jobson. “The Jamaican music business will definitely be closed for the next few weeks, as a lot of roads are blocked.” According to the producer, Music Mansion — a plush studio and compound in Montego Bay where Maxi Priest just finished cutting an album — was hit hard and is currently closed. (Rolling Stone has reached out for comment.)


	The Catherine Hall Sports Complex, a stadium in Montego Bay that hosts the annual Reggae Sumfest festival co-founded by Jimmy Cliff, is currently underwater. “In Montego Bay, the storm feels personal,” says Radhe Vaswani, a leading Jamaican marketing executive connected to the country's music scene. “The 1982 World Festival [which took place at the stadium as well] turned the city into a world stage with musical icons.”

	The storm even impacted the Jamrock Reggae Cruise, the annual festival at sea co-founded by Damian Marley, another son of Bob. This year's cruise, which featured Marley, his brother Stephen, and various other musicians, was sailing from Miami to Jamaica and had to be re-routed to Cozumel. (The Marley brothers flew back to Jamaica soon after.) “It's all devastating to everyone,” says Rohan Marley. “It's new to us. But the greatest thing is we have life. Once we have life, we can rebuild. We are creative people, and we still have our creative souls and hearts. So we just have to put that forward again, and do the building again, and do the things that are going to move us forward as a country.”


	The storm brought with it one symbolic bit of dismantling. Montego Bay is also home to “Touch Up,” a 750-foot-long mural depicting reggae legends like Marley, Cliff, Peter Tosh, Lee “Scratch” Perry, Yellowman, and Sean Paul. The mural withstood Melissa for a day before most of it collapsed. “Even though parts of the wall have fallen, it remains a testament to Jamaica's resilience,” says Vaswani, who curated the work painted by different artists. “It reminds us that no matter the storm, we will persevere.”

The deal ends UMG's involvement in the copyright infringement lawsuit it brought against the AI company with Sony and Warner last year.

	Universal Music Group (UMG) and Udio, one of the top AI music models on the market, have announced a strategic agreement, thereby ending UMG's involvement in the copyright infringement litigation it brought against Udio alongside Sony and Warner last year. A press release from UMG states that the two companies will also “collaborate on an innovative, new commercial music creation, consumption and streaming experience.”


	This deal includes a compensatory legal settlement for UMG, which sued Udio and its rival Suno with the two other major music companies in June 2024, accusing the two platforms of copyright infringement on an “almost unimaginable scale.” At the time, Suno and Udio were using UMG and the other majors' copyrighted sound recordings to train their models, which could make realistic songs at the click of a button, without a license in place. (Sony Music and Warner Music Group are still involved in the lawsuit against Udio and Suno). 


	According to the press release, this deal goes beyond just settling the lawsuit — it also provides licensing agreements for UMG's recorded music and publishing assets, creating a new revenue stream for the company and its signees. Notably, UMG's lawsuit against Udio was only focused on the apparent infringement of UMG's sound recordings, while today's agreement provides a licensing framework for not just sound recordings but songs as well. Participating UMG artists and songwriters will be rewarded for both the training process of the AI model and for its outputs, according to a source close to the deal.


	For now, Udio's existing model will remain available for users as the AI company transitions over to this new model with UMG. Any song created with Udio's existing model will be “controlled within a walled garden,” according to the release, and there are already amendments in place to make sure that all songs created with Udio are fingerprinted, filtered and more. According to a source close to the deal, users are not able to export their Udio songs now.


	The new collaborative platform will be launched in 2026, and UMG artists and songwriters can participate in it on an opt-in basis. The press release states it will be “powered by new cutting-edge generative AI technology that will be trained on authorized and licensed music. The new subscription service will transform the user engagement experience, creating a licensed and protected environment to customize, stream and share music responsibly, on the Udio platform.” The source close to the deal adds that users will not be able to export works made within Udio's forthcoming platform. Instead, users can enjoy their creations within the service, which will be geared towards fans. Some capabilities are said to include mashups, remixes and tempo changes to existing, licensed works as well as voice swapping with UMG artists' voices who have chosen to make their vocals available to users.


	This marks UMG's latest collaboration with an AI music company and is certainly its biggest announcement on that front to date. In the past few years, UMG has struck deals with “responsible” AI music companies, as the company often calls them, including KLAY, SoundLabs and Pro-Rada. More deals between UMG and AI companies are expected to arrive in the coming days.


	“We couldn't be more thrilled about this collaboration and the opportunity to work alongside UMG to redefine how AI empowers artists and fans,” said Andrew Sanchez, co-founder & CEO of Udio, in a statement. “This moment brings to life everything we've been building toward — uniting AI and the music industry in a way that truly champions artists. Together, we're building the technological and business landscape that will fundamentally expand what's possible in music creation and engagement.”


Lucian Grainge, chairman and CEO of UMG, said, “These new agreements with Udio demonstrate our commitment to do what's right by our artists and songwriters, whether that means embracing new technologies, developing new business models, diversifying revenue streams or beyond.  We look forward to working with Andrew who shares our belief that together, we can foster a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans.”

Watching the current White House and its various lackeys/minions/catspaws attempt to wrestle with “memes,” as an artistic format, has been a little bit like watching a dog try to aim and fire a machine gun: Bizarre, darkly amusing in a sick sort of way, and ultimately likely to end in tragedy. We've been tracking, for instance, the Trump administration's recent embrace of Halo—truly, the hottest gaming property of 2005—in its latest stab at convincing the nation's gym teachers and gym teacher-minded folk that working for ICE would be a cool thing to do. Now, the Department Of Homeland Security's efforts to screenshot-post its way to popularity have spread to encompass The Lord Of The Rings, too, posting an online recruitment ad pulled from Peter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers.

Now, we have to take a second and acknowledge here that the political and philosophical battlefields surrounding J.R.R. Tolkien and Lord Of The Rings are insanely complicated. (And have only been muddied further by Jackson's films, which simplify some of Tolkien's more nuanced ideas about morality by doing things like excising one of his most important chapters in favor of more time spent on big, setpiece battles between good and evil.) Whole books have been written about how Tolkien's Catholic conservatism, his contempt for bullies, his “guy born in 1892” takes on race, his overall disdain for any of the trappings of modernity, etc., add up to a fantasy universe that both the left-wing and the right-wing have seen themselves in, and tried to take exuberant grip of, over the years. (For instance: Both Peter Thiel and J.D. Vance are massive Tolkien fans, and have both “honored” the Professor by naming tech and investment companies—which he likely would have loathed to the very core of his being—after words he invented.) None of which makes it any less gross to see poor Dominic Monaghan get his face plastered on a virtual ICE recruitment poster trying to sell the idea that America is some idyllic Shire, in desperate need of protection via an army of masked goons who live in mortal fear of inflatable frogs.

Of course, the irritation is, presumably, part of the point: Laying claim to fictional heroes who can't do inconvenient things like tell ICE to go fuck itself when it invokes them is an easy way to both annoy people who are pretty sure Merry and Pippin would look at the various bullies and cowards currently populating the administration for like five seconds before telling them to go kick rocks, and to convey some clout into the minds of those who are convinced that fielding an army of masked thugs dragging people out of their homes makes themselves “the good guys” in this looming “great battle of our time” that they're all apparently obsessed with. DHS media reps have previously stated that the new ads are a deliberate pivot to trying to target the things that Vance was really into when he was like 16, specifically, saying, “We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, Lord of the Rings, or any other medium.”

She appeared in films as a child with her mom before becoming a great star for CBS in the early days of television.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Maria Riva, the only child of Marlene Dietrich who as a rare contract player with CBS was one of the top television personalities in the medium's early days of live, kinescope broadcasts, died Wednesday. She was 100.


	Riva died in her sleep at the home of son Peter Riva in Gila, New Mexico, he told The Hollywood Reporter. She had been living with him since early last year.




	William S. Paley's favorite actress, Riva starred, often as a woman in peril, on such classic anthology series as Studio One, Lux Video Theatre, Suspense and The Philco Television Playhouse and on shows including Danger, Crime Photographer and Climax!

	She quit acting in the late 1950s — she often described herself as a “Poor Man's Dietrich” and admitted she never had a burning ambition to be an actress — but managed her mother's glitzy one-woman Las Vegas act and global tours for many years.


	A few months after Dietrich died in Paris in May 1992 at age 90, Riva published a book about her glamorous movie-star mother. “I consider myself a biographer, not the daughter,” she said in a 2009 chat for the Television Academy Foundation website The Interviews.


	“I'm very proud of the fact I was able to step back as a biographer … what was wrong was wrong, what was right was right, what was great was great, what was brilliant was brilliant. [People] don't understand how it is possible to be a child of an ephemeral creature that is beyond normalcy. It's very difficult.”


	The only child of Dietrich and Rudolf Sieber, an editor and assistant director who later was put in charge of translating films for Paramount in Paris, Maria Elisabeth Sieber was born in Berlin on Dec. 13, 1924.

	











	“But I never thought that was my name, because being the child of a very famous person, I was always ‘Maria, the Daughter of Marlene Dietrich,'” she said. “I actually signed it that way when I was a child.”When she was 5, she “was imported” to Los Angeles to live with her mother, by then a huge star at Paramount Pictures.


	­­Riva played Catherine the Great as a child — Dietrich portrayed the Russian monarch as an adult — in Josef von Sternberg's The Scarlet Empress (1934), then appeared in another film starring her mom, David O. Selznick's The Garden of Allah (1936), an early Technicolor release.


	Later, she was raped repeatedly by a woman who was the secretary of one of her mother's lovers, she said.


	Riva attended the Brillantmont International School in Switzerland and studied acting as a teenager at the Max Reinhardt Academy in Los Angeles at Wilshire & Fairfax, where the Academy Museum is now.


	She then taught and directed there — her students included Elizabeth Taylor's brother, Howard — acted on the radio with Orson Welles' Mercury Theater and appeared on Broadway with Tallulah Bankhead in Foolish Notion in 1945.


	After a brief first marriage and performing in Germany and Italy for two years as part of a USO troupe, she taught a graduate course in acting and directing at Fordham University and married scenic designer William Riva in 1947, while Dietrich was away in Europe.


	When she complained to him about what she was seeing on television, he said to her: “'I'm so tired hearing you criticize this new profession. Why don't you go and do something to make it better?' And that's why I went into television.”


	She made her first TV appearance in 1951 on the anthology series Sure as Fate before signing a three-year contract for $250 a week with CBS, which sought to create a movie-style studio system. She acted often alongside John Forsythe and appeared on hundreds of TV episodes.

	











	“There was a saying: You played to Mrs. Glutz in the Bronx,” she said. “People who knew nothing about acting, about the profession, would now get [their entertainment] for free in their home, and they should be glad to get whatever they got. So you played to a very low standard. Which was fine, because I had no talent.”


	Still, she received Emmy nominations as best actress in 1952 and 1953, appeared in a “mirror-image” photograph with her mother on the cover of Life magazine in August 1952 and later turned down an opportunity to replace an ailing Imogene Coca on NBC's Your Show of Shows.


	Riva also did TV commercials for Alcoa in which she would demonstrate how to use the company's new product — that would be aluminum foil — and was paired with famed product pitchwoman Betty Furness when CBS tested color television for the first time.


	At the height of her career as the TV industry moved west, she quit, not wanting to return to Los Angeles. “I had grown up in a world where everybody was beautiful, everybody was rich, everybody had everything that everybody else in the world wants, and nobody was really happy. And I learned a very valuable lesson, that it's not what it looks like on the surface.”


	She did tour in stage productions of Tea & Sympathy and Country Girl and noted that, “outside of Jackie Gleason and the great comedians, I was probably the first person that drew people as a television personality into another media.”

	











	Riva returned to acting to play Mrs. Rhinelander — the wife of Robert Mitchum's character, Bill Murray's boss — in Scrooged (1988), directed by Richard Donner. Her first-born son, the late J. Michael Riva, was the film's production designer, and another son, John-Paul Riva, was a production assistant in the art department.


	She acted again in All Aboard (2018), a short film directed by grandson J. Michael Riva Jr.


	Riva also co-authored a 2001 photography book with previously unseen images of her mother, edited a 2005 volume of Dietrich's poetry and wrote a 2017 period novel, You Were There Before My Eyes, about a woman who emigrates from Italy to Detroit.


	After Dietrich's death from liver failure, she sold much of her mom's estate to Berlin to be housed in the city's Deutsche Kinemathek museum.


	She and William Riva remained together until his death in 1999.


	In addition to her sons Peter and John-Paul, survivors include another son, David; grandchildren Matthew, Sean, Samantha, William, Michael Jr., Adam and Daniel; and great-grandchildren, Lily, Ayla, Aidan and Marilee.


	A timeless icon of style, Dietrich received an Oscar nomination for her turn opposite Gary Cooper in Morocco (1930) and starred in such films as Blonde Venus (1932), The Devil Is a Woman (1935), Touch of Evil (1958) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961).


	Dietrich and Sieber, who died in 1976, never divorced, even though they lived together for only a few years. Meanwhile, she reportedly had sex with the likes of Cooper, John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher, James Stewart, Jean Gabin and Yul Brynner. And that was just the men.

	











	While promoting her book about Dietrich, Riva told Diane Sawyer that her mom had this idea for her own funeral: “All the men who walk into the church, and women, who had slept with her would get a red carnation, and all the people who said they had slept with her but hadn't would get a white carnation.”

The existence of 'unidentified aerial phenomena' (UAP) has long been dismissed as science fiction, but explosive claims from a government insider have reignited the debate.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a key voice in Washington on intelligence matters, is now facing mounting pressure to launch a thorough investigation into secretive government projects following whistleblower testimony about covert UAP retrieval operations.

Acting National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Marco Rubio faces growing demands to investigate the secretive US activities allegedly linked to unidentified flying objects. This scrutiny is fueled by remarks he previously made that highlighted the fear of retribution among intelligence officials who act as informants.

The pressure on Rubio escalated significantly after the advocacy group Disclosure Party (@disclosureorg) shared an old clip of a NewsNation interview. In the clip, they pressed Rubio to leverage his new authority to 'ensure whistleblowers are protected' and 'expose any covert UFO programs operating outside lawful oversight'.

In the clip, first shown on NewsNation, Rubio is seen discussing several whistleblowers who allege they have direct knowledge of top-secret government initiatives related to unidentified aerial phenomena.

Marco Rubio previously said that multiple whistleblowers had shared information with him about highly classified UFO programs and were afraid for their safety, fearing retaliation or harm from within the U.S. military and intelligence community. Now that he's the Acting National… https://t.co/BiQUkjfLRK pic.twitter.com/niqgQRLozo

Rubio confirmed receiving sensitive information from various individuals who reached out to the Senate Intelligence Committee during his time as its chair. 'We say there are people that have come forward to share information with our committee over the last couple of years', Rubio said.

'A lot of these people came to us even before these protections were in the law for whistleblowers to come forward.' Citing the apprehension felt by the sources who approached him, Rubio explained that he had to be cautious when speaking publicly about their claims.

He remarked, 'Some of these people still work in the government and frankly a lot of them are very fearful — fearful of their jobs, fearful of their clearances, fearful of their career, and some frankly are fearful of harm coming to them'.

The video clip received fresh scrutiny because the X post's caption pressed Rubio to act decisively, given his current occupancy of two of the highest positions in the US national security.

The post stated, 'He bears a direct responsibility to investigate these allegations, ensure whistleblowers are protected, and expose any covert UFO programs operating outside lawful oversight', the post read. 'The American people are counting on you, @SecRubio.'

On the question of whether he believed the whistleblowers' testimonies, Rubio stated he would not prejudge the information, although he acknowledged the professional standing of the individuals. He explained, 'I don't find them either not credible or credible because we have no basis to understand'.

'I will say, I find most of these people at some point or maybe even currently have held very high clearances in high positions within our government...', he stated. He then posed the question, 'So you do ask yourself, what incentive would so many people with that kind of qualification have to come forward and make something up?'

Rubio's comments reflect a persistent issue in American conversations concerning UAP, the conflict between national security confidentiality and the public's right to information.

Furthermore, Rubio's admission that numerous whistleblowers have emerged, some allegedly fearing retribution, has increased demands for more robust protections for informants across the intelligence and defence communities.

These newly surfaced remarks from Rubio are consistent with earlier statements he made this year concerning the upcoming UFO Revolution documentary. Specifically, in an interview quoted by Entertainment Weekly, Rubio shared that unidentified objects were spotted hovering over American' restricted nuclear facilities'.

He emphasised that the incidents were 'not isolated' and warranted intensive scrutiny from both the government and the scientific world.

The earlier remarks give context to the ongoing campaign urging Rubio to take charge of investigations into alleged clandestine programs. Because he previously championed 'serious inquiry, not sensationalism', many now regard his expanded authority as essential for bringing the truth to light.

Advocates for transparency regarding UAPs contend that Rubio's dual appointment grants him the necessary power and responsibility to ensure accountability. This viral X post, along with corroborating testimony from former intelligence personnel like David Grusch, has fueled renewed speculation about whether specific parts of the US defence sector have managed UFO programs outside of proper legal scrutiny.

Rubio has remained silent regarding the surge of public pressure. However, as online demands for transparency escalate, his prior comments reveal that he recognises the careful necessity of balancing the protection of classified data with the need to shield those who expose potential government wrongdoing.

All eyes are on Marco Rubio, a central figure in national security, and whether he will move past mere acknowledgement to spearhead a formal inquiry into the explosive allegations that have captivated the legislative branch and the American people.

Immediately after stepping inside the Montvale Hotel's room 310, Jennifer Von Behren said she sensed a female spirit . Fellow paranormal researcher Kika Morelan took out a vintage audio recorder that's no longer in production and routinely sells on eBay for over $1,000. 

Morelan said this Panasonic DR60 can pick up the voices of spirits. 

“We are in Montvale room 310. My name is Kika. If there is someone here with us, can you please say hello?” Morelan said while recording, pausing a beat before continuing. “Can you give us your name?”

Ghosts are all over the place, the local ghost hunters said during an outing with The Spokesman-Review, and downtown Spokane is no exception.

Founded by  Morelan two decades ago, the Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group can get as many as five calls a day come October – their busy season. Morelan, 63, estimates she has conducted at least 200 investigations .

She moved to Washington from Finland when she was in her 20s. A retired electrical business co-owner, she treats her ghost hunting as a full-time job. The Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group has an official business license and general liability insurance.

 Von Behren, 48, is not officially part of the Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group, but she has accompanied Morelan and the other three members on investigations when she can for the past 10 years. Von Behren claims to be a medium, able to see and communicate with ghosts, and Morelan uses devices sensitive to electromagnetic fields to attempt communication herself – though the tools are not always completely accurate, she said.

“She's a medium, and she's always been a medium,” Morelan said of Von Behren. “I research. We  are paranormal researchers who investigate anything mysterious, paranormal, unnatural thing using equipment, since we're not psychics.”

Being a medium is like taking the five senses and “kicking them up a notch,” Von Behren said. A Coeur d'Alene mother to three boys, she described herself as a “serial entrepreneur,” having owned shops, selling “telepathy decks” of cards and hosting one-on-one “spirit readings” professionally. She said she can tell how many ghosts are in a building just from seeing a picture of it.

“Yeah, so, real people that really do this stuff, most of us want to help people, and then this is like a fun side thing,” Von Behren said about touring “haunted” locations. “And it does help people, too… because then they understand why things are going bump in the night. Is it a good entity? Is it something that needs to go away? So that's what we do.”

A lot of times, the calls Morelan gets are people who just need a listening ear.

“Most of the calls we get are people that have issues with the paranormal and they have nobody else to talk to, because everyone is going to think they're crazy,” she said. “So we listen a lot of times. They just need somebody to listen – and, we can handle things over the phone with the distant readings.”

Trying to convince people that ghosts exist isn't on the priority list for the pair.

“We're not here to convert anybody. You believe or you don't – we don't care one way or the other,” Morelan said. “We're just researchers.”

That didn't stop them from getting giddy about a walkthrough of one of Downtown Spokane's iconic hotels – The Montvale.

Built in 1899 by Spokane Judge John W. Binkley, The Montvale functioned as an apartment building, a brothel and a youth hostel until Expo ‘74 before shutting down for 30 years. Under developer Rob Brewster, the hotel reopened in 2005, and today, the ground floor is occupied by pubs and cafes while the upper two floors are hotel rooms.

Room 310 was the first stop, picked by Montvale manager Zachary Neighbors because of complaints from guests.

There was no clear response after Moreland started recording , but Von Behren said the ghost was answering the questions.

Morelan unloaded her backpack of other ghost detection tools – an electromagnetic field detecting call bell, music box, light and two flashlights, unscrewed just far enough to turn off but be turned back on by the slightest touch.

“Is your name Katie? Ring the bell for yes. Or Caitlin?” Von Behren asked.

The bell, across the room from them, rang. 

Von Behren “translated” that the ghost “Caitlin” had been killed in the street outside The Montvale around 60 years ago. It is not immediately apparent whether a woman named Caitlin was actually killed in the streets in front of the hotel. Von Behren said that the ghost likes to “mess with the T.V.” and make things move to “freak people out” in room 310, along with the room next to it. The bell rang intermittently as she spoke. 

Somebody has died in the room in the last two years, Zachary Neighbors said, and guests in the room have complained about the lights turning on by themselves in the past. 

In room 203, Von Behren and Morelan repeated the procedure. Von Behren said that this room was haunted as well, a male ghost reporting that he had died of a heart attack. A handheld electromagnetic field detector spiked once or twice, and the field detecting light changed colors. Neighbors said he didn't know if anybody had died in the room.

The Montvale basement is largely used for storage. There is an old shower room, bathroom and remnants of an underground pool. There is also a dimly lit corner, home to dozens of pipes and a standalone chair, never moved by Neighbors because “I feel like it is somebody's.”

Sure enough, Von Behren said there were two men around the chair. Morelan set up her equipment, and the flashlights flickered on and off as Von Behren said that the ghosts were drinking buddies in life. One seemed to be a smuggler from the prohibition era, she said, the other a flirty bartender.

There are rumors that alcohol was smuggled through underground tunnels in Spokane during the prohibition, though historian John Fahey told the Inlander over 20 years ago that while there were utility tunnels under downtown buildings, it is unlikely they were used for transporting alcohol. 

Von Behren toyed with the idea of coming back with a bottle of booze and pack of cigars for the ghosts before leaving.

Morelan and Von Behren found a fourth ghost in a dark stairwell in the basement as well, one that Von Behren said touched her hair. Neighbors also said that he has experienced the sensation of cobwebs on his head in the stairwell before, only to find that there is nothing there. This ghost was skittish, and Von Behren said it wouldn't play with the toys. Neighbors led the group back to the hotel lobby.

The Historic Davenport hotel has long been regarded one of the must-visit haunted locations in Spokane for paranormal enthusiasts. Von Behren herself said that she has seen several ghosts in the hotel, which opened in 1914. Like The Montvale, The Davenport also had a period of abandonment, theirs spanning from 1985 to 2000.

“This is where I met Bing Crosby,” Von Behren said, standing outside the Davenport's Marie Antoinette Ballroom. It was his ghost she met, of course, along with Al Capone's.

 Crosby grew up in Spokane and began his professional music career partially in what is now the Bing Crosby Theater in 1925, but he also played with his band “The Musicaladers” at the hotel early on. 

 Capone's brother Frank Capone visited Spokane in 1936, the Spokane Chronicle reported. It is unclear whether Al Capone himself ever visited the city.

The Davenport's lobby was too busy for Von Behren and Morelan to search for ghosts, and while they sensed a spirit in the Hall of the Doges Foyer on the second floor, they said it was quiet.

There have been a handful of high-profile deaths at The Davenport Hotel, the most famous arguably the 1920 crash through the ceiling of Ellen McNamara. A 68-year-old visiting from New York City, McNamara mistakenly wandered onto the glass skylight over the hotel lobby, the Spokesman-Review detailed in 2005. 

“..While McNamara did medically expire in The Davenport, some at the hotel swear she never fully left the building,” the article states.

An employee at the hotel, Archie Gonia, 25, was also murdered on site in 1973, left beaten and strangled on floor 12.

The history behind the “haunted” locations she visits and the ghosts she meets is a big part of the passion behind ghost hunting for Von Behren.

“History is fascinating,” she said. “So you get to see the history of the buildings, you get to see cool things like basements.”

Built in 1890 for the Spokane Falls Review, the Spokesman-Review Tower is older than The Montvale and The Davenport. While many believers in the paranormal might agree that old buildings tend to house a spirit or two, as far as recent memory serves, ghost hunters have never toured the tower.

Two ghosts were in the basement of the building, standing among archived newspapers and files, according to Von Behren. When Von Behren entered the storage room, she said that it felt like water had been there before.

The basement of the Review Tower has flooded multiple times, damaging newspapers and causing mold growth. 

Flashlights set up by Morelan flashed a few times, and the music box played briefly, though the electromagnetic field devices could be impacted by the basement's pipes, she said.

Tenants live in some spaces of the building, and walking through the residential staircase, Von Behren said that there were two ghosts. One, an agitated drunk man slumped in a corner, and another, a man who had been shot in the head. Morelan tried the audio recording device in the corner with the drunk ghost, her voice echoing in the empty stairwell, and for the first time of the tour the player picked up a very audible but garbled noise following her questions. Von Behren wasn't able to find the ghost who was shot. 

At the very top of the Review Tower, Morelan laid out her sensors. Von Behren said that there was a teacher visiting, the wife of a former employee.

“She's so cute,” Von Behren said. “She's, like, sitting on the floor trying to play with everything, and she says, ‘This is fascinating.'”

Downtown Spokane is a hotspot for ghosts who like to party, Von Behren said. She said that the teacher in the tower was one  such party animal. Ghosts are everywhere, though, she and Morelan said.

Morelan doesn't like big groups. She says that they distract from the paranormal activity, and so the Spokane Paranormal Investigation Group is not welcoming new members. Anyone interested in ghost hunting can get started on their own, though, Morelan said. 

“You can read books. You can watch stuff online. They'll teach you how to use equipment, how to investigate and all that,” she said. “You should always go with somebody.”

Von Behren said that she will lead public investigations because she knows “how to protect the entire group.” Spirits can be dangerous, after all.

“So sometimes when you go to do a ghost investigation,” she said, “you don't want to go in somewhere and take somebody home with you.”
