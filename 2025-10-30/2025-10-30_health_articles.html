                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By evaluating 25 patient samples, the researchers identified overexpression of TROP2 and several other cell-surface proteins in RMC, as well as upregulation of the Hippo pathway. These findings led to the exploration of sacituzumab govitecan, a TROP2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. In a small cohort of four heavily pretreated RMC patients, sacituzumab govitecan resulted in one partial response and two patients with stable disease, with a median progression-free survival of 2.9 months. Identifying TROP2 as a therapeutic target in renal medullary carcinoma marks a pivotal step toward precision treatment for one of the most aggressive and underserved cancers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Merck, a leading science and technology company, has entered into a partnership with Promega Corporation, a global life science solutions and service leader based in Madison, Wisconsin in the US, to co-develop novel technologies that advance drug screening and discovery. The agreement unites Merck's strength in organoids and synthetic chemistry with Promega's market leading assay and reporter technologies. Together, the companies aim to develop assays capable of tracking cellular activity in real time using an innovative reporter system within three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures. These 3D cell cultures, also called organoids, mimic the human biology, where testing can be done in a model that is physiologically more relevant than traditional two-dimensional (2D) models. This partnership with Promega shows what is possible when two companies with a shared commitment to science join forces. By combining our organoid expertise with Promega's advanced reporter technology, we aim to enable high throughput screening that helps researchers identify safer and more effective drug candidates for complex diseases such as cancer - and do it faster than ever before.” “Collaborating with Merck allows us to push the boundaries of drug discovery,” said Tom Livelli, VP, Life Sciences Products & Services at Promega Corporation. “By combining our technological strengths, we are helping to create more relevant and accessible models for drug discovery, with the goal of enabling new insights and eventually better outcomes for patients.” In addition to the primary co-development agreement, Merck and Promega have signed a separate agreement to explore the integration of Merck's Duolink® with Promega's HiBiT technologies. This aims to create new workflows for studying the protein interactions inside cells, providing researchers with deeper insights into cellular signalling and supporting applications in both biologics and small molecule drug discovery. The partnership with Promega is one of the latest steps that Merck is taking to strengthen its leadership in next-generation biology and uniting complementary expertise to deliver the next wave of breakthroughs in drug discovery. In December 2024, Merck acquired HUB Organoids B.V., a pioneer in organoid technology, which expanded Merck's capabilities in 3D cell culture and enhanced its portfolio with HUB's foundational patents, advanced model generation, and high-throughput screening services. These strategic moves position Merck as a leader in providing researchers with the tools needed to bridge the gap between laboratory discoveries and clinical success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, in collaboration with researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine, have made a breakthrough in understanding why many cancer patients develop nerve damage after chemotherapy. Their new study reveals that a stress response inside certain immune cells can trigger this debilitating side effect. The study was published online today in Science Translational Medicine. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common and often severe side effect of cancer treatment, especially with drugs like paclitaxel. Up to half of all patients receiving chemotherapy may experience this condition, but until now, the exact cause has remained a mystery. To better understand this nerve toxicity that could be painful, scientists used a well-established mouse model that closely reflects the nerve problems experienced by people undergoing cancer treatment. The patients were receiving chemotherapy for gynecological cancers, collecting blood samples before and after treatment to measure IRE1α activity in their immune cells. Our research shows that a stress response inside immune cells is a key contributor to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy that could be painful and debilitating. By targeting this pathway, we may be able to protect patients from one of the most challenging side effects of cancer treatment." "Our study opens the opportunity to further explore if this pathway could be used to predict what patients will develop this condition and therefore could help clinicians implement patient-tailored treatments," Romero-Sandoval said. The discovery could lead to new drugs that block this pathway, helping patients stay on their cancer treatment without suffering from painful side effects. According to Romero-Sandoval, who is a member of the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, this is the first study to show that the IRE1α stress sensor in immune cells is directly linked to nerve damage from chemotherapy. The team plans to conduct larger clinical studies to confirm these findings and test whether the IRE1α pathway could be used as a biomarker for disease progression and if drugs that block this stress sensor can safely prevent or reduce nerve damage in cancer patients. They also hope to explore whether this approach could help with other types of nerve pain. Interestingly, an IRE1a inhibitor is currently in clinical trials to improve anti-cancer effects of chemotherapy, including paclitaxel. Additional support came from the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center. Leukocyte-intrinsic ER stress responses contribute to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Military veterans who develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury may have a higher mortality rate in the following years than veterans who develop epilepsy with no previous traumatic brain injury, according to a study published on October 29, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. While these findings need to be validated in future studies, we recommend that people who develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury are closely monitored, and, especially if seizures do not respond well to treatment, are prioritized for surgery or changing to new medications without delay." Of those, 28,832 people had experienced a traumatic brain injury within the five years before their epilepsy diagnosis. The remaining 181,350 people had no traumatic brain injury within five years before their diagnosis. They were an average of 61 years old at diagnosis. The participants were followed for an average of six years. Once researchers accounted for how long each person spent as part of the study and adjusted for other factors that could affect the mortality rate, they found that overall people with post-traumatic brain injury epilepsy were 2% more likely to die during the study than those with epilepsy without traumatic brain injury. Those with skull or facial fractures had an 18% higher risk of death during the study period; those with diffuse brain injury had a 17% higher risk; and those with localized brain injury had a 16% higher risk. In contrast, people whose traumatic brain injury was from a concussion had a lower mortality rate than the rate for people with epilepsy with no traumatic brain injury. Haneef said several possibilities could explain this finding. Some causes of non-traumatic brain injury epilepsy that served as the comparison group, such as stroke, infections, or tumors, have high mortality rates. "It's also possible that when people develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury, they receive earlier treatment and may have more access to care and better outcomes than people who have not had a traumatic brain injury," Haneef said. The researchers also found that people with extracerebral traumatic brain injury who developed epilepsy at a young age-or when they were in the 18-39 age range-were twice as likely to die during the study as young adults with epilepsy but no brain injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Labman is revolutionizing accuracy, scalability, and efficiency in cancer research by integrating robotics and AI for precision image analysis. In Vivan Therapeutics' laboratory, scientists were spending hours manually analyzing fly pupae - tiny organisms that hold critical data for cancer drug testing. To address this challenge, Labman engineered a sophisticated custom automation platform by integrating advanced robotics with precision imaging. The system manages vials of fly pupae, ensuring precise positioning for accurate image capture. The novel system analyzes large volumes of pupae with precision and consistency, allowing researchers to dedicate more time to strategic tasks. This innovation has revolutionized Vivan's ability to scale its operations while preserving the accuracy and reliability essential to life-saving study. The technology demonstrated a 98 % accuracy rate in classifying and counting fly pupae, saving 4.5 days of manual counting per patient. Vivan Therapeutics is a pioneer in cancer treatment innovation through its novel approach to personalized medicine. By using genetically modified fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to model human cancer mutations, Vivan tests thousands of drug combinations to identify the most effective therapies for individual patients. Vivan Therapeutics offers two main products: the Personal Discovery Process (PDP) and Tumatch software. Both systems aim to develop highly individualized cancer treatments tailored to the genetic makeup of each patient's tumor. The Personal Discovery Process (PDP) revolutionizes cancer treatment by carrying out highly targeted research tailored to individual patients. By replicating the genetic intricacies of a patient's tumor into a population of 500,000 fruit fly ‘avatars', as many as 2,000 FDA and NICE-approved drugs can be tested, including those not traditionally prescribed for cancer treatment. Through analysis of large datasets of tumor genetics, primarily focused on colorectal cancer, Vivan has identified around 400 genetic signatures representing real-world tumor configurations. Notably, approximately 130 of these signatures account for almost 80% of patient cases, enabling efficient modeling for personalized therapies. While this novel approach holds tremendous potential for customized cancer treatments, the work depends on analyzing hundreds of thousands of fly pupae, a necessary but demanding manual task requiring precision and consistency. There were only three of us working on this at the beginning, and it was incredibly time-consuming. We had to manually count and score pupae, entering data into individual Excel sheets. We thought, there must be a better way. Andrea Chai, PhD, VP Compliance & Lab Automation, Vivan Therapeutics Vivan partnered with Labman to design an automation system that ensures the accuracy and scalability required for Vivan's cutting-edge research. By examining genetic variations in fruit flies, Vivan uncovers crucial insights into how different patients respond to therapies. This work aims to ensure that cancer treatments are more effective and tailored to each patient's individual needs. So, you can treat the fly with the same drug that we take and they're going to respond. Nahuel Villegas, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Vivan Therapeutics While Labman's platform automated the image capture of vials, Vivan Therapeutics required a solution to replace its labor-intensive, unmanageable manual counting and analysis processes. Its flagship product, Darwin, is an AI training and data labeling platform that allows the development of machine learning models for tasks requiring image analysis. Working in collaboration with V7, Andrea leveraged their Darwin platform to train an AI model capable of classifying and counting pupae with exceptional accuracy. Utilizing high-resolution images captured by Labman's system, the model accurately categorizes pupae, removing the need for manual analysis and delivering actionable data with over 98 % accuracy. We trained the model with around 1,000 images initially, achieving an accuracy rate in the high 80s to 90s, so we thought, OK, we could go to the full project. Andrea Chai, PhD, VP Compliance & Lab Automation, Vivan Therapeutics The system guarantees each vial is positioned exactly in the same position every time to reduce error risk. Automation has enabled Vivan to expand its operations, handling larger patient screens without additional human resources. Andrea estimates that the system saved roughly 4.5 workdays per patient, a substantial gain for a process that previously required months of manual screening. This partnership demonstrates how technological innovation accelerates research, bringing the medical world closer to personalized, life-saving treatments. Andrea Chai, PhD, VP Compliance & Lab Automation, Vivan Therapeutics Investors have the opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking enterprise at the forefront of cancer research. As Vivan continues to grow, the company is actively seeking partners that share its vision of improving patient outcomes on a global scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A company used Labman's expertise in developing custom projects to develop an innovative solution that was urgently required. Sampled, a large biorepository and human diagnostics R&D company with operations in Piscataway, New Jersey, and Glasgow, UK, faced a significant challenge during the global COVID-19 pandemic: the need to efficiently process an extremely high volume of incoming saliva samples to satisfy the situation's demands. To address this, Sampled collaborated with Labman Automation for a cutting-edge solution. Labman designed, constructed, and commissioned an automated system to streamline the processing of saliva samples in Spectrum saliva tubes, enabling increased throughput while minimizing the need for manual handling. Not only that, but the design, build and testing phase of the project was delivered within a record timeframe of only six weeks. Chris Piccirillo, Director of Automation, stated, “We physically received thousands of saliva tubes each day and had to individually register and accession every tube, sometimes close to 100,000 a day by hand.” The process of decapping samples, scanning barcodes, and configuring the tubes for additional processing was highly laborious and prone to human error. As the COVID-19 caseload surged, Sampled required an advanced and efficient solution to manage this immense volume of samples. To handle these difficulties, Labman proposed a highly tailored automation system. Its functionality included tube decapping, barcode scanning, and a unique resealing mechanism. A distinctive property was an automated tube-sorting mechanism that maintained the correct sample order after their processing through the system, preventing costly mix-ups. “All of the features Labman created on the system were really well made”, said Chris. With reliability and uptime being priorities for such an operation, Labman's high-quality in-house engineering proved indispensable. Although Spectrum saliva tubes offer a user-friendly and safe technique for COVID testing, they tend to seal shut due to the effects of the neutralizing agent released when the cap is screwed on. Labman's system addressed this challenge through the use of in-house-produced gripper fingers and a unique profile specifically developed to efficiently decap these tightly sealed Spectrum tubes, saving the hands of hundreds of workers. The adoption of Labman's automated system had a direct impact on Sampled's operations, allowing the company to increase sample processing throughput by as many as 20,000 samples a day. With the new technology, 250 fewer staff were required, substantially reducing overhead costs and boosting efficiency by reducing the acute RSI issues associated with undoing the tubes. This also decreased the risk of human interaction with COVID-19. One thing I've always been focused on in my career is building relationships [...] I just think that you guys do a tremendous job at that. Labman is committed to building long-term relationships with its customers. All of my staff here in the robotics team and the lab staff love working with the Labman team - you guys do a tremendous job at building and maintaining those connections,” said Chris. The relationship between Sampled and Labman extended beyond technical implementation, fostering a sense of reliability and trust. Sampled's partnership with Labman represents an extraordinary success story. Labman's bespoke automation solution transformed the laboratory's efficiency, delivering a substantial return on investment while establishing a warm and enduring client relationship. Labman's dedication to solving specific challenges through innovation and delivering dependable support has positioned the company as an important partner for Sampled, a testament to Labman's ongoing commitment to customer success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If untreated, a disorder of high brain pressure called idiopathic intracranial hypertension can lead to vision loss. But this disorder can develop without noticeable symptoms, making it hard to catch. A new study looks at how these vision problems develop and proposes a way to predict who will develop issues. The number of cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been increasing, and it mainly affects young women, so we need more information about who is more likely to develop vision problems and how that process works." It may cause chronic, disabling headaches, vision problems, and in rare cases, permanent vision loss. A total of 69% had scotomas, which are blind spots in their vision that can be temporary or permanent. None of the participants developed blindness. Researchers found two mechanisms that led to vision problems. In one group, higher degrees of papilledema were associated with increased thinning of the optic nerve fiber layer in the retina, causing scotoma in their peripheral visual fields. This resulted in reduced visual acuity that did not resolve after treatment. The researchers also developed an assessment to help physicians predict at the time of diagnosis with intracranial hypertension who might later develop vision problems. "This score needs to be validated by external groups before it can be considered ready for use, but we identified the severity of papilledema and the disorganization of the inner layer of the retina as major predictors for who will have persistent vision problems," Beier said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers estimate that about 196 million people around the world live with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) — an eye disease that causes vision loss in mostly people over the age of 50. Now, a new study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows how a wireless retinal implant may help restore central vision in people with geographic atrophy. For this study, researchers recruited 38 people with geographic atrophy to receive the new PRIMA implant, which had been developed by Daniel Palanker, PhD, a professor of ophthalmology at Stanford University. The retinal implant is photovoltaic, which means it uses natural light to power itself. For this study, researchers recruited 38 study participants over the age of 60 from 17 medical sites across five European countries, all who had geographic atrophy due to AMD, and vision worse than 20/320 in at least one of their eyes. Study participants underwent a medical procedure to have the PRIMA implant placed in one eye. On average, participants regained the ability to see another five lines on the standard eye chart, with one improving by 12 lines. “More than 80% of the patients were able to read letters and words, and some of them are reading pages in a book. I don't think we'll ever be able to restore full 20/20 vision with the implant alone, but we are investigating tricks that could further improve people's quality of life and take them above the threshold for legal blindness. One of the main requests we hear from patients is to be able to recognize faces and emotions again, and that's something we're working toward,” he said. Medical News Today had the opportunity to speak with Benjamin Bert, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study, who commented it is great to have new technologies being developed to help treat vision loss. MNT also spoke with Jonathan Gloth, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist and fellowship trained vitreoretinal surgeon at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Ocean University Medical Center in New Jersey, who found this to be a promising study for patients with geographic atrophy. “Though the initial sample size is small (38 patients) in the recently published article, 80% of patients achieved clinically significant visual improvement,” Gloth said. “This retinal implant is placed in a better location, the subretinal space, which affords these patients higher resolution and better visual acuity than previously studied prosthetic retinal implants.” “It is imperative that we find ways to improve vision in patients with geographic atrophy as it affects over a million people in the United States and 8 million people worldwide. “This study will have to be reproduced at a larger scale to further assess the safety of the device,” Gloth added. “81% of patients in this study suffered serious adverse effects. As retina specialists become more familiar with the surgical implantation technique, I expect this compaction rate to decline.” As part of our series addressing medical myths, we turn our attention to the many myths that surround the "inevitable" decline associated with aging. According to a recent study, when ophthalmic conditions occur alongside systemic ones, such as diabetes and obesity, this increases the risk of…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even when blood pressure is well controlled, older adults whose blood pressure fluctuates widely from one heartbeat to the next may be at greater risk for brain shrinkage and nerve cell injury, according to a new study led by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. The study, first published online in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease on October 17, reveals that short-term "dynamic instability" in blood pressure - moment-to-moment changes measured over just minutes - is linked to loss of brain tissue in regions critical for memory and cognition, as well as to blood biomarkers of nerve cell damage. "Our findings show that even when average blood pressure is normal, instability from one heartbeat to the next may place stress on the brain," said USC Leonard Davis School Professor of Gerontology and Medicine Daniel Nation, senior author of the study. "These moment-to-moment swings appear to be associated with the same kinds of brain changes we see in early neurodegeneration." Recent evidence suggests that such fluctuations can strain small blood vessels in the brain and reduce their ability to deliver steady blood flow. In this study, the researchers combined two complementary measures: Together, these measures indicate how much blood flow changes over a short period of time, or what the researchers call "blood pressure dynamic instability." "Blood pressure isn't static; it's always adapting to the body's needs," Nation explained. But as we age, that regulation can become less precise. During MRI scans, participants' blood pressure was monitored continuously using a finger cuff device that recorded every beat for seven minutes. Blood samples showed that the same individuals had higher levels of neurofilament light (NfL), a blood-based marker that rises when nerve cells are damaged. Importantly, these findings remained significant even after accounting for participants' age, sex, and average blood pressure, suggesting that fluctuations themselves, not just overall pressure, may be a key risk factor. The researchers speculate that differences in blood vessel anatomy or blood flow demands between hemispheres might make the left side more susceptible. The findings open a new window into how cardiovascular changes contribute to cognitive decline and may offer novel prevention strategies. "Traditionally, we've focused on lowering average blood pressure numbers," said Trevor Lohman, USC research assistant professor of neurology and gerontology and first author of the study. Reducing these fluctuations could help protect the brain, even in people whose average readings look fine." Future research will explore whether interventions that stabilize blood pressure, such as tailored medication timing, exercise, or stress reduction, can slow brain aging and reduce dementia risk. The authors also note that because this was a cross-sectional study, it cannot prove cause and effect, necessitating larger, long-term studies that closely examine the links between cardiovascular and brain health. "Our results underscore how closely connected the heart and brain are," Lohman said. "Maintaining steady, healthy blood flow could be one of the best ways to support brain health as we age."
