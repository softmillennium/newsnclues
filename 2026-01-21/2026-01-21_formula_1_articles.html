                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wheatley ‘more emotional than I thought' as Audi launch in Berlin Aston Martin and Honda have kicked off their new partnership via a Tokyo launch presentation. Aston Martin and Honda celebrated the start of their works F1 partnership on Tuesday during a special pre-season event in Tokyo, Japan. Aston Martin Aramco Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll was joined by Honda President and Representative Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe for the presentation, while F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali also attended and took to the stage. Since returning to F1 as a works team back in 2021, the Silverstone-based Aston Martin squad have been powered by Mercedes engines, but this changes for 2026 – and the sport's all-new regulations – thanks to their Honda tie-up. Aston Martin's former Team Principal and new Chief Strategy Officer Andy Cowell has been overseeing the final stages of the integration, drawing on his lengthy and successful stint at Mercedes High Performance Powertrains, with F1 design legend Adrian Newey taking on team boss duties. “I am delighted to celebrate the start of our partnership with Honda here in Tokyo today,” said Lawrence Stroll. “Our journey won't always be easy and challenges inevitably lie ahead, but winning is what drives both companies forward and together we look forward to many successful years of partnership.” “Striving to become number one in the world, Honda will continue to take on challenges together with the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team. “Today we also launch a new ‘H' mark with a refreshed design, which Honda has adopted as the new symbol representing its automobile business. This new H mark symbolises the transformation of Honda's automobile business so it is an important moment for us.” “Formula 1 began racing in Japan in 1976 before moving to Suzuka in 1987, so there is a deep loyalty and connection to the country where a record 13 World Drivers' Championships have been decided over the years. “The sport is growing in Japan where there are now nearly 17 million passionate and incredible F1 fans. There will be a simplified hybrid engine that runs on advanced sustainable fuel without impacting the performance. “F1 echoes the commitment of Honda and Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team to sustainability, and is on target to achieve the goal of Net Zero by 2030 having already delivered a 26% reduction in carbon emissions by year end 2024 compared to 2018.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wheatley ‘more emotional than I thought' as Audi launch in Berlin For Doriane Pin there has only been one target at the forefront of her mind – to win. Never one to blend in, Pin was destined to stand out from the moment she first set foot in a kart aged seven. As her nickname of ‘Pocket Rocket' attests to, Pin was a driver you should never underestimate. However, when Mercedes offered her the chance to represent them in F1 ACADEMY, it was a chance she was determined to repay with the title. “Champion is a beautiful word to really fit our season,” she summarises. Storming onto the scene with victory on her F1 ACADEMY debut in Jeddah, Pin had every intention of claiming the 2024 crown with PREMA Racing. Entering the 2025 F1 season, it was clear that Pin had unfinished business to take care of. As a title favourite, the weight of expectation fell heavy on her shoulders. Her competition was no less fierce, as Ferrari junior Maya Weug went back-and-forth with Pin for the top spot. “She's talented and very much deserves her success this year. It was a close battle that I actually enjoyed a lot, because you need those drivers to push you and push each other to the top. We did exactly that so it was really positive.” Taking the Standings lead with a daring first lap pass on Weug in Shanghai Race 2, Pin lost the top spot one round later, a position she refused to accept. Recognising that she needed to step up her game, the Mercedes junior left no stone unturned as she drove herself to be better than ever. Her impeccable consistency was built on rapid speed and a sharp intellect, choosing her moments wisely – not least her outstanding performance going from sixth to the victory in Miami Race 1. It was not easy at all but we were still there performing on Sunday. Even her behaviour behind the scenes takes lessons from those that have gone before her, with her journal recording car and session details reminiscent of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. The change in Pin across her two seasons isn't stark, with her virtually unshakeable mentality ever present. “Just being in the present,” Pin responds when asked about her mentality last season. “Winning and fighting for a title for the whole year hasn't been easy because when you're leading, you're the one to beat. I'm very happy about this weekend especially, because we have been very ahead of our contenders in terms of approach. It's clearly making a difference because we are champions.” On hand to celebrate the title with her in Las Vegas were Mercedes, as the Formula 1 team poured into parc ferme wearing custom ‘P1N' shirts. George Russell, Kimi Antonelli and Toto Wolff were amongst the first to congratulate her and the Team Principal was full of praise for their young star. “Dori has been a great addition to the team,” he remarked in the Mercedes End of Year Review video. "But then she went into [F1 ACADEMY] and crushed it. She's a fierce young lady that can drive. From a personality, she fits into Mercedes, she fits into the team and it's a pleasure to see her working." “Mercedes have been there from day one,” she says. They bring professionalism, experience and performance into my racing career. I will remember it for my entire life.” As the next stage awaits, with duties as a Mercedes Development Driver soon to come for the 22-year-old, Pin's aspirations know no bounds. With a versatility that should stand her in good stead for any path she chooses, the opportunities are endless. Savouring all she's learnt across her two seasons in F1 ACADEMY, her childhood dream is as alive as ever. "Every day you learn something so it's super fascinating when you're passionate about motorsport and the high level of sport. "I've learned so much in terms of driving, but also outside the track and on myself as well. She adds: “The idea is to have a long and successful career. Hopefully we will achieve good things with everyone who is involved at the moment with me […] I've grown so much, it will definitely help me in my entire career. "F1 ACADEMY and everything around it is big and I will never give up on achieving my ultimate goal – that's Formula 1.”</p>
