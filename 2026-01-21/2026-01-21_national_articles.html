At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Supreme Court's Republican majority ordinarily believe that President Donald Trump is allowed to fire virtually anyone who works for a federal agency. It is not at all clear what this cryptic sentence means, but at Wednesday morning's oral argument in Trump v. Cook, most of the justices signaled that they will adhere to the view that they laid out in Wilcox. Meanwhile, even Justice Samuel Alito, who is ordinarily a kneejerk Republican partisan, asked some skeptical questions of Trump's lawyer. If they set those rates too high, it will be too expensive for businesses to borrow money and investment and hiring will stagnate. For this reason, Congress shields the Fed's governors from presidential control, only permitting the president to fire them “for cause.” This is to prevent the president from pressuring them to lower interest rates in an election year, when the president's party would benefit from a temporary economic high. And, if Trump prevails in Cook, his administration has already signaled that it will bring similarly dubious allegations against Fed chair Jerome Powell. Last August, Trump attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee to the Fed's Board of Governors, claiming that she falsely claimed on a mortgage application that “both a property in Michigan and a property in Georgia would simultaneously serve as her principal residence.” But Trump has yet to provide any meaningful evidence that supports this allegation, and he never gave Cook a hearing where she could explain this alleged falsehood. Right out of the gate, several key justices appeared skeptical that a minor discrepancy on mortgage documents could justify Trump's decision to fire Cook. As anyone who has ever obtained a mortgage can testify, the process requires the borrower to sign a huge pile of documents, many of which are drafted by the government, with little time to review them or to ask for them to be changed — even if such a change can be made. Thus Chief Justice John Roberts told solicitor general John Sauer early in the argument that “we can debate…how significant it is that, in a stack of papers you have to fill out when you're buying real estate,” one of those papers contains an inaccurate representation. Roberts also expressed skepticism of Sauer's claim that Cook engaged in “deceit,” asking whether it is really fair to apply this word to “an inadvertent mistake contradicted by other documents in the record.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh, meanwhile, warned Sauer that, if the president can fire a Fed governor because they discover what is at most a minor paperwork error, then that will destroy the Federal Reserve's independence. Meanwhile, Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked an even more basic question: “Why are you afraid of a hearing?” If Trump is so confident that Cook actually did something wrong, why wouldn't he give her notice of the allegations against her and an opportunity to defend herself before he tries to fire her? Of all the justices, only Gorsuch seemed to offer a coherent reason to rule in favor of Trump — Gorsuch suggested that Cook may only challenge Trump's decision to fire her by seeking a rarely used court order known as a “writ of mandamus.” It is nearly impossible to win a mandamus case, and Sauer argued that mandamus may never be used against the president. So Gorsuch's approach would likely amount to a total victory for Trump. Indeed, these questions are so vexing that some of the justices, including Barrett and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that the Court might avoid deciding them until the lower courts have more time to consider this case. After a lower court ruled that Trump may not fire Cook, Trump asked the Supreme Court to issue a temporary emergency order removing her from office. But when a party seeks such an order, the Supreme Court said in Nken v. Holder (2009), they must do more than show that they are likely to prevail in the case. Among other things, they must also show that they will be “irreparably injured” if the Supreme Court does not intervene right away. They also must show that an immediate order would not harm the “public interest.” Although the Court's Republicans appear to have exempted Trump from having to comply with Nken in the past, Barrett, a Republican appointed by Trump, asked Sauer about an amicus brief filed by economists who argued that allowing Trump to fire Cook would trigger a recession. A recession, as Barrett suggested, would not be in the public interest. She also asked Clement to provide his best argument that Trump will not experience irreparable harm if Cook gets to remain on the Fed's board while this case is fully litigated in lower courts. Not all of the justices, however, appeared to believe that such a narrow decision would be desirable. Roberts, in particular, expressed doubt that there would be any point to giving Cook an additional hearing, because there aren't really many factual disagreements to be explored here. Cook will simply claim in such a hearing that she, at most, made an inadvertent mistake. So Roberts seemed to believe that the Court should just decide, as a legal matter, whether such a mistake is sufficient grounds to fire her. Other justices appeared exasperated that they were being asked to decide this case so quickly and with so little evidence in the record. Alito, for example, complained that this case came up to the Supreme Court in such a “hurried manner” that Cook's mortgage applications aren't even part of the official record before his Court. All of which is a long way of saying that it is far from clear what the Cook opinion will say, or even if it will say anything more than “we'll decide this case at some point in the future.” And it does appear that, whenever they get around to deciding Cook, most of the justices do not think that Trump should be able to order Fed governors to lower interest rates or else they will be fired. ﻿Why the nation's movies, video games, and toys went global in 2025.</p>

Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and attorney Abbe Lowell, arrive at the Supreme Court in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed inclined to keep Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook in her job, casting doubt on President Donald Trump's bid to wrest control of the nation's central bank. The justices heard arguments over Trump's effort to fire Cook based on allegations she committed mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a sitting governor in the 112-year history of the Fed, which was structured to be independent of day-to-day politics. Both Cook and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell sat through nearly two hours of arguments in the packed courtroom. The true motivation for trying to fire Cook, Trump's critics say, is the Republican president's desire to exert control over U.S. interest rate policy. If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, the first Black woman Federal Reserve governor, he could replace her with his own appointee and gain a majority on the Fed's board. The case is being closely watched by Wall Street investors and could have broad impacts on the financial markets and U.S. economy. Trump has been dismissive of worries that cutting rates too quickly could trigger higher inflation. He wants dramatic reductions so the government can borrow more cheaply and Americans can pay lower borrowing costs for new homes, cars or other large purchases, as worries about high costs have soured some voters on his economic management. The board cut a key interest rate three times in a row in the last four months of 2025, but that's more slowly than Trump wants. The Fed also suggested it may leave rates unchanged in coming months over inflation worries. Chief Justice John Roberts, who also seemed skeptical of Trump's actions, suggested it may be pointless to return the case to lower courts rather than issue a more enduring ruling. In Trump's first year in office, the justices generally, but not always, went along with Trump's pleas for emergency action to counteract lower-court rulings against him, including allowing the firings of the heads of other governmental agencies at the president's discretion, with no claim that they did anything wrong. In Cook's case, Trump is not asserting that he can fire Fed governors at will, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said. Cook is one of several people, along with Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who have been accused of mortgage fraud by federal housing official Bill Pulte. The case against Cook stems from allegations she claimed two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as “primary residences” in June and July 2021, before she joined the Fed board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. Those applications, Sauer said, are evidence of “gross negligence at best” and give Trump reason to fire her. In any event, he argued, courts shouldn't be reviewing his decision and Cook has no right to a hearing. “There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,” a Cook lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi in November. Cook specified that her Atlanta condo would be a “vacation home,” according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. In a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a “2nd home.” Lowell wrote that the case against her largely rests on “one stray reference” in a 2021 mortgage document that was “plainly innocuous in light of the several other truthful and more specific disclosures” about the homes she has purchased.

Many have not yet responded to Trump's invites. Chaired by Trump, the board was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the Gaza ceasefire plan. But the Trump administration's ambitions have since expanded, with Trump extending invitations to dozens of nations and hinting at the board's future role as conflict mediator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Officials subpoenaed: Leaders in Minnesota and the Twin Cities have criticized the Justice Department for subpoenaing them as part of an investigation into whether local officials obstructed federal immigration enforcement efforts that have drawn strong backlash. • Church protest investigated: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said there would be arrests made related to the protests that disrupted a service at a St. Paul church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly serves as a pastor. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is investigating. The church said it welcomes “respectful dialogue,” and is evaluating “next steps with our legal counsel.” Organizers describe “ICE Out of Minnesota” as a statewide protest Friday. Newly released court documents describe federal agents' account of events leading up to the recent shooting of a Venezuelan man in Minneapolis. Two ICE agents, driving in an unmarked vehicle last week, ran the license plate of a nearby vehicle and found it was registered to someone living in the United States illegally, an FBI agent described in a court affidavit. The driver, Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela ran up to a nearby apartment building, where Julio Sosa-Celis, another undocumented Venezuelan man, was standing, the affidavit states. The affidavit alleges that both Aljorna and Sosa-Celis used a broomstick to hit the agent in the ensuing struggle – in which he believed a third, unidentified person struck him with a snow shovel – before the agent fired his gun, striking Sosa-Celis in his upper thigh. Both men stand accused of assaulting an ICE agent and are due in federal court today. “There's nothing that brings two mayors together like a bullshit federal investigation,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at an event hosted by St. Thomas University in St. Paul. “The fact that this is happening to leaders should make everybody, Republican and Democrat, livid, furious. Frey pushed back on the idea that his rhetoric has inflamed the situation in Minneapolis, saying that he's channeling what residents in his city are feeling. But St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her said “it doesn't matter what language he uses” because “I haven't dropped any F-bombs … and I received the same subpoena as he did.” In the words of the Trump administration, Renee Good, the woman killed by an ICE agent while protesting enforcement actions in Minnesota was part of a “mob of agitators.” Likewise, a bystander who could be heard in a video of the interaction yelling “shame, shame” and other residents protesting since then have been called “paid” or “professional” agitators. Throughout US history, the label “agitator” has largely been deployed in one direction — “by the powerful to delegitimate real grievances of the marginalized and oppressed seeking change,” Aldon Morris, a professor emeritus of sociology at Northwestern University, wrote in an email to CNN. The “agitator trope” was used by enslavers to describe abolitionists, labor union organizers and to smear Black civil rights activists, Morris said. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the most well-known figures ever to be deemed an “agitator.” Still, “agitator” didn't always have a negative connotation. Before it was first used as a synonym for “instigator” around the 1700s, the term meant an “agent,” or a person who acts on behalf of others. Her wife, Becca Good, said in a statement last week the couple had “stopped to support our neighbors.” She added, “We had whistles. Read more about what “agitator” means and how it has been used here. Minneapolis remains on edge two weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good. As the Justice Department opens criminal investigations into state and local officials and vows to charge protesters who disrupted a church service Sunday, some activists wonder if it's safe to keep speaking out. Hear from one of them – and get a lesson on the legal issues that could also be relevant in other cities: Religious leaders from across the country say they will present Congress with a letter Wednesday signed by more than 2,000 faith leaders that calls for the ICE agent who killed Renee Good to be charged and for the federal government to stop all ICE operations in Minnesota and across the county. It also implores the FBI to make information available to Minnesota law enforcement after the Justice Department blocked state investigators from joining in a federal probe. ISAIAH said it will host a strike Friday, calling for “No Work. No Shopping.” The group will also hold a march in downtown Minneapolis Friday afternoon. “DHS is able to find no record of ICE or Border Patrol stopping and questioning a police officer. Without a name, we cannot verify these claims. We will continue to look into these claims,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday. Police leaders in the Twin Cities area say they've received “endless reports” about ICE agents violating civil rights – particularly in the past two weeks. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley alleged some of his off- duty officers — all people of color — have been targeted by ICE agents in recent weeks, without quantifying how many. In one instance, a female off-duty officer was pulled over during a traffic stop and boxed in by ICE agents, who demanded to see her paperwork, Bruley said. To de-escalate the situation, the officer identified herself as a police officer, and that's when agents “immediately left after hearing this, making no other comments,” Bruley said. Bruley was joined at the press conference by St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry and Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt in calling for better supervision and accountability from federal agents. Federal agents were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” when an undocumented Venezuelan national, Julio Sosa-Celis, resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” an agent, the Department of Homeland Security has said. In self-defense, the ICE agent targeted, chased, then shot Sosa-Celis as the agent was being “ambushed” by three people, DHS said last week in a statement. ICE also detained another undocumented Venezuelan national, Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, during the encounter. Sosa-Celis and Aljorna are due in court this morning. Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, faces one count of murder-for-hire, according to the Associated Press. Federal prosecutors allege Espinoza Martinez sent a Snapchat message in October to other gang members that read, in part: “10k if u take him down,” along with a picture of Bovino. A criminal complaint cites an anonymous source who accused Espinoza Martinez of being a “ranking member of the Latin Kings.” But his family and attorneys say he's not in a gang. He does not have legal permission to stay in the United States. If convicted, Espinoza Martinez faces up to 10 years in prison. Federal agents' tactics have been scrutinized after operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans, and currently in the Twin Cities of Minnesota.

Investigations are then furthered by putting witnesses to the grand jury,” he told Fox's Sean Hannity. “No one – elected official, private citizen or otherwise – gets to impede and obstruct a law enforcement investigation,” Patel said. A crowd of anti-ICE protesters in St. Paul confronted several ICE agents' cars on Tuesday. Some protesters argued with one agent, who can be seen wearing a mask, about whether race is a factor in recent arrests. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, whose county was subpoenaed in the DOJ's inquiry into several Minnesota government offices, condemns federal officers' actions in the state. The subpoenaed officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have, been vocal critics of the administration's growing operation. The subpoenas came as the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is investigating demonstrators who interrupted a church service in St. Paul Sunday, accusing them of “desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.” As the Justice Department investigates anti-ICE protesters who disrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota, Sunday, it is leaning on two federal laws – one more than 100 years old – to justify potential federal charges. • The FACE Act: The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act was enacted in 1994 and prohibits the use of force or physical obstruction to intentionally interfere with anyone lawfully exercising their First Amendment right of religious freedom. The statute also protects facilities that provide reproductive health services. Read more about the laws and why context matters in this case here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For subscribers to The New York Times who are as interested in solving Wordle or filling in the crossword puzzle as in reading the latest political or business news, Wednesday is a big day. The Times' popular Games unit is debuting Crossplay, a Scrabble-like electronic feature that represents its first designed multiplayer game. It becomes the website's 11th game, joining a lineup of puzzles that were collectively played over 11.2 billion times in 2025. The Times says it has about 3,000 journalists on staff, its most ever and more than twice what it had a decade ago. It is thriving at a troubled time for the industry: More than 350,000 journalists worked at U.S. newspapers in 2005, and that number was down to 91,550 last year, according to Northwestern University. Kennedy tries the crossword puzzle — on its easiest day. His Scrabble-loving daughter is likely to be excited about Crossplay. His wife regularly uses the Cooking app, where thousands of recipes for all occasions are available. “As remarkable as it's been, I kind of scratch my head at the other news organizations that have tried to replicate it,” Kennedy said. “It just seems like they were so thoroughly beaten to this idea that it's hard for them to compete.” The Times likens itself to a solar system. The research company YipitData reported in 2023 that subscribers spent more time in Games than they did with the digital newspaper (the company didn't respond to questions about whether it had more current data). The Times reported 12.33 million subscribers by the end of last September, up 9% from 2024 and all but about a half million of them digital. Subscription revenue for digital-only products increased by 14%. Last year saw a decrease in people subscribing to just the news. Puzzles, contests and games aren't novel for newspapers; The Times introduced its crossword puzzle in 1942 and it went digital in 2009. It was late last decade when its spelling bee game proved popular, particularly among people intimidated by the crossword. Times executives realized the potential and rebranded its app in 2020. Developed by a Brooklyn software engineer named Josh Wardle, the addictive puzzle known as Wordle requires players to guess a five-letter word by eliminating potential letters. Last year Wordle was played 4.2 billion times. Morning social feeds brim with people posting their results and bragging about — or lamenting — their performance that day. “I knew we could get to this scale,” Knight said of his site. “I didn't think we could get to it in this amount of time.” The Wordle rhythm — one word a day — is something Knight's team keeps in mind. They're always trying new games, but keep standards high, and have generally added one new game a year. He doesn't want a site with 30 or so games, some of them low-quality. “We're not trying to get you in the app all day. We're not nagging you to come back in. One popular addition has been Connections, where people need to group different things that relate to one another. Digits, a logic puzzle with numbers, failed despite two tries. The conclusion, Knight says: “We have been cautious about math and numbers games ever since.” Staff members at Games stay in touch with users through a newsletter and forums devoted to specific puzzles. They're also very kind and joyful people, and we really value engaging with the community all the time.” The games are similar, though there are some small differences in how Crossplay is played — how the game board is designed and some letter values, for example. People can invite friends to play or compete against a computer, keep track of records and engage with the Cross Bot feature, which gives a postgame analysis and tells players about moves they could have made to score more points. Unlike some of the other individual Times games, people can download a specific Crossplay app.</p>

The body wasn't even cold before the Buffalo Bills decided to let go of Sean McDermott. That loss, team owner Terry Pegula said, single-handedly cost McDermott his job. Head coach Sean McDermott and owner Terry Pegula of the Buffalo Bills before the Buccaneers game at Raymond James Stadium on Dec. 12, 2021, in Tampa, Florida. "My decision to bring in a new coach was based on the results of our game in Denver," Pegula, alongside general manager Brandon Beane, told reporters on Wednesday. "I looked around, first thing I noticed was our quarterback with his head down crying. We all know what I'm talking about. If I can take you into that locker room, I felt like we hit the proverbial playoff wall year after year," Pegula added. The owner also made sure to note that Allen "didn't have any input at all" in the decision. "I didn't talk to Josh about this. I talked to him afterwards, but that conversation will stay private," Pegula said.

Beane was asked about the lack of wide receiver success, namely in Keon Coleman, but Pegula jumped in and placed blame on "coaching" on the first pick of the second round in 2024. Ladd McConkey was the next selection. "The coaching staff pushed to draft Keon," Pegula said. "I'm not saying Brandon wouldn't have drafted him, but he wasn't his next choice. That was Brandon being a team player and taking advice from his coaching staff who felt strongly about the player. He's taken, for some reason, heat over it and not saying a word about it. But I'm here to tell you the true story." Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott speaks at a news conference after the Lions game, Dec. 15, 2024, in Detroit. Many thought the Bills were a team of destiny this year, considering Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson all did not make the playoffs.

Europe should be happy President Donald Trump was elected — despite his threats to take Greenland — because without him, it would never have stepped up for its own defense, according to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "I'm not popular with you now because I'm defending Donald Trump, but I really believe you can be happy that he is there because he has forced us in Europe to step up, to face the consequences that we have to take care of more of our own defense," Rutte said Wednesday in remarks at Davos, Switzerland. "No way, without Donald Trump, this would never have happened. In 2014, NATO allies agreed to spend 2% of GDP on defense, but many fell short until recent years. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Trump's threats not to defend NATO countries, most allies are meeting or exceeding the benchmark. They've now agreed to spend 5% GDP on defense and national security infrastructure. "I'm absolutely convinced without Donald Trump you would not have taken those decisions, and they are crucial, particularly for the European and the Canadian side of NATO to really grow up in the post-Cold War world." NATO chief Mark Rutte says Europe never would have stepped up its defense spending without Trump. U.S. lawmakers previously criticized Rutte for his own country's underspending on defense. Rutte was prime minister of the Netherlands from 2010 to 2024. And yes, they have to pivot more towards Asia. So it is only logical for them to expect us, Europe, to step up over time," he said. He also added Greenland is not the "main issue" and Europe should not let it distract from Ukraine's defense. "The risk here is that we focus, of course, on Greenland, because we have to make sure that issue gets solved in an amicable way," he said. I'm also a little bit worried that we might drop the ball focusing so much on these other issues." "This focus on Ukraine should be our top priority," he said. Rutte repeatedly has praised Trump, in June calling him "daddy" of the NATO alliance. Rutte has repeatedly praised Trump, in June calling him "daddy" of the NATO alliance. Other European leaders have expressed more concern about Trump's Greenland ambitions. On Wednesday Trump, for the first time, ruled out taking Greenland by force. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said a U.S. takeover of Greenland would mean the "end of NATO," the nearly 80-year-old defense alliance. President Donald Trump said from Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21 that the U.S. is the only nation that is able to control and secure Greenland. (Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP via Getty Images) This week the president told Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in a text message he "no longer thinks purely of peace" in his desire to own Greenland. Trump wrote: "Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America." "I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States," Trump wrote. "The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., speaks during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform markup business meeting about finding former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in contempt of Congress, Wednesday Jan. 21, 2026, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Ranking member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., listens during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform markup business meeting about finding former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in contempt of Congress, Wednesday Jan. 21, 2026, on Capitol Hill in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans started a push Wednesday to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, opening the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time. “Subpoenas are not mere suggestions, they carry the force of law and require compliance,” said Comer, R-Ky. Bill Clinton, President Donald Trump and many others connected to Epstein have not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet lawmakers are wrestling over who receives the most scrutiny. Nonetheless, there were signs of a potential thaw as the Clintons, both Democrats, appeared to be searching for an off-ramp to testify. In addition, passage of contempt charges through the full House was far from guaranteed, requiring a majority vote — something Republicans increasingly struggle to achieve. While the charges have historically been used only as a last resort, lawmakers in recent years have been more willing to reach for the option. Comer initiated the contempt proceedings after the Clintons refused for months to fulfill a committee subpoena for their testimony in its Epstein investigation. The public release of case files has shown details of the connections between Epstein and both Bill Clinton and Trump, among many other high-powered men. Comer rejected an offer Tuesday from a lawyer for the Clintons to have Comer and the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, interview Bill Clinton in New York, along with staff. Behind the scenes, however, longtime Clinton lawyer David Kendall has tried to negotiate an agreement. The Clintons, who contend the subpoenas are invalid because they do not serve any legislative purpose, also say they did not know about Epstein's abuse. They have offered the committee written declarations about their interactions with Epstein. We've done so because Mr. Epstein's crimes were horrific,” the Clintons wrote Comer last week. Contempt of Congress proceedings are rare, used when lawmakers are trying to force testimony for high-profile investigations, such as the infamous inquiry during the 1940s into alleged Communist sympathizers in Hollywood or the impeachment proceedings of President Richard Nixon. Most recently, Trump's advisers Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon were convicted of contempt charges for defying subpoenas from a House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of the Republican president's supporters at the Capitol. Both Navarro and Bannon spent months in prison. The Jan. 6 committee also subpoenaed Trump in its inquiry. Trump's lawyers resisted the subpoena, citing decades of legal precedent they said shielded ex-presidents from being ordered to appear before Congress. No former president has ever been successfully forced to appear before Congress, although some have voluntarily appeared. Democrats have largely been focused on advancing the investigation into Epstein rather than mounting an all-out defense of the Clintons, who led their party for decades. They have said Bill Clinton should inform the committee if he has any pertinent information about Epstein's abuses. A wealthy financier, Epstein donated to Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton's joint fundraising committee ahead of her 2000 Senate campaign in New York. Comer has also allowed several former attorneys general to provide the committee with written statements attesting to their limited knowledge of the case. The committee had also subpoenaed Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime confidant who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for a conviction on sex trafficking charges. “It's interesting that it's this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” Garcia said. Comer said the committee will interview Maxwell next month. Attorney General Pam Bondi will also appear before the House Judiciary Committee in February. The backlash scrambled traditional ideological lines, leading Republicans to side with Democrats demanding further investigation. Comer has indicated that he will insist that the subpoena be fulfilled by nothing less than a transcribed deposition of Bill Clinton.</p>

Joel Klatt and Colin Cowherd discuss the importance of Indiana winning the National Championship, and whether or not Miami can rebound following their loss. Miami Hurricanes quarterback Carson Beck gave it a valiant effort, but his team came up just short in the college football national championship against the Indiana Hoosiers. Beck was seen running off the field without meeting his opponents for a postgame handshake. Miami quarterback Carson Beck is sacked by Indiana linebacker Aiden Fisher during the first half of the College Football Playoff national championship game, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in Miami Gardens, Florida. Beck didn't address why he just ran off the field. But he appeared to be shaken up during Miami's final drive of the game. He was hit hard by an Indiana defender after he threw a pass, which garnered a roughing the passer call on the Hoosiers. ESPN's Pete Thamel suggested that Beck may have been hurt on the play. "The other factor in that play was Carson Beck took a late hit from the Indiana defensive tackle, what was it, two or three plays before that?" he said on the "College GameDay Podcast." He didn't look right just in the locker room. So I walked by him and I said, ‘Hey Carson, how are you feeling after that hit.' And he said, ‘My ears are still ringing,' and there was a few accentuators that you wouldn't hear Rece Davis say in sentences, but you'd probably hear Dan (Wetzel) and I say pretty much every day there. Miami quarterback Carson Beck passes against Indiana during the first half of the College Football Playoff national championship game, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in Miami Gardens, Florida. He was 19-of-32 with 232 passing yards, a touchdown pass and the game-sealing interception. Beck later reflected on his lone season with the Hurricanes, calling it the best year of his life. "And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed," he said. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Chicago to Minneapolis, federal immigration agents deployed on Trump administration crackdowns have relied on an unlikely tool in the heat of tense operations — cellphone cameras. What's been less clear, though, is exactly what the agents are doing with these devices in scenarios when many experts say law enforcement officers are better served having both hands free and their attention undivided. A CNN review of dozens of videos provides the clearest picture yet of federal immigration agents' at-times unconventional use of personal and government-issued phones and cameras in the field, which agents are widely using to deploy facial recognition software and to capture video – either for social media content or to document their actions. In particular, the videos provide new insight into how the agents are using Mobile Fortify, a recently developed Department of Homeland Security app that allows officers to scan faces and retrieve detailed personal information. The app was intended to help quickly process immigrants targeted by operations – though it's also now being used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in street encounters with protesters and civilians alike. US Customs and Border Protection agents are using cellphones in a similar way during operations, videos show. 404 Media, an independent news outlet, first reported on the existence of Mobile Fortify. Federal agencies like ICE, by contrast, aren't required to wear body cameras, thanks to a 2025 executive order by President Donald Trump rescinding a Biden-era policy. When agents are using personal phones in the field, there's no definitive ICE policy about recording interactions or incidents, current and former officials said, though the expectation is that government business be handled on government-issued phones. It's unclear whether DHS has any overarching policy governing how agents use facial recognition software. citizens are afforded the right to opt out of face recognition for non-law enforcement uses unless otherwise authorized or required.” “There's no retention requirement if it wasn't department-issued,” said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, adding that “It can really be used in a way that will misrepresent the situation.” The practice of agents simultaneously filming and conducting operations is also a new phenomenon – driven in part by demands from the White House for more content for social media showing Trump's crackdown in action, according to a former DHS official. For years the agency would send designated videographers on assignments; now, many agents record video at once – even amid potentially dangerous operations. “Its use is governed by established legal authorities and formal privacy oversight, which set strict limits on data access, use, and retention,” the statement said. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN on Friday that the agency plans to use money from Trump's major policy bill, which includes $75 billion for ICE, to expand body-camera access for agents – but did not address whether new policies would require their use. DHS moved more slowly than other agencies to comply, in part due to resistance from the Customs and Border Protection agency, an official who formerly had oversight over the DHS program told CNN. That delay became moot when Trump took office last year, as he quickly revoked Biden's order. Under the new rules, agents could continue wearing cameras in some places. In other offices – including ICE's Minneapolis office – body camera policies weren't adopted. But even as many DHS agents have taken to the field without body cameras, they've begun filming Trump's crackdowns in unprecedented ways, video analyzed by CNN found. In numerous incidents reviewed by CNN on recent sweeps across the country, agents pulled out cellphones and snapped photos of civilians' faces, using a unique app interface with large white circles. In one video, in which immigration agents question someone who tells them he is 16 and doesn't have identification with him, one agent asks the other: “Can we do facials?” before another officer enters the frame to take the teen's photo. Mobile Fortify's development is the outcome of an ongoing effort at DHS, including under the previous administration, to modernize processing of immigrant arrests – a sluggish process that relied on mobile fingerprinting or bringing people into local field offices, according to current and former officials. The new app instead allows agents to scan someone's face and instantly pull their information from any CBP immigration database, the DHS said in its statement. Multiple officials who spoke to CNN described the app as “efficient.” Mobile Fortify, which is allowed only on government-issued phones, was first rolled out last year. In the videos reviewed by CNN, agents are rarely seen asking permission before holding their phones up to scan faces – and in some videos, after ignoring requests from individuals to stop. However, while signs typically inform travelers that they can decline facial recognition, ICE does not give civilians the option. That's led to outcry from some lawmakers and privacy advocates. A group of senators has called for ICE to stop using Mobile Fortify, and in a letter to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, asked what tests the agency conducted, if any, before deploying the app. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who led the inquiry, said he hasn't received a response from ICE. “It's draconian, dangerous, and deceptive,” Markey said in a statement to CNN. “Our faces are not barcodes for ICE to scan and track.” A lawsuit filed against DHS earlier this month by the state of Illinois also alleges that an “indiscriminate use” of Mobile Fortify has violated residents' rights. McLaughlin in a statement to CNN has disputed the lawsuit's claims and said that federal agents' actions are constitutional. Munira Mohamed, a policy associate for the American Civil Liberties Union in Minnesota, said the lack of consent leaves citizens and noncitizens alike vulnerable. “The surveillance structure and network that's being created affects us all, whether you care about immigration enforcement or not, whether you're a US citizen or not,” Mohamed said. In its statement, DHS said concerns about privacy intrusions are unwarranted. “Claims that Mobile Fortify violates the Fourth Amendment or compromises privacy are false,” said a DHS spokesperson. “The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data.” One senior official at DHS told CNN that Ross recorded because the couple had been harassing ICE officers that morning, adding that ICE officers often start documenting incidents if protesters or others become hostile to create a record of the incident. “It was incredibly irresponsible and unprofessional and it doesn't comport to any law enforcement standards that I was ever a part of,” said the former DHS official. In some incidents, agents appear to be recording during confrontations with civilians. The fleeing man was charged with assault for allegedly ramming agents' cars. The use of cellphones or personal cameras by agents on duty raises numerous potential conflicts, experts said. Some told CNN that Ross' judgment and actions may have been impacted by the use of his phone – including his decision to walk in front of Good's car during the encounter just before he shot her. The presence of cameras during raids could have an impact on agent behavior, said William Most, a civil rights attorney. “This does raise concerns that federal agents are seeking to perform or create a spectacle rather than enforce and comply with the law,” Most said. While ICE doesn't have a definitive policy on recording interactions or incidents on cellphones, the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility can review a government device upon request. A warrant or subpoena is generally required to access the officers' personal phone. There are also concerns about ICE and CBP's filming of protesters. FBI agents are restricted from recording protesters or using surveillance tools to monitor First Amendment activity without having probable cause as part of an investigation. DHS is required to follow some of the same guidelines around civil liberties and other protections in criminal investigations. Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, suggested on Thursday that the administration could even create a “database” to publicly out protesters. “One thing I'm pushing for right now … we're going to create a database where those people that are arrested for interference, impeding and assault, we're going to make them famous,” he told Fox News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Australia is doing absolutely everything to protect its most iconic ecosystem — except, perhaps, the one thing that really matters. It was shortly after 10 pm on a cloudy December night, and Harrison, a coral researcher at Australia's Southern Cross University, was about 25 miles off the coast of northern Queensland. Over a few nights in the Australian summer, shortly after the full moon, millions of corals across the Great Barrier Reef start bubbling out pearly bundles of sperm and eggs, known as spawn. It's as if the reef is snowing upside down. Those bundles float to the surface and break apart. If all goes to plan, the eggs of one coral will encounter the sperm of another and grow into free-swimming coral larvae. Those larvae make their way to the reef, where they find a spot to “settle,” like a seed taking root, and then morph into what we know of as coral. Spawning on the Great Barrier Reef has been called the largest reproductive event on Earth, and, in more colorful terms, “the world's largest orgasm.” Coral spawn can be so abundant in some areas above the reef that it forms large, veiny slicks — as if there had been a chemical spill. Some people say coral spawn smells like watermelon or fresh cow's milk. “Here we go,” said Mark Gibbs, another scientist onboard and an engineer at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), a government agency. A few people onboard began skimming the water's surface with modified pool nets for spawn and then dumping the contents into a large plastic bin. And with nearly $300 million in funding and hundreds of people involved, RRAP is the largest collective effort on Earth ever mounted to protect a reef. And despite the name, it's not really one reef but a collection of 3,000 or so individual ones that form a reef archipelago. Over three days in December, I scuba dived offshore from Port Douglas and Cairns, coastal cities in Queensland that largely run on reef tourism, a whopping $5.3 billion annual industry. Descending onto the reef was like sinking into an alien city. Two decades of scuba diving had led me to believe that you can only find vivid blues, reds, oranges, and pinks in an artist's imaginings of coral reefs, like in the scenes of Finding Nemo. But coral colonies on the reefs I saw here were just as vibrant. Some of the colonies of the antler-like staghorn coral were so blue it was as if they had been dipped in paint. While cruising around large colonies of branching coral, I would see groups of young fish hiding out among their nubby calciferous fingers. RRAP partners with First Nations peoples, many of whom have relied on the reef for thousands of years and are eager to help sustain it. “It's there to provide for us, too,” Keyes, who comes from a family of fishers, told me. The Great Barrier Reef is not dead, as many visitors assume from headlines. But in a matter of decades — by the time the children of today grow old — it very well could be. The world's coral reefs face all kinds of problems, from big storms to runoff from commercial farmland, but only one is proving truly existential: marine heat. Each piece of coral is not one animal but a colony of animals, known as polyps, and polyps are sensitive to heat. But when ocean temperatures climb too high, polyps eject or otherwise lose those algae, turn bleach-white, and begin to starve. If a coral colony is “bleached” for too long, it will die. And should wealthy countries continue burning fossil fuels — pushing global temperatures more than 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline — it will likely lose the rest of it. Projections for the Great Barrier Reef are just as grim. The reef would only later recover to anything close to what it looks like today, the authors wrote, if there are immediate, near-impossibly steep emissions cuts. The reef has already had a taste of this future: In the last decade alone, there have been six mass bleaching events. Surveys by AIMS found that bleaching last year affected a greater portion of the reef than any other year on record, contributing to record annual declines of hard coral in the northern and southern stretches of the reef. These species also tend to be most sensitive to heat stress, cyclones, and a coral-eating pest called the crown-of-thorn starfish. “We've got immense volatility in coral cover at any given reef,” said Morgan Pratchett, a marine ecologist at James Cook University. “We have reduced the biodiversity on those reefs, and it's just being driven by weedy species. Now we're in an era where the existing choral assemblage is so vulnerable to any given disturbance. Sometimes it's overwhelming, like when you see another mass bleaching. The problem isn't just bleaching but that these events are becoming so frequent that coral doesn't have time to recover, said Mia Hoogenboom, a coral reef ecologist at Australia's James Cook University, who's also involved in RRAP. That night in December, after filling two large plastic bins onboard with coral spawn, the crew motored to a nearby spot on the reef where several inflatable pools were floating on the ocean's surface. The boat slowly approached one of the pools — which looked a bit like a life raft — and two guys onboard dumped spawn into it. The government established RRAP in 2018 with an ambitious goal: to identify tools that might help the reef cope with warming, refine them through research and testing, and then scale them up so they can help the reef at large. RRAP involves more than 300 scientists, engineers, and other experts across 20-plus institutions, including AIMS, which operates one of the world's largest research aquariums called the National Sea Simulator. The government committed roughly $135 million to the project, and it has another $154 million from private sources, including companies and foundations. It's operating on the scale of decades, not years, said Cedric Robillot, RRAP's executive director. Scientists at RRAP have now honed in on several approaches that they think will work, and a key one is assisted reproduction — essentially, helping corals on the reef have babies. That's what scientists were doing on the water after dark in December. They might get eaten by fish, for example, or swept out to sea, away from the reef, where the larvae can't settle. RRAP is trying to improve those odds through what some have called coral IVF. At sea, scientists skim spawn from the surface and then load them into those protected pools, which are anchored to the reef. Suspended inside the pools are thousands of palm-sized ceramic structures for the larval coral to settle on, like empty pots in a plant nursery. After a week or so, scientists will use those structures — which at that point should be growing baby corals — to reseed damaged parts of the reef. With this approach, scientists can collect spawn from regions that appear more tolerant to warming and reseed areas where the corals have been killed off by heat. So those babies may be less likely to bleach and die. While baby corals are growing in those pools, scientists can also introduce specific kinds of algae — the ones that live symbiotically within polyps — that are more adapted to heat. That may make the coral itself more resistant to warming. But what's even more impressive is that scientists are also breeding corals on land, at the National Sea Simulator, to repopulate the reef. SeaSim, located a few hours south of Cairns on the outskirts of Townsville, is essentially a baby factory for coral. He first walked me through a warehouse-like room filled with several deep, rectangular tanks lit by blue light. The light caused bits of coral growing inside them to fluoresce. Other than the sound of running water, it was quiet. SeaSim has several open-air tanks designed to breed corals with little human intervention. The tanks collect their spawn automatically and mix it together in another container that creates the optimal density of coral sperm for fertilization. It typically happens just once a year for each species, and the timing can be unpredictable. But I got lucky: Colonies of a kind of branching coral known as Acropora kenti were set to spawn later that evening. They were covered in pink, acne-like bumps — the bundles of spawn they were getting ready to release — which was a clear sign it would happen soon. As it grew dark, the dozen or so people around the tanks flipped on red headlamps to take a closer look. They hung for a moment just above the coral branches before floating to the surface and getting sucked into a pipe. “It's such a beautiful little phenomenon,” Robillot said, as we watched together. “It's a sign that we still have vitality in the system.” Those larvae then get transferred to yet other tanks, settling on small tabs of concrete. One clear advantage of spawning corals in a lab is that scientists can breed individual corals that appear, through testing, to be more resistant to heat. Ideally, their babies will then be a bit more resistant, too. During spawning late last year, SeaSim produced roughly 19 million coral embryos across three species. “People often don't understand the scale that we're talking about,” said Carly Randall, a biologist at AIMS who works with RRAP. “We have massive numbers of autospawning systems lined up. We have automated image analysis to track survival and growth. Including the spawn collection at sea, RRAP produced more than 35 million coral embryos last year that are now growing across tens of thousands of ceramic structures that will be dropped onto the reef. The goal RRAP is working toward, Robillot says, is to be able to stock the reef with 100 million corals every year that survive until they're at least 1 year old. (Under the right conditions, each ceramic structure can produce one coral that lives until 1 year old in the ocean, Robillot told me. That means RRAP would need to release at least a million of those structures on the reef every year.) One study, published in 2021 and partially funded by RRAP, suggests that a combination of interventions, including adding heat-tolerant corals, can delay the reef's decline by several years. We're talking about starting to change the makeup of the population by adapting them to warmer temperatures and helping their recovery. If you systematically introduce corals that are more heat-tolerant over a period of 10 to 20 to 30 years, then over a hundred years, you significantly change the outlook for your population.” The obvious deficiency of RRAP, and many other reef conservation projects, is that it doesn't tackle the root problem: rising greenhouse gas emissions. While restoration might help maintain some version of coral reefs in the near term, those gains will only be temporary if the world doesn't immediately rein in carbon emissions. Many groups involved in reef conservation have failed to reckon with this reality, even though they're often on the front lines of climate change. During my trip, I would be on dive boats listening to biologists talk about restoration, while we burned diesel fuel and were served red meat — one of the most emissions-intensive foods. A lot of tour operators, some of whom work with RRAP, don't talk about climate change much at all. Yolanda Waters, founder and CEO of Divers for Climate, a nonprofit network of scuba divers who care about climate change, said this isn't surprising. “At the industry level, climate change is still very hush-hush,” said Waters, who previously worked in the reef tourism industry. “In most of those boats, climate messaging is just nonexistent.” Tourism companies don't want people to think the reef is dying. Tourists are ending their vacation with the memory of, say, a shark or manta ray, not a new urge to fight against climate change, Waters said. So the status quo persists: People don't connect reducing emissions with saving the reef, even though that's “the only reef conservation action that can really be taken from anywhere,” she added. (Not everyone in the tourism industry is so quiet. Eric Fisher, who works for a large Australian tourism company called Experience Co Limited, says he tells tourists that climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. “It's what we tell people every day,” Fisher told me. Keeping mum on climate change, while speaking loudly about restoration and other conservation efforts, including RRAP, can also take pressure off big polluters to address their carbon footprints, Waters and Murphy said. Polluters who fund reef conservation, including the government and energy companies, are given social license to operate without stricter emissions cuts, because the public thinks they're doing enough, they said. In reality, the Australian government continues to permit fossil fuel projects. Last year, for example, the Albanese administration, which is politically left of center, approved an extension of a gas project in Western Australia that Murphy and other advocates call “a big carbon bomb.” The extension of the project, known as the North West Shelf, will produce carbon emissions equivalent to about 20 percent of Australia's current yearly carbon footprint, according to The Guardian. A spokesperson for the Albanese government acknowledged in a statement to Vox that climate change is the biggest threat to coral reefs globally. “The Albanese Government remains committed to action on climate change and our net zero targets.” Yet the policy only applies to Scope 1 emissions. If any country can reduce its emissions, it should be Australia, Waters said. On a stormy morning, near the end of my trip, we returned to the reef — this time, visiting another set of floating pools, offshore from Port Douglas. They had been filled with spawn several days earlier. Small corals were now growing on the ceramic structures, and they were ready to be deployed on the reef. After a nauseating two-hour ride out to sea, a group of scientists and tourism operators jumped into small tenders and collected the structures from inside the pools. As it started to pour, and I noticed water flooding into the front of the tender, I couldn't help but think about how absurd all of this was. “You sort of think about the level of effort, that we're going to try and rescue something that's been on our planet for so many millions of years,” Harrison told me on the boat a few nights earlier. RRAP is making this process far more efficient, Robillot says — machines, not people, will eventually be dropping the ceramic structures off the boats, for example. But still, why not invest the money instead in climate advocacy or clean energy? Isn't that an easier, perhaps better, way to help? Many donors who fund the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a core RRAP partner and Robillot's employer, are putting more of their money into climate action relative to reef conservation, he said. The government of Australia, meanwhile, says it's spending billions on clean energy and green-lit a record number of renewable energy projects in 2025. Investing that roughly $300 million into fighting climate change could have a small impact on reefs decades from now. Putting it into projects like RRAP helps reefs today. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation has been criticized for its ties to mining and energy companies, including Peabody Energy and BHP. The Reef Foundation currently receives money from mining giant Rio Tinto and BHP Foundation (which is funded by BHP) for projects unrelated to RRAP, the organization told Vox. “It's really important that we get polluters to pay for the damage they're causing. But that should be done as an obligatory tax and they should not be getting any marketing benefits from that.” Robillot argues that these companies have not influenced RRAP's work, or restricted what its staff can say about climate change. “If we can still scream that climate change is the main driver of loss of coral reefs, I don't have an issue,” he said. “I don't think it's realistic to only take money from people who do not have any impact on climate change. Yet if there's one argument that I find most convincing for RRAP — for any project trying to help wildlife suffering from climate change — it's that even if the world stops burning fossil fuels, these ecosystems will still decline. “If you stop emissions today, they will still suffer,” Robillot said of reefs. Then again, these sorts of efforts are what scientists, Indigenous Australians, and the most thoughtful divers can do — what they are doing — to help the reef today. “There's so much work happening on the ground,” Waters, of Divers for Climate, told me. It would be great for the Australian government to go, ‘Well, this is what we can do for reefs, too,' pick up their game on climate, and show that we're actually in it together.” Major studies on microplastics are now being called into question.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunday church services were underway at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, when protesters entered and began shouting “Justice for Renee Good” and “ICE out,” a video from the incident shows. “Shame on you!” a person at the church podium shouts. He was recently named a defendant in a case brought by protesters who allege immigration agents violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights. President Donald Trump called the demonstrators at the church “agitators and insurrectionists” and said they are “troublemakers who should be thrown in jail, or thrown out of the Country.” Now, the protesters could be facing prosecution. Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said the protesters were “desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshipers.” “Everyone in the protest community needs to know that the fullest force of the federal government is going to come down and prevent this from happening and put people away for a long time,” Dhillon said on The Benny Show, a podcast by conservative influencer Benny Johnson. Here's what you should know about both laws and how they could be applied. The FACE Act, enacted in 1994, is a federal law that prohibits “the use of force or threat of force or physical obstruction to intentionally injure, intimidate, or interfere with or attempt to injure, intimidate, or interfere with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.” The statute also protects facilities that provide reproductive health services. As of 2024, the Department of Justice has filed more than 15 FACE Act actions in at least a dozen states, with ongoing investigations in others, according to a DOJ news release. At the time, Trump was already facing a lawsuit that alleged he violated the KKK Act when he attempted to overturn the election results of major cities in 2020. That same year, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation filed a federal lawsuit against right-wing political operatives Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, saying they violated the KKK Act when they “conspired to intimidate and threaten many thousands of eligible voters.” The men were accused of targeting Black voters in 85,000 robocalls that spread false information about voting by mail. The lawsuit, which was ultimately dismissed, alleged these were attempts to block her reform efforts. The protesters who disrupted Sunday services at the Minneapolis church might have violated the two federal laws, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said Tuesday, but context matters. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and the ability to voice beliefs, views and ideas, but it's not an unlimited right and doesn't apply everywhere, according to the Freedom Forum. The right does not necessarily extend to private places like churches, for example, the Freedom Forum said. “In fact, the First Amendment protects private people and companies' right to make their own decisions about speech in their spaces.” Honig noted the contrast between the Justice Department's probe into a non-violent church protest – using the “full force of federal law” – and how it is not currently investigating a fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer. “Regardless of what one might think the ultimate conclusion should be,” Honig said, “the approach of the DOJ and (Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche has been: We're not even going to look. We're not even going to do an investigation.” CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis, Holly Yan, Andy Rose and Elise Hammond contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's audience in the Swiss alpine town of Davos on Wednesday may wonder if they are present at the destruction. Never before has a president crossed the Atlantic after threatening to seize a chunk of European sovereign territory over the wishes of its people. Trump's Greenland power grab may already have damaged NATO, the world's most successful military alliance, beyond repair. His antipathy for values the US used to share with Europe — like international law — risks another fracture. It's not good manners either for a guest to mock Europe as weak, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent did over the weekend. Or for a White House to write national security strategies that advocate replacing sitting governments with far-right extremist parties. America's shift has bewildered many in Europe who regarded the United States as a liberator, protector and partner. The question they now ask is not whether the United States is still a friend, but whether it's becoming an enemy. Of course, the possibility that Trump might not be welcomed in Davos — the glitzy haunt of corporate barons, liberal European leaders, commentators and think-tankers — is the reason it made political sense for him to go. If his new national security strategy is a guide, he'll rebuke the continent for courting “civilizational erasure” with nonwhite immigration. The Wall Street titans and hoity-toity Euro elites who spurned Trump when he was a vulgar real estate shark never saw this day coming. It might temporarily slake his resentment, displayed in a rambling White House news conference Tuesday, over voters' lack of appreciation for his second term. Still, Trump's image as the champion of the American worker is a little tarnished since his first storming of globalization's Super Bowl as president in 2018. These days he spends time hobnobbing with the new elites — AI tech bros and crypto pioneers. On his rare forays out to meet the people, he points out that he's ignoring his scriptwriter's prepared remarks on high consumer prices. But he's losing the economic argument to Democrats in a midterm election year. Trump made clear in the 2024 campaign that his second term would be so disruptive that riding it out and hoping for the return of a more benevolent America was not an option. NATO, the United Nations and the global economic system are examples of institutions that many of Trump's supporters believed have failed them,  and that he's spent his political career undermining. Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador to NATO and to China, lamented America's abdication of its modern global role in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett. We're not an imperial power, and that's what Truman believed. “Suddenly, we have a president who disregards the United Nations charter that borders are inviolable, and he's threatening to attack one of our closest allies.” One quality of this president is that he raises burning questions that many more timid or politically correct politicians don't dare touch — whatever one might think of his proposed solutions. No modern presidential candidate until Trump built a campaign around the dispossession of working Americans whose jobs and industries disappeared abroad because of free trade policies adopted by their government. But he raised the issue of mass migration that is straining Western societies when other, often liberal politicians didn't. Now, every government in Europe is wrestling with the problem, fueling a wave of Trump-style populists. One critical geopolitical question Trump asked is about the transatlantic alliance. Europe's failure, 80 years after World War II, to equip itself for its own defense gave him the opening. Previous US presidents and European leaders would often meet and lionize the World War II generation without planning for the inevitable consequences once the heroes and living memory of their deeds faded away. Perhaps stock markets tanked by European threats of tariff retaliation will concentrate his mind. But the EU thought it had conceded a beneficial trade deal to Trump last year. But he was elected twice, suggesting that political conditions inside the US have shifted in a lasting way. And a Democratic Party that seems to share many of Trump's populist economic instincts might also balk at financing Europe's defense. Gavin Newsom, was in Davos on Tuesday, and said he should have brought “knee pads” for European leaders, who he accused of “rolling over” for Trump with previous rounds of flattery. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, told CNN's Richard Quest on Tuesday that Europe must be ready for the old world not to come back. And I think that Europe is going to look at its strength, look at its weaknesses,” Lagarde said in Davos. She said the bloc must “decide what do we need to do to be strong by ourselves, to be more independent, to rely on the internal trade that we do with each other so that we can just — not ignore, but at least be prepared and have a plan B just in case the normal relationship is not restored.” French President Emmanuel Macron rejected Trumpism in Davos on Tuesday, bemoaning a “shift towards a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot and the only rule that seems to matter is the rule of the strongest.” But skeptics will wait to see whether fragile leaders can convince grumpy electorates that cuts in social services must pay for rearmament. Still, a shift away from the United States has clearly begun. Canada spent last year reeling from Trump's demands that it become the 51st state. Some of those Western Hemisphere middle powers are spreading their bets. Four Mercosur nations, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, last week signed a trade deal with the EU that will cover 700 million people — after a quarter-century of tough negotiations. Such efforts represent attempts to make sense of a world descending into disorder accelerated by Trump's disruption. Trump's withdrawal of America means its allies now face a similar challenge.</p>

Air Force One, carrying President Donald Trump, turned back shortly after taking off for the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland.

The White House pool reported that the plane's crew identified a “minor electrical issue” and was returning to Joint Base Andrews out of an abundance of caution.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quipped that the Qatari jet offered to Trump sounded “much better” at the moment.

Trump and his team will board a different plane to take to Davos. He's expected back at Joint Base Andrews at 11 p.m., with the delay pushing his arrival at Davos by an unknown period of time.

A government motorcade was filmed speeding to Joint Base Andrews shortly after the plane turned around.

Trump is scheduled to speak at Davos on Wednesday amid unprecedented tensions between the United States and Europe over the former's desire for Greenland.

“America will be well represented in Davos — by me. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!” the president said in a Truth Social post shortly before taking off.</p>
