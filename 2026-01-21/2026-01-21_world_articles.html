                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's winding, antagonistic speech to business moguls and government officials in the Swiss Alps on Wednesday was hardly a salve to concerns the Western Alliance is at its breaking point. Trump complained relentlessly about the United States being taken advantage of by Europe, and wondered incredulously why his attempt to take control of Greenland was being met with resistance. And that, at a crisis moment for transatlantic ties, was something. For European leaders listening anxiously to the president's remarks on Greenland, there were four words in a speech of otherwise fiery rhetoric that mattered: “I won't use force.” It was the clearest statement yet from Trump that he would not attempt to seize Greenland using military might. Taking it off the table will be a relief to officials who had been preparing for tense diplomatic confrontations with Trump to try and stave off a potential war. Markets responded positively, too, turning upward after a day of losses on Tuesday. Trump just backed off on using military force to take Greenland. That's not to suggest everything will be easy sailing going forward. Trump remained insistent that he would accept nothing less than full ownership Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. “This enormous unsecured island is actually part of North America,” Trump said. In reiterating his demand for control of Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland four times — Trump argued in Davos that “no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland, other than the United States.” Trump went on to slam Denmark as “ungrateful” for refusing to relinquish control of Greenland, contending that the nation owed the US for defending it during World War II. Trump also took aim at a range of other targets both old and new, at one point even belittling host country Switzerland as “only good because of us.” He recounted a past exchange with a Swiss leader over tariffs, boasting that he decided to increase his levy on the country after she “rubbed me the wrong way.” “We have many places like that where they're making a fortune because of the United States,” Trump said to the largely European crowd, which sat in shocked silence. Fact check: Trump's barrage of false claims in Davos about Greenland and NATO As for Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump opted to issue an ominous threat. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. Trump used his speech to renew a pair of longstanding domestic grudges as well, attacking Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. “She comes from a country that's not a country, and she's telling us how to run America,” Trump said of Omar amid an extended diatribe against the nation of Somalia, adding that she's “not going to get away with it much longer.” And he invoked alleged fraud in the state she represents, Minnesota, to make a thinly veiled xenophobic argument for the Western values that he said need to be protected and strengthened. “The situation in Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot mass import foreign cultures, which have failed to ever build a successful society of their own,” Trump said, claiming that Western prosperity stemmed from “our very special culture.” “This is the precious inheritance that America and Europe have in common,” Trump added. The president, who appeared more subdued following a lengthy flight into Switzerland, garnered laughs for calling out “so many friends, a few enemies” in the audience and claiming that after his first year back in office, “people are doing very well. Another digression — and extended tirade against windmills — startled the room into nervous laughter as he inaccurately praised China for not having windfarms and called nations that rely on wind energy “stupid people.” As Trump's speech hit the hour mark and went into a section on his deployment of the National Guard to Washington, DC, and other US cities, some of the international crowd had clearly lost interest — with a few even getting up to leave early. Trump himself even seemed to feel urgency to wrap up by the end, finishing out his remarks on a casual note: “I'll see you around.” If there was an underpinning to Trump's hourlong speech — and it meandered in many directions — it was an abiding belief that Europe and its leaders had veered drastically off course. While Trump claimed to love the continent's nations — declaring himself “100%” Scottish and German — he had only disdain for how officials had managed immigration, security and economics over the past decades. And we can argue about it, but there's no argument,” Trump said minutes into his speech. Recalling wars over the past century that required American intervention, Trump seemed intent on humiliating Europeans into granting him what he really wanted from them: Greenland. “Without us right now, you'd all be speaking German and a little Japanese,” he said. “Without us, most of the countries don't even work,” he bemoaned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Netanyahu announced his participation, Israeli airstrikes and tank fire killed 11 people across Gaza. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Wednesday that he is accepting an invitation from President Donald Trump to join the U.S.-led “Board of Peace” — the colonial body set to have control over and supposedly enforce “peace” in Gaza as Israel bombs Palestinians and freezes babies to death in its ongoing genocide. The prime minister's office announced his acceptance in a post on social media. Netanyahu will sit on the board to envision supposed “peace” for Gaza in spite of his role in destroying Gaza; killing tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Palestinians there; being wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court for his Gaza campaign; and his vision for a “Greater Israel” that would involve even further ethnic cleansing in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and beyond. Several powerful European countries are opting out of the board. On Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that French officials “wholeheartedly support” the U.S.'s “peace plan,” but that France is saying “no to creating an organization as it has been presented, which would replace the United Nations.” The “Board of Peace” and accompanying “International Stabilization Force” have been widely panned by critics as a “colonial abomination,” a horrific plan to continue violent control over Gaza on the heels of Israel's genocide, which has killed over 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza so far, with likely far more deaths currently uncounted. Israel has continued to demolish and raid residential areas in Gaza, waging attacks nearly every single day since the agreement began on October 10. Gaza officials have recorded 1,300 Israeli ceasefire violations, with the attacks having killed at least 477 Palestinians, including over 100 children. The slaughter included two young boys, killed by tank fire in central and southern Gaza, and three journalists who were on an assignment by the Egyptian government's aid committee to film tent encampments provided by the country.Meanwhile, on Saturday, a newborn baby froze to death in Gaza — one of at least eight children to die of exposure to the cold this winter under Israel's severe blockade of aid materials like shelter. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes. We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks. We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A French magistrate has said two Trump administration emissaries approached her seeking to lobby against an election ban on the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Confirming comments she made to France 5 TV, Lafourcade said she had been very surprised by the tenor of her discussion with the US advisers in Paris last May, when they steered the conversation on to French judges' sentencing of Le Pen in 2025 after she was found guilty of the embezzlement of European parliament funds. After a nine-week trial in Paris, judges ruled last March that Le Pen had been at the heart of an extensive and long-running fake jobs scam at the European parliament, and banned her from running for public office for five years with immediate effect. Le Pen, 57, who leads the anti-immigration National Rally (RN), had been considered a lead contender for next year's presidential election until her sentence. Le Pen appealed alongside 10 of the 24 party members who were convicted last year. Lafourcade told AFP she had met Samuel D Samson and Christopher J Anderson last May. She said they had been seeking “elements to support a theory that could have, perhaps, served to support a disinformation or manipulation of the public debate in France”. Lafourcade said she had tried to explain the French judicial process, but that the two men “were convinced it was a political trial that aimed to remove [Le Pen] from the presidential race or to place a ban on her for purely political reasons”. She said they felt Le Pen had been unfairly treated and was victim of a “political conviction”, and that they had sought elements to support that view. Lafourcade, who is not involved in the Le Pen case, said she was troubled because this was not the type of conversation that “should happen with allies”. She said she had sensed that it could be seen as a form of interference, so immediately reported the conversation to the foreign ministry, “which is something I never do, as we are an independent institution and don't report the exchanges we have with diplomats”. “[DRL] officials routinely hold productive meetings across Europe with a wide range of government officials and civil society representatives to address concerns regarding censorship, democratic backsliding and other human rights issues,” the statement added. Samson, a recent college graduate appointed as senior adviser under the new Trump administration, had recommended last year that his bureau's leadership use funds earmarked by Congress for foreign assistance to support projects including the resettlement of Afrikaners to the US and Le Pen's legal defence. It is not clear whether the DRL's leadership adopted his recommendations. Le Pen's sentence prompted anger among political figures on the international populist right. She told La Tribune Dimanche this month that whatever the outcome, her party would dominate and its “ideas will survive”. If she is unable to run for the presidency for a fourth time next year, she will be replaced by her young protege and party president, Jordan Bardella. The German magazine Der Spiegel has reported that Trump officials held internal discussions about sanctioning French prosecutors and judges involved in last year's trial and sentencing of Le Pen. The Department of State said it was a “fake story”. The French government spokesperson, Maud Bregeon, said this month that there was no proof of any international interference, but that the government would remain vigilant.</p>

This rhetoric, which began during his first term, reached a fever pitch during the 2024 campaign when Hillary Clinton compared his Madison Square Garden rally to the infamous Nazi gathering held there in the 1930s. In 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris and half of the American public, according to ABC News/Ipsos polling, embraced the label for Trump, while many others dismissed it as hyperbolic. A year into Trump's second term, Goldberg suggests that those who sounded the alarms are being vindicated. The debate over fascism has become more pervasive following the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross in Minnesota. The video of Good's death was seen by 80% of Americans, and polls from Data for Progress, Quinnipiac, CNN, and YouGov/Economist reveal that the majority of Americans do not think the killing was justified. The internet is flooded with viral videos of ICE agents violently detaining a U.S. citizen child at a Target and warning peaceful bystanders that they will end up like Good. Other footage shows agents punching citizens for legally recording them, assaulting a woman whose disability prevented her from exiting her car, and using flash bangs and pepper-spraying peaceful protesters. As they were driving, a Minneapolis couple and their six children were reportedly caught in a chaotic clash between federal agents and protesters. According to the parents, officers deployed flash-bang munitions and tear gas that filled their vehicle, causing their 6-month-old baby to stop breathing and lose consciousness before emergency responders arrived. These violent acts are not just limited to Minnesota. Since 2025, ICE has been responsible for nine fatal shootings and about 40 deaths in custody, including one ruled a homicide. The agency has also detained nearly 200 U.S. citizens, including Native Americans. Social media is increasingly filled with videos of everyday citizens who emphasize that they are not overtly political and rarely, if ever, protest, yet feel compelled to speak out because they believe the President's version of events is demonstrably false. Even traditionally sympathetic voices like Tim Dillon and Joe Rogan have raised concerns, specifically comparing the administration's use of federal agents to the “Gestapo”: the secret police of Nazi Germany known for their brutal suppression of dissent and lack of judicial oversight. Rogan further leaned into this comparison by arguing that forcing residents to prove their citizenship status on the street is tantamount to the infamous Nazi practice of demanding “your papers,” to identify and disappear undesirables. Relatedly, in the understatement of the year, former ICE Director Sarah Saldana recently warned on CNN that the situation has reached a breaking point, noting that it is “way past time for de-escalation.” As his first year comes to a close, much of what has occurred in Minnesota and elsewhere has led critics to label Trump a fascist. In reality, Good's car did not run over anyone, and Ross walked away from the scene unassisted. New York Times reporting casts doubt on the idea that Ross even visited a hospital after Good's death. Critics argue that Trump warrants the fascist label due to his efforts to direct the U.S. military against American citizens. Trump and his Administration have threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, which, unlike in Trump's National Guard deployments would allow armed forces to carry out law enforcement functions, such as making arrests and conducting searches. According to military intelligence sources, the Minnesota crackdown serves as more than an immigration initiative; it is allegedly part of a broader campaign targeting “anti-American' elements,” such as Antifa and the radical left. This escalation coincides with a federal court ruling this week that significantly restricted the tactics ICE may employ against peaceful protesters. Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz mobilized the state's National Guard this weekend to maintain order. Critics contend that the Trump administration has effectively weaponized ICE, transforming it into a tool of executive power rather than a public service agency. In mid-2025, the administration introduced substantial financial inducements, including $50,000 signing bonuses and $60,000 in debt forgiveness, to attract recruits whose primary motivations may be economic rather than civic. This, coupled with policies allowing agents to remain masked, withhold identification, and conduct stops based on subjective criteria like “accents,” has largely insulated the agency from accountability. Moreover, the imposition of strict arrest quotas to meet a target of 11 million deportations has escalated routine daily activities into high-stakes confrontations for many residents. Despite claims that professional standards prevent abuse, an undercover report from Slate describes ICE training as “sloppy” and lacking substantive background checks. Trainees reportedly expressed more interest in physical assault and making arrests than in mastering the legal requirements of the job. As the line between law enforcement and political weaponry continues to blur, the American public is left to determine whether these actions represent a temporary crisis or a permanent systemic shift toward something like fascism. However, some such as Tyler Cowen, a Professor of economics at George Mason University wrote in 2018 that “American fascism cannot happen anymore because the American government is so large and unwieldy.” Four years later, Political scientist Anthony DiMaggio disagreed, arguing that it was already happening in the U.S. Steiner's academic warnings were grounded in the volatile political climate of the 1930s, most notably the “Business Plot,” which involved a fellow Marine and two-time Medal of Honor recipient, Major General Smedley Butler. The conspirators, a group of financial elites, believed they could leverage Butler's immense influence over veterans to lead a military coup against President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This historical episode, recently dramatized in the 2022 film Amsterdam, served as the catalyst for Butler to document the corrupt intersection of corporate interests and military power in his seminal pamphlet, War is a Racket. While scholars were still debating whether fascism could ever take root in the United States, poet Langston Hughes argued that Black Americans were already living through its domestic equivalent. We know,” Hughes declared, noting that “theories of Nordic supremacy and economic suppression” had long been a lived reality. After World War II, Americans largely viewed fascism as an “Old World” relic, a theme explored in the new film Nuremberg. The film rightly tells the story of how psychologist Dr. Douglas Kelley was dismissed by American audiences for suggesting that his work with Nazis revealed that fascism could take root in the U.S. Still, in the decades ahead, scholars like Theodor W. Adorno as well as artists such as Pier Paolo Pasolini warned that nations like the U.S. that privileged capitalist consumerism had the potential to resuscitate fascism. “It's striking how much the arguments that Trump is not a fascist have suffered in just the first few days of this year,” Goldberg noted. While Marxists and conservatives debated whether capitalism was responsible for the rise of fascism, liberals continued to blame “totalitarianism.” Marxists rejected this as a politically charged attempt to marginalize progressives by conflating fascism with the leftist, Communist Soviet Union. Nonetheless, by the late 1970s, the lack of a unified concept led many to believe that fascism was a unique set of historical circumstances that would not recur. “Fascism: a populist political philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition.” Goldberg noted that those who contend Trump is a fascist point to his territorial aggrandizement in Greenland and Venezuela, the utilization of state violence via ICE, his appeals to nationalism, and an emphasis on hyper-masculinity. They further cite his pardoning of January 6th participants and a “fetish for technology” as evidence of this shift. Meanwhile, other commentators highlight Trump's strategic alliance with corporate power and his systematic dismantling of institutional independence, including efforts to curb autonomy in higher education, co-opting legal processes, and intimidating the press. In 1995, Umberto Eco introduced a framework for ‘eternal' fascism. He posited that fascism functions as a ‘coagulation' of contradictory elements rather than a single, cohesive system, categorized by fourteen primary characteristics: “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.” In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.” “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.” “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.” “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.” “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.” “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.” “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.” He famously noted that “it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.” Eco's framework shifted the focus from specific government structures to a set of psychological and rhetorical traits. Eco's list was later emulated by Lawrence Britt in 2003, who identified fourteen characteristics of fascist regimes: The examination of features of fascism accompanied the research on how fascism was not a European phenomenon because these features are universal. However, as the digital age and globalized economy reshape the ways power is seized and maintained, many wonder if these classic markers are being updated for a new era. While the classic markers of the 1930s provide a baseline, many experts argue that modern movements require a new vocabulary. In November 2025, Stefanie Prezioso warned that traditional fascism analogies may not be entirely helpful today because Trump's actions, “while echoing the darkest chapters of the twentieth century, remain in many ways radically new.” Prezioso cites historian Eric Hobsbawm, who observed, “When people face what nothing in their past has prepared them for, they grope for words to name the unknown, even when they can neither define nor understand it.” Indeed, when fascism first emerged in the early 20th century, thinkers like Antonio Gramsci drew upon history to name the phenomenon, initially referring to it as “Caesarism.” This 19th-century concept described autocrats who, like Julius Caesar or Napoleon III, claimed to embody the “popular will” while systematically dismantling the institutions that protected it. Still, scholars have sought to bridge the gap between 20th-century history and today's political shifts through the term “neofascism.” Galadriel Ravelli and Anna Cento Bull define neofascism as a revival of activism by groups striving to keep fascist ideals alive in the post-war international context. Jason Stanley argues in How Fascism Works (2018), that 21st-century fascists share tactics with their 1930s predecessors: the construction of a mythic past, reliance on propaganda over reason, and the exploitation of sexual anxiety. Modern neofascism is fueled by globalization rather than total war, and its rhetoric has shifted from old-world antisemitism toward xenophobia aimed at immigrants. Neofascism's appeal is rooted in its ability to reframe political contests. In this framework, the good people are defined as anti-feminist, uneducated, xenophobic nationalists who aggressively oppose the emancipatory promise of the Enlightenment in favor of a world governed by hierarchy and hyper-masculine violence. The contemporary debate over Trump is less about his personality and more about the specific timeline of American decline. Analysts like Monika Bauerlein of Mother Jones contend that the transition to fascism is “not over” because citizens still possess rights worth using. Similarly, contributors to The Nation argue that a window remains to prevent total consolidation, provided the public aggressively defends those currently targeted by state violence. This belief that the U.S. is “transitioning” suggests that fascism is a process rather than a single event. Researchers such as historian and philosopher Hannah Arendt argue that fascism emerges from specific societal conditions. It often begins with what Arendt calls the “politics of inevitability,” the naïve belief that democracy is guaranteed to endure, leaving citizens unreflective and vulnerable to creeping authoritarianism. This complacency often coincides with a deadlocked democracy, where traditional liberal and conservative parties become unable to govern effectively or solve national crises. In these moments, when the future seems bleak, leaders point toward a mythical, “pure” past, a “Golden Age,” and frame the present as a constant cycle where “innocent” people are under attack by outsiders. Fascism also gains momentum when there is no viable left-wing alternative to champion the needs of poor and working people. As Professor of Economics at The New School for Social Research, Clara Mattei notes, fascists rarely seize power in a vacuum; instead, conservative elites often decide to invite fascists into power specifically to help crush the Left. Mattei argues that austerity, which refers to policies like wage cuts and social service reductions, is a deliberate tool used by elites to break the power of the working class. When democracy fails to solve a national crisis, elites may view fascism as a technocratic solution that can enforce economic discipline by force where democratic processes have failed. Fascism thus emerges to “tame” the public and ensure that the logic of profit remains unquestioned, often presenting brutal economic choices as scientific necessity. This transition is made easier by the death of truth. As University of Toronto's Timothy Snyder emphasizes, fascism begins with the abandonment of facts; if nothing is true, no one can criticize power, and citizens eventually trade their freedom for the “sensual experience” of belonging to a tribe or following a leader. Once a movement emerges, it follows a trajectory that Robert Paxton delineated in his 2004 seminal work, The Anatomy of Fascism. Paxton contends that fascist regimes evolve through five distinct stages: While Paxton observes that several movements have emerged throughout history, only Italy and Germany reached the third stage of achieving power, and only Germany successfully expanded through its full exercise. He contends that fascist regimes carry the seeds of their own “inherent self-destruction” because they are built on fundamental contradictions. Ultimately, fascism is a self-terminating system, yet it collapses only after a period of profound violence, suffering, and systemic instability. Leading global voices in the study of fascism, such as Jason Stanley, Marci Shore, and Timothy Snyder, recently left their positions at Yale University for academic appointments in other nations. Drawing on their own research, they suggested that the safest course of action is to exit a country at the earliest stage, before a fascist regime fully consolidates its power and closes its borders. While critics point to the crackdown as proof that the country has entered the later stages of authoritarian consolidation, others maintain that these actions are necessary measures to maintain order within a polarized democracy. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the ‘big bazooka' to a world cup boycott, Europe has powerful weapons beyond dialogue. An emergency EU summit could be a turning point Don't get This Is Europe delivered to your inbox? “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,” wrote Emmanuel Macron in a private message to Donald Trump this week. But Macron might have been speaking for millions of bewildered European citizens. As Russia's war physically tears into Ukraine, Trump's phoney war on Europe over Greenland risks breaking apart the western defence alliance Nato. By Trump's unhinged logic – which includes him linking his actions over Greenland to having been snubbed for the Nobel peace prize – Europe has no right to prevent him from acquiring Greenland from Denmark. In a rambling speech at Davos on Wednesday, Trump stepped up his claim to the territory although he ruled out military force to seize it, saying he was seeking “immediate negotiations” instead. But he again insisted that only the US was capable of securing Greenland. Diplomats hoped a confrontation between Trump and his one-time European allies could be averted in Davos if the president was truly committed to the compromise that he insisted would make Nato and the US “very happy”. Either way, Trump's intimidation and blackmail tactics could backfire, amid signs that Europe may finally be ready to abandon appeasement as a tactic. Retaliatory tariffs on €93bn of imports of US goods such as soya and bourbon have been primed in Brussels, ready to launch in response to any new US tariffs on 1 February. MEPs have also agreed to suspend ratification of the EU-US trade deal sealed in July. This would have seemed too radical a step until recently. Macron wants to go further and roll out the EU's most powerful trade weapon, the anti-coercion instrument (ACI), its so-called “ bazooka”. A crisis meeting of EU ambassadors on Sunday showed there was no majority for this step.” Punitive tariffs on US goods could snap into place on 7 February, barring any agreement otherwise.” Divisions may yet emerge between France and Germany, however. “I'm struck by differences in tone,” Jennifer says. “The EU wants to de-escalate with Trump over Greenland but still show that it has the capacity to exert leverage over him. That is mission impossible,” Alberto Alemanno, professor of EU law at the business school HEC Paris, said. There would be real costs for Europe with this approach, he admitted, adding: “But the cost of not acting is worse: permanent subordination to an increasingly adversarial power. “Despite persistent myths, the anti-coercion instrument need not take long at all. The instrument could be mobilised rapidly, giving Brussels a powerful retaliatory set of tools.” Tariffs on US goods should be reactivated and the Turnberry trade deal, struck by Trump with Ursula von der Leyen last summer, “should be declared null and void”, Riekeles said, since the premise it was based on has been “shredded”. Simply making its use a credible option changes the balance of power – and that is the only language Trump understands. On Wednesday, Von der Leyen urged European governments to reach for their own” levers of power” and in a “lawless world”, abandon their “traditional caution”. But Tocci is not convinced that EU leaders will do what it takes. My guess is that EU leaders will leave their economic options open and move to retaliatory tariffs only if Trump proceeds with his tariffs on 1 February.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom, long one of President Donald Trump's chief trolls, took the routine this week to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland – and got a globally televised rise out of the president. Newsom was in the crowd Wednesday when Trump called him out during a speech in which he again demanded Denmark cede control of Greenland to the US but also moved through a range of domestic and international issues. “We're going to help the people in California,” Trump said. A camera found Newsom in the room, smiling and appearing to chuckle. The moment was quickly clipped online, becoming more fodder for Trump and Newsom's social media teams and further highlighting Newsom's presidential ambitions. Speaking to CNN's Kaitlan Collins afterward, Newsom said Trump's address was “remarkably boring” and “remarkably insignificant.” “There wasn't anything new about that speech for the American audience,” the governor added. He also dismissed the president's demands for the US to acquire Greenland, including threats of military action before Trump backed off the aggressive stance in his speech Wednesday. Trump “was never going to invade Greenland,” he said. Talking to reporters on Tuesday before Trump's arrival, he accused attendees of “rolling over” for Trump, remarking that “I should have brought a bunch of kneepads for all the world leaders.” Nobel Prizes that are being given away. And I hope that people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage. I mean at least from an American perspective, it's embarrassing,” he said. Newsom's social media team has mimicked Trump's tone on social media, complete with all-caps sentences and “Thank you for your attention to this matter” signoffs, along with memes and AI-generated images that sometimes include personal attacks on critics. In an interview on “The Late Show” on CBS last year, the California governor explained his approach to Trump. “We put a mirror up to Trump, and the absurdity of what's going on in this country, the absurdity of Donald Trump.” Newsom wasn't the only potential 2028 candidate at Davos. Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer and Kentucky's Andy Beshear, participated in a forum on Wednesday. Beshear spoke to CNN's Collins after Newsom. “You saw him make fun of world leaders in the room, who we call friends. You saw him ramble on, in stories, and even try to do voices. This is really concerning and for the United States, frankly, embarrassing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine, not Greenland, should be the main priority for NATO, Mark Rutte, secretary general of the military alliance, said on Jan. 21 at a panel session at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. The pressure has led to a major crisis in U.S.-European relations. He said he was "worried that we might drop the ball focusing so much on these other issues." "Focus on Ukraine should be our number one priority, and then we can discuss all the issues, including Greenland," Rutte said. Rutte believes that public disputes could hinder diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the Davos forum on Jan. 20 that his country stands "firmly with Greenland and Denmark" and fully supports "their unique right to determine Greenland's future." He also said that Canada is working with "NATO allies (including the Nordic Baltic 8) to further secure the alliance's northern and western flanks, including through Canada's unprecedented investments in over-the-horizon radar, submarines, aircraft, and boots on the ground." Carney argued that Canada is "rapidly diversifying abroad," including through a comprehensive strategic partnership with the European Union." Oleg Sukhov is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. He is a former editor and reporter at the Moscow Times. He has a master's degree in history from the Moscow State University.

"I'm seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States," U.S. President Donald Trump said. "Focus in Ukraine should be our number one priority, and then we can discuss on all the issues, including Greenland," Rutte said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upends job markets in countries around the world, Nvidia Corp chief executive officer Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) brushed off longer term concerns and made the case that skilled vocational workers are seeing increasing demand now. Plumbers, electricians and construction workers are going to be able to command “six-figure salaries,” thanks to demand to build data centers that run and train AI, he said in an interview with BlackRock Inc CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland yesterday. The technology will require one of the biggest infrastructure buildouts in history, with trillions of dollars in new investment, Huang said. “We're seeing quite a significant boom in this area. “Everybody should be able to make a great living. Huang's comments echo remarks made at Davos on Tuesday by Palantir Technologies Inc CEO Alex Karp, who praised workers with “vocational training” and said AI would create more local jobs and largely eliminate the need for mass immigration. The company is on track to generate almost US$200 billion in data center chip sales for last year, according to an average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. To date, the bulk of its revenue comes from the biggest data center builders — Microsoft Corp, Meta Platforms Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc — but it's striking deals with a growing number of smaller data center operators. AI's impact on the job market is already being felt. Anthropic PBC CEO Dario Amodei has warned about a “white-collar bloodbath” that could wipe out 50 percent of entry-level jobs. The company's Claude AI is gaining attention for its coding abilities, a feature that could displace more junior programmers. Fink yesterday noticeably avoided probing Huang on sensitive topics, most notably China. Huang is expected to visit China at the end of this month as he works to reopen a crucial market for the company's AI chips. It's a pivotal time for the business, after the US moved to ease limits on chip exports to China it's had in place since 2022. Meanwhile, a key Republican lawmaker scheduled a committee vote yesterday for a bill that would give Congress power over AI chip exports, despite pushback from White House AI czar David Sacks, among others. Representative Brian Mast of Florida, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced the "AI Overwatch Act" last month after US President Donald Trump greenlighted shipments of Nvidia's powerful H200 AI chips to China. The legislation would give the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Banking Committee 30 days to review and potentially block licenses issued to export advanced AI chips to China and other adversaries. Vincent Wei led fellow Singaporean farmers around an empty Malaysian plot, laying out plans for a greenhouse and rows of leafy vegetables. What he pitched was not just space for crops, but a lifeline for growers struggling to make ends meet in a city-state with high prices and little vacant land. The future agriculture hub is part of a joint special economic zone launched last year by the two neighbors, expected to cost US$123 million and produce 10,000 tonnes of fresh produce annually. It is attracting Singaporean farmers with promises of cheaper land, labor and energy just over the border. US actor Matthew McConaughey has filed recordings of his image and voice with US patent authorities to protect them from unauthorized usage by artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, a representative said earlier this week. Many artists are increasingly concerned about the uncontrolled use of their image via generative AI since the rollout of ChatGPT and other AI-powered tools. The acquisition of a cleanroom in Taiwan would enable Micron to increase production in a market where demand continues to outpace supply, a Micron official said                                        Micron Technology Inc has signed a letter of intent to buy a fabrication site in Taiwan from Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (力積電) for US$1.8 billion to expand its production of memory chips. The acquisition includes an existing 12 inch fab cleanroom of 27,871m2 and would further position Micron to address growing global demand for memory solutions, the company said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 21 that Washington is seeking "immediate negotiations" to acquire Greenland, delivering the remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos as tensions between the United States and its European allies continue to rise. Trump's appearance in Davos came as European leaders had planned to press the U.S. president on security guarantees for Ukraine, only for Greenland to unexpectedly dominate the agenda. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark and home to about 56,000 people, has grown in strategic importance as Arctic ice melts, opening new shipping routes and access to mineral resources. Trump framed U.S. interest in Greenland as a protective measure rather than coercion, echoing arguments he has used to justify American claims over Venezuela's oil sector. "After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. In what seems like a shift in stance, Trump said he would not try to acquire Greenland by force, adding that the "military is not on the table," though he had previously left that option open. The U.S. president also made clear that he views the war in Ukraine primarily as a European responsibility, criticizing U.S. involvement and financial support. "What does the U.S. get out of all of this work, all of this money, other than death, destruction, and massive amounts of cash going to people who don't appreciate what we do," he said, adding that Europe "has to work on Ukraine," while the U.S. is separated by "a big, beautiful ocean." Trump also said he plans to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos, but Zelensky has said he will not attend, opting to remain in Ukraine amid Russia's strikes on energy infrastructure. The transatlantic dispute intensified after Trump renewed calls for the United States to acquire Greenland, earlier hinting he could use military force. During his Davos speech, he also criticized Europe more broadly, saying it was "not heading in the right direction." The tariff threat followed the arrival of European troops from France, Germany, and other countries in Greenland for military exercises, fueling concerns in European capitals that Trump's rhetoric is expanding into economic pressure. EU officials have since concluded that a coordinated response is necessary, with several options expected to be debated by leaders this week. European leaders, who had previously avoided direct confrontation with Trump over Greenland, have begun using firmer language as the dispute escalates. Trump is expected to hold talks with several European leaders during the forum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vaughan, Ont.-based GFL has announced it will shift its headquarters to Florida but remain incorporated in Ontario. Passive investors in U.S. benchmarks, including index funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), are expected to acquire between 10 and 15 per cent of GFL's public float, or 35 to 50 million of the company's shares, as the company joins U.S. stock benchmarks, according to sources familiar with the relocation strategy. “The relocation of our executive headquarters broadens our eligibility for participation in U.S. equity indices while preserving our eligibility for inclusion in Canadian equity indices,” GFL founder and chief executive officer Patrick Dovigi said in a news release. GFL's CEO said a U.S. head office will also help the company recruit and win more business from American clients, including municipal governments. “The United States has grown to represent over two thirds of our revenue, more than half of which is generated in the fast-growing southeastern region,” Mr. Dovigi said. “The relocation aligns with our expanding presence in this attractive market and is expected to improve our ability to attract highly-skilled talent,” he said. GFL is North America's fourth-largest waste disposal company, with 15,000 employees across Canada and 18 states. Rival Waste Connections Inc., based in Woodbridge, Ont., is a member of the S&P/TSX 60. Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. and RB Global Inc. (formerly known as Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers) have made similar moves, in part to attract a larger investor following. Brookfield moved its headquarters to New York while RB Global executives are based in Chicago. Last March, New York-based S&P Dow Jones Indices, which runs the S&P/TSX indexes, loosened the rules around inclusion to allow domestic companies to remain in the Canadian benchmark after moving their head office to another country. Institutional investors in Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd. and suitor Anglo American PLC are putting pressure on S&P Dow Jones to keep the new mining company in Canadian equity indexes when their merger closes. Teck's merger with Anglo is expected to close later this year. Membership in Russell indexes, which are owned by London Stock Exchange Group PLC, is based on publicly disclosed criteria. GFL has two significant shareholders, London-based private equity fund BC Partners and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which acquired stakes in the company in 2018 as part of a recapitalization. Expanding GFL's American shareholder base to include more passive and active investors will make it easier for BC Partners and Ontario Teachers' to sell their holdings. Tech founders leaving Canada at accelerating rate, survey finds GFL's large shareholders also include U.S. funds such as those run by Boston-based Fidelity Investments, Los Angeles-based Capital Group and Philadelphia-based Vanguard Group, all of which would support a larger American investor following at the company. Marie, Ont., who was drafted as a goalie by the Edmonton Oilers, founded GFL in 2007. The company has moved from picking up garbage with a fleet of bright green trucks into recycling, soil remediation and other environmental services. Last January, GFL sold a majority stake in its environmental services division to private equity funds Apollo Global Management and BC Partners for $6.2-billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading home Wednesday from a global gathering of political and business elites in Switzerland without meeting Donald Trump after delivering a major speech that blamed the U.S. President, without naming him, for rupturing the rules-based international order. ET, his office said – about the same time Mr. Trump arrived. Live: Trump delivers speech at Davos amid global uproar over U.S. threats to annex Greenland Mr. Carney is getting ready for a cabinet retreat in Quebec City rather than remaining at the World Economic Forum in the wake of his much-celebrated Tuesday speech, which called for middle powers to stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning, and instead build coalitions to survive in a new era where great powers prey on smaller countries to take what they want. Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a speech at the World Economic Forum that blamed U.S. President Donald Trump, without naming him, for what Carney described as a rupture in global relations. The Prime Minister's speech on Tuesday, for which he received a standing ovation, came days after an extraordinary threat by Mr. Trump to impose tariffs on European allies and Britain until Washington is allowed to acquire Greenland for strategic purposes. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. “I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn't so grateful. He said Canada only exists because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.” Trump repeated demands for control over Greenland in a speech at Davos, which also included a swipe at Prime Minister Mark Carney and the comment that, 'Canada lives because of the United States.' Opinion: Carney calls for resistance in a world of ravenous powers Asked why Mr. Carney would not remain in Davos to have a chat with Mr. Trump, Mr. Sidhu said the focus right now is trade diversification to a multitude of markets. More than 75 per cent of Canadian exports traditionally flow to the U.S. Ottawa and Washington are preparing for a review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that is expected to lead to U.S. demands for renegotiation of some chapters. Numerous hefty U.S. tariffs are still hurting Canadian industries, from steel to autos. After resetting damaged relations with China last week, Mr. Carney is soon headed to India to repair ties that ruptured in 2023 after former prime minister Justin Trudeau accused New Delhi of being behind the slaying of a Canadian Sikh activist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Mr. Sidhu said negotiations for a trade deal with India will launch in February. Robyn Urback: On our sovereignty, Canada must assume Trump will pursue the riskiest, dumbest path possible “When you talk about the Americans, they'll always remain important to Canada. “But you look at who else we want to deal with: China is our second-largest trading partner. After Mr. Nijjar's murder, Canada-India relations were further fractured in October, 2024, when the RCMP announced they had clear evidence that Indian government agents had been linked to homicides, extortions and other violent criminal activities in Canada. Ottawa followed up by expelling India's high commissioner and five other diplomats. Canadian authorities continue to investigate alleged transnational repression targeting Sikh activists domestically, with four Indian nationals now facing charges in the Nijjar case. Asked why Canada is warming up to India despite the alleged wrongdoings, Mr. Sidhu repeated Mr. Carney's recent rationale. “The Prime Minister has been clear: We want to see the world as it is, not as we wish it to be,” he said. Several European countries have sent troops to Greenland in recent days, saying they are there for Arctic security training, but U.S. President Donald Trump downplayed that development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Advances in hypersonic missile technology have left a glaring gap in the West's defences, and nobody but the US can fill it Europe and the US are in a full on dogfight over Greenland. Donald Trump's late-night Truth Social posts, lambasting America's European allies for their stance on the issue, prompted Emmanuel Macron to hit back against Washington in pointed terms: “We do prefer respect to bullies”. Even Britain's Sir Keir Starmer, careful with his words, condemned the tactic. But Danish officials are believed to be boycotting the 2026 Davos summit, where Trump is speaking on Wednesday. And Greenland's dog sled federation disinvited Trump's envoy from attending its annual race, after the president ridiculed Denmark for relying on “two dog sleds” to defend the Arctic island. Amid the fire and fury, few seem to be asking whether Trump's rationale for acquiring Greenland stacks up. It is easier to dismiss him as a megalomaniac driven by imperial ambitions. His push to acquire the world's biggest island is indeed motivated primarily by security – America's, Europe's and Greenland's. While Greenland is already incorporated in the US and Europe's security strategy, however, the emergence of novel technologies, such as hypersonic weapons, has exposed glaring gaps in the United States' early warning security architecture, making the country vulnerable to attacks from third powers, such as Russia and China. Trump wants to close these strategic vulnerabilities but believes it can only be done if the US has full control of Greenland. This is partly why, since the Second World War, the US has operated a military base in Greenland, monitoring anything that could be flying from Russia. Designed to alert US military commanders to incoming nuclear strikes, it is likely to be insufficient for detecting advanced weapons, such as hypersonic missiles, and warheads flying at low altitudes, such as Hypersonic Glide Vehicles and drones. Flying at hypersonic speeds of up to Mach 11 (11 times the speed of sound), many times faster than ordinary ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, there are concerns that the Oreshnik is nearly impossible to defend against. Besides, even if such a missile were to be intercepted, Greenland is right in the firing line. In a hypersonic scenario, he may have considerably less time than that, which may well explain Trump's sense of urgency about taking possession of the island. But he is the first one who has done so in this new context. During his first term, Trump established a new branch of the US military, the US space force, for which he was mocked by many. Trump did this because he understood that space is the next frontier of any future armed conflict, and that both Russia and China are gearing up for space warfare. Russia established its Space Troops in 2001, almost 19 years before the US did. Preserving American space superiority is essential to safeguarding US national security. Every aspect of US war-fighting doctrine is reliant on space – command and control, target acquisition, communications among the troops, synchronising operations – so Russia and China plan to disrupt or destroy our satellites in wartime or in the run-up to a conflict. To deter Moscow and Beijing from disabling or disrupting our war-fighters' “kill chain” – which if they succeed would prevent our weapons from reaching their targets – Trump gave a greenlight for space force to engage in previously unauthorised offensive counterspace operations. The US is believed to be significantly increasing its inventory of defensive and offensive counter-space weapon systems. Some of these assets could target Moscow's and Beijing's spacecraft. Many space force operations, aimed at safeguarding US and Europe's security, are conducted out of Greenland. It is why, last June, Trump shifted military responsibility for Greenland from the US European command (EUCOM) to the US northern command (NORTHCOM), which is responsible for protecting North America from missile strikes. Several 14- and 12-metre dishes make contact with polar-orbiting satellites 10 to 12 times a day. All of these operations are highly sensitive, requiring a special military unit, the 821st security forces squadron, dubbed the “Arctic wolves”, to provide Pituffik's internal security and perimeter defence. However, these units are likely to be optimised for ground defence against terrorists and special forces. These strategic assets may well be exposed to attacks by hypersonic missiles. Trump appears to want to have control over Greenland so he doesn't have to depend on Danish or local authorities when improving the security of US strategic assets on the island and mitigating the gaps in early warning systems. Some argue that this is unnecessary, because Denmark is already supposedly willing to allow the US to increase its military presence on the island. During my service at the US defence intelligence agency, I briefed multiple heads of US combatant commands and some threat briefings could not be attended even by their deputies because they were not authorised to receive the intelligence. Given that Greenland's GDP is only $3.3bn (£2.4bn) and a figure of $700bn (£521bn) for any purchase has been mooted, rejecting Trump's offer may not just be financially foolish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump will arrive in Davos three hours later than planned after he was forced to return to Washington because of electrical issues on Air Force One. The US president, who was on his way to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, turned around shortly after departure “out of an abundance of caution”, according to Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. No explanation was given for what caused the “minor electrical issue”. Mr Trump landed safely back at Joint Base Andrews in Washington and switched to a Boeing C-32A, which is primarily used to transport JD Vance, the vice-president. He took off again just after midnight local time (5am GMT). Mr Trump is en route to Switzerland, where he will meet world leaders amid strained relations with European allies. He is scheduled to give an address at 1.30pm GMT but this is likely to be delayed following the electrical issue. Technical problems with the jet are infrequent because it is meticulously maintained. Mr Trump's visit to Davos comes amid escalating tensions with European allies over the president's plan to take control of Greenland. The levy, which will also be imposed on seven other European countries, will rise to 25 per cent on June 1 unless they agree to let him take over Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark. Asked during a press conference on Tuesday how far he was willing to go to secure Greenland, Mr Trump told reporters: “You'll find out.” Asked whether the potential breakup of Nato was a price he was prepared to pay for the territory, the US president replied: “Something's going to happen that's going to be very good for everybody”. Greenland and Denmark have insisted the territory is not for sale.</p>
