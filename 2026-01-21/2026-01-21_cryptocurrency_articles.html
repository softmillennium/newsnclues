                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the current average cost for short-term holders, who have held the digital asset for less than 155 days—and are typically sensitive to price swings—they wrote in a Wednesday note. “One of the defining features of Bitcoin bear markets is promising relief rallies followed by violent sell-offs,” they wrote. “Last week's rally was BTC's strongest recovery since falling below the Short-term Holders' cost basis on 10/30.” Bitcoin hovered around $90,000 on Wednesday, after slipping as low as $87,900 the day before alongside tariff-fueled jitters stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed bid for Greenland. The analysts noted that long-term holders, who have held Bitcoin for more than six months, have been selling less recently. After a period of moderate selling in late November, the cohort's supply of coins has remained unchanged at 14 million Bitcoin, according to checkonchain. Compass Point signaled that it would feel “more comfortable buying the dip” if Bitcoin's price fell toward $80,000, but it warned that funding rates for perpetual futures remain elevated at 10%, suggesting that market participants are stepping in to buy Bitcoin with borrowed funds. The analysts explained that “leveraged dip buying can preclude another wave of liquidations if BTC moves lower near-term.” When Bitcoin fell from an all-time high of $126,000, a historic cascade of liquidations showed how quickly markets can shift when trades are forcibly closed. Last week, Bitcoin's 50-day average jumped above its 200-day average, a pattern that's widely interpreted as a bullish sign and referred to as a “golden cross.” At the time, Bitcoin was also closer to advancing past the psychological $100,000 mark. Jeff Park, CIO of crypto asset manager Bitwise, posited on X that on Tuesday that “this might be the worst Bitcoin sentiment ever.” With precious metals like gold and silver scaling new heights, he suggested that it's because investors feel Bitcoin “should be up 10x.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steak ‘n Shake is launching a bitcoin bonus program for hourly workers, giving $0.21 per hour worked that vests after two years, following its $10 million corporate bitcoin purchase. Starting March 1, hourly employees at company-operated Steak 'n Shake locations will earn a bitcoin bonus worth $0.21 for every hour worked. The rewards will vest after two years, meaning workers must remain employed for that period before they can access the accumulated bitcoin. The bonus is roughly equivalent to about 1% of the U.S. federal minimum wage and will be administered in partnership with Fold, a bitcoin rewards application. Employees will continue to receive their regular wages in dollars, with the bitcoin component treated as an additional incentive rather than a replacement for cash pay. Same-store sales rose more than 10% in the second quarter of 2025, according to company comments. Last week, Steak ‘n Shake disclosed that it had added $10 million worth of bitcoin to its balance sheet, marking one of the more significant treasury allocations to the asset by a consumer-facing restaurant brand. The company has also leaned into bitcoin-themed marketing, including the launch of a limited-time “Bitcoin Meal” in October that includes a small donation to open-source bitcoin development. The hourly bonus rate references bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, a symbolic nod frequently used in crypto culture. Last year, a company executive said that Bitcoin transactions were already outperforming expectations. “Bitcoin is faster than credit cards, and when customers choose to pay in Bitcoin, we're saving 50% in processing fees,” said Edwards.</p>

For years, blockchain has been discussed in automotive circles as a future technology — interesting, promising, but often framed as experimental or speculative. Blockchain is already operating in the automotive industry today. Not in consumer-facing applications or flashy pilot programs, but quietly inside some of the industry's most friction-heavy workflows: title and lien management, settlement, provenance, and compliance. The next phase of adoption will not be driven by “blockchain projects,” but by something far more practical: smart contracts. Blockchain isn't coming, it's already here The most successful blockchain implementations in automotive share a common characteristic: they solve real operational problems across multiple parties who do not fully trust one another and who rely on shared state. A clear example is digital title and lien management. Blockchain-backed title platforms are already live in multiple U.S. states, modernizing how ownership and liens are issued, transferred, and released. Payments are another area where blockchain has quietly crossed into production. Regulated stablecoins are now used by financial institutions to move value 24/7, reducing settlement delays and counterparty risk. While most automotive payments still flow through traditional rails, the infrastructure for faster, programmable settlement is now proven and operational. These examples matter because they demonstrate a key point: blockchain adoption in automotive is not driven by novelty. It is driven by the need to reduce latency, errors, disputes, and reconciliation costs in multi-party workflows. Smart contracts are the real value driver Blockchain on its own is simply a way to store shared state. Smart contracts encode business rules that all participants agree to in advance and then execute automatically when conditions are met. In an automotive context, that means contracts that can: —Release funds when a vehicle sale is finalized —Enforce fee splits and settlement waterfalls —Track ownership and lien states through defined transitions —Establish immutable provenance for condition reports, custody, and service history —Trigger downstream actions such as dispatch, payment, or insurance coverage This is not about replacing dealer management systems, auction platforms, or lender systems. Smart contracts operate above them as a neutral execution layer — connecting existing platforms and enforcing agreed-upon outcomes across organizational boundaries. In other words, smart contracts don't change how the industry works. Smart contracts can tie sale events to escrow, automate fee distribution, preserve tamper-evident condition records, and provide a shared audit trail when disputes arise. In logistics and insurance, contracts can link custody and location events to payment or coverage status, ensuring the right party is paid or insured at the right time. Across all of these use cases, the common theme is not automation for its own sake. The expected payoff When implemented selectively, blockchain-based smart contracts deliver value in four areas that matter to automotive operators: —Speed: Faster settlement, reduced funding delays, and fewer handoffs —Cost: Lower dispute resolution costs and less manual reconciliation —Trust: Verifiable records for ownership, condition, and custody —Auditability: Regulator-grade transparency without exposing sensitive data Importantly, these benefits compound. As more participants operate against the same shared rules and state, friction decreases across the entire network—not just at individual touchpoints. Why prudent adoption matters Despite real progress, blockchain adoption in automotive still fails when it is approached as a replacement technology or as a standalone platform. A shift in perspective The automotive industry does not need to decide whether it “believes in blockchain.” That question has already been answered by live deployments. The more important questions now are: —Which workflows benefit from shared, enforceable rules? —How can smart contracts complement existing platforms without disruption? The winners will be those who treat it not as a bet on the future, but as infrastructure for a more efficient present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Capybobo has created a unique niche as it has been able to blend gaming, NFT collectible and physical art toys to build a cohesive ecosystem. The project recently received $8 million in strategic funding spearheaded by Pluto Vision Labs with activities from industry observers such as Animoca Brands, HashKey Capital and Mirana Ventures. What makes Capybobo different from conventional GameFi projects is the project's innovative creation of value via “outfit blind boxes.” These digital NFTs represent physical dolls outfits; the digital currency provides a physical form of connection between blockchain and collectable toys. The platform has shown tremendous growth, gaining greater than 2 million users since its release and intending to launch the first flagship store in Hong Kong in 2026. The wallet supports major blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon with seamless one click integration to the KuCoin exchange for frictionless transfers of assets. HyperEVM support on KuCoin Web3 Wallet allows it to connect with over 100 decentralized applications, including DeFi, liquid staking, and gaming. This integration helps demonstrate HyperEVM's vision of providing wide-open gateways to the emerging blockchain ecosystem. KuCoin will provide customers with seamless access to Capybobo's gaming ecosystem through the KuCoin Wallet so that getting into gaming is easier than ever before for crypto enthusiasts. This coin fuels all community activities, from collecting digital skins to unlocking in-game incentives and participating in governance. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, PYBOBO's tokenomics ensure that the community engages over time rather than being excited by short-term excitement. The project just released Season 2 of the VWA (Virtual World Assets) game on January 16th, 2026 introducing better play-to-earn mechanics where players consume PYBOBO tokens in order to catch NFT Bobos. These digital assets can be fostered, and they can be used to mine for hash power, the early adopters gaining outlier portions of the mining pool. This partnership will help to solve a crucial issue in NFTs, which is the need to generate long-term value that does not rely on investment banking only about trading. For Capybobo, the partnership has brought valuable resources and infrastructure to help bring new users into their unique platform which links the digital and real-world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York, USA, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Watermark Investments today announced the launch of a new structured advisory framework designed to guide capital allocation across initial public offerings (IPOs), select regulated initial coin offering (ICO) structures, and bank-centered investment opportunities. The model integrates institutional due diligence processes, compliance review, and scenario-based risk assessment to support long-term investment planning. Under the framework, Watermark Investments will continue to operate within a clearly defined mandate focused on: As part of the framework rollout, Watermark Investments confirmed that artificial intelligence tools will be used to support data analysis, scenario modeling, and risk assessment. These tools are intended to enhance analytical capacity while preserving human oversight in decision making. "Technology can improve how information is processed, but investment judgment ultimately rests with experienced professionals,” Andy Okun, CEO said in a statement. "The framework is designed to ensure that AI supports analysis without replacing accountability, context, or regulatory judgment.” Watermark Investments stated that the framework reflects its global operating perspective while maintaining adherence to banking standards and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. The firm said this balance is essential for navigating cross-border investment environments responsibly. The firm combines experienced financial advisory leadership, disciplined risk management, structured governance, and technology-supported analysis to support long-term investment objectives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This shift is driven by the disruptive nature of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology, blockchain. This leads to the creation of new products, services and financial models. Crypto prices aren't just a barometer for market interest in digital finance; they are a catalyst for investment and growth in digital. Surging prices drive fintech startups into hyperactive mode, with accelerated product development, integration of blockchain and efforts to fund venture capital projects at faster rates. They integrate crypto wallets for buying, selling and holding digital assets. Additionally, they create tokens for specific needs, such as governance or rewards. Crypto volatility is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride, at times, and sometimes a disappointing trek downhill in pricing. Some fintech companies have now launched tools so users can work on managing volatility, including automated trading platforms, portfolio balancers and stablecoin-based wallets meant to mitigate risk. Specific tokens can help power AI and data-driven fintech solutions, provide infrastructure for faster, cheaper transactions, increase scalability and have potential for U.S. market growth in finance, known as utility tokens. Digital assets are closer now than in their early days to mainstream financial behavior, and they've become a more standard point of discussion. Fintech apps now more often integrate crypto buying, selling and spending functions. The accessibility of managing Bitcoin directly from mobile devices, some with user-friendly interfaces, is another aspect that is part of the greater mainstreaming effort. Some mainstream financial apps allow users to switch between traditional fiat and cryptocurrency investments. Another big plus for fintech platforms is the use of blockchain technology to complete secure transactions faster compared to some standard financial systems, many times with lower fees. What do rising prices as a trend mean for the market over time? While increased prices can boost collateral values and traffic on platforms, sharp declines can equal liquidations and tighter lending terms. Market cycles in general often lead to a boom and bust experience for investors, and that has a strong influence on sentiment. External economic conditions also place pressure on price trends, especially in times of upheaval. Volatile crypto markets equal a need for agile compliance solutions. These solutions include developing advanced KYC/AML tools, real-time monitoring and smart contract auditing systems. As the industry has faced high-profile problems with platform collapses and fraud, such as impersonator scams, the failings have exposed major gaps in investor protection. In comparison with traditional finance, no central authorities exist to reverse fraudulent transactions, so victims are ill-equipped to recover their losses through legal avenues. A group of consistent laws doesn't exist to handle problems and crimes that surround crypto assets. Different federal agencies in the U.S. classify these assets in different ways, seeing them as securities, commodities or property, leaving enforcement actions unclear and confusing. The driving force behind a demand for user education has ramped up interest in crypto prices. Fintech platforms now include learning tools to teach users the basics of investing, risk management and blockchain literacy. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are an upcoming, new-wave sector around the blockchain and crypto industry that is attracting significant capital recently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new comms lead, an institutions portal, and “Get in touch” CTAs suggest Ethereum thinks perception is becoming adoption. When the Ethereum Foundation dropped a thread on Jan. 19 claiming “Ethereum is the #1 choice for global financial institutions” and backing it with 35 cited examples, it moved past the standard protocol update or developer announcement. It read like institutional marketing: a ranked claim, a curated evidence stack, and a call-to-action funnel pointing readers to an owned landing page where financial institutions can browse live metrics and click “Get In Touch.” That shift in tone and structure matters because it signals something more strategic than routine developer communications. The Foundation is documenting what's happening on Ethereum while also actively fighting for control of the narrative about which blockchain institutions will choose as their settlement layer. And it's doing so at a moment when competing rails, particularly Solana, have been gaining mainstream credibility in institutional tokenization stories, while Ethereum itself has been painted as slowing down. In 2025, the Ethereum Foundation formalized “Comms & marketing” as an explicit management focus area, assigning it to Josh Stark as part of a broader effort to strengthen execution. That's a shift from the Foundation's historically decentralized, developer-centric communications posture. Making narrative work someone's formal responsibility means the organization can now mount coordinated, institution-facing campaigns rather than relying on ad-hoc community evangelism. It's a fully built funnel with a Data Hub that displays real-time network metrics, including ETH staked, stablecoin TVL, tokenized real-world assets, DeFi TVL, and layer-2 counts. First, competing institutional tokenization narratives have increasingly been attached to non-Ethereum rails. R3, the enterprise blockchain consortium whose clients include major banks, announced a collaboration with Solana in late 2024, framing it as bringing “big bank” tokenization efforts onto Solana's infrastructure. R3 followed up with plans for a Solana-native “Corda protocol” yield vault slated for the first half of 2026, adding more oxygen to the “institutions-on-Solana” storyline. That's a direct challenge to Ethereum's positioning as the default institutional settlement layer. Although these three blockchains account for just 33% of Ethereum's total market share, the accelerated growth rate raises an alert. Second, mainstream outlets began framing Ethereum as losing momentum. The Financial Times explicitly used “midlife crisis” language, contrasting Ethereum with faster, cheaper rivals and questioning whether the network could maintain its dominance amid intensifying competition. That kind of framing, published in an outlet read by the exact institutional decision-makers Ethereum wants to attract, raises the reputational cost of silence. Not all of the 35 items carry equal weight, and treating the thread as a truth table rather than a press release reveals useful nuance. Several claims are verifiably live with measurable activity. Fidelity issued its FDIT tokenized money market fund on the network. Amundi tokenized a share class of its CASH EUR money market fund. JPMorgan issued its deposit token on Base, an Ethereum layer-2. Stripe built stablecoin-based recurring billing into its payments stack. These are real products with issuer announcements, on-chain contracts, and in some cases disclosed volume or assets under management. JPMorgan moving JPMD onto Base signals a shift in how dollars move after hours. Here's what changes for ETH, stablecoins, and bank rails next. Tokenized real-world assets tracked by RWA.xyz total roughly $21.66 billion in distributed value. Those numbers are large enough that the “which chain wins institutions” question is no longer niche, but contested terrain with real economic stakes. If decision-makers at banks, asset managers, and fintechs begin internalizing the story that Solana is faster, cheaper, and more aligned with institutional needs, those perceptions can become self-fulfilling as liquidity and developer attention migrate. The same happens if these institutions believe that Ethereum is slowing down under its own weight. The Foundation's response appears to contest that narrative directly by arguing that Ethereum already serves as the institutional liquidity layer, backed by a curated stack of proof points and a self-service portal where institutions can verify claims and make contact. China Merchants Bank's Hong Kong unit moves a money market product onto BNB Chain. What it means for custody, redemptions, and ETH/SOL competition. The Jan. 19 post isn't important because it reveals new institutional deals. It's important because it reveals that the Ethereum Foundation now treats narrative control as a formal organizational capability rather than a byproduct of developer evangelism. Tapping institutional interest also requires actively shaping how that infrastructure is perceived by the institutions it wants to attract.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's central bank appears to have been using vast quantities of a cryptocurrency championed by Nigel Farage, according to a new report. Elliptic, a crypto analytics company, said it had traced at least $507m (£377m) of cryptocurrency issued by Tether – a company touted by the Reform UK leader – passing through accounts that appear to be controlled by Iran's central bank. Elliptic's report tracked what it says is the Iranian central bank's “systematic accumulation” of Tether stablecoins, a type of crypto that is pegged to the dollar so it can easily be exchanged for hard currency. In September, Farage revealed he was planning to raise Tether during a meeting with the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey. The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said. If you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform. Stablecoins are the way which money goes from conventional currencies through into cryptocurrencies and back again. Tether is about to be valued as a $500bn company.” Farage criticised Bailey for imposing restrictions on crypto and urged the UK to catch up with the US, where Donald Trump, who chose Howard Lutnick, Tether's banker, as his commerce secretary, has reversed efforts to police digital currencies. Farage added: “You know, stablecoins, crypto – this world is enormous, and I've been urging for years that London should embrace it. We should become a global trading centre for this stuff, under proper regulation.” One of Tether's major shareholders, the tech investor Christopher Harborne, is Reform's biggest donor. Suggestions that Harborne profits from Iran's use of Tether stablecoins were “baseless drivel”, the lawyers said. A spokesperson for Reform UK said “many companies and organisations across the globe” use Tether. They added: “All donations to Reform UK comply with electoral law and regulations. We continue to actively support the Iranian people in their fight for freedom.” Last year, Israel revealed what it said were dozens of crypto accounts used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards. His post contained two crypto account numbers the businessman said were used by Iran's central bank. It was through this apparently inadvertent disclosure that Elliptic's researchers found connections between 50 accounts, concluding with a “high level of confidence” that they were controlled by Iran's central bank. A Tether representative did not address questions about Iranian central bank use of its stablecoins, but said: “Tether maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward the criminal use of our financial products.” They added that Tether has collaborated with more than 310 law enforcement agencies across 62 countries and frozen more than $3.4bn in assets “linked to criminal activity”. Tether has frozen the suspected Revolutionary Guards accounts identified by Israel last year but most of those that appear to have been used by the Iranian central bank seem to remain active.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For any grievances under the Information Technology Act 2000, please get in touch with Grievance Officer, Mr. Anirban Mandal at data-query@nasscom.in. Blockchain-based fundraising has undergone a profound transformation over the past decade. ICOs emerged as a reaction against traditional venture capital gatekeeping. IEOs developed in response to the trust and security issues that plagued ICOs. Each model represents a trade-off between accessibility, security, decentralization, and operational complexity. The rise of specialized IDO development services and IDO platform development solutions reflects how fundraising has become a discipline requiring deep technical and strategic expertise rather than a one-time token sale event. Initial Coin Offerings were the first widely adopted blockchain fundraising model. There is no intermediary overseeing the sale, which initially made ICOs appealing for their openness and low barrier to entry. Token creation, basic smart contracts, and a frontend interface are often sufficient. Without standardized oversight, many ICOs suffered from weak governance, poor security practices, and, in some cases, outright fraud. By 2018, regulatory scrutiny intensified as authorities observed widespread investor losses. The absence of investor protection mechanisms and accountability led to a decline in ICO popularity. Strategically, ICOs demonstrated that decentralization without structure can undermine trust, particularly in high-stakes financial environments. Projects could raise capital quickly and globally, often without permission or approval. This allowed innovation to flourish, particularly in early blockchain experimentation. However, the lack of due diligence, liquidity guarantees, and post-sale accountability became systemic weaknesses. Initial Exchange Offerings emerged as a corrective mechanism to ICO shortcomings. This structure significantly reduces the likelihood of fraudulent launches, as exchanges have reputational incentives to maintain credibility. This introduces strategic trade-offs for projects that prioritize decentralization or community governance. IEOs improved investor confidence by leveraging exchange reputations and providing immediate liquidity. Tokens launched via IEOs typically experienced smoother market entry due to guaranteed listings and marketing exposure. Yet, the model favors well-funded projects capable of paying high listing and marketing fees. Smaller teams and experimental protocols often struggle to meet exchange requirements. Moreover, centralized control contradicts core Web3 principles, limiting innovation in governance and participation models. IEOs represent a middle ground between decentralization and institutional control—effective, but philosophically constrained. Initial DEX Offerings represent the most decentralized evolution of token fundraising. IDO development solutions emphasize transparency, permissionless participation, and immediate liquidity. Smart contracts automate token sales, allocation logic, and liquidity provisioning. As a result, IDOs require significantly more technical sophistication than ICOs or IEOs. The technical architecture underlying each fundraising model fundamentally shapes its behavior and risks. ICOs rely on relatively simple token sale contracts, often with minimal safeguards. IEOs integrate deeply with centralized exchange infrastructure, which handles order books, custody, and compliance. Automated market makers, liquidity pools, staking mechanisms, and governance contracts form an interconnected system. This makes IDO platform development significantly more complex, requiring expertise in smart contract engineering, gas optimization, and decentralized liquidity design. The IDO platform development process is not merely about launching tokens—it involves building resilient, auditable systems capable of withstanding adversarial market conditions. Liquidity is one of the most decisive strategic differences among ICOs, IEOs, and IDOs. ICOs often lacked immediate liquidity, leaving investors dependent on post-sale exchange listings. IEOs improved this by guaranteeing liquidity through centralized exchange markets. IDOs take liquidity one step further by embedding it directly into the launch process. Liquidity pools are created at launch, enabling instant trading and transparent price discovery. However, this also introduces volatility risks if liquidity ratios are poorly calibrated. Advanced IDO development services address this through liquidity locking, phased releases, and dynamic AMM parameters, stabilizing early market behavior. ICOs often lacked formal governance structures, while IEOs placed decision-making authority largely in the hands of exchanges. Token holders can participate in protocol decisions, treasury management, and roadmap evolution. IDO development agencies increasingly embed governance frameworks into token and platform design, recognizing that community alignment is critical to ecosystem resilience. ICOs were particularly vulnerable due to unaudited contracts and weak operational controls. While this eliminates custodial dependence, it increases exposure to code-level vulnerabilities. As a result, professional Initial DEX Offering development emphasizes rigorous audits, formal verification, and fail-safe mechanisms. Historical exploit data suggests that security investment during IDO platform development is directly correlated with long-term project viability. ICOs attracted early regulatory attention due to unregulated public offerings. IEOs align more closely with traditional compliance frameworks through centralized exchanges. Responsible IDO development solutions incorporate compliance awareness, transparent documentation, and adaptable launch structures to mitigate jurisdictional risk. Strategically, regulation has become a design constraint rather than an afterthought. IEOs are effective for teams seeking exchange credibility and centralized support. IDOs are best suited for projects committed to decentralization, community governance, and DeFi-native design. However, they demand higher technical sophistication and strategic planning, making collaboration with an experienced IDO development company essential. ICOs, IEOs, and IDOs represent distinct evolutionary stages in blockchain fundraising. Projects that approach IDOs as holistic ecosystem launches rather than fundraising events are best positioned for sustainable success.

Automated stock trading bots are now a common part of today's financial markets. The crypto market is no longer an experimental playground it has evolved into a mature digital finance ecosystem. Asset tokenization has fundamentally changed how value is created and exchanged in the digital economy. In the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape of 2026, centralized exchanges (CEXs) remain dominant gateways for traders, institutions, and retail users alike. As digital assets, blockchain applications, and Web3 platforms continue to gain enterprise adoption, businesses are increasingly required to offer secure and scalable crypto wallet functionality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will the tensions put a stop to Bitcoin's start-of-year recovery? Rising US and Japan bond yields signal macroeconomic stress, dragging the total crypto market capitalization 32% below its October 2025 peak. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) retested their lowest levels in more than two weeks after crypto and stock markets digested US President Donald Trump's fresh round of tariff threats. The S&P 500 index fell 1.9%, while gold prices surged to a new all-time high on Tuesday. Yields on the five-year US Treasury climbed to their highest level in almost six months, a move often linked to fears of recession or rising inflation. Investors demanded higher returns to hold US government debt, signaling weakening confidence. Billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio told CNBC that a “new phase of global financial conflict” may be emerging as foreign governments reassess their exposure to US assets amid growing uncertainty and economic strain. Dalio said that history provides several examples where economic disputes expanded beyond trade into capital flows. While this backdrop could appear favorable to those who view cryptocurrencies as an alternative monetary system, silver has been the standout performer so far, rising 64% since December. The precious metal's market capitalization has climbed to $5.3 trillion. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Tuesday that any response to US threats would be “unflinching, united, and proportional,” increasing fears of negative spillovers into equity markets. Bitcoin ranked as the eighth-largest global tradable asset with a market capitalization of $1.8 trillion, but competitors such as TSMC (TSMC US) and Saudi Aramco (2222 SR) are rapidly closing the gap. Ether's position appears more fragile, with a $360 billion market capitalization, placing it 42nd overall after being overtaken by Home Depot (HD US) and Netflix (NFLX). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is down 32% from its all-time high reached in October 2025. Investor attention has shifted toward macroeconomic risks as the world's largest central banks face mounting pressure from higher debt issuance costs. According to a TD Securities report, the move in Japan has spilled over into the US, the United Kingdom, Canada and other markets, serving as “a warning sign to heavily indebted nations that bond markets can turn rapidly if fiscal policy loses credibility.” These contagion risks are particularly concerning amid heightened geopolitical tensions, leaving the cryptocurrency market exposed.
