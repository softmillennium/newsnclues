                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek looks to extend one of the longest Grand Slam consistency runs of the Open Era as Madison Keys, Elena Rybakina and Belinda Bencic face tricky opponents. “I think obviously started a little slow today and definitely nervous,” said Madison Keys, reflecting on the opening set of her Australian Open title defense. Two qualifiers, Maddison Inglis and teenager Nikola Bartunkova, won first-set tiebreaks, then hung on to win in three. “Doesn't matter to overanalyze it,” Swiatek said afterward. Perhaps Thursday's second-round matches from the bottom half of the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz draw will be less stressful and more conventional. Swiatek survived qualifier Yuan Yue and now faces a more familiar opponent in Bouzkova, who handled Renata Zarazua 6-2, 7-5 to get here. She's still only 24 years old, and it's easy to take Swiatek's consistency for granted. Anisimova had a more routine first-round win, 6-3, 6-2 over Simona Waltert and similarly Siniakova defeated Panna Udvardy 6-1, 6-2. Anisimova, who briefly slipped ahead of Coco Gauff for the No. 3 ranking, has high hopes after reaching two Grand Slam finals last year. Just trying to find that extra edge anywhere I can, same as last year.” This is only major in which Anisimova has failed to reach at least the quarterfinals; she's made the fourth round three times. Only Aryna Sabalenka (96), and Naomi Osaka (93) hit more aces than Anisimova's 76 in last year's Grand Slams. In her 13th main draw here, Siniakova -- the world's No. Rybakina limited Gracheva to only three games in each of those previous contests. “She can play really well on the baseline,” Rybakina noted. I think the most important thing is to focus on my game. In a 6-4, 6-3 opening win over Kaja Juvan, Rybakina served five aces and zero double faults. Gracheva was a 6-1, 2-6, 6-1 winner over Viktorija Golubic, converting seven break points. Rybakina is 3-3 in second-round matches at the Australian Open. She has won six straight second-rounders; the last loss at that stage came two years ago, to Anna Blinkova. A win would equal Gracheva's best result in Melbourne. She's won 11 of her past 12 meetings against fellow Americans -- losing over that span only to Coco Gauff in Wuhan's final. One of those wins was a 7-5, 6-2 victory over Kessler last February. In the past five years, only Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek have reached the third round here more (five) than Pegula (four). With 35 main-draw wins, the Australian Open is Keys' most successful tournament. Her 35-10 record (.778) is surpassed only by Sabalenka (.867) and Naomi Osaka (.794). 62, has now made the second round in four consecutive Grand Slams. She's 1-10 against Top 10 players, beating Rybakina last year in Miami. If Keys and Pegula each win two more matches, they'd meet in the fourth round. Three weeks into 2026, there are only three undefeated players left -- Sabalenka, (the Brisbane champion), Elina Svitolina (Auckland) and Bencic (United Cup MVP). This is Bartunkova's first match against a player ranked in the Top 10. Osaka went on to win four Grand Slam singles titles, two of them at Melbourne Park. 7:00 p.m.-- James Duckworth (AUS) vs. Jannik Sinner (ITA) [2]Followed by-- Elena Rybakina (KAZ) [5] vs. Varvara Gracheva (FRA) 7:00 p.m.-- Naomi Osaka (JPN) [16] vs. Sorana Cirstea (ROU)Followed by-- Jaume Munar (ESP) vs. Casper Ruud (NOR) [12] -- Oksana Selekhmeteva vs. Paula Badosa (ESP) [25]Followed by-- Hubert Hurkacz (POL) vs. Ethan Quinn (USA)-- Elise Mertens (BEL) [21] vs. Moyuka Uchijima (JPN)-- Denis Shapovalov (CAN) [21] vs. Marin Cilic (CRO) -- Karen Khachanov [15] vs. Nishesh Basavareddy (USA)Followed by-- Not before 1:00 p.m.-- Maddison Inglis (AUS) vs. Laura Siegemund (GER)-- Tomas Machac (CZE) vs. Stefanos Tsitsipas (GRE) [31]-- Nikola Bartunkova (CZE) vs. Belinda Bencic (SUI) [10] -- Ray Ho (TPE) / Hendrik Jebens (GER) vs. Simone Bolelli (ITA) / Andrea Vavassori (ITA) [7]-- Shuai Zhang (CHN) / Tim Puetz (GER) [6] vs. Nicole Melichar-Martinez (USA) / Yuki Bhambri (IND)-- Matthew Romios (AUS) / Ryan Seggerman (USA) vs. Alexander Erler (AUT) / Robert Galloway (USA)-- N.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Aryna Sabalenka made the necessary adjustments to get past Bai Zhuoxuan, while Anastasia Potapova recovered from a tense opening set to upset Emma Raducanu, setting up a third-round meeting between the two. The win sets up a third-round showdown with two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka, who advanced through to the last 32 in 1 hour and 12 minutes in a 6-3, 6-1 over Chinese qualifier Bai Zhuoxuan. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play A third meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz now awaits between Sabalenka and Potapova, who most recently played in Rome last year. Both players were tested in their respective second-round matches Wednesday, but eventually prevailed in straight sets. When Sabalenka raced through the first five games against Bai in 15 minutes, she looked as though she'd score a seventh consecutive win to start 2026 with ease. But after the match time doubled in the next three games -- all of which went to World No. 702 Bai, who found her footing inside Rod Laver Arena and left Sabalenka frustrated with impressive rally tolerance and variety -- the top seed found herself flummoxed. "She really stepped up in the first set, and for a minute, I was like, 'What should I do? She's crushing it,'" Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. I think it gave me a little more confidence that my game was there ... I was trying to tell myself, 'One at a time, it's OK, it's going to come back, you're OK, keep fighting, keep trying,' and I'm glad I did it well." Serving at another deuce in the ninth game, Sabalenka hammered down an unreturnable serve to earn a seventh set point, cracked another to win the set, and eventually cruised through to the last 32 in 1 hour and 12 minutes, 6-3, 6-1. Despite hitting 14 of her 21 unforced errors across the first nine games, she finished the victory with 24 winners. She hasn't lost to a player outside the Top 100 in more than three years -- last losing such a match to former Top 20 player Kaia Kanepi at the 2022 US Open. Initially, it seemed Raducanu was on her way to taking the first set. With a pair of forehand winners by Raducanu and a couple of Potapova unforced errors, she sprinted to a 4-2 first set lead, and Potapova dropped her racquet and looked her coach's corner in frustration. That's when it all changed for the Austrian. After trading holds, Potapova trailed 5-3, but managed to set up double-break point in the 10th game -- she displayed stellar court coverage after a Raducanu drop shot and hit a forehand winner, one of 25 Wednesday. "I didn't do anything different the whole match," Potapova said. "I felt like we both struggled a little bit on serve, because it was not easy conditions to play. The first set ultimately went to a tiebreak, where Potapova hit a pair of forehand winners and Raducanu had four unforced errors to give the Austrian to first set win. Potapova carried that first-set win into the second, getting two breaks and a hold for a 3-0 lead that propelled Potapova for victory. Interestingly, Potapova has been playing with a fractured left finger, affecting her backhand. She isn't going to have a procedure, but rather let it heal on its own. "Every time that we played before, I learned something new after the match, so I really kind of looking forward for the match," Potapova said. Yeah, will just try to go there and make the best out of it." However, this will be third first hard-court meeting. Sabalenka's power will be a different test than what Potapova has faced as the Austrian looks to advance to Round of 16 for the first time ever at the Australian Open. Sabalenka made it known she's not thinking about previous matches against any of her opponents. "Doesn't matter what the head-to-head looks like. Elina Svitolina also continued her hot start to the 2026 season with a second-round 7-5, 6-1 win over Linda Klimovicova. The Ukrainian remains undefeated this year after her title at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. 23 seed Shnaider saved three match points against Australian wild card Talia Gibson in a comeback 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 win. "Thank God it was on my serve," Shnaider said. "I just try to go for my serve and then just rally, but don't be, like, too defensive, because obviously she's a big hitter. If would slow it down a little bit, be a little bit more defensive, she would step in and just rip it. "I just tried to be, you know, play safe, but at the same time, also aggressive so I didn't give her a lot of opportunity." 11 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the first round, Turkish qualifier Zeynep Sonmez won her second-round match against Anna Bondar 6-2, 6-4 with an enormous amount of Turkish support in the crowd. She's now in the third-round for the second time at a Grand Slam, and will face Yulia Putintseva. Last year at Wimbledon, she became the first Turkish player to reach the final 32 at a Slam. "In Wimbledon when I was playing third round, it was similar to this, but I think today. "In Wimbledon also there were many people, and my first round here, too, there were many people. But today, I have never experienced something like this." 1 Aryna Sabalenka made the necessary adjustments to get past Bai Zhuoxuan, while Anastasia Potapova recovered from a tense opening set to upset Emma Raducanu, setting up a third-round meeting between the two.</p>

In general, as I said, it's just about those feelings.“Those comments with my team after the match help me a lot in the next round see the things more clear.” “When you're watching the match from outside, everything is more clear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's bid to complete a Career Grand Slam met major resistance Wednesday at the Australian Open. But after he battled back from a break down in a titanic opening set against Yannick Hanfmann, the Spaniard separated from the No. 1 all he could handle by combining a rock-solid baseline performance with well-timed attacks in Rod Laver Arena. The German, who led 3-1 in the set and saved two break points at 5-5, later built a 4/3 lead in the tie-break before Alcaraz rattled off four straight points. "I didn't see myself [as having played] that good. So hopefully being better in the next round." While he maintained a high level after the disappointing end to the opening set, Alcaraz was relentless in stretching his lead. Though it did not show in his tennis, Hanfmann was also affected by an apparent oblique injury that required treatment from the physio in between the second and third sets.

On the golf course, it's a really beautiful swing." While the 22-year-old Alcaraz has been playing golf for about five years — all throughout his professional career — the 44-year-old Federer waited until after he retired to pick up the sport. "I think he's been playing for two years now, and his level is really, really good for two years," Alcaraz said. "I've been playing five and he's already beating me! 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings had no such problems. His 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-2 victory against Hanfmann moved him into the third round without the loss of a set — though he needed 78 minutes to win a dramatic opening set against the German.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The look on Francesco Maestrelli's face said it all Monday at Melbourne Park. I dreamed a lot about these matches and for me, it was a dream to participate in the first [major main draw] of my career,” Maestrelli told ATPTour.com. “I didn't imagine winning a five-set match on my debut on the Tour, and I'm so excited and so happy.” It was not only Maestrelli's first major main draw match, but just his second tour-level match overall. Maestrelli will next take on 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic. “They told me that there was the chance to play Djokovic and it will be one of the most exciting things of my life,” Maestrelli said. The four-time ATP Challenger champion has never practised with Djokovic or had a formal conversation with him. Maestrelli has said “Ciao!” to the Serbian a few times over the years, but he will have to be ready to take on the 24-time major titlist Thursday in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. But it took more than three years for him to move into the Top 150. “But you have to know also there are bad moments when the results don't come. Maestrelli trained at the Italian Federation's local centre since he was 16. But two years ago, Maestrelli moved a two-hour drive away from Pisa to Sinalunga, where he trains under Giovanni Galuppo and Gabrio Castrichella. Then I tried to go and [not] think about it, and maybe, [now that it is] two years later, I can say that it was the right decision.” Outside of tennis, Maestrelli enjoys playing basketball. His favourite player is Charlotte Hornets star LaMelo Ball because of his creativity on the court. The Italian also loves watching hometown football team Pisa Sporting Club. I'm going to try to serve as fast as possible, because I know that in the rallies, maybe he is better than me.

She had just won the 2017 Canadian Open and I was the last stop of her post-match media tour. For the last three years, Svitolina has had to be strong, not only for herself as she navigates a comeback from maternity leave in her 30s, but also for her family as she supports a husband in the final stage of his own career and for a country looking to her for light and inspiration amidst an un-ending invasion.“I'm a person that's a fighter,” Svitolina told me, somewhat stating the obvious. “I go through a lot when I'm on the court, and when you're not in the right state of mind, it's impossible to win.” For the last three years, Svitolina has had to be strong, not only for herself as she navigates a comeback from maternity leave in her 30s, but also for her family as she supports a husband in the final stage of his own career and for a country looking to her for light and inspiration amidst an un-ending invasion.“I'm a person that's a fighter,” Svitolina told me, somewhat stating the obvious. “I go through a lot when I'm on the court, and when you're not in the right state of mind, it's impossible to win.” “I go through a lot when I'm on the court, and when you're not in the right state of mind, it's impossible to win.” After giving birth to daughter Skaï, she came back employing far more offense without sacrificing the athleticism that took her to No. In 11 Grand Slam outings since becoming a mother, she has made the second week at seven; her pinnacle came at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships when she stunned then-world No. 1 Iga Swiatek to reach the semifinals.She began 2025 in that proverbial second line of players capable of big results at major tournaments and eager to keep tweaking to find that championship formula, changing her racquet and following a strict diet to emerge in better shape than ever. Though she initially made good on that mission with back-to-back quarterfinals at the Australian Open and Roland Garros, external pressures were taking their toll on the tour's foremost activist on behalf of the ongoing war in Ukraine.Where other players can focus purely on practice schedules, Svitolina has led multiple charitable initiatives to support her compatriots, and her very presence on tour represents something greater for those at home and on the front lines.“I feel like I have these obligations,” she explained, “to be good and to fight and to continue bringing the good news.” She began 2025 in that proverbial second line of players capable of big results at major tournaments and eager to keep tweaking to find that championship formula, changing her racquet and following a strict diet to emerge in better shape than ever.

In position to lead Ukraine into the championship match, she lost a decisive rubber to Jasmine Paolini from a set up.“After Billie Jean King Cup, I was not feeling well,” she said. “I felt lots of things were on my shoulders. For me in that moment, I couldn't fight anymore.”Svitolina posted a powerful statement to social media in the days that followed, announcing her decision to shut down her 2025 season in the interest of “giving \[herself\] the space to heal and recharge.”“It was maybe a surprising decision because I was in the Race [to the WTA Finals in Riyadh] and maybe had those opportunities,” mused Svitolina, who ended the season ranked at No. It's about the mental health you have to take care of. “After Billie Jean King Cup, I was not feeling well,” she said. “I felt lots of things were on my shoulders.

Now 31, the Odesa native has erred towards a more conservative schedule in her second career, hoping to preserve her physical—and now mental—health as her Grand Slam prospects remain viable.“With experience over the years, I've faced different situations, but it's not the same as when you start your career. You're like, fired up and ready to conquer the world!” Svitolina said with a laugh. “As you get older, you have a lot in your backpack and you've picked up a lot of stones, so it's not easy to deal with all of that.”Standing by Svitolina through those uncertain months was husband and fellow Gaël Monfils, who has long felt the support from his “g.e.m.s. life” partner through his own physical and emotional struggles on the back half of a 20-year career.“All the time [she was] telling me, pushing me through, out of the limits a little bit,” said Monfils, who will officially retire at the end of 2026. It was a great decision for her. “With experience over the years, I've faced different situations, but it's not the same as when you start your career.

It was a great decision for her. With her team's blessing, Svitolina unplugged from the game, taking a month away from tennis entirely as she prioritized time with family.“This is the only way to do it for me,” said Svitolina, “because when you're too much in it, you see other people doing well and winning, and it's a natural feeling to get overwhelmed and nervous in reaction to that. You're not seeing the picture clearly, so for me, it helps to step back completely, stop a little bit. It can be for one week maybe, and you skip a tournament. I skipped a few at the end of the year because it was a little too late, but stepping back is the way that works.”With Skaï at home—"She's busy going to birthdays and spending time with her friends”—Svitolina arrived in Auckland for the ASB Classic fully refreshed and facing a unique opportunity. “This is the only way to do it for me,” said Svitolina, “because when you're too much in it, you see other people doing well and winning, and it's a natural feeling to get overwhelmed and nervous in reaction to that.

It's something to remember in ten years, we'll talk about winning the same tournament. For a player who has learned what it means to sacrifice for greater goals, that would be a picture she looks more than ready to take.“It really shows that it was good that I took some time off. Undefeated through her first seven matches, Svitolina is into the third round in Melbourne and in with a chance to return to the Top 10 for the first time since her comeback.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young tennis stars Iva Jovic and Victoria Mboko, both rising talents on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, have a close friendship. They are seeded for the Australian Open, with Mboko at No. In Melbourne, they are playing doubles together as "Team Joboko" and are enjoying their journey together in the professional circuit. There's an old saying in professional sports that it's hard to be friends with the people you're trying to beat. But for Iva Jovic and Victoria Mboko, two of the fastest-rising talents on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, that adage couldn't be less true. That's a snapshot of what's been a meteoric rise by both: Less than three years ago, they were playing each other in juniors, as Mboko defeated Jovic in the third round of girls' singles at the 2022 US Open. "She killed me," Jovic said, remembering of that meeting in Flushing Meadows. They've met three times already in their professional careers. During the year's first Grand Slam 12 months ago, both were in Rome, Georgia. Mboko beat Jovic in the first round on her way to the title, and took home just over $9,000 in prize money. That, at this stage, might be a longshot. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini certainly figure to be amongst the players who'll have something to say about the prospect. But they're getting time on court together regardless in Melbourne as doubles partners -- and the team that fans have already dubbed "Joboko" won their first-round match over Ulrikke Eikeri and Ingrid Neel on Tuesday in straight sets. That these teen titans found levity even in tense moments shouldn't come as a surprise, as Jovic shares: "She's [Mboko] just such a funny kid. I mean, she's an unbelievable player, but she's so goofy off the court, and we have so much fun together." "We kind of just did the whole path together," she adds, "and it's really nice to see her doing so well and to kind of be here together."
