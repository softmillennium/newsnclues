                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multidisciplinary team from Harvard Medical School, Duke University, and Massachusetts General Hospital has developed the dual-scale Capillary-Cell (CapCell) microscope, a revolutionary tool for visualizing tumor metabolism and vasculature dynamics. Tumors are not uniform; they contain diverse regions with varying metabolic activities and blood supply. This heterogeneity is a major driver of treatment failure and recurrence. The newly developed CapCell microscope addresses this challenge by combining widefield imaging, which captures large-scale patterns across an entire tumor, with high-resolution imaging that zooms in on cellular and microregional features. In this study, the team used the platform to monitor mouse models of breast cancer (4T1 tumors) before and after treatment with Combretastatin A-1 (CA1), a vascular-disrupting agent. The system tracked key metabolic indicators-mitochondrial membrane potential (using TMRE) and glucose uptake (using 2-NBDG)-alongside detailed maps of blood vessel density and distribution. Immediately after the first CA1 treatment, both overall metabolism and vessel density dropped significantly. Intriguingly, within micro-regions, high mitochondrial activity was associated with areas of dense vasculature, while elevated glucose uptake was more common in poorly vascularized zones-highlighting distinct metabolic adaptations based on local conditions. By this later time point, metabolic activity had largely recovered to baseline levels, even though the vascular network remained sparse and did not regenerate correspondingly. This suggests a temporal decoupling between vascular supply and metabolic function. The CapCell system offers a 12-fold increase in optical power for high-resolution imaging by concentrating light into a specific field of view, significantly improving signal detection for faint metabolic fluorescence. Its relatively simple hardware also makes it adaptable for various laboratory and potentially clinical settings.

A total of 242 individuals with ACS were included in this study. Clinical data were collected, and the severity of coronary stenosis was evaluated with the Gensini and Syntax scoring systems. Multivariate analysis, after adjustment for confounding factors, identified TGM2 as an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio: 44.292 per 100 pg/mL increase in TGM2; 95% CI: 2.491-7.398; P < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 477 days, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with higher TGM2 levels (≥91.9 pg/mL) exhibited a significantly lower MACE-free survival rate (P = 0.0142). ROC curve analysis further revealed that combining TGM2 and Gensini scores yielded superior predictive performance for MACE to that of either parameter alone. Furthermore, it provides prognostic information for MACE, particularly when it is used in combination with established anatomical risk scores. Guo, Z., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team at UT Southwestern Medical Center this week became the first in Texas and neighboring states to successfully perform a novel procedure to deliver whole-liver chemotherapy to treat metastatic uveal melanoma, a rare and deadly eye cancer. Approved for use in adult patients by the Food and Drug Administration in 2023, Hepzato Kit involves a percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) delivery method utilizing a series of specialized balloon catheters and filtration units to isolate the liver blood flow and deliver high doses of the chemotherapy drug melphalan via the hepatic artery to the entire liver. Adrienne Shannon, M.D., Assistant Professor of Surgery and a surgical oncologist at UT Southwestern, led the team during Thursday's procedure to treat a 72-year-old man with multifocal hepatic tumors. Hepzato is only available on a selective basis under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), and fewer than three dozen medical centers nationwide currently offer the therapy. Dr. Shannon worked with a highly trained team of UT Southwestern staff and fellow faculty members to deliver the therapy. They include interventional radiologists led by Sanjeeva Kalva, M.D., Patrick Sutphin, M.D., Ph.D., and Seung Kim, M.D., M.B.A.; anesthesiologists led by Steven Zheng, M.D. Dr. Kalva is a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. "Hepzato is the only FDA-approved treatment that treats the whole organ and has been proved to shrink tumors, translating into more effective disease control and potential survival benefit," said Sanjay Chandrasekaran, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology and the physician lead for the Multi-Histology and Precision Oncology Program (MPOP) Disease Oriented Team in the Simmons Cancer Center. Treating this deadly disease is about creating opportunity – the opportunity for patients to have access to a wide scope of options, including systemic therapies, clinical trials, and liver-directed treatments," said Dr. Chandrasekaran, who has received institutional funding to grow the uveal melanoma program at UT Southwestern. About 50% of uveal melanoma patients are at risk for metastatic disease, sometimes years after successful treatment of the primary eye tumor. Melphalan, a chemotherapy drug that targets tumor cells by binding to and cross-linking DNA strands and halting their replication, is infused directly into the liver's main artery. The proprietary drug/device from Delcath Systems Inc. relies on veno-venous bypass and an extracorporeal filter system to effectively contain the drug within the liver and its blood vessels, allowing high doses to be delivered with limited systemic side effects. A multicenter phase three study (the FOCUS trial) included 91 individuals who received Hepzato. The FOCUS study also found an overall survival rate of 80% after one year, and 65% of patients were progression-free at six months. It is then diverted to a filtration system designed to extract the drug from the patient's system before blood is returned to the patient's circulating blood volume. Afterward, the patient is typically monitored for up to 24 hours for potential complications, such as bleeding risks or low blood counts. Most patients are able to resume their normal activities within 48 hours. "This approach will improve our patient's progression-free survival, and it is a far more effective option for him than other liver-directed methods that only treat one segment of the liver at a time," Dr. Shannon said. After a detailed multidisciplinary review, this patient was determined to be an excellent candidate for Hepzato based on his physical fitness, adequate liver function, and tumor size with less than 50% of liver involvement by tumor. Through the MPOP clinical trials team, the Simmons Cancer Center is planning to offer Hepzato to select patients with metastatic breast and colorectal cancers in the near future. This achievement exemplifies the strength of UT Southwestern as a premier institution for interdisciplinary patient care, discovery-driven research, and the development of breakthrough therapies. It's an exciting moment for our expanding ocular oncology program as we rapidly establish UT Southwestern as a national destination for patients with eye cancers." Dr. Harbour developed prognostic tests that are now standard of care for ocular melanoma and part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for prognostication and risk stratification for this cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emotions are a fundamental part of human psychology-a complex process that has long distinguished us from machines. Even advanced artificial intelligence (AI) lacks the capacity to feel. However, researchers are now exploring whether the formation of emotions can be computationally modeled, providing machines with a deeper, more human-like understanding of emotional states. In this vein, Assistant Professor Chie Hieida from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan, in collaboration with Assistant Professor Kazuki Miyazawa and then-master's student Kazuki Tsurumaki from Osaka University, Japan, explore computational approaches to model the formation of emotions. In a recent study, this team of researchers built a computational model that aims to explain how humans may form the concept of emotion. Emotions arise from integrating internal bodily signals (interoception, like heart rate) with external sensory information (exteroception, like sight and sound), allowing the brain to create a concept, not just a reflex. "Although there are theoretical frameworks addressing how emotions emerge as concepts through information processing, the computational processes underlying this formation remain underexplored," says Dr. Hieida. To model this process, the research team used multilayered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (mMLDA), a probabilistic generative model designed to discover hidden statistical patterns and categories by analyzing how different types of data co-occur, without being pre-programmed with emotional labels. The developed model was trained using unlabeled data collected from human participants who viewed emotion-evoking images and videos. The system was not informed about which data corresponded to emotions such as fear, joy, or sadness. Instead, it was allowed to identify patterns on its own. 29 participants viewed 60 images from the International Affective Picture System, which is widely used in psychological research. While viewing the images, researchers recorded physiological responses such as heart rate using wearable sensors and collected verbal descriptions. This was significantly higher than would be expected by chance, suggesting that the model categorized emotion concepts that closely matched how people experience emotions. By modeling emotion formation in a way that mirrors human experience, this research paves the way for more nuanced and responsive AI systems. Moreover, because the model can infer emotional states that people may struggle to express in words, it could be particularly useful in mental health support, healthcare monitoring, and assistive technologies for conditions such as developmental disorders or dementia. "This research has important implications for both society and industry, as it provides a computational framework that connects emotion theory with empirical validation, addressing the long-standing question of how emotions are formed," concludes Dr. Hieida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rice University's SynthX Center, directed by Han Xiao, has received an up to five-year, $18 million award from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) Lymphatic Imaging, Genomics and pHenotyping Technologies (LIGHT) program to develop innovative solutions for lymphatic diseases. This award from ARPA-H is a powerful validation of Rice's commitment to transformative research that addresses urgent health needs. This work exemplifies how bold science and cross-disciplinary collaboration can lead to real-world solutions with the potential to improve and even save lives." R Hughes Provost and executive vice president for academic affairs He is collaborating with co-investigator Lei Li, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, and researchers from Texas Children's Hospital, the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. This project will integrate photoacoustic imaging with proteomic tools to map lymphatic vessels and detect biomarkers. "This is exactly the kind of visionary, high-impact science we champion at Rice. It pushes the boundaries of discovery and drives meaningful advances in human health." By enabling early, high-resolution imaging and biomarker-based diagnostics, the research team aims to facilitate accurate diagnoses, improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care burden associated with these diseases. "Our goal is to create a system that provides real-time insights into the lymphatic system with unprecedented resolution, depth and safety," Xiao said. The lymphatic system is crucial for maintaining fluid balance, immune responses and waste clearance; however, its tiny vessels are notoriously difficult to image. Traditional imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scans and ultrasound, often lack the spatial resolution or contrast needed to visualize the microscopic structure of lymphatic vessels deep within tissues. The VISTA-LYMPH method uses a specialized imaging technique called photoacoustic tomography (PAT), developed in Li's lab. Li, who is the product development lead for this project and a pioneer in photoacoustic imaging, is also a member of Rice's Digital Health Initiative. PAT combines light and sound, enabling it to visualize the body in greater depth and clarity than methods that rely solely on light. Early tests were conducted on animals without causing harm, successfully visualizing the entire body in fine detail. This level of precision is crucial for mapping the lymphatic system in areas such as the arms, legs, torso and neck, Li said. "Thanks to ARPA-H's award, we will build the most advanced PAT system to image the body's lymphatic network with unprecedented resolution and speed, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis," Li said. Many patients with lymphatic diseases do not present identifiable genetic mutations, and tissue biopsies can be invasive or impractical. The researchers expect this tool to help them uncover new biological markers that indicate changes in health. In addition to lymphedema, the insights gained may also assist in managing conditions associated with lymphatic dysfunction, such as cancer metastasis, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. With this ARPA-H award, the research team is positioned to advance the fields of imaging, diagnostics and precision medicine in these areas, Xiao said. The project highlights Rice's growing strength in biomedical innovation, where scientists and engineers collaborate to tackle complex health challenges. Established in 2024 as part of Rice's Momentous strategic plan, the SynthX Center is dedicated to developing groundbreaking drugs and technologies in close collaboration with cancer programs across the Texas Medical Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weill Cornell Medicine has received a $5.2 million, initial two-year award from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) Lymphatic Imaging, Genomics, and pHenotyping Technologies (LIGHT) program to develop a comprehensive and innovative approach to diagnosing lymphatic disease. LIGHT is led by ARPA-H Program Manager Kimberley Steele, M.D., Ph.D. When the system is not working properly, fluid accumulates in tissues, a condition called lymphedema, and the body can become more susceptible to infection and tissue damage. The ARPA-H award funds a project called LANTERN (Lymphatic disease Advancements with Nanotechnology, Translational Epigenetics, and Research in Genetics), led by principal investigator Dr. Lishomwa Ndhlovu, the Herbert J. and Ann L. Siegel Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine. LANTERN aims to improve the detection and understanding of lymphatic disease by developing new diagnostic tools. Researchers will use approaches such as large-scale analysis of genetic information, nanotechnology to create molecular fingerprints of the condition, and artificial intelligence to assess data. Early and precise detection of the condition can ultimately lead to better treatment. Dr. Lishomwa Ndhlovu, professor of immunology in neuroscience, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine Lymphedema is one of the most common lymphatic diseases. Symptoms of lymphatic dysfunction, like swelling, often appear only after the disease has progressed. As a result, underlying chronic conditions can go untreated. Dr. Ndhlovu and his colleagues aim to develop a diagnostic toolbox or platform that doctors can use to rapidly and reliably detect lymphatic disease. The team includes collaborators Dr. Daniel Heller, a member of the Molecular Pharmacology Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and a professor in the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences and Dr. Mijin Kim, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech, who are developing advanced detection technologies using nanosensors, or tiny devices that can detect molecular changes in tissues, and artificial intelligence, to analyze information so that doctors can better predict and prevent disease and develop targeted treatment plans. Another important part of the program is gathering input from patient advocates who can provide feedback on what types of information is valuable to them and their well-being. At one point, Dr. Ndhlovu hopes to integrate the new platform with any new imaging modalities of lymphatic disease that researchers develop through the ARPA-H LIGHT program. "This field has been a dark hole regarding imaging and diagnostics. The scope of diseases that are impacted by the lymphatic system is remarkable, so any advances in our understanding of lymphatic disease could have an impact across the spectrum of conditions including in our work in infectious diseases research."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exposure to wildfire smoke during the final months of pregnancy may raise the risk that a child is later diagnosed with autism, according to a new study led by Tulane University researchers. Researchers found that children whose mothers were exposed to wildfire smoke during the third trimester were more likely to be diagnosed with autism by age 5. The strongest association was observed among mothers exposed to more than 10 days of wildfire smoke during the final three months of pregnancy. In that group, children had a 23% higher risk of autism diagnoses compared to those whose mothers were never exposed to smoke from wildfires during pregnancy. The findings do not establish a conclusive link between prenatal wildfire exposure and autism but add to growing evidence of the adverse impact of air pollutants on fetal neurological development. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires in many parts of the world, understanding their relationship with autism is important to being able to develop preventive policy and interventions that will protect pregnant women and their children." Mostafijur Rahman, corresponding author, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University The study focused solely on California, which leads the nation in both yearly acres burned by wildfire and rates of childhood autism diagnoses. It also comes one year after the Eaton and Palisades fires destroyed more than 16,000 structures in the second- and third-most destructive California wildfires on record, respectively. Since 2000, the prevalence of autism diagnoses has increased each year, a trend often attributed in part to greater awareness and screening. Additionally, a growing body of research has linked prenatal exposure to air pollution with autism risk, with heavy metals in particles being a commonly theorized culprit. Additionally, the fine particles that comprise smoke and air pollution can pose a threat regardless of toxicity. In the study, mothers of children diagnosed with autism tended to be older, more likely to never had a previous pregnancy, and had a higher prevalence of pre-pregnancy diabetes and obesity. The potential association in the third trimester aligns with a 2021 Harvard University study that also found a higher risk of autism in children linked to air pollution exposure during late pregnancy, a period marked by rapid fetal brain growth and development. "Further study is needed to understand how wildfire smoke exposure to pregnant mothers could cause autism in their children, and to determine how exposure may interact with biology, genetics and other environmental exposures," said lead author David Luglio, a post-doctoral fellow with the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. "This study is just one piece of a much larger puzzle, and the findings tell us there are more pieces to be put together." Luglio, D. G., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new pilot feasibility study, researchers from Mayo Clinic, the University of Washington School of Medicine, the University of California San Francisco, and Nextrast Inc. found that a new imaging oral agent, also known as a "contrast agent," helps radiologists better see bowel structures and disease in CT imaging when compared with the current oral contrast agents. The introduction of a new oral contrast agent for CT imaging addresses common challenges in the diagnosis of bowel diseases, says by Joel Fletcher, M.D., lead author on the study and medical director of the Mayo Clinic CT Clinical Innovation Center. "The new oral contrast agent," he explains, "is ingested by patients prior to CT imaging and helps detect pathologies within and outside of the bowel wall in ways current imaging agents do not." "The Clinical Phase 2 results confirm that our dark agent can reveal previously impossible-to-detect findings, including very small bowel tumors and subtle inflammatory conditions that are often missed with conventional agents at CT." In their paper, the authors report findings that suggest this new agent significantly improves visualization of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or cancer within the abdomen, and may provide earlier and more confident diagnoses. The study compared CT scans of 32 patients with the dark borosilicate oral contrast agent and scans with conventional water or iodine-based oral contrast agents, to look at anatomical structures and disease presence. Evaluators identified clinically relevant findings in seven patients that were not detected using the standard contrast. "CT scans performed with the new agent will likely do a better job of displaying pathologies in the stomach and proximal small bowel, areas where CT with traditional oral contrast performs poorly," Dr. Fletcher says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with autism have brains that are wired differently. This can make them especially strong in some areas-such as noticing patterns, remembering details, or thinking logically-while making other things like social cues or changes in routine more challenging. There can also be stark differences in the way autistic and neurotypical people communicate, to the point where it may seem like each is using a different language, creating complications from social situations to the workplace. For example, while non-autistic people often depend on nonverbal cues like body language and tone of voice, inferring emotion and intent, some autistic people rely on them less, and might interpret linguistic devices like sarcasm or irony literally. Likewise, autistic people might prefer direct and clear communication-treating an indirect request ("When you get a chance, can you send that file?") On the other side, neurotypical people might misunderstand an autistic person's direct and literal style as being blunt or unempathetic. Instead of pushing autistic people to communicate in non-autistic ways, which can make social interactions inauthentic and cognitively draining for them-and which is the focus of many existing interventions-they created NeuroBridge, an AI-based learning tool that uses large language models to help neurotypical people learn how to better communicate with autistic people. "It is more useful as a way for non-autistic people to gain firsthand experience with cross-neurotype communication, learn about autistic communication preferences, and use that understanding to adjust their own communication when interacting with autistic people," he said. "Through NeuroBridge," he added, "our aim is to create an environment-among friends, co-workers, and organizations-that enables people to better recognize and appreciate neurodiverse communication styles, as well as the interdependent nature of social interactions." Fahad Dogar, an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and at Tisch College for Civic Life, oversaw the project and said their approach was "grounded in the social model of disability, which emphasizes that disability arises not from individual deficits, but from the mismatch between individuals and their social environment." He noted that the system was developed with iterative feedback from a board of autistic volunteers, who helped improve its design and accuracy. "We're excited to build on this work and believe it has the potential for meaningful social impact," he said. "We are already exploring ways to use it to enhance support for neurodiverse students at Tufts, collaborate with departments and campus resources that could benefit from it-such as the StAAR Center, which provides academic and accessibility support to students with disabilities-and pursue new opportunities to scale and evaluate its impact." NeuroBridge creates a conversational scenario tailored for the user based on information that they provide about themselves, making it interesting and relatable. For example, the user may ask it, "How can I speed up shoveling snow from my driveway?" NeuroBridge then may present three different ways to phrase that question: Is there a way to speed up shoveling a driveway? Do you know how to speed up shoveling snow from a driveway? What methods can be used to speed up shoveling snow from a driveway? It will point out that two of these options (those starting with 'Is there a way…?' Many neurotypical users were surprised to find the interpretations of the response options were obvious in hindsight, but never occurred to them." The participants also found that the feedback the program provided helped them understand exactly what parts of their conversation could be received differently by an autistic person, making it useful for navigating future real-world interactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A landmark UK study involving tens of thousands of families has shown that childhood screening for type 1 diabetes is effective, laying the groundwork for a UK-wide childhood screening program. The findings mark a major step towards a future in which type 1 diabetes can be detected in children before symptoms appear. Currently, over a quarter of children aren't diagnosed with type 1 diabetes until they are in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal condition that requires urgent hospital treatment. Early detection can dramatically reduce emergency diagnoses and could give children access to new immunotherapy treatments that can delay the need for insulin for years. Launched in 2022, ELSA is the first UK study of its kind. Led by researchers at the University of Birmingham, the study tested blood samples for autoantibodies, markers of type 1 diabetes that can appear years before symptoms. We know that risk rises sharply with the number of autoantibodies. Children without autoantibodies are unlikely to develop type 1 diabetes, while those with one autoantibody have a 15% chance of developing the condition within 10 years. Families of children found to have early-stage type 1 diabetes received tailored education and ongoing support to prepare for the eventual onset of type 1 diabetes symptoms and to ensure insulin therapy can begin promptly when needed, reducing the chances of needing emergency treatment. Those with one autoantibody also received ongoing support and monitoring. Some families were also offered teplizumab, the first ever immunotherapy for type 1 diabetes, which can delay the need for insulin by around three years in people with early-stage type 1 diabetes. As of November 2025, more than 37,000 families have signed up to the ELSA programme. The research team aims to recruit 30,000 additional children across these new age groups. ELSA 2 will also establish new NHS Early-Stage Type 1 Diabetes Clinics, providing families taking part in the study with clinical and psychological support and creating a clear pathway from screening to diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. "Being part of the ELSA study has helped us as a family to prepare for the future in a way we never expected. Knowing what's coming – rather than being taken by surprise – has made an enormous difference to our confidence and peace of mind. When Imogen's diagnosis arrives, we hope that having this awareness will reduce her chances of experiencing DKA and the added trauma that comes from a sudden illness. "Imogen took part in the study to further research and help others, but it has helped her too – being forewarned is being forearmed. We are extremely grateful to all the families who have participated in the study and generously given their time to help understand how a UK-wide screening programme could be developed. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research and Clinical at Diabetes UK, said: But that doesn't have to be the case. Thanks to scientific breakthroughs, we now have the tools to identify children in the very earliest stages of type 1 diabetes - giving families precious time to prepare, avoid emergency hospital admissions, and access treatments that can delay the need for insulin for years. Together, we can transform type 1 diabetes care for future generations." Instead of a devastating emergency, we can offer time, choices, and hope. Thanks to research like ELSA, what once struck as an unexpected crisis can become an actively managed healthcare process, changing the course of T1D for the better." The findings from ELSA's first phase signal a major step towards a future in which type 1 diabetes can be detected early, managed proactively, and potentially delayed through immunotherapy. ELSA demonstrates that childhood screening in the UK is feasible, acceptable to families, and capable of preventing emergency diagnoses. Continued research through ELSA 2 will assess how screening can be scaled across the NHS and evaluate its cost-effectiveness. Type 1 diabetes is a serious and lifelong autoimmune condition affecting up to 400,000 people in the UK. It is caused by an immune system attack on the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, meaning they can no longer make enough insulin. Rapid diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is essential to avoid life-threatening complications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The number of people over 40 in the UK living with glaucoma-the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide-is already higher than expected and is projected to surge to more than 1.6 million by 2060, finds research published online in the British Journal of Ophthalmology. This trend will be driven by an increasingly aging population and growth in the proportion of higher risk ethnically diverse groups, prompting the need for an expansion in eye health services to meet demand, they emphasise. Previous estimates suggest that around 700,000 people are living with glaucoma in the UK, but this figure probably doesn't accurately reflect population demographics, say the researchers. And late diagnosis is a major risk factor for sight loss, with over 40% of patients in the UK experiencing preventable vision impairment due to treatment delays. To generate revised current estimates and future projections that better capture the UK's evolving demography, the researchers drew on the most recent population census data (2021-22) and published clinical prevalence estimates of glaucoma for their analysis. They focused on people aged at least 40, as glaucoma is rare below this age, and grouped them by 5-year age bands, sex, and 4 broad ethnic categories: European; African; Asian; and mixed/other. The numbers of those aged 40 and older added up to just over 34 million people, most of whom (30,215,460, around 89%) lived in England and Wales; nearly 3 million lived in Scotland (around 9%), and just under 1 million in Northern Ireland. The age distribution typified an aging population of an industrialised nation, with the over 65s making up over a third (37%) of UK adults aged 40+. Women accounted for just over half (52%) of this age group, and ethnic composition was predominantly European (88.5%), followed by Asian (6%), African (3%), and mixed/other (2.5%). And estimates stratified by age indicate an increase from around 10,000 (0.25%) of those aged 40–44 to nearly 173,000 (11%) of those aged 85+. Prevalence among African ethnic groups peaked in 55–59 year olds, reflecting a younger demographic distribution, with only about 16% aged 65+. Although non-European groups represent only 6% of the UK population aged 65 and older, they account for an estimated 8% of current glaucoma cases, the estimates indicate. This corresponds to a 60% rise in cases on 2025 figures, despite only a 28% increase in the over 40s during the same period. "The projected increase in numbers of those affected by glaucoma will place considerable strain on ophthalmic services, necessitating expansion in specialist care, diagnostic capacity or innovative transformation of long-term management services," they point out. "This increase underlines a critical need for strategies that go beyond treatment options, focusing on evidence-based healthcare planning, including structured case detection, resource allocation for disease surveillance, and treatment to prevent visual impairment and blindness at older age," they write. They cite Swedish data showing that population-based screening of 67 year olds might halve the number of those losing their sight to glaucoma over the next 20 years, and additional research proving the capability of AI to boost diagnostic accuracy. "Such strategies, which may further incorporate genetic risk and behaviour characteristics, will help lower the risk of visual impairment due to glaucoma, while the number of affected individuals in the UK will increase dramatically," they continue. "It is now time to take action by scientifically developing and evaluating these strategies," they conclude.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large Chinese cohort study identifies early pregnancy as a sensitive window during which sulfur dioxide exposure is associated with higher odds of limb abnormalities, sharpening the focus on air quality and maternal health protection. Study: Maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and risk of congenital limb defects in offspring. In a recent article published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers investigated whether women who are exposed to environmental air pollutants during the pre-conception and early pregnancy periods are more likely to have children with congenital limb defects (CLDs). They found that women who were exposed to sulfur dioxide during the first three months after conception were more likely to have children with higher odds of being diagnosed with certain congenital limb defects, particularly limb shortening and polydactyly. CLDs are common birth abnormalities involving missing, shortened, or abnormally formed limbs, including conditions such as polydactyly (the formation of extra fingers), syndactyly (webbed or fused toes or fingers), limb shortening, and clubfoot (feet that point downward at birth). CLDs can severely impact physical function, development, and quality of life, while also affecting caregivers and burdening health systems. Although genetic and chromosomal abnormalities explain some cases, about half of CLDs have no clearly identified cause, highlighting the potential role of environmental factors. Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including higher odds of certain congenital anomalies such as facial, oral, and cardiac defects. However, studies linking air pollution to CLDs remain scarce and inconsistent. Researchers utilized data from the Wuhan Maternal and Child Health Management Information System, which contains detailed information on maternal, pregnancy, and birth outcomes collected through a government registration system. In addition to birth defect-related information, the dataset included sociodemographic variables, past medical histories, pregnancy-related complications, gestational histories, antenatal care utilization, delivery details, and postnatal care. The study included 510,550 mother–infant pairs from January 2011 to September 2017. All stillbirths, live births, and pregnancy terminations due to congenital anomalies were considered. Congenital limb defects were identified through a standardized congenital disability surveillance system and classified into polydactyly, syndactyly, limb shortening, and clubfoot. Researchers obtained daily concentrations of six major air pollutants from 21 monitoring stations across Wuhan. Individual exposure levels were estimated by incorporating the spatial distance between monitoring stations and maternal residential addresses. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess associations between pollutant exposure and CLD risk, adjusting for key maternal and infant characteristics. Sulfur dioxide exposure during each of the first three months after conception was significantly associated with a higher odds of the child being diagnosed with any CLD, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.033 to 1.043 per 10 μg/m³ increase, indicating modest effect sizes at the individual level. In contrast, no consistent associations were observed between overall CLD risk and exposure to other major pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, or ozone, during either pre-conception or early pregnancy. However, ozone exposure during the third month of pregnancy was associated with a higher odds of syndactyly in subtype-specific analyses. Subgroup analyses showed that sulfur dioxide exposure was particularly associated with higher odds of limb shortening and polydactyly, while no consistent associations were observed for clubfoot. Two-pollutant models confirmed the robustness of the sulfur dioxide-related findings, and sensitivity analyses yielded similar results after excluding infants with additional congenital anomalies. Effect modification analyses suggested stronger associations among women whose occupation was classified as professional, as well as variation by maternal age, season of conception, and residential setting, although statistical evidence for interaction was not uniform across all exposure windows. Limited evidence of interaction was observed for preterm birth in specific exposure periods. Using data from a large population-based cohort, this study provides evidence that maternal sulfur dioxide exposure during early pregnancy, but not before conception, is associated with higher odds of congenital limb defects, particularly polydactyly and limb shortening. Other major air pollutants, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and fine particulate matter, were not consistently associated with overall CLD risk. The findings are consistent with several previous studies and suggest that early pregnancy may represent a biologically plausible window of increased vulnerability for limb development. Key strengths of the study include its large sample size, population-based design, detailed exposure assessment, and consideration of multiple exposure windows and potential sociodemographic modifiers. However, limitations include potential exposure misclassification due to reliance on residential addresses and ambient monitoring stations, lack of personal exposure measurements, and limited information on indoor air pollution or maternal behavioral factors. Despite these limitations, the study highlights the importance of reducing sulfur dioxide exposure among pregnant women and of considering potentially vulnerable subgroups in public health strategies.
