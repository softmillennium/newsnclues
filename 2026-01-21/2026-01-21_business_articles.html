                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have "formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland." Trump said that as a result of that negotiation, he would no longer impose punitive tariffs on a slew of European countries that were set to begin Feb. 1. Read Trump's entire announcement, which he posted on Truth Social: Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region. This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations — They will report directly to me. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Stocks shot up immediately after Trump posted the update. Details about the framework agreement were unclear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was all eyes on President Donald Trump at Davos on Wednesday as he gave a much-hyped "special address" to the conference. Business Insider was in the room as he spoke. We're sharing real-time updates and reactions to his speech from World Economic Forum attendees, along with other news and insights from the Swiss Alps. In a 70-minute-long speech, Trump covered huge amounts of ground, touting achievements from his first year in office, saying he won't use "excessive force" to acquire Greenland, and that he expects the stock market to double in the coming years. Follow along here for real-time updates, reaction, and on-the-ground commentary from Business Insider's staff in Davos. During a brief address to business leaders on Wednesday, President Donald Trump told the crowd that many in the room were making a lot of money during his second term — even ones that he doesn't like. "A couple of people in the room, I can't stand them, and they've become very rich," Trump said. During a panel on AI regulation, Meta's chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, argued that large language models need access to data locked behind subscription paywalls — a point he made while sitting opposite the CEO of The Atlantic, a publication that charges consumers $80 a year for access. "I'm sure this isn't popular at The Atlantic," Kaplan said, referring to CEO Nicholas Thompson, who moderated the discussion.

"I'm sure this isn't popular at The Atlantic," Kaplan said, referring to CEO Nicholas Thompson, who moderated the discussion. Without broad access to data, Kaplan said, AI models risk missing critical information — a failure he framed as an economic and national security threat as China rapidly expands its AI capabilities. President Donald Trump used a moment in his address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to plug his bullish outlook on the US stock market. In public, CEOs often go out of their way to insist that AI isn't displacing jobs. Not Garrett Lord, CEO and cofounder of Handshake. Lord says that AI has already made both his engineering and customer support departments measurably more productive, and as a result, he's hiring fewer people as his business grows.

Lord says that AI has already made both his engineering and customer support departments measurably more productive, and as a result, he's hiring fewer people as his business grows. "A year from now, I hope we don't need more than two people running customer support," he told me, adding that the department currently employs 40 to 50 people. "I believe the job of frontline support associate should not exist in 2026." "I'd love to shift those heads more to community and phone support where customers can have a more delightful experience." I asked him if he expects to be able to transition all those displaced employees into other roles within his company. "Today, I'm taking action to bring back this bedrock of the American dream." AI Czar David Sacks said he's concerned that overzealous federal or state regulations of AI will harm the US's standing in the global technology race. "Where I kind of worry is that if in the AI race in a fit of pessimism, we do something like what Bernie Sanders wants, which is he wants to stop building all data centers or if we have 1,200 different AI laws in the states, you know, clamping down on the innovation, I worry we could lose the AI race because of a self-inflicted injury," Sacks told Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during a fireside chat Wednesday at Davos.

The GOP-led Congress was unable to pass such a policy into law. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in December that champions a federal framework for AI policy. Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech in Davos. "I thought it was a home run..." Sen. Lindsey Graham said of Trump's speech. We need the title, but not through force. If we do, he goes all in for Greenland...The biggest loser of that speech might be Putin." "Were you surprised that there was no applause throughout the whole speech?" Gavin Newsom, a longtime Trump adversary whom the president took aim at in his speech. Had there not been cell phones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom. Thank God that cell phones were allowed in. "90% of the room was on them after 10 minutes. It was deeply boring, often boorish, even by Trump standards." In a panel not long before Trump took the stage, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that, if enacted, the president's 10% cap on credit card interest rates could cause an "economic disaster." He said that the move could strip credit from 80% of Americans, but that his bank would "deal with" whatever policy the government ends up enacting. I was sitting among the 1,000 or so people in the Davos hall, some of whom were standing in packed aisles. If Trump wanted a raucous applause for his laundry list of accomplishments that he sees as crowning achievements over his first year, he didn't get it. Following his Q&A with Brende, Trump briefly took questions in a media scrum outside the Congress Hall, where it was hard to discern individual questions from reporters. "We make the greatest weapons in the world, but now we're going to make them faster," Trump said during his address, before turning to his plans to cap compensation for defense execs. "We make the greatest weapons in the world, but now we're going to make them faster," Trump said during his address, before turning to his plans to cap compensation for defense execs. Now we're going to start making it a lot faster." During his 70-minute-long speech, Trump once again backed a ban on institutional investors buying single-family homes. "I'm taking action to bring back this bedrock of the American dream," he said. "The United States is back, bigger, stronger, and better than ever before," Trump says. "I'll see you all around," he concludes to muted applause. "The United States is back, bigger, stronger, and better than ever before," Trump says. "I'll see you all around," he concludes to muted applause. He'll now take part in a discussion with WEF President Børge Brende. His speech lasted roughly an hour and 10 minutes. "Maybe I'll give you a quick story," Trump says, turning to tariffs placed on watches made in Davos' host country, Switzerland. "Maybe I'll give you a quick story," Trump says, turning to tariffs placed on watches made in Davos' host country, Switzerland. And we had a $41 billion deficit with this beautiful place. "So I said, let's put a 30% tariff on them. So that we get back some of it," he adds. Trump says he had talks with Swiss political leaders, during which he realised that "the United States is keeping the whole world afloat." "We have an unbelievable future in that the stock market is going to be doubled. We're going to hit 50,000, and that stock market's going to double in a relatively short period of time because of everything that's happening," he says. Trump tells the audience he is close to appointing a new Federal Reserve chairman, saying it is "somebody that's very respected." Trump tells the audience he is close to appointing a new Federal Reserve chairman, saying it is "somebody that's very respected." Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh are considered the frontrunners to succeed current Fed chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump called "terrible" and nicknamed "Jerome 'Too late' Powell." Trump elicits laughter from the Davos crowd by mentioning French President Emmanuel Macron's much-discussed aviator sunglasses. Trump elicits laughter from the Davos crowd by mentioning French President Emmanuel Macron's much-discussed aviator sunglasses. Trump goes on to say he likes Macron, which he says is probably surprising to many people, before discussing tariffs on French wine and Champagne. Earlier in the speech, Trump attacked what he called the "green new scam," taking particular aim at wind turbines, which he has long criticized.

"China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven't been able to find any wind farms in China. "That's a good way of looking at it. Trump says he wants "right, title, and ownership" of Greenland, but rules out using force to get it. "We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable.

"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. "The United States alone can defend this giant piece of ice," he adds, calling it a "core national security interest," and saying the US has been trying to acquire Greenland for "two centuries." He calls for "immediate negotiations" about the US taking control of Greenland. On DOGE and government cuts: "In 12 months, we have removed over 270,000 bureaucrats from the federal payrolls. On DOGE and government cuts: "In 12 months, we have removed over 270,000 bureaucrats from the federal payrolls. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77% and all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done." On domestic manufacturing: "Domestic steel production is up by 300,000 tonnes a month, and it's doubling over the next four months. And we have steel plants being built all over the country." "Factory construction is up by 41%, and that number is really going to skyrocket right now because that's during a process that they're putting in to get their approvals, and we've given very, very quick approvals. "Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies. We're helping them," he tells the Davos crowd. "Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they've made for years." "I love Europe, I want to see it do good, but it's not going in the right direction," Trump says, criticizing the continent's leadership. Trump opens by thanking Fink, and telling the assembled viewers that he is surrounded by friends and "a few enemies."

Ahead of Trump's speech, I've been walking around the Promenade trying to figure out a good spot to post up. I thought it'd be fun to watch from the Belgium House, which is serving Stella on tap. I walked in and asked if they were planning to broadcast the address. "No, we have so many sessions," he told me. Congress Hall, which seats about 1,000 people, is quickly filling up before Trump addresses the World Economic Forum. Outside the hall, CEOs, including Salesforce's Marc Benioff and Coinbase's Brian Armstrong, jockeyed alongside world leaders to get in. There was a quick bag check even though we had all been screened with metal detectors before entering the Congress Center.

Getting here required the highest level badge access, and the auditorium is segmented into different sections for trustees and VIPs.

Trump is running about three hours late after Air Force One turned around, and he had to take a different plane instead. We still haven't had official word on any potential delay to the speech. Earlier today, Bill Gates said he wants to rate AI companies based on how much they help address global health issues. "We fund a group that rates the various pharmaceutical companies in terms of their generosity to help out with global health issues," Gates said on a panel.

"We fund a group that rates the various pharmaceutical companies in terms of their generosity to help out with global health issues," Gates said on a panel. This comes as the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI on Wednesday for a $50 million pilot healthcare initiative called Horizon1000. Benioff was one of the few people being let in early. "As a member of the WEF Board of Trustees, Marc was escorted to his saved seat for the Trump address today — just as he is for any major address," a Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was among the luminaries spotted waiting to get into Trump's speech. President Donald Trump departed from Zurich Airport for Davos by helicopter, 44 minutes after his plane landed. TV images showed Marine One took off at 1:19 p.m. local time, accompanied by four other helicopters.

TV images showed Marine One took off at 1:19 p.m. local time, accompanied by four other helicopters. The 75-mile journey to Davos should take roughly 30 minutes. A convoy of black SUVs was also seen driving onto the tarmac, apparently to transport other passengers from the plane. Yutong Zhang, president of the Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI, said she increasingly prioritizes learning ability, as she said knowledge and skills become outdated more quickly in an AI-driven economy. Yutong Zhang, president of the Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI, said she increasingly prioritizes learning ability, as she said knowledge and skills become outdated more quickly in an AI-driven economy. "Every day we're feeling that the learning ability is [more] very important than the past experience because past experience and past knowledge may get expired sooner than before," Zhang told a Davos panel. As AI tools can now generate expertise on demand, she said the value of narrow specialization is declining. President Donald Trump has always had a showman's flair for conjuring attention and anticipation, and his Davos address is no different. No less than the future of NATO is at stake. Outside the auditorium where Trump will speak this afternoon, attendees told me they had no idea what he would say, so they came here to find out, especially what he says about Greenland.

Outside the auditorium where Trump will speak this afternoon, attendees told me they had no idea what he would say, so they came here to find out, especially what he says about Greenland. Several also mentioned they had never seen Trump speak in person since he appeared via video last year. "At least it will be entertaining," said another. "I just want to see where his mind goes," said someone else. Trump had to switch airplanes due to electrical issues, so part of the mystery is what time he will take the stage. While waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese. A French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real. Away from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal. On a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset. "Everybody should be able to make a great living. Trump touched down in Zurich at 12:35 p.m. local time after an eventful journey. President Donald Trump's original airplane departed about 10 hours ago, but it turned around due to a "minor electrical issue." He has instead flown to Switzerland on a Boeing C-32A, which is typically used for the Vice President's Air Force Two. Trump touched down in Zurich at 12:35 p.m. local time after an eventful journey. President Donald Trump's original airplane departed about 10 hours ago, but it turned around due to a "minor electrical issue." He has instead flown to Switzerland on a Boeing C-32A, which is typically used for the Vice President's Air Force Two. His journey has taken over three hours longer than first expected. Now, there's another 75 miles to reach Davos, most likely by helicopter. Congress Hall is now being cleared ahead of President Donald Trump's speech. One security guard told me the speech would be on time despite the electrical problems on AF1, but we still haven't heard official word from WEF. As Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns. His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk. We need to defend the Arctic," as China and Russia increase their presence there, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a Wednesday morning appearance at Davos.

After an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe. As of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour. If, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos. However, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations. No clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd. It seems highly likely, however, that his desire to make Greenland part of the USA, the diplomatic furore it has ignited, and new tariffs on Western allies, will be front and center.

Tuesday will go down as the day global financial markets finally started paying attention to Trump's Greenland threats. As Business Insider's Jennifer Sor noted yesterday, stocks tumbled in one of the worst days for the US market since April 2025. Things are looking much calmer so far on Wednesday, with investors seemingly in a classic holding pattern ahead of the president's speech later. Futures for all three major US indexes are pointing to a slightly higher open, with expected gains of around 0.2%. In Europe, where markets are open, major indexes in the UK, France, and Germany are marginally lower, but little moved.

Trump was due to speak at 2:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. While we don't yet have any confirmation of a change in schedule, Bessent's timings would put Trump's speech at 5:30 p.m. local time (11:30 a.m. In a statement to Business Insider, the World Economic Forum said it is "in close contact with the US delegation and will provide an update should there be any changes to the President's schedule or related programme arrangements." Business Insider is tracking the US military jet carrying Trump over the Atlantic closely, and we'll keep you updated on his progress. "And the sheer speed of change far outstrips anything we have seen in decades. We now live in a world defined by raw power — whether economic or military, technological or geopolitical," von der Leyen said in Strasbourg, France, hours before Trump's big Davos speech.

"And while many of us may not like it, we must deal with the world as it is now," she said. "I think there will be big failures, but I don't think we are in a bubble," Fink said on a panel on Wednesday morning. Fink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble. He cited agreement among many economists that it "will have resources to continue for at least 12 months or more." However, it will have much harder decisions to make, "painful choices" like cutting spending on infrastructure and healthcare.

He was responding to a Tuesday announcement from the Danish pension fund AkademikerPension that it would sell $100 million in US Treasurys.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at a panel on Wednesday morning that he thinks "we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China." There are two big factors at play here, Fink said. Secondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies. "The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations," Fink said. Tax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos. The letter's co-signees called out a "handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth," accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment. "I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late," US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser.

"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. "That's creating a lot of demand as well," Steinbach added. Trump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week in Davos has been about many things: AI, geopolitics and markets. But President Donald Trump has been firmly at the front of everyone's mind. His much-anticipated address at the World Economic Forum drew thousands, with attendees queuing for hours to get into the Congress Hall. I stood in line for more than an hour and a half. Even Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman had to wait in line with the rest of us. I finally cleared security and found a seat — lucky, given that many were refused entry to the hall. As the crowd packed in, the atmosphere began to resemble something closer to a star- studded concert than a policy forum. The audience included Apple CEO Tim Cook, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, World Bank President Ajay Banga, as well as senior political and business figures such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. There were some lighter moments before the speech began; Cook greeting Banga with a tight hug, Lagarde exchanging warm hellos with European officials — small, human interactions before the room shifted into anticipation. Trump was met with loud applause as he took the stage for what many billed as the most closely watched speech of this year's Davos. He opened by saying it was good to see so many friends and "some enemies," drawing laughter from the crowd. From there, he leaned heavily into self-assessment, describing himself as the most successful president and pointing to what he said were his major achievements accomplished in just one year. "People are doing very well and are happy with me," Trump said, prompting a mix of laughter and applause. Trump took aim at several figures, including a swipe at French President Emmanuel Macron's sunglasses, asking: "What the hell was that?" He also directed a number of comments at Carney. A CEO seated nearby told me, on condition of anonymity, that Carney took it in good humor, smiling and nodding along. After more than an hour, Trump turned to the topic many in the room had been bracing for. "Would you like me to talk about Greenland?" One person seated behind me, who said they were Danish, muttered: "This is ridiculous." "I am seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States," Trump said. "This is scary," one attendee in front of me said, exchanging uneasy glances with others. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember," Trump said on Greenland, although he did, for the first time, say he would not use force — resulting in a collective sigh of relief. Trump also kept referring to Greenland as a "piece of ice" and appeared to confuse it with Iceland — another European country altogether. The president also criticized Europe more broadly, saying parts of the continent had become "unrecognizable," and described former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter as "difficult." She rubbed me the wrong way," he said. The address was followed by a fireside chat with WEF President Børge Brende, but by then — after well over an hour — some of the audience had begun to drift out. One tech CEO summed it up succinctly: he wasn't sure whether to laugh or feel nervous, a sentiment echoed by several others. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

On NATO's front line, Finland's president says his country is ready for a Russian attack, regardless of whether it has US support. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Alexander Stubb said in response to a question of whether the Finnish military can effectively defend itself against a Russian attack: "Yes, we can." He pointed to Finland's mandatory conscription, which sets it apart from many other NATO members, and said that the country can mobilize 280,000 soldiers in a matter of weeks. "We have the biggest artillery in Europe together with Poland. We have long-range missiles, land, sea, and air," he added. He joked that Finland did not procure these because it was worried about allies like neighboring Sweden: "We don't have this because we're worried about Stockholm." For Finland, a relatively new NATO ally, the key security concern has long been Russia, with which it shares a roughly 800-mile border. The two fought bitter wars during World War II, though they have not engaged in armed conflict for decades. Those are US-made aircraft, manufactured by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, respectively. To keep the aircraft operational, a certain degree of US support is needed. The Finnish president said he was confident that it would continue. Speaking with the moderator at his Davos panel, he said: "Your next question is going to be, do they fly without Americans? But do we trust that they will continue to fly because it's in the interest of America to do so? These concerns have been strongest among front-line allies, with the Baltic nations regularly calling for greater efforts to strengthen defenses. Finland's military was built with Russia as a threat in mind, giving it an edge that some other allies don't have. For instance, Stubb said Finland's power also comes from its focus on civilian preparations. "That's why we have civilian shelters for 4.4 million Fins. That's why we have a security of supply where we don't get into any kind of trouble with food shortages, energy shortages, or electricity grids." He was also optimistic about NATO relations despite new tensions over the US pursuit of the Danish territory of Greenland. I mean, come on, let's not push the hypotheticals here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement on Wednesday, European Parliament member Bernd Lange, and INTA chair on EU-US trade relations, said the recent plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs of between 10% to 25% on European nations go against the terms of the trade pact. Referring to Trump's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Lange said: "I guess he didn't revise his position. Trump ruled out the use of military force in his speech, a commitment Lange described as a "small positive element." However, Lange said the proposed 10% to 25% tariffs remain on the table,  adding that, until the threat of them is over, "there will be no possibility of compromise." "We will hold on the procedure... until there is clarity regarding Greenland and the threats," he said. Lange said Trump is "using tariffs as an instrument of political pressure" as a way to buy Greenland, and described the move as "an attack against the economic and territorial sovereignty of the European Union." He added that the Committee on International Trade would on Monday discuss the use of the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) — a far-reaching measure variously described as a "trade bazooka" — which would allow the EU to substantially restrict U.S. companies' access to its single market, block them from tenders, reduce the flow of goods and capital, and curb foreign direct investment in the bloc. "This was created exactly for such a case when a foreign country [uses] tariffs and investment for political and coercive pressure," Lange said of the ACI. Earlier in the day, Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel told CNBC that he hoped Trump would reverse his stance, calling the transatlantic tensions a "very problematic situation." Nagel, a governing council member of the European Central Bank, acknowledged that the tariff threat will likely have "some spillover" to monetary policy in the region. Speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos Wednesday, Nagel said the tariff dispute could "maybe" be a game changer for monetary policy in the eurozone, which he said was still on "a good path." "I still have the hope that we can find a solution, a joint understanding," Nagel added. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If President Donald Trump gets his way on credit cards, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicts chaos — but more on the streets of American towns than in the walls of his own bank. "It would be an economic disaster," Dimon said when asked about President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest rates. "And I'm not making that up because of our business, we would survive it, by the way. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans. "The people crying most won't be the credit card companies," he said, adding that those hurt will include restaurants, retailers, travel companies, and municipalities, "because people will miss their water payments." Whatever the president and Congress decide, JPMorgan will "deal with it," Dimon said. He promised that the bank would provide more extensive analysis of the potential effects, and said that he, too, wants greater affordability. Dimon struck a largely conciliatory tone when asked about some of Trump's geopolitical moves — immigration and NATO, for example — which he called "more qualitative, how it's going to work, what are the pieces, what's their intent." Dimon, like many other big-bank CEOs and business leaders, has previously said that reducing card interest rates could harm customers with lower credit scores. JPMorgan's CFO warned during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call last week that enacting price controls could "make it no longer a good business."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's far more to Davos fashion than the iconic blue beanie and a sea of suits. Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of eMed Population Health, was spotted at the event wearing a satin suit from Gabriela Hearst. The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print. She wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses. She wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing. One attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves. She also carried her luggage, which included a Marc Jacobs tote bag. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag. However, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves. Malachi Ajayi, the cofounder at Telos House, said he's a big fan of double-breasted suits and jackets. The suit is Paul Smith, and his leather gloves were handmade in Nigeria. (He also wanted us to note there was some freshly spilled coffee on his jacket in case anyone noticed.) He drove from London as part of a caravan, picking up folks along the way. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print. Sarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat. She accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag. Wealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate. Nidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag. She coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse. Wendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies. She told Business Insider that green is her "happy color," and that she likes to wear bright colors when "the world is so dark." When the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. In addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag. One attendee wore statement sunglasses in white and a fur-trimmed hat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Brooklyn Beckham wrote on Instagram that his parents "have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship." Neither couple has responded to Business Insider's request for comment. The founder of investment firm Trian Fund Management, 83-year-old Nelson Peltz is worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. Trian Fund Management manages $8.5 billion worth of assets. In 2017, Nelson Peltz was ranked the 22nd highest-earning hedge fund manager, Forbes reported. He has contributed millions of dollars to politically conservative causes. Nicola Peltz Beckham has nine siblings through her father. In 1985, he married model Claudia Heffner Peltz, and they have eight children, including Nicola, who was born in 1995. That same year, she won a rising star CinemaCon Award. Peltz Beckham has also acted in music videos. Most notably, she was featured in Miley Cyrus's "7 Things" music video, which has been viewed over 290 million times on YouTube since its 2008 premiere. Peltz Beckham acted alongside Kumail Nanjiani and Murray Bartlett in Hulu's "Welcome to Chippendales," which was released in 2022. In a 2023 interview with Elle, she told the magazine about one of her favorite memories from the show. The show picked up five Emmy nominations in 2023. In a 2024 interview with Women's Wear Daily, Peltz Beckham said she wrote "Lola" when she was 23 years old. It focuses on the life of a teenage girl named Lola who works at a drugstore and strip club to save enough money to move herself and her brother away from their toxic mother. "I did not sleep for three days. When I started putting my thoughts down, they just wouldn't stop," she said. "I wanted to write a flawed character, but also someone where their heart's in the right place. Although the film was released in February 2024, it garnered attention in April 2024 due to negative reviews from critics, with The Guardian's Kady Ruth Ashcraft describing the film as a "vanity project." "In film, that means the exploitation of the conditions of poverty for entertainment and artistic recognition," she wrote. In her interview with WWD, Peltz Beckham acknowledged that she didn't grow up like Lola at all and was prepared for the criticism. "I wanted to write a story from a person's perspective and another point of view that was not my personal view and not my upbringing. I am an actress and my dream is to get to look at the world from different perspectives," she said. The thriller, which drops on FX and Hulu on January 21, has a star-studded cast including Ashton Kutcher, Rebecca Hall, Anthony Ramos, Bella Hadid, Isabella Rossellini, Meghan Trainor, and Peter Gallagher, among others. The siblings have almost-matching tattoos that pay homage to their family's Eastern European Jewish roots. Coachella is known to be stacked with celebrities, so it's no wonder the couple met at the annual California music festival. But they didn't have an instant connection, according to Peltz Beckham. "We didn't get along, we just didn't click … I had a boyfriend, he had a girlfriend," she told Tatler in 2022. They reunited at Leonardo DiCaprio's Halloween party in 2019, Glamour reported, and they were later spotted having a late-night dinner together after the event. "I can't tell you what happened [at the party] but from then on we were inseparable," Peltz Beckham told Tatler. Beckham, now 26, and Peltz announced their engagement via Instagram in July 2020. "Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me and she said yes," he wrote in his caption. She signed the letter as "your future wifey." At their wedding, they took photos exclusively on flip phones, according to the couple. British Vogue shared photos on Instagram of the bride and groom in their wedding attire. Nicola Peltz Beckham wore a custom Valentino gown for the occasion. She initially hoped to wear a design by her mother-in-law, Victoria Beckham, but ultimately the designer's "atelier couldn't do it," Peltz Beckham told Variety in 2022. Their 500-strong guest list included celebrities such as Serena Williams, Eva Longoria, and Gordon Ramsay, People reported. In an interview with Elle, Peltz Beckham described newlywed life as "amazing" and described Brooklyn as her "best friend." "Being able to live life by his side has been amazing, because I feel like even if I'm going through something bad, I have him by my side," she said. The couple chose to take each other's last names after their wedding, becoming Nicola and Brooklyn Peltz Beckham. The couple reportedly lives in Los Angeles. Peltz Beckham's father officiated the ceremony in August 2025. "this day meant so much to us," she wrote on Instagram. As part of his January 2026 Instagram post about his relationship with his parents, Brooklyn Beckham wrote, "We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment." "congratulations on another beautiful collection @victoriabeckham [red heart emoji] i love watching your vision come to life! love you so much," Peltz Beckham wrote on Instagram following the event. In a lengthy post on Instagram Stories on January 19, Brooklyn Beckham spoke out amid reports of a rift with his parents, which surfaced after he did not attend his father's 50th birthday in London last year. He said his mother backed out of making Peltz Beckham's wedding dress at the last minute. (Vogue reported in 2022 that the dress Peltz Beckham wore on her wedding day was the result of "a year's worth of conversations with Valentino creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli's team," as well as two meetings in Rome and two fittings in the US.) He added, "The night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was 'not blood' and 'not family'." "My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one," he wrote. Neither couple has responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for "immediate negotiations" with Denmark to "discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States." But Trump, in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said for the first time that he would not use military force in pursuit of the territory. "I won't do that," Trump told the crowd of business and political leaders. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. Stocks, which had plummeted a day earlier amid Trump's increasing aggression toward Greenland, immediately rebounded after the president ruled out using the U.S. military against the island. But Trump maintained that Greenland — an autonomous territory ruled by Denmark, one of America's NATO allies — is a must-have asset for U.S. national security. And his remarks, which came days after he threatened new tariffs against eight NATO members related to the Greenland dispute, continued to ratchet up pressure on Europe. "So they have a choice," Trump said. "You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember." Trump's remarks at Davos focused heavily on Greenland. At times he played up the strategic importance of the Artic landmass, while at others he seemed to diminish it, repeatedly referring to the island as a "piece of ice." On multiple occasions, he appeared to confuse Greenland with Iceland. But he delivered one message consistently: Denmark and NATO, he contended, cannot defend Greenland from threats in the region. "The fact is, no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Growing up in the midsize city of Vancouver, Canada, I always dreamed of living in a big metropolis — a cultural hub where something was always going on, with endless places to explore. When I started dating a Brit, I moved to his hometown of Birmingham, England, the second-largest city in the UK population-wise, with over a million residents. It made sense for us to restart our lives in Canada, where we had family support. I didn't know if we would end up staying, but now it's been two years, and we're mostly loving our life on the island. I always enjoyed visiting Victoria while growing up, since it was just a 1-½ hour ferry ride from the mainland. Luckily, after experiencing the hustle and bustle of Birmingham for many years, I found myself appreciating Victoria's calm pace even more. With a population of less than 100,000, the city rarely feels crowded. It's also surrounded by peaceful shorelines and beaches, so everything feels more chill. It didn't take me long to appreciate Victoria's compact size, either — nowhere feels too far from our apartment in our super walkable, central neighborhood. Beyond that, we can reach beautiful beaches, parks, and the downtown area within 30 minutes. Even if we need to drive across town for something, the ride is never too long — we can get just about anywhere in under an hour. I no longer have to feel frustrated watching UK buses and trains get delayed, then pile onto them like sardines with hundreds of other commuters when they finally arrive. I don't have to push through massive crowds on big boulevards or in busy shops, either. Though it's small, Victoria also has a good variety of cafés, restaurants, shops, and other cultural establishments. If there's one thing I've learned after all my moves, it's that nowhere is perfect. As much as I love my new life in Victoria, I miss some of the perks of bigger cities. Having grown up in a city with an international airport, I find traveling is now more challenging and less convenient. Victoria has a local airport, but its international flight offerings are generally limited to just a few US cities and Mexican resort towns. Traveling to Vancouver can add anywhere from a few hours to an extra day to my travel time — I spend the night there if I have an early morning flight or a late-night arrival. However, as a smaller city, it pretty much always gets passed over on tours from the bigger artists I love. Though I enjoy the option of going to Vancouver, I have to debate whether an event is worth all the extra travel expenses I'd incur, from ferry tickets to a hotel room for the night. My husband and I pick one or two gigs we really want to see a year and make a trip of it, but I'd go to a lot more shows if I were still in Vancouver and only had to worry about ticket fees. Victoria is fairly diverse for its size, but it still doesn't compare to larger cities like Vancouver or Birmingham, let alone metropolises like Paris and London. The drawbacks don't outweigh all the positives of living in Victoria, and I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying small-city life after dreaming of big ones for so long. My husband and I can see ourselves staying here for a long while. Plus, when I'm missing bigger city vibes, I'm always happy to make the trip to Vancouver when needed — even if my wallet may not be.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday some areas of Europe are no longer recognizable — and that the continent was "not heading in the right direction." Trump lauded what he described as economic growth "like no country has ever seen before" in the U.S. during his highly-anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Friends come back from different places – I don't want to insult anybody – and say, I don't recognize it. And that's not in a positive way, that's in a very negative way," Trump said. "I love Europe and I want to see Europe go good, but it's not heading in the right direction." His speech comes after global leaders condemned his aggressive approach to seeking to annex Greenland, which he said he would seek "immediate" negotiations over. Market participants and many U.S. allies had raised the alarm about his Greenland position, including at Davos. Trump used his speech to rule out military force, something he'd previously refused to do when asked. "That's why issues like energy, trade, immigration and economic growth must be central concerns to anyone who wants to see a strong and united West, because Europe and those countries have to do their thing," Trump said. It's horrible what they're doing to themselves. "We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones. Ultimately, these are matters of national security, and perhaps no current issue makes the situation more clear than what's currently going on with Greenland." Trump, who has long advocated for making the Arctic island a part of the U.S., previously insisting there is "no going back" on acquiring it from Denmark. He threatened to impose a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they continue to oppose his plans. The U.S. president's increasingly aggressive Greenland rhetoric has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning of a shift to "a world without rules" and decrying "bullies," without mentioning Trump by name. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told Davos on Tuesday that the "old order is not coming back" and warned "nostalgia is not a strategy." Carney said the new order was "a system of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion." Trump took exception to Carney's comments during his speech. "Canada gets a lot of freebies from us by the way. "Canada lives because of the United States.

The Irish airline is hand-delivering a free ticket to X's Dublin office for Musk, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a Wednesday press conference. Ryanair has taken advantage of the feud by launching a "Big 'Idiot' Sale" with 100,000 tickets starting at £16.99, or about $23. Musk and O'Leary, arguably the world's most outspoken businessmen, have called each other idiots in a weeklong feud over Starlink in-flight WiFi. "I've included myself and him in this 'Big Idiot' seat sale," O'Leary said Wednesday, referring to an ad that shows the pair brawling. After trading insults over the past days, Musk posted a poll on X on Monday asking if he should buy Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. However, European Union rules say that the bloc's airlines must be at least 50% owned by EU nationals. "It is very good for our bookings," O'Leary also said. "We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair." The quarrel started last Wednesday after O'Leary told Reuters he wouldn't join other airlines installing Starlink. It turns a profit by keeping its planes flying frequently with low turnaround times at airports, and selling extras, including scratchcards. Plus, it only flies short-haul routes, so O'Leary doesn't think passengers would be too interested in in-flight WiFi. However, in the press conference, he also called Starlink a "terrific system." O'Leary said the airline is continuing discussions with Starlink and other providers, including Amazon, but it would adopt in-flight WiFi "only in a way where it will lower our costs."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Natural gas prices soared more than 20% on Wednesday as an Arctic cold front is forecast to blast across the Upper Midwest and descend south to grip much of the U.S. with frigid temperatures through the weekend. Heating demand is expected to spike as wind chills could fall to -50 degrees Fahrenheit across the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains, according to the National Weather Service. The wind chills pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin, the NWS warned. Families should protect all pets from the cold, it said. Heavy snow is forecast for the southern high plains of Colorado and New Mexico on Friday, said Owen Shieh, a meteorologist at the NWS Weather Prediction Center in a public service announcement on social media. This could lead to hazardous travel, downed trees and power lines, he said. Frigid sub-zero and single digit temperatures will also expand into the Ohio Valley and Northeast by Sunday, according to the NWS. "Due to the large extent and long duration of the extreme cold accompanying this winter storm, it will take longer for the snow and ice to melt after the storm," Shieh said. "You need to prepare for the possibliity of extended impacts, potentailly for several days." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Berkshire Hathaway, with new CEO Greg Abel in charge, has taken a formal step toward unwinding a rare misstep by Warren Buffett. The conglomerate, which owns Geico insurance and BNSF Railway, registered its entire 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz in a filing that clears the way for Berkshire to exit its position in the hot dog and macaroni-and-cheese maker. Shares of Kraft Heinz fell as much as 7.5% at one point in Wednesday trading following the news. The move underscores Abel's willingness to move on from a deal that has long stood out as a rare blemish on Buffett's otherwise storied record. Kraft Heinz shares have plunged about 70% since the 2015 merger that created the ketchup-making giant, weighed down by shifting consumer tastes, rising costs and sluggish growth across core brands. Some of the loss has been offset with billions of dollars in dividends over the years, but last year Berkshire still took a $3.8 billion write-down on the value of its holding. "We ... view the timing of this sale as being reflective of Abel's desire to clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure," Greggory Warren, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note. The latest Berkshire filing also came as Kraft Heinz seeks to separate into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer meats, Kraft cheese singles and Lunchables. Buffett himself has acknowledged his frustration with how the merger he orchestrated a decade ago ultimately unraveled. "It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking them apart will fix it," Buffett, who remains Berkshire's chairman, told CNBC last year. "The registration provides Berkshire Hathaway the ability to reduce its ownership stake; we believe transaction notifications are not required outside of quarterly 13F filings," Stifel analysts wrote. "The next update is likely to be in mid-May, when Berkshire reports its first fiscal quarter activity." Stifel reiterated a hold rating on Kraft Heinz and a $26 price target, citing softer U.S. consumption trends and slower growth in emerging markets that could delay any revenue growth, even as the company continues to generate strong cash flow. In 2015, Berkshire teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the combined company struggled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said that AI robotics is a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity for Europe as the region boasts an industrial manufacturing base that is "incredibly strong." "You can now fuse your industrial capability, your manufacturing capability, with artificial intelligence, and that brings you into the world of physical AI, or robotics," he said in an address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. It presents an opportunity to "leap past" the era of software, he added, which has been led by the U.S. Attention across the industrial and tech sectors has increasingly shifted to autonomous robotics as recent advances in AI promise more capabilities. European industrial and manufacturing giants, including Siemens, Mercedes-Benz Group, Volvo and Schaeffler, have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year. Big Tech companies have also been doubling down in the space. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said 80% of the company's value would come from its Optimus humanoid robots in September, Google's AI division DeepMind released AI models for robotics in 2025, and Nvidia announced partnerships with Alphabet to work on physical AI in March. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to "get serious" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said energy costs will be a key factor in determining how successful countries are in the AI race at WEF on Tuesday. "I think that it's fairly certain that you have to get serious about increasing your energy supply so that you could invest in the infrastructure layer, so that you could have a rich ecosystem of artificial intelligence here in Europe," Huang said. Europe has been grappling with limited access to energy as hyperscalers look to roll out AI infrastructure across the region. That rapid buildout is showing no signs of slowing down, said Huang. AI has started the "largest infrastructure buildout in human history," he told the audience at WEF. "We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Meta agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on Manus at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and "scale this service to many more businesses." Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis. Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is "legitimately sad that this has happened." "I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them," said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. "I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data." Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm 0260.AI, which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit. "Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually," Yeh told CNBC. "We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map," Yeh said. "We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would." Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, "In terms of Meta, we're just not sure." Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, "We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology." But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a long-term strategy in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise. Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call in October that AI costs will keep growing. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week. Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition. "We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement," Crivello said. Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at Uber and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue. Crivello said Manus is "focused on very small business owners like independent contractors," and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here. "The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet," Crivello said. Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company announced in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after discontinuing its Portal video calling device. Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its Workrooms virtual reality app, part of a broader pivot away from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off. Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools. "Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic," Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by Microsoft or Amazon, "where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized," she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030. "Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us," Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. "We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A startup widely known as "ChatGPT for doctors" raised a new funding round that values the company at $12 billion. OpenEvidence, based in Miami, Florida, closed a $250 million financing, led by Thrive Capital and DST, the company told CNBC. In less than a year, OpenEvidence has raised $700 million from investors including Google's venture arm, Nvidia, Kleiner Perkins, David Sacks' Craft Ventures and Mayo Clinic. The company was founded in 2022 by Daniel Nadler, who previously built Kensho Technologies, an artificial intelligence company that was acquired by Standard & Poor's for about $700 million in 2018, and by Zachary Ziegler, a Harvard PhD student in AI. Nadler's newest venture provides a chatbot for doctors, with its AI models having been trained on data and information from top scientific journals, Nadler said in an interview. "'ChatGPT for doctors' is a useful shorthand, but what we really do is help physicians make high-stakes clinical decisions at the point of care," Nadler said. "It's not trained on the open internet or social media, which can introduce low-quality medical information." He pointed to the massive opportunity in health care, which accounts for nearly 20% of U.S. gross domestic product with $5 trillion in annual spending. "People realize there could be a lot of winners in the space." OpenAI launched "ChatGPT Health" earlier this month, while Anthropic has "Claude Healthcare." Both are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, compliant extensions of their popular consumer chatbots. While competition is emerging, Nadler said his company's moat is its focus on physicians, quality of data and a first-mover advantage. "We've already gathered hundreds of millions of real-world clinical consultations from verified physicians — that feedback loop is incredibly hard to replicate," Nadler said. OpenEvidence said it topped $100 million in annualized revenue last year, mostly fueled by organic growth. Nadler said 95% of new users hear about OpenEvidence from another physician. "Most health care in America isn't happening at billion-dollar hospitals in New York or San Francisco," Nadler said. OpenEvidence was one of the first AI startups to rely on advertising for revenue, which Nadler said allows faster adoption and wider use versus a paid subscription model. Companies can pay for promotions through video ads on the OpenEvidence app. Last week, OpenAI said it was testing an ad-supported version of ChatGPT. Nadler said he's trying to be more disciplined than some companies that are "openly planning to burn billions or tens of billions over the next several years." "That's a big bet, and a very risky bet," Nadler said, adding that OpenEvidence is trying to balance growth with eventual profitability. "We're not running this like a private equity portfolio company, but we're also not planning on burning billions of dollars over the next year." AI startups are picking up this year where they left off in 2025. In the third quarter of last year, there were six AI funding rounds of more than $1 billion, according to CB Insights. Anthropic is in talks to raise an additional $10 billion as of January, while Elon Musk's xAI announced a $20 billion round this month. Nadler said that with the big tech companies aggressively pursuing acquisitions in the space, he's felt the pressure, but has remained set on building OpenEvidence as a stand-alone company. "I've done the acquisition route before," he said. But this time, I want to build something that compounds over many years." As for an initial public offering, he said SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic, which have all been rumored to be potential 2026 candidates, need to go public first.

"It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough," Hinton told BBC Newsnight in an interview released on Tuesday and recorded earlier this month. Hinton, who helped pioneer the neural networks that underpin modern artificial intelligence, has become one of the field's most outspoken critics as AI systems grow more powerful and widespread. He has predicted that AI could trigger widespread job losses, fuel social unrest, and eventually outsmart humans — and has said that researchers should focus more on how advanced systems are trained, including ensuring they are designed to protect human interests. On BBC Newsnight, Hinton said that humanity is approaching a pivotal moment as researchers edge closer to building machines more intelligent than humans. "We've never been in this situation before of being able to produce things more intelligent than ourselves," Hinton said, adding that many experts believe that AI will surpass human intelligence within the next 20 years — and in many areas, already has. Once that happens, he said, controlling such systems may become far more difficult than many assume. "The idea that you could just turn it off won't work," Hinton said, adding that a sufficiently advanced AI could persuade humans not to shut it down. Hinton said the biggest mistake humanity could make now would be failing to invest in research on how humans can coexist with the intelligent systems they created. He suggested that catastrophic outcomes are not inevitable, saying that the risks depend on how advanced systems are designed and governed and that humans still have "a lot of options on how to create them" while AI remains under development. Still, Hinton also expressed concern that AI is being unleashed at a time when global cooperation is weakening and authoritarian politics are on the rise, making meaningful regulation harder to achieve. He compared the need for AI governance to international agreements on chemical and nuclear weapons. "It would have been developed without me," he said. He remains hopeful about AI's potential to improve education and medicine, pointing to AI tutors and advances in medical imaging as examples of its promise.</p>

It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew. While Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior. Every time Kelsey publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

Musk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Analysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year.</p>

"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast," he added. Tesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year. The Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start. Meanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the "hardest year" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported. It wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product. The company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called "production hell" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. The electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had "dug its own grave" with the Cybertruck's design. The divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals. Musk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.</p>
