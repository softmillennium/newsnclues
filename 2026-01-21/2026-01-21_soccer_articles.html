                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials from England's top league wrote to FIFA to express deep concern about its plan to stage the inaugural global women's tournament from Jan. 5-30, 2028, possibly in Qatar and smack in the middle of the English domestic schedule. “At best it will cause us real scheduling issues; at worst it is going to be catastrophic for the game in this country, our commercial program and, more importantly, the welfare of our players.” European teams can secure up to six of 16 Club World Cup qualifying spots. The club tournament would be held between a pair of marquee international summer events — the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. “There are no gaps,” the WSL spokesperson said. “If the tournament is in a different time zone, with the rest and recovery needed, it could lead to rearrangement of a lot of fixtures.” On the men's side, FIFA has organized a Club World Cup in most years since 2000. It interrupted the season for Major League Soccer, which is shifting its schedule in 2027. FIFA chief football officer Jill Ellis defended the proposed timing of the women's tournament in speaking with media on Tuesday and said it could be reassessed four years from now. “We will enter a new calendar conversation in 2030,” Ellis said. “We will look at the entire ecosystem, taking into account all shareholders. (January 2028) was the window that I think everybody agreed upon.” Boston Bruins forward Alex Steeves signed a two-year, $3.25 million contract extension on Wednesday that runs through the 2027-28 season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Germany, fans watched the games on screens in crowded town squares, their roars careening off ancient buildings, or from the banks of rivers, peering at floating, double-sided big screens on barges. During the 2018 World Cup, Russia surprised visitors – and its own citizens – with its friendliness as spontaneous parties broke out all over the country. The reason the 2022 World Cup in Qatar didn't entirely feel like a real World Cup is that those sorts of spontaneous soccer gatherings just didn't seem to be happening, or not at the same scale, at any rate. It exists in the stadium, where it is studiously curated and ultimately makes every World Cup sound and feel largely the same. But it exists outside the venues, too. This realization offers hope for the upcoming World Cup. Because there is opportunity in this edition's unprecedented vastness. That there may be another way, a workaround. If the shocking ticket prices for the actual World Cup will make it exclusive and inaccessible – as is well established in these pages – something like a shadow World Cup may nevertheless emerge as an alternative. With a tall wall built around the genuine article, scalable only by a bundle of money, a kind of bootleg version may be fashioned out of the scraps and flashes of the tournament that have not yet been privatized and premium-ified. A lower-case world cup, as it were, consisting of fan fests and open training sessions and pre-tournament warmup matches. The bits not yet sold off to the highest bidder via the Visa pre-sale lottery peddling a bespoke, once-in-a-lifetime experience brought to you by Coca-Cola and Aramco and whomever else. There will still be an awful lot of World Cup-adjacent programming on offer around the tournament. And that means there's opportunity to make the World Cup accessible, in a way, to people who can't afford or access the full experience, financially or geographically. For a start, all 48 of those participants will be training somewhere, and will presumably hold a few open training sessions – an easy way for federations to score PR points in a coveted market. Germany will hold its training camp at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. The Netherlands, England and Argentina are all rumored to be headed for Kansas City. There may yet be teams who choose to train in Birmingham, Alabama; Westfield, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Oklahoma City; Tucson; or Stillwater, Oklahoma, depending on which of Fifa's proposed training facilities they pick. Taken together, they will expand the World Cup's footprint enormously. So, too, will the many pre-tournament tune-up games. Plenty of teams will choose to play their final friendlies at home, or at someone else's home, but a great many will use the occasion to acclimate to the US. The “Road to '26” series will pit Brazil, France, Colombia and Croatia up and down the East Coast in March. Argentina will play a pair of stateside friendlies in June against Honduras and Mexico, at undecided locations. The US will play newly crowned African champions Senegal in Charlotte on 31 May and Germany in Chicago on 6 June. And right now, all but New York City's and New Jersey's are expected to be free, per Front Office Sports. New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani already is freelancing watch-parties for major soccer games and promising to host more. If host cities, federations and US Soccer get creative, and if a concerted effort is made, this can still be a World Cup that a lot of people can touch. It can still leave a legacy and make memories beyond those lucky few who managed to get tickets. After all, Fifa can't monetize everything.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pair of dual nationals are going to El Tri Dual nationals have increasingly become an important element of the USMNT player pool. Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun, and Yunus Musah could represent one, or more, nations in addition to the United States. They joined the team after being recruited by coaches and players and have become key parts of the USA lineup. While those players were big acquisitions, not every player will choose the USA and any number of factors go into how they decide who to represent internationally. It seems like the factors for joining the USMNT were not compelling enough for a pair of players who had been a part of the picture for the Americans. ESPN is reporting that Richie Ledezma and Brian Gutierrez have finalized their one-time switch from the USA to Mexico with FIFA. Ledezma has not been a part of the USA set up for some time after featuring on youth teams going back to 2018 with the U-20s. Gutierrez is a different story, the midfielder notched nine goals and three assists with the Chicago Fire in 2025 and was a leading playmaker in MLS last season. He moved to Chivas in January and has room to develop further at just 22 years old. He had two caps last year in January camp but hasn't been called in for the USMNT since as Mauricio Pochettino focused on players who could contribute to the team by the time the World Cup starts this summer. The roster is deeper than it has ever been and the team is in a position where losing talents at the level Ledezma and Gutierrez are will not have the sting it would in past years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Manchester United star Paul Pogba has been tipped to seal a shock transfer to Wrexham before he hangs up his boots. The 32-year-old has returned to football at Ligue 1 side Monaco, after a spell out of the game due to a doping ban, but former France and Manchester United striker Louis Saha thinks he could be a good option for Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac's side. Pogba joined Monaco in June on a free transfer as he made his long-awaited return to football. The midfielder served a four-year doping ban, that was reduced to 18 months on appeal, and joined the French club after terminating his contract with Juventus. He was handed his Monaco debut in November as a late substitute at the end of a 4-1 defeat to Rennes, marking his first competitive appearance since 2023. Monaco defender Caio Henrique says the squad have been blown away by watching Pogba in training, but injuries have been a problem for the midfielder since he made his comeback and mean that he's only managed 30 minutes of action for his new club so far this season. Monaco CEO Thiago Scuro has admitted it's been a frustrating start to life at Monaco for Pogba and he has also admitted there is a possibility that the former France star could move on in the summer. If it does not work, for sure the parties can sit down in the summer and try to have another discussion, where do we go? It's not the moment to have this discussion because we are engaged on trying to find the solution and bring him back." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Saha has been asked about Pogba's future and explained why Wrexham might be a good choice. He told Grosvenor Casinos: "Paul Pogba back in England? The French league is extremely hard, to be honest. We all want Pogba to be at his best, and if he is, there is no reason that he can't be in the France squad at the World Cup. But, now he's coming to a very pivotal moment, February, March. I don't know if he's going to be in the Premier League or not. I will see in the summer what his situation is going to be, how many games he has played. He has had a great season, so that's for sure. Paul has his eyes on Hollywood and wants to be an actor in some way, so it might make a lot of sense."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We are setting records on ticket sales,” Trump said. However, questions remain over whether supporters from every qualifying country will ultimately be able to enter the US. It was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament. The US State Department has stressed that a FIFA Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, as all applicants must still undergo thorough security screening and vetting. Most citizens of countries under the US Visa Waiver Programme which covers much of Europe, including the UK, as well as Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days and therefore do not need to use the FIFA Pass.

Recall that Trump recently issued a pause on the processing of immigrant visas affecting 75 countries, from which 15 have already qualified for the 2026 tournament, including five-time winners Brazil. For Football fans in countries affected by the US suspension of immigrant visa processing, they will still be able to apply to travel for the World Cup. The State Department confirmed that the pause “applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only” and “does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals”. Countries already qualified on the list include: Algeria, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Haiti, Iran, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia, Uruguay and Uzbekistan. Nations still in contention on the list include: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, DR Congo, Iraq, Jamaica, Kosovo and North Macedonia. Earlier, Trump expanded a travel ban that came into force on January 1, barring nationals of certain countries from entering the US. Ivory Coast and Senegal, who have also qualified, are subject to partial restrictions. Guidance specifies there are exceptions for any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives under the travel ban for the World Cup. However, it adds that the exception does not apply to fans or spectators. While they can still submit visa applications, they may be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women's Club World Cup to take place in January 2028; WSL says timing of tournament causes "significant concerns" over domestic calendar and player welfare; global 16-team tournament could impact up to five match rounds of the league and fixtures could be moved to midweek "The timing of that tournament causes us significant concern," a WSL spokesperson said. "If that tournament is also in a different time zone and there needs to be travel and then rest, recovery and training ahead of a tournament and the same back the other way, we could be moving a lot of fixtures," a WSL spokesperson added. "We know Arsenal will participate as current holders of the Champions League. Based on the current coefficient, if they use that, Chelsea would probably qualify. But there could be more than two of our teams." A WSL spokesperson also added that there were concerns among clubs and players about the schedule. FIFA chief football officer and former United States women's national team coach Jill Ellis, who coached the USA to Women's World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019, told the BBC: "These consultations have happened since 2022, and this window [January] was one of the windows agreed upon. "It's hard to find the perfect spot, so it was important to involve a lot of people in these conversations. The decision was taken on these recommendations to delay it until 2028." On whether there is an appetite for the Club World Cup, Ellis said: "I think there is. This came to the calendar fairly late, but I think this will showcase these players around the world. "And the coach in me thinks, a lot of players don't get a chance to play international football so there is that as well." Last year, FIFA announced the inaugural Women's Champions Cup, which takes place this month. Sky Sports will exclusively broadcast all matches, kicking off with Gotham FC vs SC Corinthians (12.30pm) and Arsenal Women vs ASFAR (6pm), with both semi-finals being held at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium on Wednesday, January 28. The third-place play-off (2.45pm) and final (6pm) will then be hosted at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium four days later on Sunday, February 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WSL Football fears the timing of FIFA's new Women's Club World Cup could be “catastrophic” for its competition and claims it was not consulted over the final dates by the world governing body. “The timing of that tournament causes us significant concern by multiple levels,” a WSL spokesperson said in a media briefing on Wednesday. The 16-team tournament was initially due to be introduced in 2026, but was later delayed to 2028, after stakeholders in the women's game told the global governing body more time was needed to get it right. According to WSL Football, the competition not only adds to a busy calendar for players but also directly conflicts with at least five Women's Super League matchdays. If the competition is held in a different time zone or requires an additional qualification process, there are concerns further scheduling conflicts would arise. If based on coefficients, Chelsea would also likely participate. According to a WSL spokesperson, at least two more clubs could be involved. FIFA has stated they reached consensus on the competition's timing after consultation with stakeholders and confederations. “We will enter a new calendar conversation in 2030. Looking at the entire ecosystem, taking into every consideration in terms of shareholders and players, a massively important part of that, this was the window that everybody agreed upon,” she said. It will still run every four years but going forward, may not take place in the January window. “If you ask FIFA, yes, there was consultation,” said a WSL spokesperson. “I wouldn't say the information we've received is consultation. You report back on the changes that are made. “We don't want to stop our cubs competing on the global side from earning great prize funds that could be transformational for their business,” a WSL spokesperson added. It would be much better to take a step back and work out a way where everyone can benefit from this rather than have us stuck in the middle, having a war between our own clubs and FIFA, which is really unhealthy and not where we want to be.” According to a source briefed on the matter, players and their unions were consulted and have put forward certain conditions for FIFA to meet. For example, a dedicated prize money pot for players — there has to be competitive interest for players to take time out of the club schedule — and a robust prize money distribution mechanism beyond players and clubs. A FIFPRO report in December detailed the industry's two-tier calendar and the tension between under-loading and overloading players. On the one hand under-loading remains a pervasive issue in professional women's football for most players. In the WSL 2024-2025 season, for example, 43 per cent of players made fewer than 20 appearances. On the other end end of the spectrum elite players faced increasingly congested schedules, travelling and little rest periods in between. The Club World Cup will only compound this issue for them. “Players are at risk of physical and mental burnout. Ideally WSL football would prefer to have the competition held in the summer when there is not a major tournament taking place. “We need to take a big step back and look at the calendar as a whole rather than trying to slot things in an already incredibly congested calendar,” the spokesperson continued. “It's introducing a new tournament without really considering, should there be? Have we got the right amount of windows, international games, summer tournaments? It doesn't feel like the right thing to do.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World governing body Fifa has announced the inaugural global competition, designed to echo the revamped men's Club World Cup, will take place from 5 to 30 January 2028. The timing is what causes us real concerns," a WSL spokesperson said. We are fully on board with a strategy to help the women's game grow globally. "At best it will cause us real scheduling issues; at worst it is going to be catastrophic for the game in this country, our commercial programme and more importantly the welfare of our players." It is the second new mid-season women's competition to be introduced by Fifa in recent years. The inaugural Champions Cup – featuring continental champions from around the world, including Arsenal – will take place next week in London, between 28 January and 1 February. WSL officials say the planned Club World Cup would result in up to five WSL match weeks being rescheduled, leading to a potential fixture backlog and an impact on player fitness. They say they have written to Fifa with their concerns and will meet with global officials in London during the Champions Cup to discuss the issue. "If the tournament is in a different time zone, with the rest and recovery needed, it could lead to rearrangement of a lot of fixtures. Fifa chief football officer and former United States women's national team coach Jill Ellis says that the fixture congestion caused by the Club World Cup being played in January 2028 will prove to be an outlier. "It's hard to find the perfect spot, so it was important to involve a lot of people in these conversations. The decision was taken on these recommendations to delay it until 2028." "And the coach in me thinks, a lot of players don't get a chance to play international football so there is that as well." While there is a concern about fixture pile-up, players' union Fifpro has said some players are in need of more matches and that underloaded footballers are at a greater injury risk. According to a recent report, external, 43% of WSL players made fewer than 20 appearances per season while only 11% played 40 or more matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WSL Football has admitted "serious concerns" over the scheduling of the Women's Club World Cup, set to run Jan. 5 - Jan. 30 2028, saying it could have "catastrophic" consequences for the Women's Super League and player welfare. A spokesperson for the WSL said holding the tournament in January is "at best inconvenient, and at worst, catastrophic" for the domestic game in England, commercially and for player welfare, and said their preference would be for the Club World Cup to take place in the summer. Arsenal, as reigning Champions League winners will likely be involved. Based on coefficient rankings, at least one other WSL club may also be included, likely Chelsea, though no qualification process has been determined yet. A WSL spokesperson said the league does not want to stop clubs competing and is in favour of plans to grow the global game, but does have the option to stop English clubs from competing. The proposed 2028 Club World Cup is also bookended by the 2027 Brazil World Cup and the 2028 LA Olympics, adding further pressures to player load amid a growing international match calendar. Prior to WSL Football's comments, FIFA's chief football officer, Jill Ellis said: "We will enter a new calendar conversation in 2030, we will look at the entire ecosystem, taking into account all shareholders, players are a massive part of that. This was the window that I think everybody agreed upon." Though no host has been decided for the Club World Cup, The Guardian reported that Qatar was being considered. ESPN understand that no talks have been had but FIFA are open to the idea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has described the 2026 FIFA World Cup as a “once in a lifetime opportunity” as the United States government unveils its new FIFA Pass visa programme for international fans. US President Donald Trump praised the upcoming FIFA World Cup tournament while revealing the new travel system designed to fast-track visas for global visitors. And we can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe,” he said. Eleven of those host cities are in the United States, with the final set to take place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The FIFA Pass launched on January 20, allowing ticket holders to apply for expedited visa interviews before the tournament begins on June 11. According to the US Department of State, the FIFA Pass aims to cut long wait times for non-immigrant visas, including B1/B2 visitor categories. The programme prioritises confirmed ticket holders in countries where interview backlogs remain high. The system provides confirmed World Cup ticket holders with access to priority visa interview appointments at American embassies and consulates around the world. Officials confirmed that the initiative does not alter US immigration or security standards. Applicants must still meet all eligibility criteria, attend interviews, and demonstrate intent to return home after the tournament.

KMBC 9 News is learning that several of the world's top soccer teams are expected to set up base camps in the Kansas City area during the 2026 World Cup.

Sources tell KMBC that the defending World Cup champion Argentina national football team plans to base its camp in Kansas City, Kansas, and train at the Compass Minerals National Performance Center, the training home of Sporting Kansas City.

The England national football team is expected to train at Swope Soccer Village in Kansas City, Missouri, which previously served as Sporting Kansas City's training facility.

KMBC has also learned Algeria national football team plans to practice at Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence, Kansas, while the Netherlands national football team is expected to train at the Kansas City Current's facility in Riverside, Missouri.

FIFA has not made a formal announcement.

Kansas City's central location and extensive soccer facilities are believed to be key reasons the region is attracting international teams.
