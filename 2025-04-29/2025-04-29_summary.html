Amazon owner Jeff Bezos has made several moves in the past year to gain favor with Donald Trump.

Online retail behemoth Amazon pushed back against reporting from Punchbowl News on Tuesday that the company was planning to list tariff costs next to the total price of products on its website.

The Trump administration's tariffs against dozens of countries (including a whopping 145 percent tariff on all goods from China) will undoubtedly lead to higher prices for consumers, a point that several major retailers made known during the 2024 presidential campaign. The announcement that Amazon was planning to show consumers just how much tariffs would raise the costs of specific goods prompted praise from some political commentators — and a scathing response from the White House — before the company denied that it was considering the idea.

The report was especially surprising given the many ways that Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, one of the richest people on the planet, has sought to gain favor with the administration, including blocking the editorial staff of The Washington Post (which he owns) from publishing an endorsement of Donald Trump's 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris and stifling other criticism of Trump from writers and cartoonists at the publication. Bezos has also scaled back corporate promises to protect the rights of Black and LGBTQ people, falling in line with the White House's campaign to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion practices in both the public and private sectors. 

“Amazon doesn't want to shoulder the blame for the cost of President Donald Trump's trade war. So the e-commerce giant will soon show how much Trump's tariffs are adding to the price of each product, according to a person familiar with the plan,” the report from Punchbowl stated. 

Victoria Brownworth, a Philadelphia-based investigative journalist, lauded the supposed plan to disclose tariff costs.

“Every outlet should do this,” Brownworth wrote.

Political commentator Shea Jordan Smith also praised the idea.

“Amazon showing shoppers exactly how much Trump's tariffs are costing them isn't political — it's transparency,” he wrote on X.

The White House reacted swiftly to the report, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasting the company on behalf of Trump.

“I just got off the phone with the president about the Amazon announcement. This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” Leavitt claimed.

She then accused the company of hypocrisy because it didn't list price increases due to inflation following the pandemic, baselessly claiming that Amazon's plan to disclose tariff costs was “not really a surprise” because it was supposedly partnering “with a Chinese propaganda arm.”

After the Punchbowl report was published, Trump called Bezos on Tuesday morning to express his anger that tariff costs could be included in the price breakdowns of Amazon purchases. 

Amazon later claimed that the reporting from Punchbowl was false, with a spokesperson for the company saying that Amazon Haul, a “budget friendly” part of the shopping website, had “considered listing import charges on certain products.”

“This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties,” the spokesperson added.

But Diego Areas Munhoz, Punchbowl News's tech reporter, partially disputed Amazon's claim.

“Amazon is saying the tariff cost idea was restricted to its Amazon Haul service. Important to point out, Amazon Haul is hosted on Amazon.com,” Areas Munhoz wrote on X. “It's the first tab on the left on the main website.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

An embargo in support of Palestinian rights wins out over continuing to send weapons by a 50-point margin.

Democratic voters overwhelmingly say that the U.S. should restrict military assistance to Israel until it stops its assault on civilians in Gaza and respects the rights of Palestinians, new polling finds.

According to a Data for Progress-Zeteo poll released last week, 71 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say that the U.S. should end its arms transfers to Israel until it “stops attacks on civilians in Gaza, supports Palestinian rights, and commits to a long-term peace process.”

By contrast, only 21 percent of voters said that the U.S. should continue sending military aid to Israel, supporting Israel's supposed “right to defend itself” while also pushing for a reduction of civilian harm — with a 50-point margin between the two ideas.

Restricting military assistance is the most popular among voters under 45 years of age, with 80 percent in favor and only 13 percent against; support was still strong, however, among those over 45, with 68 percent agreeing that the U.S. should end aid.

The polling also found broad support for other progressive ideas compared to traditional policies championed by establishment Democrats, with majority support for Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, opposing transgender sports bans, and restricting deregulation and corporate influence in the economy.

The poll results are the latest show of the wide gulf between Democratic politicians and their base on the issue of Israel and its genocide in Gaza. 

Last month, Gallup found that nearly 60 percent of Democrats say they sympathize more with Palestinians than with Israelis, with only 21 percent saying they are more sympathetic to Israelis. Earlier this month, Pew released a survey finding that the majority of Americans now have an unfavorable view of Israel. 

Further, numerous polls released during President Joe Biden's term found that ending military aid to Israel would be a boon to Democrats' popularity — at a time when support for Democrats is cratering, and in some polls, reaching record lows. 

And yet, Democrats have not come out strong against the U.S.'s support of Israel, even as President Donald Trump has proposed a genocidal and unpopular plan for Gaza to be totally emptied of Palestinians through forced displacement, starvation or mass killing. 

In fact, a Senate vote to block a $9 billion weapons transfer to Israel forced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) this month failed with only 15 votes in favor — even less support from Democrats than similar resolutions brought by Sanders last year, despite Trump being behind the latest sale.

Meanwhile, establishment Democrats have stayed largely silent as the Trump administration has been abducting and imprisoning pro-Palestine student protesters; in fact, as these disappearances were happening in recent weeks, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) was trying to embark on a tour promoting a book demonizing the same people being targeted by Trump, even as advocates warned that the disappearances represent a major erosion of free speech rights.

Despite publicly opposing Trump, Harvard's agenda has often converged with that of the White House, one student said.

Although Harvard University has been celebrated for resisting the Trump administration — including suing over threats to withhold $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university refused to comply with a series of demands issued by the White House — on Monday it effectively dismantled its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) office, rebranding it as “Community and Campus Life.” 

The university also announced that it will no longer host or fund affinity group celebrations during Commencement.

“Such cowardly shit. Harvard is continuing to capitulate despite the lawsuit,” Harvard Law School clinical instructor Alejandra Caraballo wrote on Bluesky. “They fundamentally changed the mission and mandate of the office. It's a full on crackdown on support[] for minority students.”

This shift comes amid news that the Trump administration's civil rights offices at the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services opened investigations on Monday targeting Harvard University and the independently funded Harvard Law Review, alleging “race-based discrimination” —  a term that the administration has increasingly weaponized to attack DEI initiatives. 

“Harvard will do what it always does, snuff out internal opposition with oppressive administrative policies while implementing them over the summer to limit student protest,” Caraballo said. “They're remarkably efficient at this.”

Crimson Opinion Writer Violet T.M. Barron has similarly criticized the university's posture. Earlier this month, Barron wrote that while Harvard President Alan Garber has publicly opposed Trump, Harvard continues to “execute[] deeply conservative agenda from behind a fading blue facade.”

In 2024, Harvard suspended five students and placed 23 others on multi-semester probation for participating in a Palestine solidarity encampment in Harvard Yard. Harvard also banned over 60 students who staged a silent “study-in” protest from Widener Library, and punished around two dozen faculty members for their participation in related protests, issuing two-week library suspensions. Harvard also suspended the Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, a leading pro-Palestinian student organization at the university, and barred 13 students from graduating because of their involvement in protests against Israel's genocide in Gaza.

“Harvard's shameful track record on Palestine is only the most glaring proof that in many cases, the University's agenda converges with that of the government they ostensibly reject,” Barron wrote.

This March, Harvard's School of Public Health suspended its research partnership with Birzeit University, a prominent Palestinian institution in the occupied West Bank. That same month, Professors Cemal Kafadar and Rosie Bsheer were removed from their leadership roles at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES). In April, Harvard Divinity School announced the suspension of the Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative (RCPI) and did not renew the position of Hilary Rantisi, the program's associate director and the Divinity School's sole Palestinian American staff member. 

“Do not mistake Garber's scramble to retain a semblance of liberalism as a stand — let alone fight — against the Trump administration. No number of strongly worded statements nor invocations of ‘independence' or ‘constitutional rights' will allow Harvard to claw its way out of the hole it has dug itself into for over a year now,” Barron wrote. “In this hole, academic freedom is not reality but myth, proved fictional by the systematic exclusion of Palestine from its bounds.”

Accusation from UN agency comes as Red Crescent medic held since deadly Israeli attack on ambulances is freed 

The embattled UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has accused Israel of abusing dozens of its staff in military detention and using some as human shields.

The head of the agency, Philippe Lazzarini, said that more than 50 staff members, including teachers, doctors and social workers, had been detained and abused since the start of the 18 month-long war in Gaza.

“They have been treated in the most shocking & inhumane way. They reported being beaten + used as human shields,” Lazzarini wrote on X.

Those detained had been subjected to “sleep deprivation, humiliation, threats of harm to them & their families + attacks by dogs … [and] forced confessions”.

UN officials said the reported abuse had taken place in Gaza and also in military detention sites in Israel.

The Israeli military has not responded directly to Lazzarini's accusation, but has previously denied allegations of widespread abuse in its detention facilities and by its troops.

It has, however, launched investigations into abuse by individual soldiers during the war, and into the use of detainees as human shields, bringing charges against service personnel in some cases.

In a statement, the Israeli military said it acted in accordance with Israeli law and international law, and protects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.

“Any abuse of detainees, whether during their detention or during interrogation, violates the law and the directives of the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) and as such is strictly prohibited,” the statement said.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said on Tuesday that Israel had released a medic held since a deadly and hugely controversial attack by Israeli troops on ambulances in southern Gaza on 23 March.

Eight PRCS staff members, six from the Gaza civil defence agency and one Unrwa employee, were killed in the attack, according to the UN humanitarian office OCHA.

The killings sparked international condemnation, including concern from the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, about possible war crimes.

Relations between Israel and Unrwa have plunged since the beginning of the war, which was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas militants in southern Israel in October 2023 during which they killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage.

Israel banned all cooperation with Unrwa's activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank earlier this year, and claims the agency has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested.

The international court of justice, the UN's highest court, is hearing statements from dozens of countries and organisations before delivering a legal opinion on Israel's humanitarian obligations to Palestinians. A key issue is whether Israel's ban on Unrwa's operations in Palestine is legal.

Israel is not participating at the ICJ but has dismissed the hearings as “part of the systematic persecution and delegitimization” of the country. The foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Sunday that the hearings were “another attempt to politicise and abuse the legal process to persecute Israel”.

“The goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself,” he said. “It is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and Unrwa. The UN has become a rotten, anti-Israel and antisemitic body.”

The hearings come amid an intensifying bombardment of Gaza, which had killed at least 27 Palestinians in the past 36 hours, according to local health officials on Monday. The Israeli military said airstrikes had killed three militant commanders and that all targets were “subject to relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”

Palestinian health officials in the territory say 2,151 people, including 732 children, have been killed since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March that had been in place since mid-January.

Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza almost two months ago, stopping all food, fuel, medicines and other items from entering. It says the measure is intended to force Hamas into releasing hostages and accuses it of systematically stealing humanitarian assistance.

Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic” that endangers the whole population, potentially making it a war crime.

Humanitarian workers say supplies are running desperately low, with most people eating one meal or less a day. Major agencies such as the World Food Programme and Unrwa have distributed their last stocks of flour and other basic foodstuffs, and medics say malnutrition levels are rising.

Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements and other deals.

Families of deceased hostages called on Tuesday for the return of their loved ones' remains. There are fears that poor conditions and continuing fighting could lead to many being destroyed or soon becoming unidentifiable.

“After everything we went through on that day and since, it cannot be that my father's body will also disappear from the face of the Earth,” said Bar Godard, whose parents were killed during the 2023 Hamas raid and whose father's body was taken to Gaza.

Negotiations for a fresh ceasefire appear to have stalled, with conflicting reports about progress in ongoing talks. Few observers expect a breakthrough in the near future, though analysts say Donald Trump's scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in May could lead to renewed US pressure on Israel that might secure a deal.

Israeli forces have killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, since it launched its offensive on Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.

Bombardments and ground operations have also destroyed vast areas and displaced about 80% of the population, many of them 10 or more times.

Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to continue the offensive until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is either destroyed or agrees to disarm and leave the territory.

TD Securities is parting ways with its co-head of global markets, Chris Vogel, marking another significant change to its senior ranks this year.

Mr. Vogel, who is based in New York City, co-ran the global markets group alongside Dan Charney. Global markets oversees all trading activity, including, equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. Going forward, Mr. Charney will be the sole head of the group.

The departure marks another shakeup in the senior ranks of the trading division. In January, Jason Cope, former global head of fixed-income trading who had been with the bank for 15 years, left to run fixed-income at Polar Asset Management.

Mr. Vogel joined TD in 2017 from BlackRock as head of global foreign exchange and took on increasingly senior roles. In 2021, he was named co-head of global markets alongside Tim Wiggan.

In the years since, TD bought American investment bank Cowen & Co. and has had to integrate its U.S. division with Cowen employees. Mr. Charney, the new sole head of global markets, used to be the president of Cowen.

Mr. Wiggan, meanwhile, is now head of TD Securities. After co-running global markets, he became co-head of investment banking, and from there he was tapped to run TD's wealth management arm.

However, he was moved back to TD Securities as its leader in the fall of 2024, after only 10 month, because the group's former head, Riaz Ahmed, retired.

Around this time, TD announced significant changes to its leadership, including a new chief executive officer, Ray Chun. TD also revamped its board of directors after the bank pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in the United States.

Mr. Vogel will remain with TD as a special adviser until October.

The info the staffers reportedly have access to could “damage or harm national security” if leaked, one source said.

Two members of the Trump administration's so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) have been granted unusual access to classified networks that house U.S. government information regarding nuclear weapons. 

Sources speaking to NPR say that former SpaceX intern Luke Farritor and venture capitalist Adam Ramada, both members of Elon Musk's DOGE program, have accounts on two networks relating to the government's nuclear secrets. 

The sources note that Farritor and Ramada's names are included on a list of people who have had accounts created for them in order to access that information. This in itself is not proof that they've directly seen nuclear secrets, a point that spokespersons for the government have stated in order to discredit the report. But it is the first step toward accessing such information, which can only be viewed in a secure room.

“They're getting a little further in, it's something to make note of. It could lead to something bigger,” one source familiar with the matter told NPR.

Farritor and Ramada are listed as account holders allowed access to the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Enterprise Secure Network (ESN), which is “responsible for transmitting restricted data about America's nuclear weapons designs and the special nuclear materials used.” Through ESN, information is sent from nuclear labs to production facilities “that store, maintain, and upgrade the country's nuclear arsenal,” The Daily Beast reported.

The DOGE duo has also been granted access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, which the Department of Defense (DOD) uses to discuss nuclear weapons with the Department of Energy (DOE).

Access to those networks requires a “Q” level government clearance status, the highest level of security clearance that exists at the DOE. Typically, obtaining that status is a lengthy process, but it can be expedited in certain circumstances.

Neither Farritor nor Ramada has any experience, prior to working for DOGE, with handling classified information, let alone information relating to nuclear weapons.

A DOE spokesperson initially denied that Farritor and Ramada have access to the secured networks. That person later amended their statement to NPR, saying that accounts had been created for the two DOGE employees but had not been used. 

A former career DOD civil servant told the publication that if the information were somehow leaked (either purposely or by mistake), it could have devastating consequences, “potentially damag[ing] or harm[ing] national security.”

The new reports detailing the DOGE workers' access to the country's nuclear secrets comes as recent polling shows that most voters are skeptical that the “department” is carrying out its purported function of cutting waste and rooting out fraud.

According to a new Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll, while 43 percent of Americans believe that waste has decreased due to DOGE and the Trump administration, a majority of voters, 56 percent, hold the opposite viewpoint, with 31 percent saying that waste has stayed the same and 25 percent saying it has actually increased since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

The same holds true for voters' views on fraud — only 32 percent think that the administration has decreased fraud in the government, while 34 percent say the levels of fraud have remained the same. Another 34 percent say fraud has increased, for a combined total of 68 percent of respondents saying that fraud has not decreased as promised.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

When Donald Trump made his inaugural speech at the US Capitol, he began by proclaiming to the audience of former presidents and tech giants: “The golden age of America begins right now.”

While the statement was largely seen as a metaphor heralding a new era of US prosperity, Mr Trump was referring to at least one part of his presidency literally.

Since returning to power, the Republican leader has drenched every nook and cranny of the Oval Office in glimmering gold.

Mr Trump's office looks more like a king's chamber than the command post of modern democracy.

Gracing the walls, alongside portraits of former leaders of the free world, is Mr Trump's mugshot.

The glaring photo, featured on the front-page of the New York Post, sits in a gold frame just outside the Oval Office.

Mr Trump, 78, whose affinity for extravagant interiors has been apparent since he covered his Trump Tower triplex in Manhattan in 24 carat gold in the 1980s, appears to have transformed the office into an extension of his Mar-a-Lago estate.

While other presidents hosted world leaders in several rooms in the White House, Mr Trump conducts almost all of his entertaining, including press conferences, in the Oval Office, which he sees as his gilded stage.

Gone are the tufts of Swedish ivy – grown from cuttings given to John F Kennedy by the Irish ambassador – and sturdy, plain side tables favoured by Joe Biden.

Instead, the fireplace is adorned with gold ornaments and marble consoles held up by gilded eagles.

Kate Andersen Brower, who has written several books on the White House, said Mr Trump's renovations are "definitely in keeping with his New York real estate tycoon image".

She said: "In his mind, the more gold, the better. It's very on-brand for him… I think he associates gold with power and prestige.

"He's said gold also symbolises luck and angels, but I tend to think it's also about more is more."

Ms Andersen Brower said she cannot think of a president who has made "such big changes" to the decorations in the Oval Office, but all presidents leave their mark on the White House.

1 Gold detailing has been added to the front of the fireplace, as well as the wall beside it. Mr Trump has added golden accents across the whole room. These include gold cherubs shipped from his Florida estate to place in the pediments above the doorways. He told Fox News: "They say angels bring good luck."

2 Mr Trump has removed the Swedish ivy plants that used to sit above the fireplace. They were grown from cuttings given to John F Kennedy by the Irish ambassador to the US, Thomas J Kiernan. Instead, he has filled the space with seven gold ornaments, some of which appear to be trophies or candle holders. The figures are arranged in a row flanking a tall empire-style centrepiece.

3 Mr Trump has packed almost every inch of wall space in the oval office with portraits in gold frames, almost doubling the number favoured by Mr Biden, mimicking his style at Mar-a-Lago.

Mr Biden had six portraits on the wall, while Barack Obama hung portraits of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington then decorated the rest of the space with modern paintings. Mr Trump has hung close to 20 paintings in the Oval Office all of predecessors or statesmen he is inspired by:

Top row, left to right

John Adams: Founding Father and second US president.

Benjamin Franklin: Founding Father and signer of the Declaration of Independence.

George Washington: First US president.

Thomas Jefferson: Founding Father, primary author of the Declaration of Independence and third US president.

Benjamin Franklin: Another portrait of Mr Franklin.

Bottom row, left to right
On the extreme left and right are grand, gold stucco mirrors which Mr Trump has had added to many walls and doors.

Martin Van Buren: Eighth US president and founder of the Democratic Party.

Mr Trump's decision to hang a portrait of James Polk, a president from the 1800s who oversaw the largest territorial expansion in American history, fits with his expansionist ambitions in Panama, Canada and Greenland.

On an additional section of wall to the right of the fireplace hangs Franklin D Roosevelt – Mr Trump's inclusion of FDR might raise some eyebrows given Roosevelt's liberal policies, but Mr Trump has said he was a "serious president" regardless of his views.

Mr Trump has returned a painting of Andrew Jackson, a populist with whom the president frequently identifies and who also faced censure during his presidency, after Mr Biden removed it during his time in office.

The painting on the far right is of John Marshall, Founding father and fourth Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court

4 The lamps on either side of the coffee table, which had been made from patterned china, have been replaced with gold lights in the shape of trophies.

5 Mr Trump has replaced the wooden side tables which hold the busts of Martin Luther King Jr and Winston Churchill with extravagant marble-topped consoles with gold eagles at the base.
6 Donald Trump returned the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. The bust of the British prime minister was originally loaned to George W Bush by Tony Blair in 2001. It was removed by Barack Obama in 2009, which Boris Johnson called a "snub to Britain". Mr Trump returned the bust to the Oval Office during his first administration, which Mr Biden subsequently removed.
7 The bust of Dr King, which Mr Biden brought into the Oval Office, remains.
8 The cream chairs in front of the fireplace have been replaced with light yellow versions, covered with a champagne-coloured flocked fabric.
9 Gold coasters have been added to the coffee table.
10 A scale model of Air Force One, the presidential plane that Mr Trump designed during his last term, sits on the coffee table.

Every angle of the office now shimmers after Mr Trump enlisted the help of John Icart, who some of his advisers are said to refer to as his "gold guy", to redecorate the room.

The Floridian, who worked on Mar-a-Lago, travelled to Washington DC with Mr Trump on Air Force One to help add custom-made gold finishes to the Oval Office, including the carving for the fireplace mantel and the white plaster molding that wraps around the room, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Mr Trump is said to often return from his weekend sojourns to Mar-a-Lago with a new piece of decor for the Oval Office.

There are gilded Rococo mirrors, gold cherubs shipped in from his Florida estate and a heavy, gold paperweight embossed with "Trump" on the coffee table.

Behind the Resolute Desk sit pictures of Mr Trump and his wife and children, along with a glinting gold model of the Fifa World Cup.

Further suggesting Mr Trump is trying to remake the Oval Office in the manner of his Mar-a-Lago estate, the president is said to have brought in experts to hang a chandelier from the ceiling.

His ambitions were curtailed, however, because the fixture was deemed too heavy for that part of the ceiling, although one official told the WSJ the project could go ahead in a different area of the room.

1 Mr Trump opted to keep the Resolute Desk, which has been used by every US president since Jimmy Carter, other than George H W Bush. Presidents can choose one of seven desks to use in the Oval Office. The Resolute Desk was a gift from Queen Victoria, carved from timbers from an Arctic exploration vessel.

Mr Trump currently has a temporary desk in his office while the Resolute Desk is being refurbished.

2 The famous red button Mr Trump uses to summon a Diet Coke has returned to his desk, which he said people sometimes mistake for the nuclear button. He also has a tray filled with Sharpie marker pens which he uses to sign executive orders.

Pictures of Mr Biden's family have been replaced with those of Mr Trump's own. One framed picture shows his eldest three children in formal evening wear, another shows him with his daughter Ivanka and there is a picture of Mr Trump and his wife Melania, holding their son Barron when he was a baby.

3 The golden replica of the Fifa World Cup trophy is on display in honour of North America hosting the tournament next year.

4 There is an easel displaying a map of the body of water he renamed as the Gulf of America.

5 A bust of César Chávez, the Mexican-American labour leader who fought for the rights of farm workers, has been removed. It has been replaced with an equestrian sculpture of Andrew Jackson; an artist's miniature of a statue located in Washington's Lafayette Park. 

6 Mr Trump has returned the flags for every service branch of the military to the Oval Office, which he had on display during his first term. Mr Biden had removed them, leaving only two flags behind the desk: the American flag, and a flag bearing the presidential seal.

7 The paintings of former statesmen Mr Trump has hung near his desk also point to the priorities of his second term.

A large portrait of Ronald Reagan hangs immediately to the right of his desk, showing his admiration for the Republican leader.

Above it sits a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the country's first treasury secretary.

James Monroe, the fifth US president, is displayed in a golden frame to Hamilton's right.

A second portrait of Andrew Jackson hangs further to its right

8 Sitting under the painting of Mr Reagan is a sculpture called "The Bronco Buster" by Frederic Remington, which also graced Trump's first Oval Office.

9 The president immediately swapped out the dark blue rug used during the Biden administration, which originates from when Bill Clinton was in the White House. Mr Trump instead opted for the cream-coloured carpet he used during his first term.

The pastel tones of Mr Trump's rug, which was also used by Ronald Reagan, are more in keeping with the gold and cream colour palette the president favours across Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower.

Keen to put his mark on the White House, Mr Trump has ambitions to rip up the grass in the Rose Garden and replace it with a patio because he said the heels of female guests sink into the grass if it's wet.

A copy of the Declaration of Independence has been installed behind blue curtains to protect it from the light.

Ms Andersen Brower said the addition of extra paintings in the Oval Office is “about power and [Mr Trump] cementing his own legacy as being as great, or, in his mind better, than his predecessors”.

The glitzy changes brought in by Mr Trump prompted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to describe the Oval Office as “the Golden Office for the Golden Age”.

            Mankind's achievements over the millennia have been bountiful. Their evolutionary fruits – from the harnessing of fire, to vaccines, to the art of diplomacy – were never low hanging; they were imagined before they were ever grasped.
    


            But once held, they became indispensable. Until now that is, as 100 days into his presidency US President Donald Trump seems determined to throw this painful learning to the wind, risking a world forced into reverse.
    


            A torrent of tariffs, unleashed against the better judgement of experts, yet exalted by Trump's acolytes as the work of a deal-making genius are a case in point. So too is his willingness to throw allies to the wind, by threatening to grab Greenland, Canada even Panama by force if necessary.
    


            Whatever one's view of the policies themselves, Trump's total upending of the global status quo has sewn fear and uncertainty among America's friends, exacerbated market volatility and normalized economic aggression. It's a formula that over the centuries has rarely served the world well.
    


            The president's apparent over-arching ethos – might is right, and mine is greatest – is now demolishing geopolitical norms at speed. It is Ukraine that should give in to Russia, which “has all the cards,” Trump says. Russian President Vladimir Putin's “pretty big concession,” his US counterpart adds, is not “taking the whole country.”
    


            Yet despite three years of “meat-grinding” war, Putin's aim remains as contrary to international law as it was when he launched his unprovoked, full-scale invasion.
    


            It is clear then why Trump struggles to do what all his allies find easy: to blame Putin for defying the rules-based world order in a brutal campaign to swallow his smaller neighbor. The US president often even blames Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky for the war in which at least 42,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed or injured, according to the United Nations, saying “he should never have started it.”
    


            The implication – that the weak should capitulate to the strong – is an upending of millennia of evolution, culminating in the post-World War II, US-inspired rules-based international order that led to an unprecedented eight decades of relative global peace, prosperity and unimaginable scientific innovation.
    


            Trump, as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has commented, has broken the mold. “Old assumptions can no longer be taken for granted, the world as we knew it is gone,” he said.

            The president's world view was nurtured by his property-developing, landlord father Fred Trump. Poor tenants unable to pay their rent claimed they were evicted; not an uncommon practice at the time, or since, but one that advantages the powerful over the weak.
    


            The parallels are not hard to spot: the world's most powerful man still relies on bravado and bullying to get what he wants. Today everyone is in his firing line. America has been “taken advantage of by virtually every country in the world,” Trump inaccurately claims, “we're no longer going to be the country that's ripped off by every country in the world.”
    


            But here's the rub. Such is Trump's braggadocio, no one he trusts appears brave enough to challenge him. Only when global markets soured, and his Petri dish economic experiment turned putrid, did he backslide on the threat to impose immediate tariffs on both friends and foes of the US, and even then, it may not be enough to avoid economic pain.
    


            China seems ready to wait out his trade-defying tariffs, having been preparing for this moment since Trump's first term.
    


            Now, it seems, he must learn a costly lesson for himself that economic evolution had already taught the experts.
    


            And while Trump's defiant pose after the July 2024 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, was enough to convince Putin that he was “a courageous man,” the US president is already backing down on some of his tariff bravado, chastened by his loyalists who found their voices as bond markets tanked.
    


            In the view of both Putin and Trump, it is the tough who set the rules, and the man in both their crosshairs, Ukraine's President Zelensky, got this message Wednesday, “the man with ‘no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE,” as Trump wrote on his social media platform.  Trump has since criticized Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader is interested in peace and suggesting “he's just tapping me along.”
    


            The world Trump and Putin seem to crave is one of spheres of influence run from islands of power, where diplomacy is a time-consuming irrelevance replaced by imperial decrees.
    


            It would be a reset harking back to a darker time, essentially overturning the rules-based order. In the aftermath of great empires, regional warlords allied, feuded and fought each other for centuries before nations emerged, and largely did the same.
    


            By the 19th century diplomats like Klemens von Metternich, the Chancellor of the Austrian Empire, spent entire careers attempting to balance Europe's feuding powers. He famously said, “when France sneezes, the rest of Europe catches cold.”
    


            Today it is Trump spreading a chill. The Manhattan real estate developer has said he is going to “get” Greenland “for national security reasons.” Greenland and its Danish patron, a NATO ally that is no match militarily for the USA, say no.
    


            Canada's prime minister says the same about Trump's plans to make his northern neighbor the USA's 51st state, insisting “it will never happen.” Mark Carney, a former central banker already battling Trump's aggressive trade tariffs, knows the threat is real, telling voters ahead of Monday's election in which his Liberal Party won a stunning fourth consecutive victory “the Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country.”
    


            Trump's world view is clear: he speaks as though he can reach out and take these things, and clearly believes he is working from an island of power, isolated from the negative consequences of his assumed conquests.
    


            But no man, nor nation, is an Island.
    


            Trump's weakness is not just that he might buy Putin's lie that he can conquer all Ukraine, or be outfoxed by Xi on tariffs, but that the rest of the world increasingly sees through his mantle of self-belief.
    


            The costs of this muscle-power politics will be revealed more slowly than the near-instantaneous economic market pain to his trade tariffs. But it still marks a return to  an era of dog eat dog. History has shown how that turns out.

            A Chinese man fighting for the Russian Army claims his superiors locked him in a dark steel-barred pit, with barely enough room to stand, for 21 days. His offense, he said, was a dispute with his commander over lifesaving protective gear.
    


            Michael, not his real name, said he joined Russia's fight against Ukraine to “have a taste for military life abroad” but after a brutal year on the frontlines is now convinced enlisting in Vladimir Putin's army was “a mistake.”
    


            His experience in the pit, where the 29-year-old said he could barely lift his head, killed his desire to fight for Moscow and he wants to send a message home to other Chinese nationals contemplating joining Russia's fight.
    


            “I have to speak out some truths and warn those irrational Chinese – don't come over here,” he said.
    


            Speaking to CNN by phone, Michael said he was currently recovering from injuries sustained on the battlefield.
    


            “The world's number two military is a sheer joke,” Michael said, listing subpar equipment, inadequate logistics, mistreatment and “severe corruption” as issues within the military, complaints that have been widely documented since the war began.
    


            Both Ukraine and Russia have used foreign fighters to bolster their forces. But the issue of Chinese mercenaries fighting for Russia was thrust into the global spotlight when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed two Chinese fighters had been captured by Ukraine in early April and claimed there were “many more” in Russia's ranks.
    


            Zelensky demanded answers from Beijing which, in turn, denied any involvement and repeated previous calls for Chinese citizens to “refrain from participating in military actions of any party.”
    


            Russia's deputy foreign minister called the claims Chinese citizens were fighting in Ukraine a “complete untruth,” according to TASS, a Russian state media agency. Days later Ukraine paraded the Chinese fighters it captured in front of the media.
    


            Kyiv said it had information that 155 other Chinese nationals were fighting for Russia. But the true number is likely higher, according to Zelensky. Both Michael and another Chinese fighter who fought with Russia told CNN they know of hundreds of others.
    


            A handful of Chinese people have been fighting on the Ukrainian side too. CNN has confirmed their presence with one battalion, but Ukraine's Land Forces could not provide a total number as each unit recruits directly.
    


            Chinese men have been targeted on social media by recruitment ads to join Russia on the frontlines fighting Ukraine.
    


            The posts and accompanying videos seen by CNN typically promise good pay and to boost the manhood of those who sign up.
    


            The videos are all in Russian but come with Chinese translations. One carried Chinese subtitles saying: “Aren't you a man? Be a real man!” It is not clear who made the translations.
    


            Such videos caught the attention of Michael, who said he started seeing them in 2023 on Douyin – the Chinese version of TikTok. Once enlisted, he started posting regular social media videos of his time in Moscow's ranks.
    


            Michael told CNN he had been a soldier in China's People's Liberation Army, but left in 2018, and said seeing the ads and videos from other Chinese fighters on the frontlines rekindled his “aspiration for the army.”
    


            “I felt pretty pumped back then,” Michael recalled. “As a former professional soldier in China, I thought there had to be a way for me to contribute here.”
    


            He said it wasn't political – he just wanted to fight. “I'm just a pure soldier,” he said.
    


            While he could've chosen to fight for Ukraine, he said, but it was easier to get a visa to go to Russia and he arrived in Moscow on a tourist permit in November 2023.
    


            After being initially turned down by the Russian army because he didn't speak Russian, he said he joined the infamous mercenary group Wagner and was sent to fight in the Donbas region. Six months later, in May 2024, he says he signed a one-year contract with Russia's Defense Ministry which sent him to Bakhmut. Other foreign fighters have signed similar contracts.
    


            Michael told CNN that his contract offered 200,000 rubles ($2,400) per month and in a previous social media video said there were also bonuses when they captured territory from Ukraine – an extra 50,000 rubles ($598) for every kilometer they pushed eastward.
    


            According to Michael, most of his Chinese comrades-in-arms are in it for the cash. As one self-proclaimed Chinese mercenary put it in a comment on Douyin: “no money, no honor.” CNN tracked the IP address of the post to a location in Russia.
    


            Michael offered a reason the money mattered; describing himself and many Chinese fighters on Russia's frontline as being “from the bottom of the heap” in his homeland's hyper-competitive society and where economic growth is slowing.
    


            Another Chinese national who said he fought for Russia and documented his exploits online told CNN what he earned as a mercenary was about three times what he was previously earning at home.
    


            The man, 37, who CNN has chosen not to name, said he spent a year in Russia's army from July 2023. He said it was hard for him to pinpoint exactly why he signed up, but didn't think money was a major factor for him.
    


            “Maybe it's because I feel lost in life, like I'm searching for something,” he told CNN. “I just want to wander. As a man, I have had a kind of hero complex since my childhood.”
    


            He said he previously served as a prison guard and, like Michael, claimed fighting for Russia was not a political choice.
    


            He chose to fight for Russia because he felt it “has the upper hand in military strength.”
    


            That view is not uncommon in China.
    


            Maria Repnikova, an expert on Chinese and Russian politics at Georgia State University, said state media coverage in China leans towards a pro-Russia stance. “The Chinese outlets' coverage of the war has significant impact on public perceptions of this ongoing invasion,” she said.
    


            Some Chinese fighters have adopted language commonly deployed by the Kremlin, expressing their desire to “go against Nazi fascism” and referring to the war as a “special military operation” in public posts on Douyin, seen by CNN.
    


            While they may not have caught the world's attention until now, seeing Chinese fighters with buzz cuts sharing daily experiences from the frontlines and engaging in live chats with fellow fighters was commonplace on Chinese short video platforms. Their account handles often featured Chinese and Russian flags and CNN tracked several of their IP addresses to Russia and Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine.
    


            But shortly after Zelensky raised the issue of Chinese fighters on the Russian frontlines with Beijing last week, many of those social media accounts were blocked.
    


            The Russian recruitment ads, however, are still widely available on China's tightly-controlled internet.
    


            Michael was one of those Chinese fighters regularly sharing his experiences on Chinese social media, but he said was restricted from posting before the latest round of censorship. He believes the sweeping ban was because of his public comments detailing his mistreatment in the Russian military.
    


            The other fighter, who returned to China in late 2024, said he discovered he was now prohibited from leaving the country last month, when he was stopped before a planned trip abroad. He suspects the travel ban is connected to his previous service in Russia.
    


            There have been Chinese fighting on both sides of this war but those who chose to fight for Ukraine – who largely see themselves as motivated by ideology rather than finances – seem to have one thing in common: they spent time out of China.
    


            Jason, who was born in China, moved to the United States during his high school years.
    


            He said he dropped out of his master's program in Computer Science at a US College in May 2023 to go to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, and enlist in the Ukrainian International Legion. CNN has seen his Chinese passport and enlistment contract.
    


            After spending four months dodging shells in trenches and foxholes, the then infantryman said he sought to be even more active in combat. He applied to transfer to an assault company, but said he was turned down because the Ukrainian commander was suspicious about his nationality.
    


            Reflecting, a year after returning to the US, he said that was a “pity,” but he understood the suspicion because “China and Russia are pretty close.”
    


            China's threat to one day take Taiwan was a motivation for Jason to fight with Ukraine.
    


            The cause of the self-governing island - which China's Communist Party claims as its own and has vowed to seize by force, if necessary - is deeply personal for the 27-year-old. He said his great-grandfather was a Nationalist soldier who lost his life in the fight against the Communists in the late 1940s during China's civil war. The defeated Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan.
    


            He hopes the fact he went to fight for Ukraine would give people in Taiwan a “sense of hope that someone would come to help,” if China were to invade.
    


            “I think most of the Chinese people are being brainwashed for a long time,” he said.
    


            Sophie, a PhD student from a top-tier Chinese university, is currently waiting for approval to join the Ukrainian International Legion. CNN has seen her passport and application documents.
    


            She told CNN she “used to be pretty indifferent to politics” but her thinking changed during a year of studying in Europe, away from the confines of China's Great Firewall and its pervasive online surveillance.
    


            She said she was inspired to sign up for service in Ukraine after seeing a video about the only known Chinese national killed while fighting for Ukraine.
    


            Sophie told CNN many of her friends back home in China hold pro-Russian views of the war and said she too was once “brainwashed” by “one-sided information from Russia.”
    


            Claims of a “one-sided” narrative in China were also made by the two Chinese fighters captured by Ukraine. Ukrainian security personnel watched over the men as they spoke, likely under duress, and the fact the two men were put in front of media at all is likely a violation of international humanitarian law.

Ukraine parades Chinese nationals captured fighting for Russia. What message was it trying to send?



            Following the capture, Zelensky has publicly said Ukraine is investigating whether the Chinese state has had a hand in encouraging its nationals to fight for Russia.
    


            “I don't have an answer to this question yet. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding: “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”
    


            China has repeatedly denied any state involvement. “These claims are groundless,” said Lin Jian, spokesperson for China's Foreign ministry, after being asked about Zelensky's statement “many more” Chinese citizens were fighting for Russia.
    


            “Ukraine should acknowledge China's efforts and constructive role in seeking a political solution to the crisis,” said Lin in a news conference on April 9.
    


            China's quick move to censor the social media accounts of Chinese fighters in Russia is to have been expected, according to Maria Repnikova, the Georgia State University expert. “I am not surprised by the censorship of mercenaries since the capture was a big scandal,” she said.
    


            While social media has undoubtedly played a role in the recruitment of Chinese fighters, Repnikova said the fact the recruitment ads were not censored in China, and remain available, was likely more an “oversight” than “strategic” because the pro-Russian view in such videos is “just entwined with the narrative of Russia fighting well.”
    


            Michael and Jason may have fought on opposite sides of this war, but they have a shared experience: the reality of war, they said, was much worse than they ever expected.
    


            “It's incredibly brutal, far beyond what anyone can imagine,” said Michael.

President had said order relaxing some of his 25% tariffs on cars and car parts will be ‘short-term' help

On the auto tariff executive orders, Trump said:

We just wanted to help [automakers] enjoy this little transition, short-term. If they can't get parts, you know, it has to do with a very small percentage. If they can't get parts, we didn't want to penalize them.

The president will sign an executive order later today to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts, a significant climbdown as the duties threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers.

The change will allow carmakers with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.

The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, White House officials said.

They also said that parts made in Canada and Mexico that follow North America free trade rules would not face tariffs, an exemption previously described as temporary.

Doug Emhoff, the husband of former vice president Kamala Harris, accused the Trump administration of turning “one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue”, after he and other Joe Biden appointees were removed from the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.

Emhoff, who is Jewish and spoke passionately against the rising tide of antisemitism during his time as the Second Gentleman, said he was informed on Tuesday that he had been removed from the museum's council.

“Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve,” he said.

“No divisive political decision will ever shake my commitment to Holocaust remembrance and education or to combatting hate and antisemitism. I will continue to speak out, to educate, and to fight hate in all its forms—because silence is never an option.”

The New York Times reported that the Trump administration also fired Ron Klain, Biden's first chief of staff, Susan Rice, national security adviser to Barack Obama and Biden's top domestic policy adviser, and Tom Perez, the former labor secretary who was a senior advisor to the former president. 
 Trump defeated Harris in November. Emhoff's law firm recently struck a deal with the Trump administration to avert an executive order targeting its practice, a decision the former Second Gentleman is reported to have voiced his disagreement with.

Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has abruptly banished the Pentagon's Women, Peace and Security program as part of his crusade against diversity and equity – dismissing it as “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative” despite it being a signature Donald Trump achievement from his first term.

In a post on X, Hegseth wrote: “This morning, I proudly ENDED the ‘Women, Peace & Security' (WPS) program inside the [Department of Defense]. WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops – distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING.”

The defense secretary added the program was “pushed by feminists and left-wing activists”, claiming “Politicians fawn over it; troops HATE it.”

But the decision is raising some eyebrows as the initiative was established during Trump's first administration when he signed the Women, Peace and Security Act in 2017, making the US the first country in the world to codify standalone legislation on the matter.

The Trump campaign even courted women voters by citing the initiative as one of its top accomplishments for women on its website.

Attempting to square this circle, Hegseth later claimed the Biden administration had “distorted & weaponized” the original program. “Biden ruined EVERYTHING, including ‘Women, Peace & Security,'” he insisted.

The Senate has confirmed billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens to be ambassador to the UK, backing Donald Trump's nominee by 59 to 39.

Stephens is chairman, president, and CEO of Stephens Inc, a privately owned financial services firm headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas. He is a longtime contributor to Republican candidates, including Trump, having donated millions of dollars to support his campaigns and 2025 inauguration fund.

Asked about negotiations with Congress over tax legislation, Trump said: “the Republicans are with us. I think we've got the big beautiful deal that's moving along, and I think we're going to have it taken care of.”

A very important element that we're working on now, more important than anything with the border in good shape, is the fact that we want to get, and very importantly, the big beautiful new deal. If we get that done, that's the biggest thing … And I think we're going to get it done. We have great Republican support. If the Democrats blocked it, you'd have a 60% tax increase. I don't think that's going to happen. We have great support from Republicans.

He added:

The next period of time, I think, my biggest focus will be on Congress, the deal that we're working on. that would be the biggest bill in the history of our country in terms of tax cuts and regulation cuts, and other things.

On the auto tariff executive orders, Trump said:

We just wanted to help [automakers] enjoy this little transition, short-term. If they can't get parts, you know, it has to do with a very small percentage. If they can't get parts, we didn't want to penalize them.

Donald Trump said Jeff Bezos “was very nice, he was terrific” during their call earlier and “he solved the problem very quickly”. “He's a good guy,” Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One.

Trump called the Amazon executive chairman this morning to complain about a report that the company planned to display prices that show the impact of tariffs.

The Trump administration has reached one trade deal already and is waiting for approvals from that country before announcing it, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC.

I have a deal done ... but I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give its approval, which I expect shortly.

Key GOP moderate Don Bacon has privately told the White House he won't accept more than $500bn in cuts to Medicaid, two people with direct knowledge of the matter have told Politico.

Bacon's red line could complicate matters as Republicans try to pass its massive party-line megabill to enact Trump's domestic policy agenda, which is set to include border security, energy policy and other provisions.

The representative from Nebraska told Politico he wants to limit the changes to Medicaid to implementing the first-ever federal work requirements for the program, excluding noncitizens from eligibility for benefits and mandating more frequent eligibility checks.

Moderates like Bacon are wary of cutting deep into social safety net programs like Medicaid, while GOP fiscal hawks are pressing for more drastic cuts to federal spending. With the party's slim majorities in both chambers, House speaker Mike Johnson – despite his optimistic tone this morning – can't afford to lose more than three Republicans on a party-line vote.

Kash Patel has instructed the FBI to administer polygraph tests to identify the sources of alleged leaks to news outlets, the Washington Post (paywall) reports.

In recent weeks, the bureau's director has ordered the tests be used to investigate sensitive information that was shared with the press, creating a climate of fear and intimidation, according to the Post.

The polygraphs are part of an administration-wide effort to clamp down on dissent, sources told the paper.

Current and former officials describe a culture of intimidation where the “sense of dread is palpable” among employees, with one former FBI field office head saying:

People are trying to keep their heads down. Morale is in the toilet.

The United States proposed sending up to 500 Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador as the two governments sought to reach an agreement on the use of the nation's notorious mega-prison, according to emails seen by CNN.

The details of the arrangement, which have not been previously reported, reveal the Trump administration's deal-making with El Salvador to take the unprecedented step of sending migrants to the country to be detained in Cecot.

El Salvador eventually agreed to accept up to 300 people in mid-March, according to an internal document. A US official described 500 as a “notional” figure, adding that the arrangement between the two countries is a “cooperation agreement but in a friendly non-binding fashion”, and still stands.

Donald Trump called Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos on Tuesday morning to complain about a report that the company planned to display prices that show the impact of tariffs, CNN reports.

CNN notes that an administration official described Trump as “pissed” after learning of the news. Soon after the call, an Amazon spokesperson released a statement clarifying the move “was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties”.

The spokesperson later sent CNN a revised statement, adding: “This was never approved and not going to happen.”

‘The weeks when decades happened': Trump's first 100 days took the US from cornerstone of the west to unreliable ally

For US foreign policy, Donald Trump's first 100 days in office were the weeks when decades happened.

In just over three months, the US president has frayed alliances that stood since the second world war and alienated the US's closest friends, cut off aid to Ukrainians on the frontlines against Vladimir Putin, emboldened US rivals around the world, brokered and then lost a crucial ceasefire in Gaza, launched strikes on the Houthis in Yemen and seesawed on key foreign policy and economic questions to the point where the US has been termed the “unpredictable ally”.

The tariffs Trump has unleashed will, if effected, disrupt global trade and lead to supply chain shocks in the United States, with China's Xi Jinping seeking to recruit US trade allies in the region.

Operating mainly through executive action, the Trump administration has affected nearly all facets of US foreign policy: from military might to soft power, from trade to immigration, reimagining the US's place in the world according to an isolationist America First program.

“The shake-up has been revolutionary, extraordinary. It's upended 80-some years of American foreign policy,” said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former ambassador to Nato.

The Trump presidency has ended the relative peace in the western hemisphere since the end of the second world war underwritten by US economic, military and diplomatic influence, Daalder said.

The foundation of the Pax Americana was trust, and once you break trust, it's extraordinarily difficult to restore. And restoring trust – trust in America, trust in American institutions, trust in American voters – it takes a long time to rebuild.

As we reported earlier, Donald Trump will sign an executive order later today giving automakers building vehicles in the US relief from part of his new 25% vehicle tariffs to allow them time to bring parts supply chains back to the US, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said.

Lutnick told reporters that automakers would receive credits for up to 15% of the value of vehicles assembled in the US that could be applied against the value of imported parts. This would help domestic carmakers move their supply chains to the US, he said. The relief would be phased in over three years, he added.

All cars that are finished in the US that have 85% domestic content will have no tariff applied, Lutnick said, adding that the auto tariff will apply to foreign carmakers building cars in the US. “This is ‘finish your cars in America and you win',” he said.

Autos and parts subject to the 25% section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs would no longer be subject to other tariffs imposed by Trump, including 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican goods, as well as 10% duties applied to most other countries, Reuters reports.

Reuters reports that Lutnick said the adjustments to auto tariffs were aimed at allowing domestic carmakers time to grow their US plants and employment. He said it hadn't been clear until conversations with automakers that even a small tariff would hold them back from hiring and investment. He said they told Trump they needed relief in order to boost hiring plans.

Two years was the agreed time to give manufacturers sufficient time to build up their supply chains, Lutnick said, adding there would be no third year of relief.

A majority of the Senate has backed one-time senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, a position the former business executive assumes amid a deep strategic rivalry and blistering trade war between the two countries.

Reuters reports the tally was 67 to 29 in favor of confirming Donald Trump's nominee Perdue, who was a Republican senator from Georgia from 2015 to 2021.

Perdue has long been an ally of Trump and has fiercely repeated the president's lies about voter fraud in the 2020 election. He ran unsuccessfully to be governor of Georgia in 2022 after losing his Senate seat, making voter fraud central to his campaign and falsely claiming that his seat had also been “stolen”. He's also the former chief executive of Dollar General.

Commerce secretary says president's order easing tariffs for US automakers will give them time to reshore parts as Trump aims to mark 100 days in office

Amazon denied the story and said it never considering listing tariff prices on its main retail site nor had anything been put into place.

For US foreign policy, Donald Trump's first 100 days in office were the weeks when decades happened.

In just over three months, the US president has frayed alliances that stood since the second world war and alienated the US's closest friends, cut off aid to Ukrainians on the frontlines against Vladimir Putin, emboldened US rivals around the world, brokered and then lost a crucial ceasefire in Gaza, launched strikes on the Houthis in Yemen and seesawed on key foreign policy and economic questions to the point where the US has been termed the “unpredictable ally”.

Perdue has long been an ally of Trump and has fiercely repeated the president's lies about voter fraud in the 2020 election. He ran unsuccessfully to be governor of Georgia in 2022 after losing his Senate seat, making voter fraud central to his campaign and falsely claiming that his seat had also been “stolen”. He's also the former chief executive of Dollar General.

The National Academy of Sciences has canceled a planned workshop on preventing human bird flu infections following instruction from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop work on the event, according to Reuters.

There have been 70 reported cases of bird flu in the US in the past year, with the virus spreading aggressively among cattle herds and poultry flocks. Most of the reported cases were among farmworkers.

Ongoing federal worker terminations at US health agencies have impacted staff working on the bird flu response, according to Reuters. The FDA this month also suspended existing and developing programs that ensured accurate testing for bird flu in milk and cheese products.

While the president, along with Republican leaders, are celebrating the accomplishments of the Trump administration's first 100 days, many Democrats paint a different picture of what the president's first few months have looked like.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a social media post today:

“The Trump administration has been an unmitigated disaster over the first 100 days.

“These extremists are not fit to govern and we will hold them accountable.”

Amazon has denied a report today that it planned to disclose the cost of US tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump to its products, after the White House widely denounced the move.

The company said it never considered listing tariffs on its main retail site and nothing was implemented on any company site. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” a company spokesperson told Reuters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier she had discussed the initial news with Trump and his response was: “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon.”

The comments caused Amazon shares to dip 2.2% in premarket trading, according to Reuters.

Asked about recent polls indicating Donald Trump's dire approval ratings at the GOP leadership press conference this morning, House speaker Mike Johnson seemed to acknowledge the second Trump administration's “rocky start” as it marks 100 days in office.

He said:

In any new administration, it's a rollercoaster. When you come in and you make dramatic change, which is what he did – he's delivering on the promises made – there's some bumps along the road. I mean, we're changing everything.

It's game time for the budget reconciliation, the scramble for which continues in the House today with three more markup sessions getting started. But, however, optimistic the tone struck by treasury secretary Scott Bessent this morning or speaker Mike Johnson yesterday evening, the GOP still hasn't figured out where the dramatic spending cuts are going to come from. The party has promised to eradicate trillions of dollars from the deficit, and is privately debating controversial changes to Medicaid or social safety net programs relied on by tens of millions of Americans in order to do it – something that at least a dozen Republican lawmakers have publicly said they will not support.

My colleague Graeme Wearden notes that shares in Amazon have dropped 1.3% at the start of trading, after the White House accused it of a “hostile” act for showing consumers the cost of tariffs.

The White House's attack on Amazon is a “significant” move which could alarm the financial markets, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB.

She writes that it's a sign that the US administration is targeting companies who disagree with them – that means an increase in political risk.

Brooks explains:

The US administration has changed its tone towards tariffs yet again on Tuesday. The White House Press secretary and the Treasury Secretary accused Amazon of a ‘hostile political act', after Amazon planned to expose the cost of tariffs to its consumers. This comes days before Amazon reports earnings on Thursday, and its stock price fell ahead of the US open and is down more than 2% so far.

The US administration has mostly saved its ire for other countries that it believes gives the US a raw deal in global trade. Now it appears that the US administration is targeting US companies who question the logic of its moves. This is significant. Financial markets have been roiled by political interference in the global economy in recent weeks. Investors do not digest political risks well, so if the Trump administration is now publicly accusing US companies of hostile acts if they disagree with the President's US economic policy then this could stop the recent recovery rally in risky assets.

Political analyst Ian Bremmer has also questioned the White House's argument, suggesting that telling a customer the cost of tariffs on their goods is no different than flagging the sales tax on a receipt.

You can follow all of Graeme's reporting on our business live blog:

Donald Trump will sign an executive order on auto tariffs today as he tries to cushion the impact of his tariffs on US carmakers.

The Trump administration wants to provide companies looking to relocate to the US full expensing of factories and equipment purchases and make it retroactive to 20 January, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said.

Bessent repeated his assertion that “tariffs are unsustainable for China” and claimed that China could lose up to 10m jobs if the high tariffs remain in place. He said “the onus will be on them” to remove tariffs, despite Trump starting the tariff war, and also would not say whether the US and China were talking directly to negotiate a deal.

Bessent added that he does not anticipate supply chain shocks from Trump's sweeping tariffs.

Amazon's announcement that it will include the price of tariffs on the price-tag for products is “a hostile and political act”, according to Trump.

Bessent said tariff revenue has the potential to provide income tax relief, repeating an assertion from Trump yesterday that some people's income taxes could be lowered or even completely eliminated due to tariffs.

An announcement could be coming soon on a trade deal with India, Bessent said, adding that he “can see the contours of a deal” with South Korea, and that the US has had “substantial talks” with Japan.

The United States would like to see the internet tax in the European Union removed, Bessent said.

Bessent also claimed discussions with House speaker Mike Johnson over plans to extend Trump's tax cuts are going well and the bill is moving forward better than expected.

Trump's choice of location for his 100-day rally tonight is notable for, as Politico highlights, Michigan is a state he won, lost, then won again (in the last two decades the state has backed the presidential winner, and Macomb County as the de facto national capital of white middle America.

Per Politco:

Forty years ago, legendary pollster Stanley Greenberg pinpointed Macomb County as the epicenter of a phenomenon reshaping American politics: Working-class, socially conservative white voters who had traditionally voted Democratic felt betrayed by the party, which had given up on people like ‘us' in favor of people like ‘them,' and were eager to support a Republican presidential candidate who promised to make America great again. (Sound familiar?) He called them the ‘Reagan Democrats.'

Ever since, American politics has largely been shaped by a hunt for these voters — both nationally, and specifically in Macomb County, which national politicos have long treated as something like the de facto national capital of white middle America. Tonight, Trump will rally supporters at Macomb community college — the same venue where President Ronald Reagan famously declared: ‘I'm a former Democrat, and I have to say: I didn't leave my party; my party left me.' And he'll do so knowing that the ‘Reagan Democrats' of yesteryear are now firmly Trump Republicans; places like Macomb aren't tossups in the way they once were.

The Trump administration wants to provide companies looking to relocate to the US full expensing of factories and equipment purchases and make it retroactive to 20 January, Scott Bessent says

The United States would like to see the internet tax in the European Union removed, Scott Bessent says.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he believes he is "saving" Ukraine, though he dodged a question about supplying weapons to the war-torn country in an interview with the Atlantic published April 28. 

Trump on April 24 sat down with Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg — who in March revealed that top U.S. defense officials disclosed war plans in a Signal chat — for a conversation about his first 100 days in office. 

One of Trump's goals for his first 100 days was to end Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. In recent days, however, the Trump administration has threatened to walk away from the peace negotiations altogether. 

"I think I'm saving that nation," Trump said, referring to Ukraine. 

"I think that nation will be crushed very shortly. It's a big war machine. ... I think I'm doing a great service to Ukraine. I believe that."

When told that Ukrainians do not necessarily share that perspective, Trump insisted again that the full-scale invasion would not have happened if he had won the 2020 U.S. election — a claim Trump makes repeatedly when pressed on his Ukraine-Russia policy, often in lieu of discussing current or future assistance to Kyiv. 

Trump also reiterated his threats to abandon the peace process if upcoming talks don't yield the results the U.S. is expecting. 

"We'll have to see what happens over the next period of pretty much a week. We're down to final strokes," he said. 

"And again, this is (former U.S. President Joe) Biden's war. I'm not gonna get saddled — I don't wanna be saddled with it. It's a terrible war. Should have never happened. It would've never happened, as sure as you're sitting there."

Trump claimed he was "on Ukraine's side" but drew a distinction between supporting Ukraine and supporting President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"I've had a hard time with Zelensky," Trump said, bringing up the leaders' infamous Oval Office argument in February. 

Trump's comments on Zelensky came two days before the leaders met face-to-face in the Vatican following the funeral of the late Pope Francis. While the meeting was brief, both sides said the discussion was productive and constructive. Afterwards, Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing to attack Ukrainian cities. 

When asked by Goldberg if continued escalation from Moscow would lead to the U.S. shipping weapons to Kyiv, Trump did not give a direct answer, suggesting other forms of pressure on Russia. 

"Doesn't have to be weapons," he said. 

"There are many forms of weapons. Doesn't have to be weapons with bullets. It can be weapons with sanctions. It can be weapons with banking. It can be many other weapons." 

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tougher sanctions against Russia, but has not followed through on those threats.

In the spring of 1943, Hans Bethe, a theoretical physicist and professor at Cornell University, left Ithaca, New York, for a classified government site in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Once there, he led the theoretical division of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Bethe was just one of dozens of academics pulled from elite American research universities into wartime service, applying their intellectual training to solve critical national security challenges. When the war ended, Bethe returned to Cornell, where he helped transform the university into a hub of Cold War–era research, working to invent—among other innovations—the synchrotron, one of the world's first particle accelerators. That development, in turn, paved the way for the creation of advanced radar systems and semiconductors.

Bethe's career path epitomized the long-lasting and mutually beneficial partnership between U.S. universities and the government. Before 1940, U.S. federal support for scientific research was minimal and mainly limited to agriculture and public health. But during World War II, the government turbocharged its funding for research and development and boosted it again during the Cold War. The government extended grants to a kaleidoscopic variety of academic efforts that included conducting basic physics experiments, developing materials to enable hypersonic flight, and inventing artificial intelligence algorithms. This funding often constituted the only reliable support for long-term high-risk projects that private industry, focused on near-term profits, typically neglects.

Now, President Donald Trump's administration is moving to sever the link between academia and government by freezing billions of dollars in federal grants to top research institutions. This act may score political points among those accustomed to understanding academia as a left-leaning “ivory tower” insulated from ordinary Americans and private enterprise. But it reflects a dangerous misunderstanding of how the United States became militarily and commercially dominant in the first place. Research universities have long undergirded, in particular, the country's national security through defense research, and they continue to train the pipeline of talent that powers both government and industry. Practically speaking, cutting their support does not represent a principled political stance—it is a friendly-fire assault on U.S. national security.

The defense partnership that developed between universities and the federal government during World War II marked a turning point in the relationship between science and state in America. Before the war, most American scientific research was funded by foundations, university endowments, and private donations. In 1945, Vannevar Bush—the Raytheon founder who became vice president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then directed the government's Office of Scientific Research and Development, which sponsored wartime military R & D—prepared a report called Science, the Endless Frontier. Federal funding for research had already ballooned from $69 million in 1940 to $720 million in 1944. Bush, who had overseen much of the United States' wartime scientific mobilization, argued that the United States must not stop boosting universities' funding. In his report, he emphasized the importance of basic science research to the United States' prosperity and security. Because modern war required “the use of the most advanced scientific techniques,” he wrote, “colleges, universities, and research institutes” would have to “meet the rapidly increasing demands of industry and government for new scientific knowledge,” and so “their basic research should be strengthened by use of public funds.”

This report became a blueprint for maintaining and expanding federal support for university research in peacetime. Institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the California Institute of Technology, and Stanford University quickly secured new federal grants and transformed themselves into hubs of scientific innovation, many with a direct connection to defense. MIT, for example, created the Research Laboratory of Electronics, which—supported by $1.5 million in annual funding from the Defense Department—expanded the university's wartime research into microwave, atomic, and solid-state physics into engineering applications. By the late 1940s, grants from the Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission accounted for 85 percent of MIT's research budget. This model—in which universities received federal funding for defense-oriented research—quickly spread, and by 1949 such grants made up 96 percent of all the public funding for university research in the physical sciences.



The experiment in federally funding university research proved so successful that it became a permanent feature of U.S. government strategy. After the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, the United States responded by creating the Advanced Research Projects Agency to fund high-risk, high-reward scientific research—much of it conducted at universities. One early ARPA project, a collaboration with Stanford and UCLA, led to the development of ARPANET, the direct precursor to today's internet. What began as a government investment in secure communication technology revolutionized the way the whole world exchanged information.

Universities, for their part, converted U.S. taxpayers' dollars into innovations that made the country prosper. Nowhere was this more evident than at Stanford, where federal defense contracts and research funding supported a culture of innovation that helped create Silicon Valley. Faculty members such as Frederick Terman, who aggressively expanded the university's statistics and engineering departments to win more Defense Department grants, encouraged students to commercialize their research, enabling the founding of companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Fairchild Semiconductor that would become cornerstones of the computing revolution.

While many other countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, continued to direct government funding for scientific research mainly toward government labs, the United States built a decentralized research system anchored in its universities. This decentralized system not only accelerated technological progress but also helped defense-related innovations flow into private commerce, giving U.S. industry a clear edge that the Soviet Union struggled to match, despite its extensive investments in technical education. By the end of the twentieth century, this system of federally funded university research had become the backbone of the United States' global leadership.

The same alliance that propelled Cold War–era breakthroughs continued to propel innovation after the Cold War—and to underwrite U.S. national security. But since the early 1990s, the stakes have become even more complex. Rapidly advancing technologies such as artificial intelligence, hypersonics, space systems, and quantum computing are creating new national security challenges as well as potential solutions. Although private companies such as OpenAI and Google are popularizing new AI models, the core technologies that power these systems were developed by researchers trained in university labs sustained by decades of publicly funded research. Without substantial U.S. government investment into universities, there would be no AI revolution to commercialize.

Indeed, academic research rarely stays confined to university labs. The flow of knowledge and expertise from academia into industry is what transforms abstract scientific insights into deployable technologies with strategic and economic value. Many universities have so-called technology transfer offices that work to patent inventions, license new technologies, and support startups. Through these initiatives, discoveries made on campuses migrate into the commercial sector and startup ecosystem, preserving the United States' dominance in advanced technology. Today's driverless vehicles, for instance, rely on a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system that originated from federally funded missile-tracking research at MIT.

This migration of ideas is accompanied by a migration of people. American graduate programs in engineering, applied physics, and computer science are among the most respected in the world, attracting top-tier talent and serving as engines of innovation. These programs function as incubators for the workforce that goes on to power the defense sector, the tech industry, and government research agencies. For example, Jensen Huang came to the United States to study electrical engineering at Oregon State University and earned his master's in engineering at Stanford. The year after he graduated from Stanford, he founded the semiconductor company Nvidia, which has enabled the AI revolution.

Students trained in federally supported labs often move fluidly between academia, national laboratories, and private industry. Ashlee Vance's biography of Elon Musk depicts the university-to-SpaceX pipeline: “Musk would personally reach out to the aerospace departments of top colleges and inquire about the students who had finished with the best marks on their exams.” Poaching from top aerospace departments allowed SpaceX to go from a risky startup to the world's premier launch provider at a time when the United States' dependence on Russian launch systems posed serious national security risks.

Yet the advantage conferred by the United States' decentralized research funding system is no longer assured. Rivals have studied the U.S. model closely and are moving aggressively to replicate it. China, in particular, is racing to close the gap by pouring state investment into its universities. The People's Liberation Army now collaborates with leading Chinese technical institutes to accelerate the development of dual-use technologies, particularly in AI, space systems, and cyberwarfare. But there is one advantage China cannot easily replicate: the openness of U.S. universities. Authoritarian states can flood labs with money, but they cannot manufacture the academic freedom and economic dynamism that make the U.S. university system a magnet for global talent.

The Trump administration's recent moves are stripping university labs of their funding by freezing Defense Department research grants to institutions it deems ideologically noncompliant—effectively targeting the very research pipelines that sustain national security innovation. Weakening the university-defense research partnership is a strategic miscalculation with far-reaching consequences. Universities are the channels through which scientific discoveries yield real-world applications and talented youth become world-changing entrepreneurs and innovative defenders of national security. The Trump administration might argue that it is willing to continue funding if universities align with its ideological demands. But ceding independence in exchange for scientific funding would undermine the very rigor and openness that has given the U.S. university system its edge for decades.

If the government allows ideological discomfort to disrupt its alliance with research universities, it will sacrifice its advantage in innovation and competitiveness. Cutting off Defense Department funding to universities will not halt defense innovation. But it will help ensure that it moves elsewhere. Some talent will drift toward private firms, where pressure to generate short-term profit often precludes a focus on projects that align with long-term national security priorities. Other talent and resources may move to foreign institutions eager to capitalize on U.S. retrenchment. To enable these shifts out of political pique is not principled—it is self-defeating.

Ukraine is not on track to defeat Russia on the battlefield, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on April 28 while defending the Trump administration's efforts to negotiate a peace deal. 

While U.S. President Donald Trump's vows to end the war within his first 100 days of office was not fulfilled, Washington continues to press both sides to reach a ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on April 27 that the next week will determine whether the U.S. remains involved in the peace process or withdraws as a mediator altogether.  

"Sometimes you're incredibly furstrated with the Ukrainians, sometimes you're incredibly frustrated with the Russians," Vance said on the Charlie Kirk Show podcast. 

The U.S. team is "making progress" in the negotiations, the vice president said, but a peace deal is not necessarily guaranteed. 

"I can't say with 100 percent certainty, Charlie, that we're going to be able to do it," he said. 

Vance did not discuss the details of the proposed peace agreements, but did say he believes Ukraine will not be able to defeat Russia militarily and take back its occupied territories by force. 

"If this doesn't stop, the Ukrainians aren't winning the war," Vance said. 

"I think there's this weird idea among the mainstream media that if this thing goes on for just another few years, the Russians will collapse, the Ukrainians will take their territory back, and everything will go back to the way that it was before the war. That is not the reality that we live in." 

Vance said that if the war drags on, Russia and Ukraine would both face societal collapse, millions more lives could be lost, and the risk of nucelar war would escalate. 

"It has to stop. It is the policy of this administration that it stops," Vance said. 

The U.S. proposal for peace in Ukraine reportedly involves significant concessions from Kyiv, including formal recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea. Ukrainian and European officials have put forth an alternative plan that involves U.S. security guarantees and no promises of territorial concessions until after a full ceasefire is implemented. 

The Kremlin, meanwhile, continues to insist on maximalist demands in ceasefire negotiations, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a three-day truce in honor of Victory Day.

Moscow requires international recognition of its illegal annexation of Crimea, as well as the entirety of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as a condition for peace talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 28.  

Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire and has repeatedly urged Russia to implement an unconditional truce. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he reiterated this aim in his face-to-face meeting with Trump at the Vatican on April 26.

Liberal Leader Mark Carney gestures as he leaves a polling station after casting his ballot in the federal election in Ottawa on Monday.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Mark Carney is expected to name a new cabinet within two weeks of his election victory and recall Parliament soon after.

A senior Liberal official told The Globe and Mail that by Canada Day, the new government plans to bring in a new budget that includes a promised middle class tax cut and legislation to remove federal impediments to interprovincial trade. 

The Globe and Mail is not identifying the official who was not authorized to discuss the Carney government's plans.

Mr. Carney has promised to initiate immediate new trade and security negotiations with the administration in the United States as Canada braces for tariffs on auto parts that are expected to take effect on May 3.

He also intends to put a new face on the cabinet that will stand out from that of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, the official said. The cabinet will be no larger than 30 people, smaller than Mr. Trudeau's 37, the official said. Mr. Carney unveiled a 24-member cabinet when he became Prime Minister on March 14.

Some of the potential new MPs the Prime Minister is expected to bring into cabinet are former Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitao, ex-Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson, former Delta Chamber of Commerce executive director Jill McKnight in B.C., climate change activist Shannon Miedema in Halifax and gun control advocate Nathalie Provost in Quebec. The official said Mr. Carney is determined to have a gender-parity cabinet that also ensures regional representation.

No serious discussions have taken place about what cabinet role would be assigned to new MPs and whether senior ministers such as Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc would keep their current high-profile posts.

Once the cabinet is in place, the official said Parliament is expected to be recalled in late May, with a Throne Speech that sets out the government's legislative ambitions for the next couple of years. But the main priority will be a federal budget to approve spending and a promised tax cut. The budget will also mark a formal end to the consumer carbon levy, an issue that had divided Canadians for years. 

The new Parliament will also include legislation to remove interprovincial trade barriers under federal jurisdiction, the official said.

In March, when Mr. Carney met the premiers and territorial leaders, he promised to move quickly to eliminate trade barriers and discussed finding ways to efficiently move energy and critical minerals across the country.

He pledged to introduce a “First Mile Fund” to provide capital to build transmission and transportation networks to link natural resource extraction sites to rail lines and roads.

He has not ruled out a pipeline from oil-rich Alberta to Eastern Canada. Quebec has previously opposed an east-west pipeline, but Premier François Legault now says opinions are changing because of the U.S. economic threats. 

Removing barriers to the free movement of workers, goods and services across the country would increase the size of Canada's economy by $250-billion, Mr. Carney has said.

Mr. Carney promised to table legislation by July 1 to allow goods to travel across the country barrier-free. He said his government would also remove labour mobility restrictions in federally regulated professions.

He has also said he will within days of being elected start trade and security talks with the U.S. administration. 

President Donald Trump, who wants to impose tariffs to force manufacturers to relocate to the U.S., has already caused economic damage and job losses in Canada by imposing 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. He has announced 25-per-cent levies on foreign-made vehicles, including those from Canada. 

Mr. Carney and his government will also be focusing on the G7 summit with the U.S, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan on June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Alta.

It's expected to be a fraught meeting, with allies annoyed at Mr. Trump for his trade war and at odds with him over what appears to be a favourable attitude toward Russia in its war with Ukraine. Mr. Carney has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the G7 summit in a sign of solidarity as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year.

Canada has so far provided almost $20-billion in assistance to Ukraine, including $4.5-billion in military hardware.

BEIJING, April 29. /TASS/. Mutual support between Russia and China remains unwavering despite the ongoing changes in the world, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Rio de Janeiro.

"In recent times, there have been many changes in the international environment. Change is the norm of our era, yet the mutual trust and support between China and Russia remain unchanged," he emphasized.

The diplomat pointed out that the strategic leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been the guarantee for maintaining Sino-Russian relations at a high level. Wang Yi also noted the importance of joint efforts by Beijing and Moscow to ensure that the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries is put into practice and "embodied in the results of cooperation in all areas.".

Several injured after vehicle hit three people during after-school program and one more before exiting other side

Four children, between the ages of four and 18, were killed and several others injured when a car barreled through a building that housed an after-school camp program on Monday afternoon in a town outside Springfield, Illinois, police said.

Officers responded around 3.20pm to calls in Chatham about a vehicle hitting three people outside the building used by the YNOT Outdoors summer and after school camp, ramming through the building and then hitting one more person before exiting the other side, said Scott Tarter, deputy chief of the Chatham police department.

Several other people were hurt and taken to hospitals, police said.

The driver, who was uninjured, was the sole occupant of the vehicle and was taken to a hospital for evaluation, Tarter said.

“I am horrified and deeply saddened by the deaths of children and numerous injuries in Chatham this afternoon,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said in a statement. “My heart is heavy for these families and the unimaginable grief they're experiencing – something that no parent should ever have to endure.”

Pritzker said his office was continuing to monitor the situation and would lend support if needed.

Chatham police called the accident a “terrible tragedy”.

“If you believe in the power of prayer, please take a moment to pray right now for the entire Chatham community,” they said in a statement.

The website for YNOT Outdoors advertises the camp as a way for parents to place their kids in a “safe, fun, active and stimulating summer environment”.

It was not immediately known what led up to the crash or whether it was intentional.

Chatham is a small town of about 15,000 people just outside Springfield, Illinois.

The deaths in Illinois happened two days after 11 people were killed in Vancouver when a car plowed through a crowded street during a Filipino heritage festival – one of the most recent examples of people driving vehicles into groups of people across the globe.

A fleet of decommissioned U.S.-made Abrams tanks that Australia promised to Kyiv has not yet been delivered, in part due to resistance from Washington, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on April 28, citing unnamed defense officials. 

Australia pledged to send Kyiv 49 "soon-to-be-retired"M1A1 Abrams tanks as part of a broader military aid package in October 2024. 

The tanks are still sitting in Australia, the ABC reported. Defense officials told the outlet that the U.S. has to grant formal permission before the vehicles can be delivered to another country. This permission has not been granted, they said. 

U.S. President Donald Trump's decision earlier this year to temporarily freeze all military aid to Ukraine may have also complicated the delivery, the outlet reported in March. An unnamed American official told the ABC that the U.S. government had warned Australia against sending the tanks before the package was announced last fall. 

One defense official, speaking anonymously about the current delay, also cited other potential problems with delivering the Abrams tanks. 

"We are starting to doubt if the Ukrainians actually want these vehicles — the tank roof is the weakest point of the Abrams and this is a drone war," the official said. 

"There is also the concern that with a possible peace deal looming it would be embarrassing to have the tanks on board ships in the middle of the ocean, and there is also a lack of ranked personal that are necessary to babysit the assets at sea."

The effectiveness of Abrams tanks on the battlefield in Ukraine has been previously called into question by Western officials. The Associated Press (AP) reported in April 2024 that Ukrainian forces were pulling the tanks from the front lines due to the high risk of detection by Russian drones. The Ukrainian military denied the claim. 

"The tanks are doing a great job on the battlefield, and we are definitely not going to hide from the enemy what makes them hide," a front-line unit said. 

The Australian Defense Ministry told the ABC that the promised tanks are "on target" to reach Ukraine in 2025.

"Australia remains on target to meet the delivery of the M1A1 Abrams in 2025, the M1A1 export process remains ongoing," a ministry spokesperson told the ABC in a statement.

"Defense continues to work with the Ukrainian government in line with agreed arrangements for the gifting, including on delivery and sustainment."

Bluster from Washington and bad news in the economy are only two significant challenges for the new Parliament. Here's an overview

The winner of Monday's election will take office at a time when Canada is staring ahead at a number of urgent challenges. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and the impact on Canada's economy are chief among them, but that's far from the end of the list.

The housing shortage remains acute and many Canadians have no access to a family doctor. The recent debates about the immigration system and a recent flood of temporary residents – and their impact on services – have not gone away, nor has the need to respond to the threat of climate change. Mr. Trump has pressured Canada to increase defence spending while his trade war has prompted calls for Canada's military to be more self-sufficient. And the election campaign again exposed a growing regional divide that threatens national unity.

Here are the some of the biggest challenges facing the new government.

Since returning to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to annex Canada as his country's “51st state,” imposed across-the-board tariffs, abruptly rolled those back, then reimposed a more targeted series of levies. It has all left Canada facing both the most serious threat from south of the border since the War of 1812 and the most punishing trade war in the country's recent history. 

Most immediately, Ottawa must handle the economic fallout from the President's tariffs on key sectors, from cars to steel to aluminum. He has also threatened to enact more levies, including on auto parts, as soon as next month. There will almost certainly be a frantic diplomatic push – both directly aimed at the White House, and indirectly through free-trade-aligned U.S. politicians and business figures – to get the current protectionist measures rolled back and head off new ones. Also on the table: preparations for even more retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and, possibly, public support for industries getting hit.

In the mid-to-long-term, Canada's new government will have to think through the country's relationship with the U.S., given Mr. Trump's determination to end the era of deepening economic co-operation and pull back on collective security guarantees for the world's democratic alliance.

Lessening Canadian reliance on the U.S., however, will be hellishly complicated. It won't be easy finding enough business opportunities around the world to significantly replace the consumption of Canada's exports by the next-door behemoth. And no government in recent memory has shown much enthusiasm for increasing defence spending: 11 years after agreeing to NATO's 2-per-cent-of-GDP threshold, Canada still hasn't met it.

Central to every decision for the prime minister will be determining if and how to try placating Mr. Trump – or to simply refuse to concede anything, double down on the trade war and hope that such intransigence will press the U.S. to back off further.

The federal election is nearing its end. Ask our experts your questions about the campaign, the results and beyond

The erratic President has made the second option more appealing by repeatedly changing his mind and moving the goalposts in negotiations. When he demanded Ottawa toughen border security last winter, then-prime minister Justin Trudeau complied, only for Mr. Trump to then increase his threats. Since then, the President has not laid out any concrete demands of Canada at all – short of annexation.

Mr. Trump has already upended Canadian politics. Where the Liberals once looked set to be steamrolled, the President's threats suddenly made them competitive again with the Conservatives. And while the President may have defined this election campaign, he could very well have an even more definitive influence over Canada's future economy, security and sovereignty.

Long before Mr. Trump began threatening to trash his neighbour's economy and upend the global trading system, Canada was in for an economic reckoning. The country has experienced years of tepid economic growth (partially masked by a growing population); weak business investment; and deteriorating affordability, especially when it comes to housing. 

Last year, Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers declared the country's sluggish productivity – the amount of output per hour worked – a “break the glass” emergency. Unless it improves, she warned, wages will stagnate, inflation will become harder to manage and our standard of living will deteriorate. The incoming government needs to address these long-standing problems while also navigating Mr. Trump's erratic trade war. 

In the near-term, everything rests on U.S. trade policy. Canada has already gotten several lucky breaks. The U.S. imposed high tariffs on Canadian goods, but then offered an exemption for products that comply with the continental free-trade agreement, which covers the majority of exports. Canada also avoided the 10-per-cent baseline tariff the U.S. placed on most other countries in early April. 

If the U.S. backs down on tariffs, the Canadian economy could still be in for a rough patch, as companies hold back on hiring and investment and consumers clutch their purses. But that likely wouldn't lead to an outright recession, the Bank of Canada said in a report earlier this month. If, however, the trade war escalates, Canada could be looking at a year-long recession that leaves permanent scars on the economy, the bank warned. 

Looking ahead, the next government will need to figure out where the country fits in a changing global order where the U.S. is no longer a trustworthy partner, and access to the massive market to the south isn't guaranteed. That means trying to find new markets for Canadian goods. But it also means grappling with the fact that many of the country's key industries – automobiles, oil and gas, and steel among them – can't simply cut ship and run from the United States, said Peter Morrow, associate professor of economics at the University of Toronto.

“There are no easy outs,” he said. 

Remember the housing crisis? In the past five years, this issue increasingly dominated the Canadian political discourse at all levels. In the next term of government, it will likely return. The country's structural shortage of housing and a decade of high immigration have created a mismatch that will get worse before it gets better.

What can the federal government do here? It can provide funding, alter the building code to make construction easier and build housing directly. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) estimates the country must double its current rate of building and construct 3.5 million more homes than is projected to be built over the next five years – just to bring housing affordability back to where it was in 2000. 

This will be difficult, if not impossible. Today, the country builds about the same quantities of housing as it did in the early 1970s. The shortage is especially acute in B.C. and Ontario. The housing market in most of the country, meanwhile, is stalled owing to high prices, high taxes and Trumpian uncertainty.

Ottawa's two major tools are capital and regulatory change. CMHC offers grants and loans for rental housing. These have been criticized as insufficiently flexible, and also for having vague metrics. Less onerous approvals will help get money out the door. Testing these programs against housing starts – not approvals, but actual construction – would measure their efficacy.

The feds also have control over the details of construction through the National Building Code. Here a quick fix is at hand: allow small apartment buildings to be constructed with a single staircase. That obscure detail would align Canada with most other countries, including all of Europe. It would make it much easier to build apartments on small lots, with more livable and efficient floorplans. Ottawa could make this happen tomorrow.

Finally, the federal government can build housing directly. Ottawa owns more than 600 underused urban sites across the country. The government could move this year to develop half-a-dozen social-housing projects on its own land. Social housing has never been a major presence in Canada; the present economic downturn provides an ideal opportunity for government intervention.

Depending on whom one talks to, Canada has been falling short of its potential to be a global supplier of oil and gas, or a leader in the transition to low-carbon energy sources, or both.

On fossil fuels, notwithstanding the government-backed expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and imminent opening of the country's first liquefied natural gas export terminal in B.C., there are widespread complaints about passing up opportunities to get more product to overseas markets in recent decades.

The imperative to reduce economic reliance on the United States will have the next government facing more pressure to get pipelines and other projects built, including by expediting permitting and regulatory processes perceived to have been an obstacle, and helping ensure buy-in from Indigenous communities.

However, it may also have to sort through which abandoned projects make economic sense to try to resurrect. For instance, while polls have shown a surge in support for a pipeline that would carry oil from Alberta to Atlantic Canada, there is no company proposing to build it, and there are questions about long-term oil demand in markets it would help reach.

Ottawa will also have to balance any push to increase fossil-fuel exports with Canada's role in fighting climate change.

Although Canada's greenhouse gas emissions have finally started to decline, the country is still not on pace to hit its international commitment of a 40-per-cent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. That's largely because emissions from oil and gas production have continued to rise.

Beyond environmental concerns, there will be economic pressure to make Canada more economically competitive in clean-technology industries.

In some cases, particularly when it comes to better capitalizing on large reserves of minerals used in electric-vehicle batteries, concerns about slow regulatory processes are similar to those with fossil fuels, and could be addressed in tandem.

But Ottawa will also have choices to make about how much to direct government resources toward other aspects of the energy transition for which Canada may have competitive advantages – including building the country's supply of non-emitting electricity, and supporting emerging products or technologies such as geothermal, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon removal.

Mr. Trump's hostility toward climate policy could lead to calls for Canada's government to similarly deprioritize it. But as countries across Europe and Asia push harder toward decarbonization, there could also be danger in winding up on an island with the U.S. in resisting it.

Canada's new prime minister will be confronted with the ripple effects of recent policy U-turns, including a significant reversal on temporary residence intake. 

Temporary immigration streams are currently capped after years of increased reliance on migrant workers to staff a broad range of low-wage jobs – and on international students to fund postsecondary schools. That has left many temporary residents in limbo, and raised questions about how to fill stubborn gaps in the labour market. Meanwhile, long-standing complaints from workers advocates, who say temporary immigration programs are conducive to exploitation, remain largely unresolved.

Reduced permanent residency targets have also prompted concerns about economic growth. While cost-of-living issues – particularly housing pressures – have increasingly crept into the debate on immigration levels, policy makers will need to consider Canada's aging population and its shrinking work force.

Bureaucratic challenges will also loom large: backlogs continue to dog the immigration ministry, despite recent improvements. (Job cuts at the department earlier this year could also jeopardize efforts to speed up wait times.) Meanwhile, the Immigration and Refugee Board has a whopping 281,000 undecided claims still pending, as migration driven by war and conflict abroad shows little promise of slowing. 

But perhaps the thorniest challenge to Canada's immigration landscape is developments south of the border. Border crossings have long been governed by a bilateral refugee treaty premised on both Canada and the U.S. being safe for asylum seekers. But Mr. Trump's recent immigration crackdown – including a significant escalation in detention and rapid deportation – has prompted renewed criticism of the agreement. For Canada's political leadership, the task will be to balance its legal obligations to refugees with an already-strained immigration system.

While millions of Canadians don't have regular access to a primary-care provider, the issue did not figure prominently in the federal election campaign, including in the French and English language debates.

The problem comes down to staffing: Canada is suffering from a beleaguered health work force and health care organizations want the federal government to urgently address it.

The current picture is bleak. A Health Canada report published in February found the country needs tens of thousands of additional health care workers, including nearly 23,000 family physicians. The report also predicted the situation will only worsen in the next decade should action not be taken to address it.

Health organizations, including the Canadian Medical Association, have called on federal politicians to prioritize taking steps to see health care professionals added to address this deficit. This push is taking place at a time when more doctors south of the border are considering Canada amid concerns about the unpredictable political landscape and leadership of Mr. Trump.

The CMA said in a statement this month that Canada must act quickly to attract the American medical and scientific professionals who no longer feel valued in the U.S., which is seeing the elimination of health programs and research positions. It urged the federal government to take steps, including modernizing immigration policies to support hospitals, health authorities, provinces and territories recruiting health workers.

The next government also faces calls from pharmacare proponents to ink bilateral agreements for public coverage of diabetes medications and supplies, as well as contraceptives, with provinces and territories that have yet to reach agreements with Ottawa. Prior to the beginning of the election, Manitoba, B.C., PEI and Yukon all signed agreements with the federal government.

Health care organizations also want to see the next government ensure that virtual services are supported within the publicly funded health care system. This was discussed at a meeting of federal, provincial and territorial health ministers in January in Halifax. 

Online health care access is expected to be the subject of an interpretation letter from the federal government on how services are covered under the Canada Health Act. The legislation, passed in 1984, established how health services can be covered when they are delivered by physicians and at hospitals. 

In January, then-health minister Mark Holland said in a separate interpretation letter that nurse practitioners and other non-physician health professionals can bill the public health care system when providing primary care.

Canada's military has suffered from decades of underinvestment that has hurt its operational readiness; its capacity to recruit and train soldiers, sailors and aviators; and its investment in equipment and infrastructure.

Canada is under pressure from allies, including the United States, to reach the 2-per-cent GDP NATO target for defence spending. Canada currently spends about 1.37 per cent, a relative laggard in the alliance.

“The fact that we have been viewed as wealthy shirkers has been a real problem in our relations with other key allies. It's not just the Americans; Europeans and partners in Asia are pretty fed up with us as well,” said David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.

Canada's three biggest federal political parties have all pledged to boost spending to 2 per cent – which will require $18-billion more annually. The Liberals and Conservatives have pledged to meet this by 2030.

Canada has repeatedly encountered trouble buying new gear in a timely fashion – so much so that both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised solutions such as a stand-alone defence procurement agency or secretariat. “We have been trying to surge investment in the Canadian Armed Forces since at least 2017 and are still struggling because it hasn't been much of a priority,” Mr. Perry said.

He said whoever wins the election will have to take a fundamentally different approach and convince senior civil servants, cabinet and the Treasury Board Secretariat, which oversees spending, to treat this as a priority file.

The Forces are currently understaffed, with a regular force that falls roughly 7,000 people short of its target for 71,500 regular forces and more than 6,800 short of the 30,000 target for primary reserve forces, according to numbers as of December, 2024. Under a directive issued last fall, the Forces also anticipate requiring a further 14,500 members to “implement current and future capabilities.”

Ottawa also faces a difficult decision about whether to lessen military co-operation with the United States given Mr. Trump's talk of annexing Canada. Mr. Perry said this would be difficult because of how much Canada relies on the U.S. military. If Canada really wanted to eliminate its reliance on the Americans, it would need to spend 3 per cent or 4 per cent of GDP on defence, he said.

The threats from Mr. Trump have brought Canadians together, producing a surge of flag-waving patriotic fervour, but does that mean the new prime minister can rest easy about the perennial issue of national unity? Not necessarily.

The separatist Parti Québécois is leading the polls in La belle province. It promises to hold a referendum on independence – Quebec's third – in its first term if Quebeckers elect the party when they next cast their votes in 2026. 

On the other hand, support for breaking away from the rest of Canada is the lowest it has been in years, dropping below 30 per cent in a recent survey. In the face of the Trump tariffs, and his persistent calls for Canada to join the United States, many Quebeckers are getting caught up in the patriotic wave. The proportion of Quebeckers who say they are proud to be Canadian now exceeds the figure in Alberta.

Which brings us to the prime minister's other unity problem. Despite the Trump threats, a quarter of Albertans tell pollsters they would opt to take the province out of Confederation if the question were put to them in a referendum. A fifth of Saskatchewan residents feel the same way. 

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith insists that her United Conservative Party backs a strong and sovereign Alberta within a united Canada, but also says that Ottawa should accede to a list of Alberta's demands or face an “unprecedented national unity crisis.” Albertans, she says, are fed up with federal governments “repeatedly attacking our provincial economy and way of life.”

Flag waving aside, the newly elected PM will have his hands full calming the country's divisions.

Sen. Chris Coons, a top ally of former President Biden, was pressed by CNN anchor John Berman over whether he regretting defending the former president's fitness for office in 2024, even as fellow Democrats raised concerns at the time.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., was pressed Tuesday on whether he regretted criticizing fellow Democrats over their reservations about former President Joe Biden following his disastrous 2024 debate performance.

CNN anchor John Berman cited authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' reporting in their book about the presidential campaign that Coons knew Biden's debate performance was bad, but still chose to accuse his Democratic colleagues of "bed-wetting" as they expressed concerns over the former president.

"Now, there are some people who've written on this, including Jim Geraghty in the National Review, who say, if you felt that way, maybe you shouldn't have criticized Democrats for their reservations about President Biden at the time. Do you wish you had done things differently at this point?" Berman asked Coons.

"Obviously, if I had any idea that President Biden was going to perform as poorly as he did at that debate, I would have been advising him differently and advocating differently. That debate performance was the first time I saw anything like that out of President Biden," Coons responded.

"He had been and was a strong and capable president, and he still had strong public performances, interviews, and just the next day went to North Carolina and spoke forcefully at a rally, but I was shocked. I was genuinely surprised by that performance that evening and was wrestling with what it meant for our path forward," he told Berman. 

Allen and Parnes wrote that Coons received several texts from his colleagues that pointed out the performance by Biden was "terrible," and that he was expected to answer for the president.

An excerpt from the book read: "Now, jet-lagged, he found himself thrust into the unusual position of protecting Biden from Democratic senators. He knew, as Biden's guy in their chamber, he could give no ground. If he did, it would only feed the frenzy. He shot back texts accusing his colleagues of bed-wetting, telling them to put their big-kid pants on and asking what was wrong with them that they would so easily go faithless on the president."

Coons, according to the book, acknowledged that he saw what his colleagues saw, and knew the president "s--- the bed" in the debate.

The Democratic senator regularly defended Biden when pressed on concerns about the president's age and fitness throughout the campaign. 

In an interview on Fox News' "The Story" prior to the debate in early June, Coons dismissed reporting from The Wall Street Journal that cited lawmakers who felt the former president was showing signs of decline.

"I think they got this wrong because they didn't use quotes from those of us who serve with President Biden, who know him, who have had the opportunity up-close-and-personal in meetings in the White House or in events publicly or privately, to give affirmation that he is sharp, he is engaged, and he is commanding," he said.

After the debate – as Democrats and several media voices, including The New York Times editorial board, called on Biden to drop out of the race – Coons spoke to CNN on July 1 and demanded anyone who believed calling on Biden to drop out was the best way forward needed to "refocus."

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The blackout that engulfed the Iberian Peninsula on Monday was chaotic and stressful for many. But it had a silver lining: People were forced away from their screens and into the “real” world, connecting with the present and one another.

Some Spaniards and Portuguese embraced their day without power.

In Barcelona's Gracia neighborhood, squares were packed with sunbathers and people reading books or playing chess. In Madrid, young and old gathered on sidewalks to listen to radios that, once obsolete, were suddenly lifelines. People in Sevilla clapped and tapped their feet to flamenco.

Some neighbors spoke to each other for the first time.

At a vehicle inspection center, employees hung a net and played volleyball. Staff at a non-profit foundation in Madrid's Embajadores neighborhood pulled tables onto sidewalks and challenged passersby to a friendly game of trivia. Others played UNO on public benches. Long lines formed for free ice cream that store owners decided to give away.

On railway tracks in the middle of nowhere, stranded passengers practiced viral dance moves as they waited for rescue. Lisbon locals joined tourists at scenic viewpoints and partied under the stars. People across the peninsula sang a cappella or played their instruments in the dark.

The world ceased its whirring and time stood still. Anxiety faded. There was boredom but also mindfulness.




When lampposts finally lit up, crowds celebrated, shouting and waving their hands in the air as if their soccer team had scored.

The power was back. And the notifications pinged again.

Sen. Cory Booker stumped for the Equality Act with Democrats on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of targeting transgender people.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused President Donald Trump's administration of targeting the transgender community on Tuesday, urging Congress to pass the Democrat-backed Equality Act.

Booker made the emotional speech during an appearance on Capitol Hill alongside prominent Democrats from both the House and Senate. His speech, which lasted several minutes, borrowed heavily from the language of Martin Luther King, Jr.

"The Equality Act is on the right side of history, and right now we stand in the cold shadow of injustice. And so here we are again, introducing this bill. But it is not a normal time that we introduce this bill. We introduced it in the backdrop of a president that in his very campaign, singled out an opportunistic bigotry. The trans community. We stand here in the backdrop of a time that LGBTQ Americans are being targeted and singled out for more injustice," Booker said.

"I want you to know, we reintroduce this bill with attitude. We reintroduce this bill with swagger. We entered the bill Tuesday's bill with confidence, because there are a lot of people who are hearing our voice right now that don't understand that they are implicated. There's no bystanders in history. When injustice is in our midst, and you say nothing and you do nothing, you are part of the perpetuation of that injustice," he added.

"I remind those Americans, that even the truth, when crushed to the ground, after lie, after lie, after lie, that the truth will still rise again, that this is still one nation under God. That we still swear an oath of liberty and justice for all, and that we will not stop until freedom rings from every coast in this country. That freedom rings for every person and every soul. That freedom rings for every American, no matter who you are. Race, color or creed, LGBTQ, American or straight ally," he continued. "That we declare that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it doesn't bend automatically."

"We declare today and every day until justice is established in this land, until the Equality Act passes, we declare that we, the people, will grab hold of that arc and pull and bend it until we live up to our promise in a country and truly are free at last, free at last," he finished.

The Equality Act would prohibit discrimination based on "sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity."

Booker was joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., among other lawmakers.

The legislative push comes as Trump's administration has pushed to end unpopular diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout the federal government.

The president's efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. 

Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs.

As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria's Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs.

Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency's "Scientific Integrity Policy" implemented during the last few weeks of President Biden's term, to peel back any DEI requirements.

            Spanish tennis legend Rafael Nadal exclusively told CNN Sports he completely trusts that world No. 1 Jannik Sinner is innocent, as the Italian prepares to return from a doping suspension.
    


            Sinner is approaching the end of a three-month ban having twice tested positive for banned substance Clostebol, an anabolic steroid, in March last year.
    


            The three-time grand slam champion previously escaped a ban when the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) ruled that he wasn't at fault for the positive tests, accepting that the contamination was caused by a physio applying an over-the-counter spray.

            However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) subsequently lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), leading to Sinner accepting a suspension from February 9 to May 4.
    


            In a February statement, Sinner said that he has “always accepted that I am responsible for my team” but has always denied knowingly taking a banned substance.
    


            “I don't have a clear opinion, first of all, because I don't have the whole information,” Nadal told CNN after being honored with the Sporting Icon Award at this year's Laureus World Sports Awards.
    


            “First of all, I 100% believe that Jannik is innocent. I don't think at all that Jannik wanted to do something that is not allowed, so I 100% believe in Jannik.”
    


            The saga around Sinner has shone the spotlight on the current anti-doping protocols in tennis, with several players raising concerns about possible preferential treatment for the top stars.
    

A post shared by CNN Sports (@cnnsport)


            Sinner, for example, won't miss any grand slam events during his ban.
    


            Recently, Serena Williams said she would have been banned for “20 years” and “gotten grand slams taken away” if the same thing had happened to her. She did, though, describe Sinner as a “fantastic personality” and “great for the sport.”
    


            Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic said that the whole case was “not a good image for our sport.”
    


            But Nadal, who retired from tennis last year following a historic career, said he has full trust in the current anti-doping system.
    


            “From my point of view, I really don't believe that Jannik, because he's the No. 1 in the world, received different treatment than another person, from my perspective and from my understanding,” the 22-time grand slam singles champion said.
    


            “I really believe in the process, I have been there going through all the tests for 20 years, how the things are strict on every single movement … and I believe in the process.
    


            “I can't say another thing and I can't think another way because, if not, I will think that we are not in a fair world, and I really believe that we are in a fair world in this matter.”
    


            Despite his ban, Sinner will be one of the favorites to win his first French Open title when the tournament starts at the end of May.
    


            Nadal, who won a record 14 Coupes des Mousquetaires at Roland Garros, said he hopes a potential Sinner win won't be tarnished by questions around his eligibility to play.
    


            However, for Sinner to claim the title, he will first have to find a way past the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, who many have compared to Nadal.
    


            Not only are both from Spain, but both are formidable on clay with Alcaraz winning his first French Open title last year.

            Nadal, who retired with 22 grand slam singles trophies, said the comparisons are only natural and holds high hopes that the 21-year-old can reach the very top of the sport.
    


            “All of us received the pressure from the media and from the hope that people have about you, but I think at the end, we are humans and we know how to handle that,” Nadal told CNN.
    


            “I don't think for Carlos it's a big deal holding that pressure. He's a great player and has a great family behind (him).
    


            “I think he's doing great and he's having an amazing career and he's going to win much more if he stays out of injury – that's the most important thing. I wish and I really believe that he's going to have one of the best careers of all time.”
    


            Nadal said he occasionally messages Alcaraz but would always be on hand to provide some advice – not that he thinks the youngster needs it.
    


            It's an invitation that the 38-year-old extends to all players on the tour who might want to casually learn from his own experiences.
    


            However, Nadal has so far resisted following the likes of Andy Murray, who has gone into coaching after retiring from a playing career.
    


            “I mean in this life you can never say never,” he said, adding he was enjoying spending more time with family without all the travel that comes with being on tour.
    


            “It's difficult to imagine myself now doing this kind of thing … it's not my moment, at all. I am in a different moment of my life and I don't see myself traveling now with a player.”
    


            Instead, Nadal is happy to continue developing his tennis academy which is starting to breed success across the game, adding to the Spaniard's already impressive tennis legacy.
    


            And, even in retirement, Nadal has not stopped picking up trophies. In addition to being given the aforementioned Laureus Sporting Icon Award, the Spaniard will also be honored in a ceremony at this year's French Open.
    


            “The results are the results, you know. I won what I won, I lost what I lost, that's the results and nobody can change that,” Nadal said when asked what he wants to be remembered for now that his playing days are behind him.
    


            “Of course, I will be remembered as a good tennis player, but for me, it's important to be remembered as a good person, a player who fights as hard as possible but with positive values, being always fair and correct with everyone on court.
    


            “Trying to respect every single moment, for me that's the most important thing.”

A federal appeals court has paused a judge's order to bring a Turkish Tufts University student from a Louisiana immigration detention center back to New England this week so it can consider an emergency motion filed by the government. 

The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York, ruled Monday that a three-judge panel would hear arguments on May 6 in the case of Rumeysa Ozturk. She's been detained for five weeks as of Tuesday.

A district court judge in Vermont had earlier ordered that the 30-year-old doctoral student be brought to the state by Thursday for hearings to determine whether she was illegally detained. Ozturk's lawyers say her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process. 

The U.S. Justice Department, which is appealing that ruling, said that an immigration court in Louisiana has jurisdiction over her case.

Congress limited federal-court jurisdiction over immigration matters, government lawyers wrote. Yet the Vermont judge's order “defies those limits at every turn in a way that irreparably harms the government.”

Ozturk's lawyers opposed the emergency motion. “In practice, that temporary pause could last many months,” they said in a news release. 

Immigration officials surrounded Ozturk as she walked along a street in a Boston suburb March 25 and drove her to New Hampshire and Vermont before putting her on a plane to a detention center in Basile, Louisiana. 




Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.

And many people with the condition are cared for at home.

In Starr County, Texas, near the state's southern tip along the U.S.-Mexico border, escaping dementia can feel impossible. The condition affects about one in five adults on Medicare—more than double the national rate. “Everybody has somebody in their family” with dementia, Gladys Maestre, a neuroepidemiologist who studies aging at the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley, told me.

For Jessica Cantú, it was her father, Tomas. He asked her, his eldest daughter, never to put him in a nursing home. She promised. “We take care of our own,” she told me. As Tomas's dementia progressed, the former pastor held to his routines. He played with his 19 grandchildren. He preached Wednesday-night services and hand-delivered donations of rice, beans, and oil across the border. He fed his chickens and sheep, and ate his favorite homemade foods—pineapple upside-down cake, enchiladas with saltine crackers, and cream-of-mushroom chicken over rice.Dementia looms over the Cantú family tree. Two of Tomas's 10 siblings had it; Jessica wondered whether more might have, if they'd lived longer. Her maternal grandmother had dementia too. Seven months after her dad's death, she began working as a nurse practitioner at the county's first private Alzheimer's-specific research site, El Faro Health and Therapeutics. “Patients will come in and say, ‘So have you figured it out? What is it?'” she told me. She tells them the truth. “I don't know what it is that's causing all of this.”

Dementia has no single trigger. As with many cancers, it can emerge from a lifetime of accumulated strain—from genetics, environment, and behavior. Researchers have identified a dozen risk factors that, if mitigated, could theoretically delay or prevent roughly 40 percent of cases worldwide: traumatic brain injury; conditions including high blood pressure, hearing loss, diabetes, and depression; habits such as smoking, inactivity, and heavy drinking; environmental and social forces including air pollution, social isolation, and limited education.These “risk factors usually do not come [as] one; they come in clusters,” Maestre said—and in Starr County, an almost entirely Hispanic community, they quickly stack up. Nearly one in three people lives in poverty; a quarter lack health insurance. Chronic conditions are widespread—especially diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease—while access to care is limited: There's just one primary-care physician for every 3,000 to 4,000 people, and few dementia specialists. Low education, language barriers, poor air quality, and extreme heat all compound the threat. These accumulate in cycles of grief and stress: The people I spoke with talked about deaths in the family followed by strokes that cascade into cognitive decline. Dementia isn't simply a diagnosis. It's a structural outcome.

Still, many in Starr County struggle to make sense of it. And no matter the cause—no matter which conglomeration of causes—they must live with dementia's reality.



In the Rio Grande Valley, people are also outliving their odds. The area's high dementia rate, Maestre has come to believe, may reflect not just risk but endurance: people living longer with the condition.

In general, research shows that Hispanic people tend to live longer than non-Hispanic white people, despite facing higher rates of chronic disease and steeper socioeconomic disadvantages—a pattern sometimes called the “Hispanic paradox.” And in the Rio Grande Valley, part of what might sustain people through dementia, Maestre suspects, is the culture: Dementia is seen less as a medical emergency and more as a natural, if difficult, phase of life. Elsewhere, people with dementia may live in nursing homes or take expensive new Alzheimer's drugs with modest benefit. In Starr County, many older adults remain at home, surrounded by family who offer familiarity and stimulation. The care is physical, intimate—not clinical, but constant—and backed by research showing that familiar environments and home-based care can enhance both quality of life and cognitive function for people with dementia.“He was never, never—since the day I brought him to my home—he was never one day alone,” says Juan “Manny” Saenz of his father, Francisco “Pancho,” who died at home last month at age 94. A professional body-shop painter, offshore fisherman, and lifelong jokester, Pancho began to grow forgetful and repetitive about a decade ago. Before Manny's mom, Amaro, died, she made him promise not to put his father in a nursing home. Under Manny's care, Pancho's appearance was impeccable: He was bathed and perfumed, with trimmed nails and a neat mustache. He ate his meals on ceramic dishes, and relished his coffee-and-cookie merienda snack break—or breaks, on days he'd forget the previous ones. Manny, who lives in Rio Grande City, told me exactly what Jessica Cantú had: “We take care of our own.”

Monica Saenz Silva made a similar decision for her mother, Ramona—a bookkeeper at heart, the kind of person who kept every receipt for taxes and reminded her adult children to change their tires. She kept a running calendar of birthdays, not just for family and friends, but also for acquaintances, so she could wish them well. By 2019, a few years after her dementia symptoms appeared, “that was out the door,” Monica told me.Today, Ramona will approach a taco or hamburger quizzically; she's forgotten how to bite into them. At times, she doesn't recognize the house where she's lived for decades. Still, Monica is determined to keep her there. “You want to keep them home, so they're in a familiar surrounding,” she said. “It's not all the time that she doesn't know she's home.”The response of many families here to dementia is shaped, partly, by limited treatment options: Alzheimer's and related dementias have no cure, and available medicines can be expensive, be limited in their benefits, and come with potentially life-threatening side effects. In Starr County, some caregivers eschew pharmaceuticals for aromatic teas, herbal compresses, and prayers to soothe loved ones, Maestre said. Theirs is an ethic of endurance: If dementia is here, families ask, why not build a life, tenderly, around it?Still, many don't speak of it openly. Cantú told me that in her community, many still consider Alzheimer's to be a normal part of aging—at most, a mental illness of old age, but almost never a neurodegenerative disease. “It's okay to just be forgetful at the age of 70. It's okay because Grandma and Grandpa were forgetful at the age of 70,” she said. “There's no reason to discuss it.”

Still, some caregivers live with a sense of dread: In many cases, the disease does have a genetic component, and the structural forces that compounded their loved ones' risk haven't disappeared. They know their turn could be coming. Cantú frets about her mind; Monica Saenz Silva checks her memory every day. And they don't necessarily want for themselves what they did for their parents: If his time comes, Manny Saenz wants to go to a nursing facility. “You won't know anything, so it doesn't matter,” he said. For him, the person with Alzheimer's is spared the memory of their decline; the burden belongs to those who remember, and that's a risk he doesn't want to pass on.





Hispanic Americans face a significantly higher risk of dementia than white Americans, and are also one of the country's fastest-aging groups. And yet, for decades, scientific understanding of dementia has drawn from data from mostly white, urban, and affluent populations; Hispanics make up fewer than 5 percent of participants in Alzheimer's clinical trials. That limits researchers' understanding of the condition. And the more they look, the less dementia seems like a single disease with a uniform pattern, and the more it appears to be a spectrum of diseases—each unfolding with its own course of symptoms, progression, and brain damage.

In some studies, researchers have detected amyloid plaques—the sticky protein clumps long considered hallmarks of Alzheimer's—more frequently in the brains of white participants with dementia or mild cognitive impairment than in their Black, Asian, or Hispanic counterparts. In several studies that measured tau proteins, another key Alzheimer's biomarker, Black adults with—or without—symptoms of dementia had lower levels than white participants. The genetic variant most strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease is less common—and possibly less potent—among people with certain Hispanic backgrounds than among white people.In 2021, the National Institute on Aging designated a new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in South Texas, co-directed by Maestre and Sudha Seshadri, a neurologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Their goal is to understand the Rio Grande Valley's dementia cluster—and what can be done about it—in part by examining the effects of environmental hardship and linguistic isolation, and by investigating protective factors such as bilingualism and family networks.



Eventually, Maestre hopes that urban design (such as shaded walkways, gardens, and spaces for intergenerational interaction) could help reduce the region's risks. “It's not possible to put all the responsibility on the individual,” she told me. “You cannot do that on your own.”And yet, resources remain scarce. Texas is home to about 460,000 people living with Alzheimer's disease, but compared with other large states such as Florida and New York, it spends much less on dementia-related programs. (The Texas statehouse is considering a bill to establish a $3 billion fund for dementia research.)

For now, families like Jessica Cantú's are left to do what they can. When her father was a pastor, he would tell her about the sick people he visited who would reach up with their arms (toward the kingdom of heaven, he said) before dying peacefully. In the final weeks of his life, he was still going to church and chatting with people at the H-E-B grocery store. But then Tomas lost his appetite and grew frail. One night, Jessica kept vigil at his bedside, afraid he'd fall trying to get up. In the quiet hours, she said, he lifted both arms toward the ceiling. “He was reaching up to the heavens, to the sky,” she said. “It just gave me that comfort to know that he was ready, and that everything was going to be okay.”

Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre lost his seat in parliament, in addition to losing his bid to become prime minister, after a brutal showing for party leaders in Monday's election.

Poilievre lost his seat in Ontario's Carleton riding to Liberal candidate Bruce Fanjoy after having held the district since 2004. Fanjoy won 50.6% of the vote compared to Poilievre's 46.1%. Momentum for the Conservative Party to retake the majority faded as U.S. President Donald Trump antagonized Canada and imposed tariffs on the country.

The Liberal Party will remain in power in Canada, though likely not with a majority. Prime Minister Mark Carney won the seat in Ontario's Nepean riding, but the party will likely fall a few seats short of the 172 needed to form a majority. The Liberals have been in control of parliament since 2015, though they've had to form coalitions and minority governments since then.

The Conservative leader conceded national defeat to supporters on election night before his riding was called.

“We know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time. It takes work. And that's why we have to learn the lessons of tonight — so that we can have an even better result the next time Canadians decide the future of the country.”

In that speech, he promised to remain leader.

“It will be an honor to continue to fight for you and be a champion for your cause as we go forward,” Poilievre said early Tuesday morning. It's unclear if he'll maintain that goal now that he has lost his seat in the House of Commons.

Poilievre faced opposition from the Longest Ballot Committee, which worked to register dozens of candidates to run in his riding. On Election Day, Carleton voters chose between 90 candidates, which could've contributed to his struggles. 

Other party leaders who lost their seats Monday included New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party co-leader Jonathan Pedneault. For Singh, the loss comes with a disastrous result for the party, which will likely see it lose its official party status as it appears it will fall short of the 12-seat minimum. Singh called the losses “disappointing” but said he is not disappointed “in our movement.”

Singh has led the party since 2017, before he won the seat in British Columbia's Burnaby Central riding in 2019. The electoral district, formerly called Burnaby South, was redistributed ahead of the 2025 election. It was an NDP stronghold for 25 years.  

LIBERAL PARTY WINS CANADIAN ELECTION, BUT CHANCES OF MAJORITY GOVERNMENT FADE

“It's been the honor of my life to represent the people of Burnaby Central. Tonight they chose a new member of parliament, and tonight I wish them well as they continue to work hard for this community,” Singh said. 

The Conservative Party and Liberal Party are expected to gain seats overall, as the smaller parties lose several seats in parliament.

Videos resurface of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., making the case for tariffs decades ago.

Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., described Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., during her 2022 campaign as unrepresentative of American voters, but campaign finance reports revealed she collected at least $31,000 from the former House speaker and her political action committees during her three years in Congress. 

"I want to make my position clear that I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House," Perez told The Columbian in 2022. "I look around, I look at my community, and I don't see leadership in Congress looking like that."

Despite the moderate Democrat rejecting Pelosi's leadership on the campaign trail, campaign finance reports show that since she took office in 2022, Gluesenkamp Perez and her Super PAC, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez Campaign Defense Fund, have accepted at least $31,000 from Pelosi and her affiliated Super PACs, including PAC to the Future and Nancy Pelosi for Congress.

According to U.S. Census data, the $31,000 represents more than one third of the median household income for residents in Washington's third congressional district, which includes Clark County and Vancouver, Washington, the district's largest city.

"We need more and more normal people to run for Congress. We need more people that work in the trades," Gluesenkamp Perez told Politico in 2023, as she described a Democratic Party out of touch with middle-class Americans.

"Just like her pal Nancy Pelosi, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will say and do anything to get elected," Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC dedicated to maintaining the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair, told Fox News Digital. 

"That's not a quality Washington State families want in their congresswoman."

Gluesenkamp Perez was first elected to represent Washington in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022 and won re-election in 2024, narrowly defeating her Republican challenger, Joe Kent, for the second time in two House cycles. 

The Washington congresswoman is considered one of the most vulnerable House Democrats in 2026, just as she was in 2024 after winning her 2022 race by less than two points. Republicans are likely to target her seat as an opportunity to widen their majority in the House. 

While Republicans slam Gluesenkamp Perez for flip-flopping on Pelosi, she is also facing the fury of her own party as hundreds of Democratic constituents protested at her town hall on Thursday.

According to local reporting, including KGW News, protesters held up signs that read, "Shame on you," and chanted, "Vote her out," as Gluesenkamp Perez explained why she voted in support of the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. 

The SAVE Act, which passed in the House earlier this month, requires voters to obtain proof of citizenship in-person before they register for a federal election and will remove noncitizens from voter rolls. It has been widely rejected by Democrats since its conception, and 208 House Democrats voted against the bill. 

"I do not support noncitizens voting in American elections – and that's common sense to folks in Southwest Washington. Voting in our nation's elections is a sacred right belonging only to American citizens, and my vote for the SAVE Act reflects that principle," Gluesenkamp Perez said after voting in support of the SAVE ACT, despite facing vocal opposition from constituents on Thursday for doing so.

Gluesenkamp Perez also faced disapproval from Washington state Democrats for voting to censure Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, after he shouted and shook his cane during President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress earlier this year.

            Delivering the longest inaugural address in history in January, newly inaugurated President Donald Trump made clear he had little time to waste.
    


            “From this moment on, America's decline is over,” he said, before adding: “All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.”
    


            One hundred days later, Trump has found mixed success fulfilling the pledges in his speech to return “faith, wealth, democracy and freedom” to a beleaguered nation. Americans have grown increasingly skeptical, and his 41% approval rating in CNN's latest poll is the worst for any president at his 100-day mark – including himself, in 2017.
    


            Yet few would argue he hasn't met his promise of speed.
    


            Despite only signing one piece of legislation in a ceremony at the White House, Trump has ushered in the most dramatic change of any president in decades, transforming the nation's economy, foreign policy, federal workforce and immigration enforcement in ways that left his opponents gasping. Working at breakneck pace and awake to lessons from his first term, he has pursued almost all of his agenda through executive actions.
    


            But in some areas, including deporting undocumented migrants and striking foreign deals, Trump has privately fumed his team isn't working fast enough, according to people familiar with the conversations.
    


            And in the weeks ahead of his 100-day anniversary, two issues came to frustrate the president and stymie his ambitions for quick deals: the ongoing war in Ukraine and stalemated trade talks with China.
    


            Trump's top advisers have long predicted the president would have a short timeframe upon taking office to truly effect change. In the early weeks of his second term, and even in the weeks leading up to it, his team privately acknowledged Trump needed to ram through his core policy priorities in his first two years in office, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.
    


            “Of course it's something we've discussed. These first two years are the big years,” a senior White House official said, explaining the rapid pace of change in the period ahead of congressional elections in 2026. Work on major legislation is expected to ramp up in the coming weeks as Republicans rush to pass new tax cuts.
    


            And one White House official argued the condensed timeframe the president is operating under is even more imperative for implementing Trump's agenda abroad: “Once the midterms truly ramp up, the buy-in on foreign policy aspirations will likely wane,” the official said.
    


            The discipline in executing on his agenda is derived, in part, by Trump's experience during his first term. He has regretted not working more quickly, people familiar with the matter say, lamenting some cautious former aides who told him to operate with more calculation. This time, there is no waiting for the right moment; everything has come all at once.
    


            Trump and his team once hoped to avoid getting bogged down by the strident leaks and infighting that consumed his first administration. Yet behind the scenes the White House and Cabinet have in recent weeks assumed some of the same chaos and discord that colored much of his first term. Screaming matches, staffing purges and scrambles to be the last adviser in Trump's ear have all returned, applying a fresh layer of disorder to a presidency that has rocked the federal bureaucracy, the stock market and foreign capitals.
    


            Powerful advisers, like deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, operate with wide remit to push through sweeping change, much of it challenged in court. Elon Musk, the billionaire campaign donor assigned to revamp government, has infuriated some Cabinet members with his cuts to their agencies – though ahead of his expected departure as a special government employee next month, the budget reductions have fallen well short of his initial $1 trillion promise.
    


            Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, whom the president often refers to as “the most powerful woman in the world,” continues to wield significant influence from her corner West Wing office. Despite rarely speaking in public, she is a formidable force at the White House, described by multiple Trump administration officials as the person who Trump listens to the most.
    


            But her influence has not always served to restrain a president now mostly unencumbered by the so-called “guardrails” much discussed during his first term. Amid a market meltdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged caution, but hasn't attempted to dissuade a president intent on plowing ahead with a trade war.
    


            Empowered to conduct US foreign policy is Steve Witkoff, the president's longtime friend and fellow real estate developer who is now attempting high-wire negotiations with Russia and Iran.
    


            Somewhat less so is national security adviser Mike Waltz, whom Trump argued made a “mistake” by inadvertently adding a journalist, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, to a private Signal chain in which top Cabinet and administration officials discussed sensitive plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. Waltz was later forced to fire members of his staff after a far-right activist told the president they were disloyal. Revelations of another Signal chat deepened scrutiny over Trump's controversial Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, although Trump has declined to part ways with either of them.
    


            Trump himself spends a large portion of his workdays in public, conducting the presidency in front of cameras. He has traveled infrequently, mostly for weekends at his properties in Florida and New Jersey, though he'll visit Michigan on Tuesday to formally mark his first 100 days. He has found time to oversee major White House renovations, including plans to pave the Rose Garden, erect two 100-foot flagpoles on the North and South Lawns and redo the Oval Office in gold.
    


            On both trade and the Ukraine war, Trump has privately told advisers that reaching a deal is proving harder than he initially expected. China is dug in, apparently willing to wait Trump out as the pain of his trade war becomes felt among American consumers. And Russia's President Vladimir Putin seems to be similarly playing for time, in no rush to end his bombardment, despite Trump's growing irritation.
    


            “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along,” Trump complained about Putin on Saturday after meeting Ukraine's president inside St. Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral. The week of his 100-day mark in office will prove critical for the Ukraine war, as Trump and his advisers determine whether their efforts to end the war are bearing fruit or wasting their time.
    


            Trump's inner circle never took seriously his campaign promise to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza on the first day of his presidency (Trump himself told TIME last week “it was said in jest”). But they did expect to have tangible results to point to by the 100-day mark, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.
    


            Trump had originally selected Saudi Arabia for his first stop abroad of his new term, and will visit there next month. But when Pope Francis died those plans changed, and instead Trump made his first foreign stop in Europe, a continent he's railed against frequently.
    


            Foreign policy has been an area that Trump has focused much of his efforts on in his second term, the sources said, because he views his role in ending wars abroad as being one of, if not the, most defining aspects of his legacy.
    


            “They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize,” Trump bemoaned in February during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office. “It's too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.”
    


            As part of that push, Trump has hosted a series of foreign leaders, from Jordan's King Abdullah II to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. Netanyahu has come twice – once when Trump made headlines for suggesting the US should “take over” Gaza and turn the enclave into the “riviera of the Middle East” – and again in April as the president looks for a deal to end the Israel-Hamas war after a US-negotiated ceasefire deal fell through.
    


            The White House insists it's not fazed by Trump's declining approval numbers at the 100-day mark. “Media polls have always consistently underestimated President Trump's support. We will not get bogged down by polls and we will continue to focus on everything the President is doing to deliver on his campaign promises,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN.
    


            But with 2026 looming, those closest to the president have referred to the first 100 days as the primary period for which he will have the most leeway to push through major policy – and that the closer the administration comes to the midterm elections, the closer Trump will be to becoming a lame duck – especially if Republicans lose the House.
    


            “You lose the House, you lose the ability to do a lot of the key things you need to do,” one person close to Trump said.
    


            But it's not only the outcome of the 2026 elections that jeopardizes Trump's ability to act decisively. His top advisers also predict that once the midterm elections are over, the focus will quickly shift to the battle over who will succeed him.
    


            That's not a conversation Trump much enjoys. It's one of the reasons he flirts publicly with running for a constitutionally prohibited third term.

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won the federal election, capping a stunning turnaround in fortunes fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's annexation threats and trade war.

Carney's rival, populist Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, was voted out of his seat in Parliament, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projected Tuesday.

The loss of his seat representing his Ottawa district in Monday's election capped a swift decline in fortunes for the firebrand Poilievre, who a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada's next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.

But then Trump launched a trade war with Canada and suggested the country should become the 51st state, outraging voters and upending the election.

Poilievre, a career politician, campaigned with Trump-like bravado, taking a page from the “America First” president by adopting the slogan “Canada First.” But his similarities to Trump may have ultimately cost him and his party.

The Liberals were projected to win more of Parliament's 343 seats than the Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if they would win an outright majority — at least 172 — or would need to rely on a smaller party to pass legislation and remain in power.

Elections Canada said it has decided to pause counting of special ballots — cast by voters who are away from their districts during the election — until later Tuesday morning. The Liberals were leading or elected in 168 seats when the counting was paused, four short of a majority. Elections Canada estimated that the uncounted votes could affect the result in about a dozen districts.




The decision means Canadians won't know until later in the day whether Carney's Liberals have won a minority or majority mandate.

In a victory speech, Carney stressed the importance of unity in the face of Washington's threats. He also said the mutually beneficial system Canada and the U.S. had shared since World War II had ended.

“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” he said.

“As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” Carney added. “These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ... ever happen. But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed.”

Poilievre hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose.

But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned and Carney, a two-time central banker, became the Liberal Party's leader and prime minister.

In a concession speech before the race call on his own seat, Poilievre vowed to keep fighting for Canadians.

“We are cognizant of the fact that we didn't get over the finish line yet,” Poilievre told supporters. “We know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time. It takes work. And that's why we have to learn the lessons of tonight — so that we can have an even better result the next time Canadians decide the future of the country.”

Poilievre can still lead the Conservative Party.

Even with Canadians grappling with the fallout from a deadly weekend attack at a Vancouver street festival, Trump was trolling them on election day, suggesting again on social media that Canada should become the 51st state and saying he was on their ballot. He also erroneously claimed that the U.S. subsidizes Canada, writing, “It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!”

Trump's truculence has infuriated Canadians, leading many to cancel U.S. vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast ballots before election day.

Reid Warren, a Toronto resident, said he voted Liberal because Poilievre “sounds like mini-Trump to me.” He said Trump's tariffs are a worry.

“Canadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it's definitely created some turmoil, that's for sure,” he said.

Historian Robert Bothwell said Poilievre appealed to the “same sense of grievance” as Trump, but that it ultimately worked against him.

“The Liberals ought to pay him,” Bothwell said, referring to the U.S. president. “Trump talking is not good for the Conservatives.”

Carney and the Liberals secured a new term, but they have daunting challenges ahead.

If they don't win a majority in Parliament, the Liberals might need rely on one of the smaller parties. The Bloc Québécois, which looked set to finish third, is a separatist party from French-speaking Quebec that seeks independence. Trudeau's Liberals relied on the New Democrats to remain in power for four years, but the progressive party fared poorly on Monday and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, said he was stepping down after eight years in charge.

“This is a dramatic comeback, but if the Liberals cannot win a majority of seats, political uncertainty in a new minority Parliament could complicate things for them,” said McGill University political science professor Daniel Béland.

Foreign policy hasn't dominated a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States was the prevailing issue.

In addition to the trade war with the U.S. and frosty relationship with Trump, Canada is dealing with a cost-of-living crisis. And more than 75% of its exports go to the U.S., so Trump's tariffs threat and his desire to get North American automakers to move Canada's production south could severely damage the Canadian economy.

While campaigning, Carney vowed that every dollar the government collects from counter-tariffs on U.S. goods will go toward Canadian workers who are adversely affected by the trade war. He also said he plans to keep dental care in place, offer a middle-class tax cut, return immigration to sustainable levels and increase funding to Canada's public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

The weekend of the White House Correspondents' Association dinner reopened the debate over how the press corps covered former President Joe Biden's age-related decline while in office, a story that for many sounded too conservative to be true.

Alex Thompson, a political reporter for Axios who had written extensively about Biden's 2024 meltdown, received an award from the WHCA for his coverage. He used his acceptance speech to discuss how the media largely failed the public on that particular story.

“President Biden's decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said. “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story, and some people trust us less because of it.” 

He added, “We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows. I say this because acknowledging errors builds trust, and being defensive about them further erodes it. We should have done better.”

At this point, only a minority of political journalists would dissent from these points. Yet they don't satisfy all the critics of how Biden was covered. This includes the current White House press secretary under President Donald Trump, Karoline Leavitt. 

Leavitt said she did “agree with that assessment from Alex Thompson,” whom she went on to characterize as having “won an award for writing a story months and perhaps years after the American people already knew that story to be true.”

“Millions of Americans watched our mentally incompetent president struggle with his day-to-day duties of this office,” she continued. “We watched our country be run into the ground as a result, and nobody in the media wanted to write about that or talk about it.”

Whatever your views of this White House's framing of the Biden age issue, this much is true: Most voters, including partisan Democrats, thought the octogenarian president was too old before the June 27, 2024, debate with Trump. An ABC News-Ipsos poll released that February showed an overwhelming majority thought Biden was too old to serve another term, including most Democrats.

In March 2024, a New York Times-Siena College poll found that a majority of Biden 2020 voters thought he was too old to be effective. As far back as 2022, before the midterm elections, that pollster concluded 94% of Democrats under 30 wanted their party to nominate someone else for president in the next election.

“When we look at the polls, though, the debate didn't suddenly thrust Biden's age into the spotlight for most Americans the way it seemingly did for Democratic Party elites,” wrote FiveThirtyEight's Kaleigh Rogers in a story published nine days before Biden dropped out. “Though polls of the presidential election have moved toward former President Donald Trump, answers to specific questions about Biden's age haven't changed much.”

Many, though not all, reporters who covered Biden daily and saw him regularly were slower to grasp the significance of his aging than voters catching occasional glimpses of him on television or social media. A significant number of stories treated Biden age concerns as right-wing mis- or disinformation, amplifying his team's talking points on the issue, in some cases just days before the fateful Biden-Trump debate. 

Like the COVID-19 lab leak theory, the complaints about Biden's age and acuity sounded like Republican talking points. And they frequently were so used. Some political reporters felt Republicans overplayed concerns about Biden's health in 2020 and Hillary Clinton's in 2016.

But Biden came into the presidency as someone who had been on television for half a century. It was much easier to assess independently how he looked and sounded than it was to get to the bottom of COVID origins, and it did not require taking selectively edited videos or Alzheimer's diagnoses by cable news pundits at face value.

Coverage of the 2020 and 2024 campaigns involving Biden was also colored by media regrets over how the 2016 election, which Trump won in an upset, was covered. Some reporters thought Trump benefited from how their industry had handled his first campaign and did not want to repeat those alleged mistakes or make Biden's age the equivalent of Hillary Clinton's emails, which liberals thought got excessive attention even outside the conservative press. 

The need for access to the Biden White House also surely throttled stories about his age and Hunter Biden's laptop. Some sources would not cooperate as long as the elder Biden remained politically viable, which is one of the reasons the dam burst so soon after the debate. Finally, there was credulity about assurances that Biden was consistently better in private than he appeared to be in public.

PRESSURE BUILDS ON TRUMP THE DEAL-MAKER TO DELIVER 

Sometimes, more than one factor was in play at once. When the Wall Street Journal cast doubt on Biden's energy behind closed doors, the on-the-record sourcing tilted Republican, and Democrats, including some who would call on Biden to at least consider withdrawing after the debate, publicly pushed back.

Yet it is difficult to escape the conclusion that a desire to avoid playing into Trump's hands with coverage that sounded too much like Republican messaging made it difficult for some in the media to believe their own eyes and ears.

CHATHAM, Ill. (AP) — A car smashed through a building Monday afternoon, killing four young people and injuring several others during an after-school program in a small city outside of Springfield, Illinois, police said.

Officers responded at about 3:20 p.m. to calls about a vehicle ramming through the building, fatally hitting four people before exiting the other side, Chatham Police Department Deputy Chief Scott Tarter said.

Those killed were between the ages of 4 and 18, Illinois State Police said in an emailed statement. Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon identified the victims as “female students,” saying their identities will be released after family members are notified. Several other people were hurt and taken to hospitals.

It wasn't immediately known what led up to the crash or whether it was intentional. 

Monday's crash is the latest instance of people driving vehicles into groups of people across the globe. Only two days earlier, a car plowed through a crowded street during a Filipino heritage festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, killing 11.

The Illinois driver, who was uninjured, was the sole occupant of the vehicle and was taken to a hospital for evaluation, Tarter said. Police haven't said if the driver was arrested or taken into custody. 

“I am horrified and deeply saddened by the deaths of children and numerous injuries in Chatham this afternoon,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “My heart is heavy for these families and the unimaginable grief they're experiencing – something that no parent should ever have to endure.”




He said his office was monitoring the situation and was ready to lend support.

The struck building and facilities house Youth Needing Other Things Outdoors, which holds after-school programs and summer camps, according to its website. 

As evening fell, police cars with lights flashing still blocked streets leading to the building. On its Facebook account, the Chatham Police Department asked for prayers.

“A terrible tragedy has occurred here that has affected all of us,” the message ended.

By Monday night, some members of the community and beyond had changed their Facebook profile photos to an image of a red ribbon and the words “Chatham Strong.”

Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs. But will they sabotage him?

by  Ian Millhiser

Eight years ago, at the dawn of the first Trump presidency, the White House was the locus of an ambitious project to weaken the president. 

Justice Antonin Scalia was dead. GOP senators had kept his seat on the Supreme Court vacant for more than a year, in order to ensure that it would be filled by a Republican. And President Donald Trump's top legal aides were weighing who he should appoint.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

At the time, the Republican Party's traditional constituents — business and small-government conservatives — were still the primary drivers of GOP policy. Trump had not yet converted his party into a cult of personality centered on his expansive use of power, and the lawyers who dominated his judicial selection process remained committed to a weaker executive branch.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Colorado, who was largely unknown outside of the legal profession, had spent the years leading up to Trump's first election auditioning for a seat on the nation's highest Court. The scion of a Republican noble family — his mother led the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan — then-Judge Neil Gorsuch spent his final years on a lower court calling for a massive power shift away from the executive branch of the US government and toward the judiciary.

Among other things, Gorsuch argued that the Supreme Court should overrule Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984), a seminal decision instructing courts to defer to policy judgments made by federal agencies. He also advocated for reviving an out-of-fashion legal concept called the nondelegation doctrine, which gives judges broad discretion to strike down laws delegating power to the executive.

Gorsuch's narrow view of executive power, as journalist David Kaplan reported in a 2018 book, “proved decisive in clinching” the Trump White House's decision to place Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. At the time, the Federalist Society, the powerful conservative legal group that Trump relied on to select many of his first-term judges, was obsessively committed to weakening the executive branch's power to regulate. And no judge had done more to align himself with this broader agenda than Neil Gorsuch.

Flash-forward to the present, and Gorsuch seems triumphant. Less than a year ago, the Supreme Court overruled Chevron in an opinion joined by all of the Court's Republicans — including Gorsuch and Trump's two other, similarly minded Court picks. And, while these same justices haven't yet brought back nondelegation, they invented something known as the “major questions doctrine,” which does more or less the same thing. The Supreme Court used this newly created doctrine often to strike down Biden administration policies, even policies that were explicitly authorized by a federal statute.

Many prominent Democrats, including the three who sit on the Supreme Court, complained about this expansion of judicial power, and were vocally frustrated that the Court continuously stymied their president's plans. Now, however, Democrats may decide that Gorsuch was right in his anti-executive crusade. 

Trump's first few months back in office — with its trade wars, questionable deportations, and attempts to flout the Constitution — have been an advertisement for the idea that the United States should have less state capacity, that it is too easy for presidents to shift policy in surprising and avulsive ways, and that we'd all be better off if some wise elders in black robes step in to restore order. That sense is only likely to grow if, in the coming months, the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs and ensures that no one else is deported without due process.

Gorsuch, and other judges who believe in a weak executive, now have an opportunity to be the heroes who save America from a chaotic leader who doesn't seem to hold the law in high regard. All they have to do is reject partisan politics and hew to the values that got them their jobs in the first place.

During the Biden administration, the Court's Republican majority gave themselves sweeping new powers — powers that they largely took from the executive branch. The most significant is the so-called major questions doctrine, which allows the Court to veto executive branch actions that a majority of the justices deem too ambitious.

Proponents of this doctrine often summarize it with a quote from a 2014 opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia: “We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'” Thus, if the executive claims the power to do something with big economic or political implications, the Court will view that claim with extraordinary skepticism.

There are many reasons to doubt that Court's Republicans have applied this doctrine in good faith. The major questions doctrine is brand-new, and has never been used against any president who isn't named “Joe Biden.” The Republican justices used it to strike down Biden administration policies that were unambiguously authorized by federal law. They've never produced a majority opinion which bothers to explain where this doctrine comes from. 

Some individual justices have attempted to do so, but their explanations are often risible. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, for example, once claimed that the major questions doctrine can be derived from a parable involving a babysitter.

Realistically, however, if you are a small business owner on the cusp of bankruptcy, because your entire livelihood depends on importing components that have more than doubled in price thanks to Trump's tariffs, you are unlikely to care whether Barrett's Parable of the Babysitter is persuasive to lawyers. The primary virtue of the major questions doctrine is that, if it is applied in a fair and nonpartisan manner, it would enable the courts to shut down Trump's trade war altogether.

Recall that this doctrine targets executive branch actions that have vast economic or political significance. The tariffs have already thrown the stock market into turmoil, and expert analysis of their likely impact ranges from severe to catastrophic. The Budget Lab at Yale, for example, predicts that the average US household will lose the equivalent of $4,900 worth of income. If that's not a matter of vast economic or political significance, it is hard to imagine what is.

The justices, in other words, don't need to invent a new weapon if they want to destroy the tariffs — they already have one that is tailor-made for this case. The question is whether they will use it.

The current Court's approach to executive power often has a split personality. While most of the justices have joined majority opinions that twisted the law in knots to limit the power of federal agencies controlled by the president, they have also often been hyper-protective of, and deferential to, Trump himself — hence the Court's decision holding that Trump has broad immunity from criminal prosecutions.

Even so, there are two reasons to think that the Court may ultimately strike down Trump's tariffs.

One is that a wide array of Republican legal elites are lining up against the tariffs. The first lawsuit challenging them was filed by a right-wing legal shop that has historically aligned itself with many of Trump's goals. In one of the main lawsuits challenging the tariffs, a wide range of former officials recently filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs. They include the co-chair of the Federalist Society's board, and three former Republican senators — one of whom is John Danforth, an early mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas.

The other reason is that, because justices do not have to stand for reelection, their views do not always change as their political party evolves. Instead, Supreme Court appointees often reflect the political views that their party held at the time when they were appointed.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, chose his justices because he was confident that they would uphold New Deal programs that were a high priority for him. He did not care much at all about race, the issue that would consume liberalism a decade after Roosevelt left office, and so many of them were widely out of step with the liberal consensus by the 1950s. Former Justice Jimmy Byrnes, who Roosevelt placed on the Court, would go on to become a segregationist governor of South Carolina.

Similarly, President George W. Bush chose Chief Justice John Roberts in large part because Roberts took an expansive view of Bush's power to incarcerate suspected terrorists in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. A few years after Bush left office, Republicans united behind a lawsuit seeking to repeal Obamacare, and many of them were upset when Roberts voted only to weaken the law and not repeal it altogether.

But Bush could not have known, in 2005 when he chose Roberts, that five years later Bush's successor would sign a health care law that Republicans would hate. So his White House did not vet Roberts to ensure that he was a reliable vote against expanding access to health care. Roberts remains a strong proponent of expansive presidential power on questions involving national security. That might help Trump label people “terrorists” and disappear them to a foreign prison in El Salvador. But on topics related to domestic and economic policy,

Roberts' ideology often reflects what conservative Republicans believed in 2005, and doesn't always match what they believe today.

It is entirely possible, in other words, that at least some of the Republican justices will decide that they care more about traditional conservative free trade principles — and the view of executive power they held when they ascended to the highest court — than they will about backing a Republican president's signature policy initiative. 

And, if that's the case, they have a ready-made, long sought-after tool they can use to simultaneously eliminate those tariffs and cement the judiciary's control over the executive branch for a generation or more.

How can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin has the latest on the crackdown of illegal migrant gang members on 'Special Report.'

A Venezuelan illegal alien, and alleged leader of the violent Tren de Aragua gang, was arrested in Los Angeles County last week, the Trump administration told Fox News on Monday.

Yonaiker Gallegos, who had been using the name Yoniaker(sic) Rafel Martinez-Ramos, was already in local custody on misdemeanor charges for blank checks and possession of a deceptive government ID.

He was located by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) on April 22, according to a senior Trump administration official. Agents were able to determine that Martinez-Ramos was likely a fake identity after obtaining information about the items in his possession when he was arrested by local authorities.

He was positively identified as Gallegos on April 23 after HSI's National Gang Unit obtained pictures of Martinez-Ramos' tattoos and booking photos.

Analysts were also able to locate his social media posts and pictures, which ultimately confirmed his real identity as Yonaiker Gallegos through facial recognition technology, the official said.

A video shared with Fox News from Gallegos' social media allegedly showed him flaunting grenades and a rifle.

He was arrested on April 25 for Title 8 (immigration) violations, according to the senior official, who also said he was "identified as a leader of TDA based in California."

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) also confirmed Gallegos' arrest.

            Unlike seven years ago, the Philadelphia Eagles celebrated their Super Bowl victory at the White House with President Donald Trump on Monday.
    


            The Eagles traveled to Washington for the traditional championship victory lap, taking photos with the president, presenting him with an Eagles jersey emblazoned with “Trump 47” and soaking up the plaudits on the South Lawn having won Super Bowl LIX against the Kansas City Chiefs in February.
    


            But absent from the traveling party was star quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts who had a “scheduling conflict,” according to a White House spokesperson.
    


            Last week, Hurts had dodged a question about whether he will personally celebrate the team's Super Bowl victory at the White House, instead not answering when while he was on the red carpet for the 2025 TIME 100 gala in New York City, saying “Um” and looking around before the interviewer thanked him for his time.
    


            Trump praised Hurts at the White House on Monday, calling him a “terrific guy and terrific player” while calling the Eagles an “incredible team, an incredible group.”
    


According to reports, several other key members of the Eagles team were also not present at the White House, including wide receivers AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith, linebacker Zack Baun, defensive ends Brandon Graham and Josh Sweat and defensive tackle Jalen Carter.
    


            In 2018, during Trump's first term as president, the Eagles decided not celebrate their first ever Super Bowl win at the White House, a decision which sparked a storm of criticism from Trump, who falsely accused the Eagles of taking a knee during “The Star-Spangled Banner” that year and disrespecting the National Anthem in other ways before uninviting the whole team.
    


            During their time in Washington, the Eagles also visited Arlington National Cemetery where they paid their “respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,” team owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement.
    


            “Our time in our nation's capital served as a great reminder of the core values that have brought our team so close together – sacrifice, selflessness, and discipline.”
    


            One player who was in attendance was Eagles running back Saquon Barkley who on Sunday had been seen spending time with Trump.
    


            Barkley and Trump were seen getting off Marine One in New Jersey before playing golf at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. Barkley later took to social media to reply to those questioning his decision to meet and play golf with Trump.
    


            “Lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT,” he said on X. “Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago…and look forward to finishing my round with Trump!
    


            “Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day.”
    

lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT. Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago…and look forward to finishing my round with Trump ! Now ya get out my…


            During Monday's festivities at the White House, Trump vocalized his support for the “Tush Push” play which the Eagles have popularized but could potentially be banned later this year by NFL owners.
    


            The infamous play has become polarizing across the NFL, but teams will vote on whether it will remain a permitted play in the future after a motion was tabled to ban it. And Trump said he's in support of the league keeping it around.
    


            “I hope they keep that play, Coach (Nick Sirianni). They're talking about getting rid of that play, I understand. They should keep it,” Trump said on Monday. “I like it. It's sort of exciting and different.”
    


            After Trump spoke, Eagles head coach Sirianni said, “Thank you, Mr. President, for having us here. And we also appreciate the endorsement for the tush push.”

Christie Brinkley tried everything she could to keep her marriage to Billy Joel alive.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, Brinkley talked about her memoir, "Uptown Girl," a nod to the 1983 hit Joel created about the actress, and what she wrote of her nearly 10-year marriage to the music icon.

In the memoir, Brinkley wrote about Joel's drinking problem being the "other woman" in their marriage.

"To be clear, I never wanted to end things with Billy. I read every self-help book I could find while, together, we went to see a string of psychiatrists, psychologists, and other medical doctors," Brinkley wrote in an excerpt obtained by Fox News Digital.

"I did everything for our marriage, constantly working to make myself, our home, and everything around us into whatever he could possibly want or hope for. I continually told him how much I loved him, making sure he always felt adored and appreciated, because he was. 

"But his drinking was bigger than the both of us—booze was the other woman, and it was beginning to seem that, he preferred to be with ‘her' rather than with me," Brinkley wrote.

During her interview with Fox News Digital, Brinkley shared that Joel met her and his ex-girlfriend, Elle Macpherson, on the same night out. Joel went on to date Macpherson for a brief time before he became serious with Brinkley.

"Elle and I met Billy on the same night, and that was the night that I thought I know I want to be friends with this guy forever, but I had other things going on in my life, but I knew I wanted to keep him as a friend. We hit it off immediately. I mean, immediately," Brinkley said.

She continued, "And then when he came back into my life and he was so wonderful and I started to see him differently. And so I think it was really great to start out with a friendship and have that friendship evolve into a full-on romantic adventure."

The title of Brinkley's memoir seems to be a nod to Joel's 1983 "Uptown Girl," which he has admitted to have written for Brinkley.

In 2010, Joel finally confirmed that "Uptown Girl" was written about Brinkley (she did appear in the music video), although he explained that there was more to the story. 

"I wasn't even dating Christie when I started writing the song, I was dating Elle [Macpherson]," Joel shared on "The Howard Stern Show." He remembered a moment when he was surrounded by Brinkley, Macpherson and Whitney Houston while he was working on the song. 

"That's why I started writing a song called ‘Uptown Girls'. It was plural. I couldn't believe, you know, the situation I was in," he said of having a bevy of beauties near him.

Joel said when he and Macpherson went their separate ways, the nature of the song changed because of his relationship with Brinkley. "And then I started dating Christie and rather than it [being] about all these different girls, she became the ‘Uptown Girl.' I started writing it about one person."

Brinkley and Joel were married from 1985 until the model filed for divorce in 1994 and the couple share a daughter, Alexa Ray Joel. Brinkley told Fox News Digital that it wasn't easy to end her marriage to Joel.

"Well, I mean, when you have a child involved, you may get those thoughts, but to walk away isn't easy. And to walk away from Billy was not easy. So it took time, but at a certain point there's one incident too many, and you just have to have a little self-preservation," Brinkley said.

"I find love is the strongest thing in the whole world, and we are surrounded with love," she told Fox News Digital. "There's so many kinds of love: love for our friends, love for our families, love for nature and love for people that protect nature."

"I just feel like my life is so full of love. And so I think if there's a romantic love that comes along as well, it would be wonderful. But I also feel very content and happy with the life that I have right now, and I consider my life to be very full of love," Brinkley said.

Brinkley's "Uptown Girl" memoir hits the shelves on April 29.

            The American public is frustrated, disappointed and increasingly angry at the state of politics 100 days into Donald Trump's second term in the White House, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, with neither party positioned to change the mood.
    


            Approval ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are deeply underwater, with Democrats faring even worse as their rank-and-file turn increasingly negative about the party's leaders. Nearly two-thirds of all Americans say things in the country are going badly today.
    


            The poll also finds a rising tide of fear among Americans looking ahead to the rest of Trump's second term, with many doubtful that the checks and balances built into the US government are doing enough to limit Trump's actions in office.
    


            “I'm not pleased. I'm unsure. I'm honestly scared. I think this is the first time I can say that I'm fearful as to what is coming, what has happened and what is coming,” said Lisa Taylor, an independent from Maryland who voted for Trump in 2016 and for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 and participated in the poll.
    


            She is one of about 4 in 10 Americans (41%) who say they feel afraid about the remainder of Trump's second term, up 6 points since February and 12 points since December. That shift is centered among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 71% of whom say they feel afraid about what's to come during Trump's time in office, up from 63% two months ago. Just 8% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents feel the same way. This GOP-aligned group remains broadly positive about Trump and has grown increasingly optimistic about politics generally (55%, up from 31% before Trump took office), but the share saying they're enthusiastic for the rest of Trump's term has dipped from 44% in February to 34% now.
    


            Half or more of all Americans in the poll say they feel Congress (56%) and courts and judges (50%) are doing too little to check Trump's power as president, and that the Trump administration is not doing enough to uphold checks and balances (53%). Most independents and Democrats say too little is being done to check Trump across the board, but Republicans largely see the Trump administration (75%) and Congress (54%) as striking the right balance, while a majority of the GOP sees courts and judges as overreaching in their efforts to check Trump's power as president (52%).
    


            All told, 58% now say that Republicans' unified control of the House of Representatives, Senate and White House is bad for the country, up from 53% who felt that way in January just before Trump took office. Just 37% say they approve of the way Republican leaders in Congress are handling their jobs, and both House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune have underwater favorability ratings (23% favorable to 33% unfavorable for Johnson, 16% favorable to 24% unfavorable for Thune).
    


            But there is little sign that this disgruntled public is ready to turn to Democrats instead. Approval ratings for Democratic leaders in Congress are even lower (27% approve, a record low for the party in CNN polling back to 2008) and nearly half of adults (46%) say they disapprove of leaders from both parties. The top two Hill Democrats — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — are also underwater in favorability (20% favorable to 27% unfavorable for Jeffries; 17% favorable to 44% unfavorable for Schumer, his worst rating in CNN polling back to 2017).
    


            Gregory Victorianne, a 65-year-old Democrat from Los Angeles who took the poll, expressed frustration with his party's response to Trump's return to office. “The Democrats need to wake up. They need to put this man in check, put this party in check and let us know in real time what they're doing so we can stay on top of it and fight and take control of the House, the Senate and the White House again.”
    


            The public is also about evenly split over whether Harris would've done a better job than Trump had she won last year's election – 42% say Trump has done a better job than Harris would have, 41% that Harris would've been better and 16% that the two would've been about the same.
    


            Much of the Democratic image problem comes from dissatisfaction within their own ranks. While Republicans and Republican-leaning independents broadly approve of their congressional leadership (72% of GOP-aligned adults approve of the party's congressional leaders), those who belong or lean toward the Democratic Party are deeply negative toward their party's leadership: 61% disapprove and just 38% approve.
    


            While Republican-aligned adults have grown more positive toward Johnson and Thune since January, Democrats and Democratic leaners have shifted more negative toward their own leaders. Jeffries' favorability rating with that group slipped from net positive by 37 points to net positive by 31 points, with all of the change coming on the unfavorable side. And Schumer has lost significant ground among his own partisans, falling from a 46% favorable to 11% unfavorable rating in January to a 31% favorable vs. 30% unfavorable split now.
    


            Although he has lost ground across the board, Schumer's unpopularity within the party is notably high among the youngest Democratic-aligned adults, as he faces significant pressure to make way for younger leaders — particularly in the wake of his decision not to fight a GOP-backed spending bill in March. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents younger than 35, 14% have a favorable view and 24% an unfavorable one. Among those in the party aged 65 or older, though, impressions are widely net positive, 52% favorable to 22% unfavorable. In January, Democratic views of Schumer broke at least narrowly positive across all age groups.
    


            Souring views of Democratic leaders come as anger with politics among the party's rank-and-file generally has swelled: 70% of Democratic-aligned adults now say that they're angry about national politics, up from 46% in January. Overall, about 45% of Americans say they're angry about politics, up from 39% in January.
    


            Majorities of all Americans in the poll say they are feeling frustrated (63%, about the same as in January) and disappointed (60%, down 10 points since January) with politics in America today. Some of that negative sentiment towards the political environment is present across party lines, with 82% of Democrats and Democratic leaners and nearly half of Republican-aligned adults saying they are frustrated (45%). Partisans are moving in opposite directions on this measure, though, with Democrats expressing increased frustration as that feeling dips among Republicans.
    


            Victorianne, the Democrat from Los Angeles, wants to see more action from his own party. “We need the politicians, the Democrats themselves, who are in office, … [to] let us know ‘I got your back,' instead of asking me for my wallet.”

Prince William and Kate Middleton are celebrating their anniversary somewhere they feel right at home.

The Prince and Princess of Wales are visiting an island northwest of Scotland — where they fell in love — for two days starting on April 29, the same date as their 2011 wedding, People magazine reported.

Royal experts told Fox News Digital that the destination holds special significance for the couple, who have enjoyed country life as a refuge while they quietly prepare to be future monarchs. William, 42, is next in line to the throne.

"Prince William and Princess Catherine are heading to the Isle of Mull, just off the coast of Scotland," British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital. "They will spend the night of their wedding anniversary in a self-catered holiday cottage."

"Their opting for modest accommodation, rather than a luxury hotel, is a metaphor for their relationship," said Fordwich. "It's uncomplicated, genuine and represents the way they like to do things, which is together without a lot of fuss and connected to rural life. They have an enduring connection to Scotland, from their university days together where they started as friends."

According to Fordwich, William has been packing on the romance and showering Kate with affection since she announced that her cancer was in remission earlier this year. Bonding in the countryside — beyond palace walls — has been essential to their relationship, she said.

"After Prince William was witnessed by the world delivering gravitas and diplomacy, all welcome signs of his growing confidence on the international stage, he is treasuring his time with Princess Catherine, as he put it, his ‘second chance,'" Fordwich explained. "He's been focusing on romantic dinners, long walks and sharing their interest in rural life."

"They always energize each other in the countryside, which has been described as ‘medicine for their marriage,'" said Fordwich. "They don't let challenges drive them apart but rather leverage them to pull together. Their resilience is deeply rooted in their mutual love of family and results in a deep commitment to ensuring the next generation of monarchy is secure."

The couple met at the University of St. Andrews in 2005 and studied art history, People magazine reported. The pair, who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, dated on and off for much of their four years at the university.

The outlet noted that their visit to Scotland is aimed at celebrating rural living and the work of farming communities. They will start the day at Tobermory, a seaside town known for its harbor cottages that's also the setting of the British children's TV show "Balamory."

William and Kate have previously opened up about their love of spending time outdoors. In a 2020 podcast, Kate said her favorite moments with her family take place "outside in the country, and we're all filthy dirty."

In February of this year, William told a group from the Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs, "I love the countryside, and I love farming as well," People magazine reported.

"I'm conscious that it's an area that needs maybe support in understanding that there's access to support out there."

Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliam told Fox News Digital that after the couple said "I do," William chose not to take on royal engagements full-time and instead, focused on prioritizing his family in a quiet, private setting.

"As the world's most high-profile and most glamorous royal couple, they bring a very special cachet to the causes they support," said Fitzwilliams. "William's Earthshot Prize and help for the homeless and Catherine's Early Years Foundation are excellent examples. Initially nervous as a public speaker, she now has confidence as well as poise and charm."

"We also see examples of their closeness as a couple in the way they, unusually for a royal couple, engage in displays of affection," he shared. "Their mutual affection is especially evident when they compete against each other in sports. They and their children, whose privacy they guard fiercely, are the future of the monarchy. The inspiration that Kate derives from the natural world she has shown [on social media]."

British broadcaster Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that the couple's secret behind their 14-year marriage has been carving out time for their mutual passions together.

"The bond and love that the Prince and Princess of Wales still share with each other is evident for all to see," she explained. "They complete each other like two puzzle pieces. They are soulmates. The truth is, both Prince William and Princess Catherine have always had a strong sense of self. They communicate, compromise and share burdens. They help each other through challenging times. Princess Catherine is the more solution-focused. However, their collaborative approach filters into everything they do."

"Their shared humor is also their superpower, along with a wonderful close circle of friends and a strong family support network," said Chard. 

"They don't feel the need to prove themselves to anyone and are laser-focused on all they do, from their family priorities to their royal endeavors. They haven't changed as people and have simply matured together. They certainly know their own minds and, as modern royals, are carrying out everything that they feel fits rather than what is expected."

According to People magazine, the couple will launch a partnership between their Royal Foundation and the local area to support two community spaces on Mull, which is recognized for its farming and fishing heritage. They will also visit a small farm to learn about sustainable agriculture. On the second day of their visit, the outlet shared that the couple would spend time with local schoolchildren for outdoor learning.

Kate previously shared on a podcast that growing up, her family taught her the importance of appreciating the outdoors.

"I remember that from my childhood — doing the simple things, going for a walk together, and that's really what I try and do with my children as well, because it totally strips away all the complications, all the pressures," she said. "I think these experiences as well mean so much to children and the world that they're in which is a real adventure for them at that age."

Chard said that Kate and William have always had a mutual love of "the great outdoors" and have made it part of their work when possible.

"They passionately throw themselves into their work," she said. "With a view to ‘impact' and 'scale,' they genuinely take great interest and care, making a difference and creating positive change… They embrace [a] simple life and [will continue to do that] as they help the community of Mull on their 14th anniversary. The visit aims to highlight the importance of protecting and championing the natural environment, a cause close to their hearts."

Canadians are watching the federal parliamentary results roll in as the polls close time zone by time zone across the country.

Both Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party and Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party are holding events in the capital city of Ottawa tonight. 

There is excitement within each party about the so-far narrow race, but the night is still early.

The Liberal Party had secured 21 seats and was leading in 57 additional districts just before 10 p.m. Eastern time. The Conservatives had won eight seats already and were leading in 48. The Bloc Québécois was leading in 11 districts across Quebec and the New Democrats finally put themselves on the board with the lead in one district.

A party must win 172 seats to form a majority government.

Conservatives scored the first projected flip of the night in the Long Range Mountains riding of Newfoundland, previously held by the Liberal Party.

On its own, it's only a minor shift, but Conservatives are hoping that it is a sign of a broader trend of right-leaning voters under-reporting their intentions in the polls — the oft-asserted “shy Tory” phenomenon.

WHO IS MARK CARNEY, CANADA'S NEXT PM WHO'S ITCHING TO TAKE ON TRUMP?

Liberals are hoping to establish a more fortified position early in the night. Liberal candidates are considered strongest on the Atlantic coast and in Ontario. 

Western Canada is a geographically large but underpopulated Conservative stronghold. 

As poll closings move from the Atlantic provinces and toward British Columbia, the Conservatives are expected to find more consistent victories.

The next round of polls is scheduled to close at 9:30 p.m. Eastern. The final polls in British Columbia will be shut down at 10 p.m.

The party that receives the most votes will be able to select the prime minister. If they do not win an outright majority, they will need to form a coalition with other parties to establish their government.

BLOC QUEBECOIS WANTS TO FREE QUEBEC FROM ‘ARTIFICIAL COUNTRY' OF CANADA

President Donald Trump took a final shot at Canadian politicians as the country's voters headed to the polls for the federal parliamentary election.

Trump, whose shadow looms over the country as the premier economic threat, wished “good luck” to the “great people of Canada” and took a moment to weigh in on who they should vote for.

“Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,” Trump said on Truth Social.

Starbucks on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected earnings and another quarter of same-store sales declines, but the coffee giant said its turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success.

"Our financial results don't yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan," CEO Brian Niccol said in a video posted on the company's website. "We're testing and learning at speed and we're seeing changes in our coffeehouses."

Shares of the company were roughly flat in extended trading.

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Starbucks reported fiscal second-quarter net income attributable to the company of $384.2 million, or 34 cents per share, halved from $772.4 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company's operating margin fell to 6.9% from 12.8% as Starbucks spent more to kick-start its comeback. Labor costs rose as it staffed its U.S. cafes with more baristas.

Outside its home market, the company spent more on promotions to drive traffic to its stores. It also accrued restructuring costs for the steps it has taken to simplify its global corporate organization.

Excluding restructuring costs, the company earned 41 cents per share.

Net sales rose 2% to $8.76 billion, but Starbucks' same-store sales fell for its fifth straight quarter. The company's sales have slumped as consumers in the U.S. and China, its two largest markets, seek cheaper coffee options.

Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting "back to Starbucks" and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience.

While the early stages of the turnaround have not yielded improvements in its financial results, Niccol said the company's new marketing is resonating with customers, and service speeds are improving. One of his goals for the company is to complete every order in four minutes or less.

Still, the company's global same-store sales fell 1% in its second quarter, fueled by a 2% decline in transactions. In Starbucks' home market, the traffic decline was even steeper.

U.S. locations saw transactions fall 4%, dragging its same-store sales down 2%. China's same-store sales were flat for the quarter, as a lower average ticket offset transaction growth.

In October, the company suspended its forecast for fiscal 2025 as it unveiled the early stages of its turnaround strategy. The plan has included layoffs for its white-collar workers. In late February, Starbucks announced it would cut 1,100 corporate positions, plus several hundred unfilled roles, as part of the turnaround plan.

Looking ahead, Starbucks plans to improve its cafes with better seating and "premium touches" in the hopes of enticing customers to linger, according to Niccol. The company also plans to overhaul its innovation process and improve the customer experience by fixing staffing levels, standards and the algorithm that tells baristas what drinks to make.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday teased that the Trump administration has reached its first trade deal, but said it was not fully finalized and declined to name the country involved.

"I have a deal done, done, done, done, but I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give its approval, which I expect shortly," Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan.

The stock market rose to its highs of the session following the comments, as Wall Street is watching closely for signs of progress in trade negotiations.

Lutnick did say that he was not dealing directly with China. He said those negotiations were in the "portfolio" of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

"My portfolio is the rest of the world's trade deals," Lutnick said.

Lutnick's comments come nearly a full month after "liberation day," when President Donald Trump rolled out widespread tariff hikes on most of the world. Many of those levies have since been paused for 90 days, but the tariffs on China have been hiked to more than 100%.

The Trump administration has said that dozens of countries have reached out about making a deal in recent weeks, but no agreement has been officially announced. Japan, South Korea and India have been seen as some of the most likely candidates for deals.

When asked about Lutnick's comments on Fox Business later Tuesday, Bessent declined to say if a deal had been reached with any country.

"I'm not going to get ahead of the president. Nothing's done until President Trump announces it. ... So we should wait to hear from President Trump over the next couple of days," Bessent said.

The uncertainty around tariffs has sparked volatility in the stock market and declining confidence among business leaders and consumers, according to multiple surveys. Wall Street saw steep downturns after the initial tariff rollout, but stocks have rebounded over the past week.

Lutnick's interview with CNBC's "The Exchange" took place in Arizona at the construction site of a semiconductor factory. Increased U.S. manufacturing is one of Lutnick's stated goals for the Trump administration's tariff policies.

UPS reports that small companies can't afford to stock up and are at the back of the line for supply alternatives.

Chinese manufacturers aren't slowing production. They're selling those wares to countries other than the US.

President Donald Trump took aim at China with his cannon shot of 145% tariffs and ended up with a direct hit on US small businesses. That's the takeaway from United Parcel Service Inc.'s earnings conference call, which gave a glimpse of the damage already taking hold across the US economy.

Many small businesses rely on China as their sole source for imported goods and are now scrambling along with larger ones for alternatives. Phone calls from large companies seeking to move production outside of China, to places such as Vietnam or Thailand, are taken first, leaving the small importers hanging, UPS Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé said.

LONDON — Britain on Tuesday published draft legislation for the cryptocurrency industry, touting greater collaboration with the U.S. as it looks to regulate the wild world of digital assets.

Speaking at a fintech event Tuesday, U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced plans for a "comprehensive regulatory regime for crypto assets," adding that the proposals would aim to make the country a "world leader in digital assets."

The rules will bring crypto exchanges, dealers and agents into the regulatory fold, "cracking down on bad actors while supporting legitimate innovation," the U.K.'s Treasury department said in a statement released following Reeves' remarks.

"Crypto firms with UK customers will also have to meet clear standards on transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience — just like firms in traditional finance," the Treasury's statement added.

Reeves said that the U.K. planned to deepen regulatory cooperation with the U.S. to boost "responsible" adoption of digital assets. "For the U.K. to be a world leader in digital assets, international cooperation is vital," she told attendees at fintech industry group Innovate Finance's annual summit.

The U.K. finance minister met with her U.S. counterpart Scott Bessent last week to discuss a trade deal. She had previously said that improving business ties with the European Union was "arguably even more important."

"Regulation must support business, not hold it back," Reeves said Thursday.

Crypto industry insiders say the Financial Conduct Authority — which is the U.K.'s financial services watchdog — has been too restrictive when it comes to approving registrations from digital asset firms.

The FCA is the regulator responsible for registering firms that want to provide crypto services within the scope of money laundering regulations in the U.K.

The kick off to the first leg of this year's UEFA Champions League semifinals gives football fans the chance to watch Arsenal vs. PSG, with both sides seeking their first-ever title in the competition.

The Gunners' quest for the Premier League may have come to a premature end at the weekend, but their bid for European football's biggest prize continues after impressively dismantling champions Real Madrid 5-1 over two legs in the quarterfinals. Having lost only one game on their way to the final four, Mikel Arteta's men have been perhaps the most impressive team in this year's competition and will seriously fancy their chances to make only their second Champions League final — 19 years after their first.

Paris Saint-Germain cross the Channel knowing that the domestic title is all but sealed and with many pundits saying that this might be their greatest opportunity yet to finally capture the European glory that has so painfully eluded them. Having vanquished Liverpool on penalties and then nervously battled past Aston Villa, this is the third straight English team standing between them and the final. Luis Enrique has no major injury worries to concern him in North London, as star names like Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, and Ousmane Dembele are all fit and likely to start.

It's impossible to confidently call which way this game at the Emirates Stadium will go. To make sure you don't miss a minute, we've compiled all the information you'll need to watch Arsenal vs. PSG live streams around the world, including free options and how to stream it when abroad.

Lucky football fans in Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg can watch Arsenal vs. PSG absolutely free. In Italy, it's going out on the TV8 platform, with RTL Club and RTL2 streaming the game in Belgium and Luxembourg, respectively. Alternatively, you can take advantage of any platform offering a free trial, such as Prime Video in the UK or Paramount Plus in the US.

If you're overseas this week and find your usual free stream blocked, you can use a VPN (virtual private network) to trick your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or other streaming device into thinking it's somewhere else, so you can watch your usual Champions League live stream as if you were back home.

In a crowded market, ExpressVPN is among our favorite VPNs. As we explained in our ExpressVPN review, it has the benefit of super-fast servers, unblocks a wide array of geo-blocked services, and is very straightforward to use. VPNs like Express also encrypt all of your online activity, meaning that you can't be tracked when the VPN is switched on. If you're unsure whether to sign up, you can try out ExpressVPN thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee.


                      With its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that make it exceptional. Better yet, you can save more than 60% right now and get up to four months free.
                    

The Paramount Plus streaming service is the official online broadcaster of UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League soccer in the US, including all semifinals and finals. It costs from $8/month on a rolling basis, or you can get a whole year of Paramount Plus for only $60. Plus, there's a seven-day free trial available to new users. A Paramount Plus Essential subscription in the US also gives you access to a catalog of 40,000+ TV episodes and movies and CBS's NFL games, but you'll need to upgrade to Paramount Plus with Showtime to live stream CBS 24/7.


                      Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime.
                    

Amazon Prime Video is live streaming Arsenal vs. PSG in the UK (with next week's second leg on TNT Sport and Discovery Plus). That means Prime members are ready to go and can watch online, on smartphones, and on apps for most streaming devices. If you don't have Prime, it costs £9/month or, if you're new to the service or are returning after more than 12 months, then you can take advantage of Amazon's free 30-day trial to Prime. All the while you're subscribed, you'll also get access to Amazon's speedy delivery and other Prime membership benefits.


                      Amazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also sign up for a stand-alone plan at $9/month. 
                    

DAZN — the multinational sports streaming specialist — is Canada's Champions League broadcaster this season. DAZN costs $35/month on a rolling basis or, if you're happy to commit to a whole year, then you'll pay either $25 monthly installments or $250 up front. In addition to this and other soccer around the world, a DAZN subscription also gives you access to stacks of high-quality boxing, UFC, rugby, and other live sport action from around the planet.


                      DAZN is a sports streaming service with live and on-demand content, including exclusive boxing matches. It's also available in a vast amount of countries around the world. Many events require an additional PPV fee, but a base subscription also offers its own slate of content.
                    

Note: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.

US President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump is finally getting on the road to promote his agenda, after spending much of his first 100 days in office ensconced in the White House or his private clubs.

Trump on Tuesday is traveling to suburban Detroit to make a speech touting his second-term record. In May, he'll deliver two commencement addresses and travel to the Middle East.

House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have released their plan to overhaul the country's student loan and financial aid system, calling for limits on student borrowing and a reduction to the repayment options for borrowers.

The GOP measure, known as the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, is aimed at helping Republicans pass President Donald Trump's tax cuts.

"For decades Congress has responded to the student loan crisis by throwing more and more taxpayer dollars at the problem — never addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs," committee Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said in a statement.

The proposal immediately triggered warnings from consumer advocates, who said the measures would deepen the affordability crisis families already face in paying for college.

"The committee's current proposal would severely restrict college access by slashing financial aid programs, eliminating basic consumer protections and making it harder to repay student loan debt," said Sameer Gadkaree, president and CEO of The Institute for College Access & Success.

Here are some of the proposals in the Republicans' legislation.

Under the proposal, undergraduate students would face a borrowing cap of $50,000 in federal student loans starting July 1, 2026, while graduate students couldn't take out more than $100,000.

Current limits vary by factors including student status and year of schooling, but for many people, the caps will mean they can borrow less.

Those limits "will shift some borrowing to private student loans," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

That's a concern for Kantrowitz and other consumer advocates, who point out that private student loans come with far fewer borrower protections than federal student loans.

The GOP proposal would reduce the number of existing income-driven repayment plans for new federal student loan borrowers to just one. IDR plans aim to make monthly payments affordable for borrowers by capping the bills at a portion of their discretionary income.

More than 12 million people were enrolled in IDR plans as of September 2024, according to Kantrowitz.

It would also eliminate the unemployment deferment and economic hardship deferment for federal student loan borrowers, on debt taken out during or after July 2025.

Full eligibility for Pell Grants would also require students to be enrolled at a minimum of 30 hours each academic year, up from the current requirement of 12 hours per semester.

The federal Pell Grant program, signed into law in 1965, is one of the largest sources of financial aid available to college students. More than 6 million undergraduate students received the grants in 2020. The maximum Pell Grant award is $7,395 for the 2025-26 award year.

Meanwhile, the grants would be expanded for short-term workforce training programs.

Amazon said Tuesday it considered displaying import charges on items sold via its site for ultra-discount items, but that the plan "was never approved and not going to happen."

The move would have affected items sold on Haul, Amazon's answer to Chinese discount retailer Temu, which offers apparel, home goods and other items priced at $20 or less. Haul, which Amazon launched last year, is separate from its main storefront.

"The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products," Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. "This was never approved and is not going to happen."

Amazon weighed adding a separate line item to products on Haul in response to Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole, according to a source familiar with the matter. The consideration was not related to Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China, they added.

Punchbowl News reported earlier on Tuesday that Amazon would "soon" begin displaying the cost of tariffs alongside the price of each product, citing a source familiar with the company's plans.

The report drew the ire of the White House, which called Amazon's reported plans a "hostile and political act."

"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asked.

After Amazon clarified its statement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in an X post called it a "good move."

Trump personally called Jeff Bezos Tuesday morning to express his displeasure about the Punchbowl report that spurred the heated response from the White House, a source familiar with the call told NBC News.

Bezos, Amazon's founder and top shareholder, has tried to establish a friendly rapport with President Donald Trump in the lead up to and during Trump's second term in office. Bezos dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and stood alongside top tech executives at Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Amazon, for its part, donated to Trump's inaugural fund, and spent a reported $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump.

Amazon and other retailers are digesting the impact of Trump's new tariffs. Earlier this month, Amazon began reaching out to its vast network of third-party sellers to gauge how the tariffs are impacting their logistics, product sourcing and operations. Some sellers have already raised prices and cut back on advertising spend as they confront higher import costs. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC sellers would likely "need to pass that cost" of tariffs on to consumers.

Discount e-tailers Temu and Shein last week implemented price hikes across most items on their sites, and Temu has added "import charges" ranging between 130% and 150% on some products.

The White House on Tuesday slammed Amazon for reportedly planning to display the cost of President Donald Trump's tariffs next to the total price of products on its site.

"This is a hostile and political act by Amazon," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?" Leavitt asked.

She added, "This is another reason why Americans should buy American."

Shares of the online retail giant founded by Jeff Bezos dropped more than 2% in premarket trading immediately following the remarks. By noon, the stock had recovered its losses.

Less than two hours after the press briefing, an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that the company was only ever considering listing tariff charges on some products for Amazon Haul, its budget-focused shopping section.

"The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered listing import charges on certain products," the spokesperson said. "This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties."

But in a follow-up statement an hour after that one, the spokesperson clarified that the plan to show tariff surcharges was "never approved" and is "not going to happen."

Trump personally called Bezos on Tuesday morning to express his displeasure about the initial report that spurred the heated response from the White House, a source familiar with the call told NBC News.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in an X post called Amazon's statement a "good move."

The Trump administration's aggression stemmed from Punchbowl News' report earlier Tuesday that Amazon will soon show consumers how much of an item's cost comes from tariffs.

The amount added as a result of tariffs will be displayed right next to each product's total listed price, a person familiar with the plan told the news outlet.

A journalist in Tuesday's press briefing asked Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if they agreed that the reported move was a "crystal-clear demonstration that it's the American consumer, and not China, who is going to have to pay for these policies."

Leavitt opted to respond because, she said, she "just got off the phone with the president about Amazon's announcement."

Leavitt also said the company's decision was "not a surprise," saying Reuters "recently" wrote that Amazon has "partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm."

She held up a print-out of a Reuters report from December 2021 that Amazon complied with an edict from Beijing's government that it remove customer reviews and ratings from a book of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speeches and writings.

Amazon is not the first retailer to put a spotlight on how new tariffs are changing its prices.

China-based fast fashion giants Shein and Temu have both added massive surcharges in recent days. Temu now includes a line on its checkout tally showing an "import charge" that adds around 145% for each item.

Leavitt's response could signal an emerging rift between Trump and Bezos, who has joined other billionaires and tech leaders in cozying up to the Republican president since he won the 2024 election.

After frequently catching Trump's ire in years past, Bezos in December expressed optimism about the Republican's second term, saying he believes Trump has grown calmer and more confident. 

The same month, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Bezos later attended Trump's inauguration.

Bezos drew further accusations of seeking to court Trump when he forced the Washington Post, which he owns, to restrict its opinion section to publishing only pieces in defense of "personal liberties and free markets."

But Amazon's business has come under strain in the face of Trump's sweeping tariffs plans — especially his 145% duty on China, where up to 70% of Amazon goods are sourced, according to Wedbush Securities.

As Amazon merchants have started hiking prices on a wide array of goods in response to the tariffs, the company has started emailing the sellers to gauge the impact of Trump's agenda.

Leavitt, after delivering her statement on Amazon, was asked if Bezos is "still a Trump supporter."

"Look, I will not speak to the president's relationships with Jeff Bezos, but I will tell you that this is certainly a hostile and political action by Amazon," she said.

Novo Nordisk on Tuesday said it will offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through telehealth providers Hims & Hers Health, Ro and LifeMD to expand access to the blockbuster treatment now that it is no longer in short supply in the U.S. 

Shares of Hims & Hers soared 18% on Tuesday, while Novo Nordisk's stock rose 3%.

The Danish drugmaker is racing to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. Patients flocked to those compounded versions while Wegovy was in shortage due to skyrocketing demand. 

"We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down," Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, told CNBC. 

"We're really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine," he said. 

Moore added that the new partnerships make the experience "seamless" for patients since it allows them to access Wegovy straight from their telehealth providers, which "makes it very easy" for them to get the drug shipped directly to their homes. 

Patients will be able to access Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, directly through the telehealth providers. 

That pharmacy offers Wegovy for $499 in cash per month – roughly half its usual monthly list price  – for patients without insurance coverage for the weekly injection. 

Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNBC. 

Hims & Hers said it will begin offering all dose sizes of Wegovy along with access to 24/7 care, nutritional guidance and ongoing clinical support this week, starting at $599 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with a prescription. 

The medication will cost Hims & Hers customers more since it comes with added access to care, the company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, told CNBC in an interview. He said he thinks the company's partnership with Novo Nordisk will serve as a case study for how patients get access to and get prices for "great medicine" and other forms of treatment. 

Ro opted for the lower price, announcing Tuesday it will offer access to all doses of Wegovy for $499 per month. The company provides 24/7 messaging, one-on-one coaching, educational content and more through its monthly membership called the Body Program, which does not include the cost of medication.

"Adding Novo Nordisk's FDA-approved treatments at the best available cash price will help more patients nationwide get the obesity care they need to achieve their goals, particularly those without insurance coverage," Ro CEO Zach Reitano said in a release.

Earlier this month, Hims & Hers announced that patients could access Eli Lilly's weight loss medication Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro, as well as the generic injection liraglutide, through its platform. But unlike the company's collaboration with Novo Nordisk, Lilly released a statement clarifying that it has "no affiliation" with Hims & Hers.

Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's diabetes drug Ozempic and Wegovy, in May of 2024. The company has largely had to stop offering the compounded medications en masse, but some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable, Dudum said. 

"That was one of the first things we shared with Novo is that we will always fight on behalf of what consumers we believe have the right to get," Dudum said. "The regulation is very clear." 

During Food and Drug Administration-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug. 

But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs. 

Larger, federally regulated compounding pharmacies that make copies of semaglutide in bulk without prescriptions face a legal deadline of May 22 to stop marketing and selling those versions. Smaller, state-licensed compounding pharmacies that manufacture semaglutide copycats for individual prescriptions had a deadline of April 22.  

"The spirit of this is that we stay true to what the rules are," Moore said. "That's the best way for us to serve patients."

UPS plans to slash 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting drive amid the shifting global trade landscape triggered by President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The move comes as the shipping giant grapples with soft demand, especially from its largest customers. UPS said it would also look to close 73 facilities by the end of June.

"With our action, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS," the company's CEO, Carol Tomé, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Tomé said that the transformation would help UPS adapt to "a changing trade environment" and better position it for long-term growth.

The company said it would save $3.5 billion in 2025 through the cuts.

UPS made the announcement alongside its first-quarter 2025 earnings report, which showed a slight revenue dip to $21.5 billion — down 0.7% from the same period last year — while its adjusted operating profit inched up 0.9% to $1.7 billion.

The parcel giant also pulled its financial guidance for the year, saying that uncertainty around the impact of Trump's tariffs meant it could not provide forecasts.

"Given the current macro-economic uncertainty, the company is not providing any updates to its previously issued consolidated full-year outlook," the company said.

Its supply chain business suffered the most last quarter, with revenue plunging nearly 15%, primarily due to the divestiture of Coyote Logistics.

The cost-cutting drive comes after UPS told investors earlier this year it would reduce its Amazon business by 50% by mid-2026, citing profitability reasons.

"This was not their ask," Tomé said on an investor call in January. "This was us. This was UPS taking control of our destiny."

On Tuesday, UPS said the restructuring could expand depending on further network review. In the first quarter, it said it made $80 million in savings and booked $23 million in related costs.

United Parcel Service's first-quarter profit beat market estimates and the parcel delivery giant said it will cut 20,000 jobs to lower costs in an uncertain economy and in anticipation of weak volumes from its largest customer, Amazon.

Shares of the company rose nearly 2% before the bell on Tuesday after it said it expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 from job cuts and by shutting 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June.

Extensive tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump have slowed down trade and led companies to reduce costs in anticipation of a demand hit. For parcel delivery firms, the slowdown is likely to reduce the need for shipping services between companies.

"The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tome said.

UPS said it was not providing any updates to its full-year outlook due to the economic uncertainty, even as it lowers costs through job cuts, warehouse closures, increased automation and asset sales.

"The removal of 2025 guidance will likely create a wide range of outcomes that may be difficult to underwrite without greater macro clarity," Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell said.

The company last year said it cut its workforce by 12,000 jobs. It expects expenses between $400 million to $600 million during 2025, related to separation benefits and lease-related costs.

The Atlanta-based parcel delivery firm in January warned that it was accelerating its plan to slash millions of deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com, which accounted for 11.8% of its overall revenue in 2024.

UPS also faces a sharp downturn in volume from China-linked bargain e-commerce sellers Temu PDD.O and Shein after the U.S. decided that starting May 2, it will collect tariffs on goods that were duty-free up to $800 per individual sale.

UPS' first-quarter revenue fell marginally to $21.5 billion but beat Wall Street expectations of $21.05 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Its U.S. domestic segment revenue grew 1.4% to $14.46 billion in the first quarter, driven by an increase in air cargo and improving revenue per piece, even as volumes declined.

UPS posted an adjusted profit per share of $1.49 compared with expectations of $1.38.

The world's largest package delivery firm had in January forecast full-year revenue of $89 billion and an operating margin of about 10.8%.

Sportswear giant Adidas on Tuesday said that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs would result in price hikes for all its U.S. products.

The company said it did not yet know by how much it would boost prices, also noting that the global trade dispute was preventing it from raising its full-year outlook despite a bumper increase in first-quarter profits.

"Higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market," Adidas said in a statement.

The company said it was "somewhat exposed" to White House tariffs on Beijing — currently at an effective rate of 145% — but that it had already reduced exports of its China-made products to the U.S. to a minimum. However, it said the biggest impact was coming from the general increase in U.S. tariffs on all other countries, which are largely held at 10% while trade negotiations take place.

"Given the uncertainty around the negotiations between the US and the different exporting countries, we do not know what the final tariffs will be," the Adidas statement continued.

"Therefore, we cannot make any 'final' decisions on what to do. Cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases, not only in our sector, but it is currently impossible to quantify these or to conclude what impact this could have on the consumer demand for our products."

Adidas said it was currently unable to produce almost any of its products in the U.S.

The company, best-known for sneakers including Superstar, Sambas, Stan Smiths and Gazelles as well as sportswear, uses factories in countries including Vietnam and Cambodia — which are facing U.S. tariffs upwards of 40% in the absence of a trade deal.

A similar dilemma regarding price hikes and demand impact is facing almost all retail businesses which serve the U.S., from ultra-low-cost e-retailers like Temu to luxury giants such as Hermès.

Without the cloud of U.S. tariffs, Adidas would have raised its full-year outlook for revenues and operating profit due to a strong order book and positive brand sentiment, the company said. It instead reaffirmed its existing outlook, but said the "range of possible outcomes has increased."

In results that were largely pre-released, net income from continuing operations leapt 155% in the first quarter to 436 million euros ($496.5 million), above the 383 million euros forecast in an LSEG-compiled consensus. Net sales climbed 12.7% to 6.15 billion euros as its operating margin rose 3.8 percentage points to 9.9%.

The firm has finally shaken off a years-long headache from its collaboration with controversial musician Ye, with whom it cut ties in 2022 over antisemitic comments. It announced last month it had sold the last of its Yeezy stock.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a Tuesday note that Adidas delivered a "good print with the company making progress across all areas," despite higher uncertainty.

"So far this year, Adidas has been seeing double digit sales growth across all regions and channels, with wholesale outperforming the direct-to-consumer offering," Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said in a note.

"Footwear continues to be a strong performer, with consumers also opting for lifestyle clothing, while the performance category also continues to do well. Adidas will hope these trends continue in the face of the economic uncertainty created by tariffs in the US, but unfortunately we very much have to wait and see before the full impact comes through."

Alibaba released the next generation of its open-sourced large language models, Qwen3, on Tuesday — and experts are calling it yet another breakthrough in China's booming open-source artificial intelligence space.

In a blog post, the Chinese tech giant said Qwen3 promises improvements in reasoning, instruction following, tool usage and multilingual tasks, rivaling other top-tier models such as DeepSeek's R1 in several industry benchmarks. 

The LLM series includes eight variations that span a range of architectures and sizes, offering developers flexibility when using Qwen to build AI applications for edge devices like mobile phones.

Qwen3 is also Alibaba's debut into so-called "hybrid reasoning models," which it says combines traditional LLM capabilities with "advanced, dynamic reasoning."

According to Alibaba, such models can seamlessly transition between a "thinking mode" for complex tasks such as coding and a "non-thinking mode" for faster, general-purpose responses. 

"Notably, the Qwen3-235B-A22B MoE model significantly lowers deployment costs compared to other state-of-the-art models, reinforcing Alibaba's commitment to accessible, high-performance AI," Alibaba said. 

The new models are already freely available for individual users on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub, as well as Alibaba Cloud's web interface. Qwen3 is also being used to power Alibaba's AI assistant, Quark.

AI analysts told CNBC that the Qwen3 represents a serious challenge to Alibaba's counterparts in China, as well as industry leaders in the U.S.  

In a statement to CNBC, Wei Sun, principal analyst of artificial intelligence at Counterpoint Research, said the Qwen3 series is a "significant breakthrough—not just for its best-in-class performance" but also for several features that point to the "application potential of the models." 

Those features include Qwen3's hybrid thinking mode, its multilingual support covering 119 languages and dialects and its open-source availability, Sun added.

Open-source software generally refers to software in which the source code is made freely available on the web for possible modification and redistribution. At the start of this year, DeepSeek's open-sourced R1 model rocked the AI world and quickly became a catalyst for China's AI space and open-source model adoption.  

"Alibaba's release of the Qwen 3 series further underscores the strong capabilities of Chinese labs to develop highly competitive, innovative, and open-source models, despite mounting pressure from tightened U.S. export controls," said Ray Wang, a Washington-based analyst focusing on U.S.-China economic and technology competition.

According to Alibaba, Qwen has already become one of the world's most widely adopted open-source AI model series, attracting over 300 million downloads worldwide and more than 100,000 derivative models on Hugging Face. 

Wang said that this adoption could continue with Qwen3, adding that its performance claims may make it the best open-source model globally — though still behind the world's most cutting-edge models like OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini.  

Chinese competitors like Baidu have also rushed to release new AI models after the emergence of DeepSeek, including making plans to shift toward a more open-source business model. 

Meanwhile, Reuters reported in February that DeepSeek is accelerating the launch of its successor to its R1, citing anonymous sources.

"In the broader context of the U.S.-China AI race, the gap between American and Chinese labs has narrowed—likely to a few months, and some might argue, even to just weeks," Wang said. 

"With the latest release of Qwen 3 and the upcoming launch of DeepSeek's R2, this gap is unlikely to widen—and may even continue to shrink."

Tariffs unleashed — and temporarily, almost capriciously, paused — by U.S. President Donald Trump have given governments across the world a headache as they figure out how to minimize disruptions to their economies. But the U.S. consumer, ironically, could be the real victim of tariffs.

During the weekend, Temu, a Chinese e-tailer known for offering wallet-friendly items, hiked prices, citing "import charges." Analysis by CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Annie Palmer found that those fees can cost more than the items themselves and eventually double the price of a typical order.

Something worse than price increases is when daily necessities are unavailable for purchase. Some U.S. stores could see empty shelves in a few weeks as the impact of tariffs on China begins filtering into the economy, according to asset management firm Apollo.

It's true that China exports far more to the U.S. than it imports from the country, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out. But the implication of that trade relationship is that the U.S. consumer has more to lose when China's exports slow to a trickle.

Stocks globally register mild risesU.S. stocks traded mixed Monday. The S&P 500 was up a marginal 0.06% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28%. The Nasdaq Composite, however, slipped 0.1%. Asia-Pacific markets mostly inched up Tuesday. South Korea's Kospi index added roughly 0.4%. The country's auto stocks rose on news that the Trump administration will reduce some import duties for automakers.

European banks beat estimatesHSBC announced on Tuesday first-quarter results that beat expectations. Profit before tax of Europe's largest lender soared nearly 317% from the previous quarter to $9.48 billion. HSBC also announced a $3 billion share buyback. Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC rose 1.7%. The same day, Deutsche Bank posted a better-than-expected net profit of 1.775 billion euros ($2.019 billion) for its first quarter. The figure is 39% higher than the same period a year earlier and the bank's "best quarterly profit for fourteen years," said Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing.

China-U.S. trade war still simmeringChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference Monday that Beijing isn't in talks with the U.S. over a tariff deal, and he isn't aware of Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking with U.S. President Donald Trump, contrary to what the latter has claimed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday told CNBC that "it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them."

Tariffs drive Temu to hikes pricesChinese e-tailer Temu has started adding "import charges" of about 145% in response to Trump tariffs. The fees, which apply to U.S. customers and kicked in the weekend after price hikes went into effect on Friday, could be higher than a product's cost. "Items imported into the U.S. may be subject to import charges," Temu wrote on its website. 

$150 billion investment by IBMIBM on Monday announced it will invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers. Separately, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote Monday that the U.S. "cannot afford to fall behind" China in the race to design and manufacture a working quantum computer.

Canada's Liberal Party projected to win electionCanada Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win the country's national election, although it is too early to determine if the party will garner enough seats to form a majority government, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. That means Carney will remain as prime minister of the country. The victory of the Liberals in the polls is due, in part, to Trump's aggressive rhetoric toward Canada, which caused public sentiment of the Conservative Party to dip.

[PRO] Earnings expectations this weekThe busiest week of the earnings season is here — more than 160 S&P 500 constituents are slated to report, including Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Investors will be looking for guidance on how tariffs could impact those companies' bottom lines. Take a look at CNBC Pro's breakdown of what's expected from this week's key reports.

The worst (and best) stocks during Trump's tough first 100 days

Some stocks have made major swings in the days since Trump returned to the White House.

He has put U.S. investors on alert with market-moving plans such as tariffs and federal government spending cuts. The S&P 500 is slated to record its worst first 100 days of a presidency since Richard Nixon's second tenure in the 1970s.

Underneath the hood, some names are seeing outsized moves. CNBC screened the S&P 500 to see which stocks have performed the best and worst since Trump came back to the Oval Office in January.

British oil giant BP on Tuesday posted slightly weaker-than-expected first-quarter net profit, following a recent strategic reset and a slump in crude prices.

The beleaguered oil and gas major posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.38 billion for the first three months of the year. That missed analyst expectations of $1.6 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.

BP's net profit had hit $2.7 billion a year earlier and $1.2 billion in the final three months of 2024.

The results come as the energy major faces fresh pressure from activist investors less than two months after announcing a strategic reset.

Seeking to rebuild investor confidence, BP in February pledged to slash renewable spending and boost annual expenditure on its core business of oil and gas.

BP CEO Murray Auchincloss told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Tuesday that the firm was "off to a great start" in delivering on its strategic reset.

"We had a great operational quarter. We had our highest upstream operating efficiency in history. Our refineries in the first quarter ran at the best they've run in 24 years. We had six exploration discoveries in a row, which is really unusual and we started out three major projects," Auchincloss said.

For the first quarter, BP announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8 cents and a share buyback of $750 million.

Net debt rose to $26.97 billion in the January-March period, up from $22.99 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. BP had previously warned of lower reported upstream production and higher net debt in the first quarter, when compared to the final three months of last year.

Shares of BP fell 2.8% at around 1:35 p.m. London time, paring some of its earlier losses.

BP's green strategy U-turn does not appear to have gone far enough for the likes of activist investor Elliott Management, which went public last week with a stake of more than 5% in the London-listed firm.

The disclosure makes the U.S. hedge fund BP's second-largest shareholder after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, according to LSEG data.

Elliott was first reported to have assumed a position in the oil and gas company back in February, driving a share price rally amid expectations that its involvement could pressure BP to shift gears back toward its oil and gas businesses.

BP's Auchincloss declined to comment on interactions with investors when asked whether the firm was under pressure from the likes of Elliott to go beyond the plans announced in its February pivot.

Notably, BP suffered a shareholder rebellion at its annual general meeting earlier this month. Almost a quarter (24.3%) of investors voted against the re-election of outgoing Chair Helge Lund, a symbolic result that reflected a sense of deep frustration among the firm's shareholders.

Mark van Baal, founder of Dutch activist investor Follow This, told CNBC last week that he hoped the shareholder revolt means Amanda Blanc, who is leading the process to find Lund's successor, will look for a new chair who is "climate competent" and "will not respond to short-term activists so quickly."

Lund is expected to step down from his role next year.

BP's underperformance relative to industry peers such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell has thrust the energy major into the spotlight as a prime takeover candidate. Energy analysts have questioned, however, whether any of the likeliest suitors will rise to the occasion.

BP's Auchincloss on Tuesday said that he wouldn't speculate on whether the company is a takeover target, but confirmed the oil major had not asked for any sort of protection from the British government.

"What I will say is we're a strong, independent company and we've got sector-leading growth. And if we can deliver the sector-leading growth, and the first quarter is a fantastic example of that, then I have no concerns. I think we're going to do great," Auchincloss said.

Oil prices have fallen in recent months on demand fears. International benchmark Brent crude futures with June delivery traded at $65.19 per barrel on Tuesday morning, down more than 1% for the session. That's lower from around $84 per barrel a year ago.

Asked whether weaker crude prices could put the some of the firm's reset plans in jeopardy, Auchincloss said, "Not really. We have a balance of products that we think about that generate revenue for us. So, oil, natural gas and refined products as well."

Sweden-based automaker Volvo Cars on Tuesday announced cost-cutting plans of 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.87 billion) and withdrew financial guidance as its operating profit fell sharply in the first three months of the year.

Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, reported first-quarter operating profit of 1.9 billion kronor, down from 4.7 billion kronor in the same period last year.

Its margin on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) narrowed to 2.3% from 5% a year earlier, while revenue fell to 82.9 billion kronor in the first quarter, down from 93.9 billion kronor in the same period of 2024.

The company said the results reflect a drop in wholesales as part of a planned inventory reduction during the final three months of 2024, adverse currency effects and broader automotive industry turbulence.

Volvo Cars said its so-called "cost and cash action plan" would include reductions in investments and redundancies at its operations across the globe. The company did not provide further information on the potential scale of the layoffs but said it would update with "more details as soon as possible."

Volvo Cars said it is no longer providing financial guidance for both 2025 and 2026, citing tariff pressure on the automotive sector.

"There is a rather heavy headwind on the market," Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" in a Tuesday interview.

"There is a volume drop, and on top of that also price competition, new players in the electric segment, especially, but also influencing the prices generally. And on top of that you have the turbulence now with additional tariffs, so all of that makes it very difficult to predict the future."

Samuelsson added that the company was focusing on what it can control via the cost action package.

Shares of Volvo Cars fell as much as 10% on Tuesday, before paring some of its losses. The firm was last seen trading 8.1% lower at around 1:50 p.m. London time.

In its earnings report, the company said it would sharpen its U.S. product line-up to focus on growth and explore how it could "better use" its existing manufacturing footprint in the coming years, in order to produce "more cars where they are sold."

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on cars imported to the U.S. earlier this month. The White House has said it also plans to place tariffs on some auto parts such as engines and transmissions, which are set to take effect no later than May 3.

"We see long-term, we need, of course, to come back to some kind of trade deal with the U.S. Otherwise, this is of course going to be very difficult for the business in the U.S.," Samuelsson said.

Alongside making more cars locally, Samuelsson said the automaker is exploring how it can utitilize its South Carolina factory more effectively.

"We are looking into utilizing our Charleston factory better. So, we need another car into that factory and that has to be a best-seller for the U.S. market. It's something that we otherwise need to import and pay tariffs for. So, that's really the countermeasures we are taking," Samuelsson said.

Volvo Cars' sales share of "electrified cars," which it defines as any vehicle with a charging cord, hit 43% in the first quarter. It aims for the category to represent 90% to 100% of its global sales volume by 2030.

 Bitcoin price goes on a near-parabolic rally everytime these two events happen. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors' inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

Significant Bitcoin rallies occur when US Federal Reserve policy expectations ease, crypto market leverage is low, and strong retail data supports bullish momentum. The last occurrence of these three events saw Bitcoin's price climb from $40,000 to $73,500 in seven weeks in early 2024.

Comparable gains were recorded in early 2023, when the same three drivers aligned, propelling Bitcoin from $16,700 to $25,100 over seven weeks. A third example dates back to July 2021, culminating in a 76% price increase.

After stagnating near $43,000 in December 2023, Bitcoin's price tested the $48,000 level in early January 2024. The failed breakout was followed by a sharp drop to $37,800 by late January, just as a seven-week bullish trend began. A crucial factor at this stage was the exceptionally low perpetual futures funding rate, sitting at 4% per year.

Other factors impacting the price reversal was US retail sales data for December 2023, released on Jan. 17, 2024, exceeded expectations, rising 0.6% month-over-month compared to the 0.4% forecast and US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jan. 31, 2024 press conference that, signaled a tighter monetary stance, with no immediate interest rate cuts in sight.

Prior to this rally, Bitcoin had consolidated below $18,000 for two months, resulting in minimal demand for leveraged long positions, as reflected by a near-zero perpetual futures funding rate.

The landscape shifted on Jan. 3, 2023, when the funding rate on Binance surged to 50% within four days. This coincided with stronger-than-expected retail sales data for January 2023, which rose 3% month-over-month, outpacing the 1.9% consensus. Notably, Fed Chair Powell also suggested a tighter monetary policy to combat inflation during his speech at Sveriges Riksbank on Jan. 10, 2023.

From July 20, 2021, to Sept. 7, 2021, Bitcoin gained 76%. Bitcoin's price had dropped from $40,000 to below $30,000 over the preceding month, dampening market sentiment. Suddenly, the annualized Bitcoin funding rate jumped from 0% to 37% in two weeks, while US retail sales data for June 2021 surprised economists by increasing 0.6%, even though consensus had predicted a 0.4% decline.

During this period, Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Aug. 27, 2021, indicated a potential reduction in central bank asset purchases, which was a move aimed at curbing inflation.

The common thread linking these significant rallies is a reduction in expectations for expansionary Federal Reserve policy and initially low leverage demand from Bitcoin bulls. When these factors coincide with robust retail data, they create ideal conditions for a Bitcoin bull run, as traders tend to remain cautious ahead of possible economic downturns.

Looking ahead, Fed Chair Powell is set to speak on June 18 following the central bank's interest rate decision. Additional key dates include the Beige Book release on July 16 and the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium starting Aug. 21. Monitoring US retail sales data for May, due June 17, and for June, due July 15, will also be important.

 Analysis from Fidelity Digital Assets says that multiple onchain metrics point to ETH price bottoming and being undervalued. 

Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets' report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.

The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin's favor. 

The investment firm pointed out that the MVRV Z-Score, which compares market value to realized value, dropped to -0.18, entering the "undervalued" zone on March 9. Historically, such levels have marked market bottoms, indicating that Ether “was looking cheap” compared to its “fair value.” The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio also fell to 0, indicating "capitulation," where unrealized profits equal losses, citing a neutral spot for holders. 

ETH's realized price, averaging $2,020, sits 10% above its current value, showing holders face unrealized losses. While this trend is bearish, the firm noted that a minor 3% drop in realized price versus a 45% decline suggests short-term holders sold off, while long-term holders held firm, possibly stabilizing the base price. 

However, the company highlighted that in 2022, despite ETH price dipping below the realized price, it continued to decline further before recovery. 

Fidelity also cited Ethereum's market cap ratio to Bitcoin at 0.13, sitting at mid-2020 levels, and in a decline for 30 months.

Data from growthepie.xyz indicated that the number of unique addresses interacting with one or two layer 2 networks in the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new all-time high of 13.6 million active addresses. The rate of active addresses is up 74% over the past week, implying the network's scalability prowess and growing adoption. 

Unichain, a new layer-2 protocol by Uniswap, led the charge with over 5.82 million weekly active addresses, surpassing Base and Arbitrum. The collective increase in active addresses improved Ethereum's layer-2 dominance by 58.74% in the past seven days. 

Anonymous crypto trader CRG noted that ETH price recovered a position above the 12-hour Ichimoku cloud indicator for the first time since December 2024. The Ichimoku Cloud indicates an uptrend when the price is above the cloud and the cloud turns green, indicating bullish sentiment.

Nike is being hit with a class action lawsuit demanding over $5 million in damages after shutting down its Web3 NFT platform  RTFKT in January.


	A group of RTFKT users filed the lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York on April 25, claiming that they suffered “significant damages” after Nike touted its sneaker-themed NFTs to win investors, before pulling the plug on the platform.Founded in 2020, RTFKT offered shoes and collectibles that could be used by various avatars and applications in the metaverse. Nike acquired the company at the end of 2021 in a bid to tap into RTKFT's user base—as well as its expertise in blockchain and augmented reality technologies.The lawsuit argues that the NFTs sold by Nike were unregistered securities, because the sports giant sold them without registering with the US's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The plaintiffs accuse Nike of using “its iconic brand and marketing prowess to hype, promote, and prop up the unregistered securities that RTFKT sold,” as outlined in the lawsuit. They further claim that they would not have bought the NFTs had they known that they were “unregistered securities.”“Because the Nike NFTs derived their value from the success of a given promoter and project—here, Nike and its marketing efforts—investors purchased this digital asset with the hope that its value would increase in the future as the project grows in popularity based in the Nike brand,” the complaint reads.The lawsuit argues that Nike broke consumer protection laws and violated several states' unfair trade and competition legislation when it closed the platform. It adds that the court doesn't need to weigh in on the legal status of NFTs to address the complaint.Whether or not NFTs are in fact securities is a hotly debated issue in a murky, unregulated environment. A US court has yet to rule on the matter, but in 2023, the SEC entered into a settlement with media company Impact Theory, finding that the firm's NFTs were securities—and as a result, determining that Impact Theory had engaged in an unregistered security offering. This the SEC's first case in the NFT arena.

	Last year, Dapper Labs, the makers of the NBA Top Shot NFTs, settled a case with investors who alleged that Dapper's NFTs were unregistered securities, for $4 million. In that case, a Southern District of New York judge determined that NFTs could be considered as securities under the “Howey test,” a legal framework established by the Supreme Court to classify securities. However, Dapper settled before a final determination was made by the court.One of the largest NFT marketplaces, OpenSea, wrote a letter to the SEC on April 9 demanding it to remove NFTs from federal securities law arguing that they don't meet the legal status of a security.

	











	Nike has yet to comment on the lawsuit.

Bitcoin closes higher but fails to break out

BTC closed yesterday at $95,630—its highest daily close yet—but still below the $95,000 resistance level that has acted as a ceiling since early April. This marks four previous pierces and now a fifth attempt to clear this key level. While OBV and RSI remain constructive, daily Volume continues to decline, falling under the yellow moving average at $2.1B. BTC has now spent a full week above the daily TBO Cloud, reinforcing the current bullish structure. However, the pullback risk remains elevated if BTC continues to stall.

On the 4-hour timeframe, bearish signals are appearing, including a growing number of TBT Bearish Divergence alerts. These haven't been confirmed by a TBO Close Long yet, but they are early signs of trend fatigue. A decisive close above $95K is still the main trigger to extend momentum toward $100K.



BTC.D shows weakness as OTHERS.D flashes breakout potential

Bitcoin Dominance is flashing its first TBT Bearish Divergence Cluster on the daily chart in weeks, with daily RSI also trending lower. This is the earliest warning that BTC may begin underperforming versus the broader altcoin market. At the same time, OTHERS.D printed a second TBO Close Short, which is often a precursor to a major move. The last time two appeared in close proximity, OTHERS.D rallied 35% in just under three weeks. Still, the risk of a whipsaw move remains if stablecoin dominance, which just printed a TBO Open Short, flips bullish.

The situation is becoming more nuanced. The crypto market might be setting up for a divergence between BTC and OTHERS. However, if BTC corrects while stablecoin dominance rises, it could suppress altcoin gains even with strong reversal signals.

Market structure holds but sentiment starts to weaken

TOTAL and TOTAL3 are still in bullish structure, with TOTAL3 in progress of printing a TBO Open Long. OTHERS continues to flirt with long-term overhead resistance and has now pierced it five days in a row without closing above. OBV continues rising, but daily RSI is struggling to post higher highs. BVOL7D is slowly falling again toward its Bounce Zone, signaling low volatility—a pattern last seen before the big Q4 2024 rally.

Altcoins push forward with mixed signals across the board

Ethereum continues to build a base inside the TBO Cloud with slightly improving RSI and OBV, but volume remains unimpressive. XRP is approaching the top of its Cloud, while BNB holds just above resistance but with no strong follow-through. SOL has flashed TBO Close Longs on the 4-hour chart, which could signal a short-term pullback before resuming higher.

LINK remains in a confused state with rising OBV but lower highs on RSI and resistance just overhead. SUI, which recently surged, is now showing TBT Bearish Divergence on the 4-hour. OM printed three TBT Bullish Divergence Clusters—an aggressive reversal setup. HYPE, XMR, ONDO, and MNT are all in various phases of recovery, with some now printing TBO Open Longs.

Further down the list, coins like POL, ALGO, XDC, and IOTA are printing strong continuation signals with clean follow-through, while FLOKI, KAVA, WIF, RUNE, CORE, and GIGA are joining the growing list of coins showing real upside potential.

Conclusion

BTC remains the dominant force, but short-term weakness near $95K could spark a sharp pullback. If that happens, the Multiple Factor Effect could hit altcoins harder than BTC. However, dominance is slowly shifting, and reversal signals are stacking up across the altcoin sector. Traders should remain flexible—take partial profits and manage exposure—but also watch for confirmation of rotation from BTC into altcoins as the next big move.

Eric Trump, VP of the Trump Organization, has confirmed that crypto assets will be accepted for real estate transactions at the company's newly announced luxury development in Dubai. 

This $1 billion project is under development in collaboration with the London-listed Dar Global. It marks a significant move into the Middle East for the Trump brand and an institutional embrace of crypto asset payments in high-end real estate.

The development will include a Trump-branded hotel, residential units, two ultra-luxury penthouses priced at Dh75 million (approximately $20.4 million), and a private clubhouse. It is located at the entrance of Downtown Dubai on Sheikh Zayed Road. Notably, the project is scheduled for completion in five years.

Eric Trump's statement reflects the company's recognition of evolving buyer preferences. By accepting crypto, the Trump Organization is catering to a growing class of crypto-native investors and high-net-worth individuals seeking to diversify their holdings into hard assets like premium real estate.

Moreover, accepting crypto in this real estate venture further deepens the Trump family's ties with technology. Initially a vocal critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, President Donald Trump has since shifted his stance to become one of the most prominent advocates for crypto.

As president, he signed executive orders to establish Bitcoin reserves and to position the U.S. as the leading market for crypto technology.

Meanwhile, the latest announcement aligns with Dubai's positioning as a hub for real estate and crypto innovation. With favorable regulations and increasing global appeal, the city continues to attract capital from across Europe, Asia, and Africa.

According to Knight Frank, Dubai saw 111 property sales above $10 million in Q1 2025, totaling $1.9 billion, and welcomed 7,200 new millionaires in 2024 alone. This contributed to the UAE's total of 130,500 dollar millionaires.

This development aligns with a broader trend of traditional industries intersecting with the crypto economy.

In 2023, The Crypto Basic reported that Bahrain-based real estate developer Bin Faqeeh began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for property purchases via Binance Pay. 

This move reflects growing crypto adoption in the real estate sector, following similar actions by companies like Condos.com and Pacaso.

Earlier this month, Lomond School in Scotland became the first UK educational institution to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments. This further highlights the growing trend of crypto payments in traditional sectors.

The investing behavior in cryptocurrency is often speculative and hypes an investment, but long-term investors still ride out the volatility. One of these investors bought into Ethereum (ETH) during its initial coin offering (ICO) at 31 cents.  This investor has always believed that blockchain technology would change industries. Regardless of Ethereum's ups and downs, this investor continues to reap massive returns. However, now there is another rising altcoin in focus: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance has become an attractive opportunity to some investors as it has potential alongside Ethereum, the market leader. Ethereum faces increasing competition from new platforms and Layer-2 solutions, which is directly impacting its trajectory. Ethereum does retain its long-term value proposition, especially when compared to projects like Rexas Finance, which seeks attention for innovative strategies focusing on real-world asset tokenization.

Ethereum's ICO came in 2014, with the Ethereum price set at $0.31. Early investors made a killing as the price grew through the years. The peak Ethereum price of $4,864 in 2021 and the current 2025 position of above $2,700 show Ethereum strengthening its position as a crypto powerhouse, enabling dApps and providing support for decentralized finance (DeFi). Looking at Ethereum's success, the network is facing some competition. The emergence of competitors such as Solana and Polkadot began to chip away at Ethereum's dominance. These networks provide quicker transaction times, lower fees, and better scalability. Other layer two solutions like Polygon also started gaining traction and are pulling users from the Ethereum network due to gas fee problems and concerns regarding scalability.

Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new emerging altcoin that is gaining attention from investors looking for some gold rush prospects. While Ethereum has put energy into building the decentralized infrastructure for DeFi and smart contracts, Rexas Finance is concentrating on tokenizing real-world assets. By enabling investment in real-world assets through blockchain technology, Rexas Finance stands out with its innovative approach to crypto. The tokenization of assets, from real estate to art and private equity, can potentially revolutionize entire industries. Rexas Finance allows access to illiquid assets by allowing fractional ownership, enabling investors to access previously locked markets. The ability to tokenize real-world assets dramatically expands the scope of participation, allowing the average Joe to step into high-value markets typically dominated by the ultra-rich.

Rexas Finance is undoubtedly a good investment opportunity for early investors, as its current price is $0.20. They are currently in the presale stage, with 91.76% of their tokens sold. For prospective investors, the presale pricing Rexas Finance offers is excellent value, as it presents the chance of being part of what might turn out to be the next leading blockchain project. Rexas Finance intends to list on one of the major exchanges on June 19, 2025, while also planning to sell at $0.25, which means early investors are looking at a possible 25% increase in value. Unlike Ethereum, which faces stiff competition in the DeFi marketplace, Rexas Finance's focus on tokenizing real-world assets offers much more value. Suppose Rexas Finance solves real-life problems using blockchain services. In that case, they will be able to capture a significant market share in the coming years, making this an attractive option for early investors looking to invest during the presale. With asset tokenization gaining traction in the financial world, it is clear that Rexas Finance will benefit from adopting blockchain technology in other sectors. Tokenized real estate is one example that has the potential to become a market leader, considering the total worth of real estate globally exceeds $280 trillion. Rexas Finance is determined to lead the emerging space of real estate ownership using blockchain technology, which allows the splitting of assets into smaller, more accessible units.

Ethereum's lack of scalability and high fees have hampered its growth, while it remains a frontrunner in the crypto arena. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is working on capturing the growth potential in a rapidly tokenized assets market, which could provide better mid-term returns. Rexas Finance is positioned as a promising new investment for those searching for the “next big thing” in crypto while its token continues to grow in popularity. In Ethereum's case, early investors were evidently able to reap the benefits. However, now, Rexas Finance seems to be the catch for investors waiting on the sidelines, seeking the next innovation in blockchain technology. With a focus on tokenizing real-world assets, a low presale price, and an outlined plan of action, Rexas Finance is targeted for massive growth in 2025 and beyond. For those seeking more significant returns, Rexas Finance is certainly worth following.

Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that altcoins are primed for a bull run following an extended bear winter.

Van de Poppe tells his 784,800 followers on the social media platform X that three tailwinds are pushing crypto prices higher.

At the top of his list is that financial conditions are starting to ease across the world, which he says is highly favorable for risk-on assets such as altcoins and Bitcoin (BTC).

“Liquidity is increasing, and therefore, Bitcoin is expected to go up…

China has started firing up QE (quantitative easing), Europe has lowered the interest rates and we're at the forefront of the US lowering interest rates and expanding the money supply (or easily said: starting doing printer brr again).

That is a heavy trigger for risk-on assets and will likely start pushing Bitcoin towards a new all-time high.” 

Next up, Van de Poppe thinks that investors who benefited from gold's strong rally over the past few months will start to move their capital into crypto after the precious metal printed a local top at $3,500 per ounce.

“The markets have started to peak for gold in the short term. I truly approve that we're in a bull market for risk-off assets and that there are certain windows in between that provide windows for risk-on momentum.

We're on the edge of one. That means a 12-18 month window of risk-on assets to do well as the correlation between a strong gold price and falling altcoins has provided strong data.

Gold has extended massively upwards as the RSI (relative strength index) data has gone into levels not seen since 1980, while ETH has gone so deep that it's on the lowest point ever against Bitcoin on the weekly and monthly data.”

Lastly, Van de Poppe says that historical data suggest that the offshore Chinese Yuan and US dollar ratio (CNH/USD) is tightly correlated to the value of the Ethereum versus Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair.

According to the trader, CNH/USD printed major bottoms in 2016 and 2019, and during those periods, ETH/BTC and the rest of the altcoin markets carved cycle bottoms before sparking huge upside bursts.

Now, Van de Poppe believes that CNH/USD has bottomed out following the “tariff madness,” putting Ethereum and altcoins in a position to finally witness a true bull run.

“Just like liquidity is the key trigger for Bitcoin, that's the risk-on and risk-off appetite for altcoins, which can be provided through charts like the CNH/USD and gold.

The altcoin markets have just witnessed the longest bear market ever, which was four years. The previous longest bear market was in 2016, although that was just 2.5 years…

Macroeconomic tables are turning, and I assume we'll see gold correct, Chinese Renminbi to turn upwards and altcoins to fire off.” 

At time of writing, the ETH/BTC pair is trading for 0.01894 BTC worth $1,798.

EXCLUSIVE — A group of legal veterans with ties to President Donald Trump‘s past litigation have launched a firm located just steps from the White House to capitalize on the growing demand for influence in Washington's fast-expanding cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors.

NexusOne Consulting, a lobbying firm founded by attorney Jeff Ifrah and former Trump lawyer Jim Trusty, opened its doors this week with the goal of helping emerging tech companies navigate, and shape, a fast-evolving regulatory landscape.

“NexusOne was launched to give the crypto, AI, and other emerging tech industries a seat at the table,” Trusty, principal for the consulting firm and one of Trump's former lawyers at Ifrah Law who represented Trump during the early days of his federal criminal cases he faced in 2023, said.

The firm's launch comes as lobbyists with ties to the Trump administration are in high demand. 

Since Trump's return to the White House, crypto and AI companies have ramped up political spending and expanded their Washington operations dramatically.

Companies such as Kraken, Uniswap, Jump Trading, and Riot Platforms are recruiting former administration officials and Capitol Hill staffers to secure influence in a favorable regulatory environment, according to Bloomberg.

“Technology is outpacing policy, and that creates both opportunity and risk,” Ifrah, who has long represented tech clients through his law firm, Ifrah PLLC, said. “There's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the future of tech policy. We're here to make sure innovators don't just react to policy—they influence it.”

NexusOne says it aims to help its clients through a heavy focus on the executive branch, with early lobbying priorities including the Commerce Department, the White House crypto and AI czar's office, and digital policy officials within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The firm also plans to engage selectively with agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We have a team of folks that we sort of lean into for Hill lobbying, but that's not what we're going to primarily be focused on at NexusOne,” Ifrah said, emphasizing the firm's focus on the executive branch.

The firm's leadership team also includes Ross Branson, a former senior Commerce Department official during Trump's first term. 

Its advisory board draws from prominent conservative and Trump-aligned figures, including former Republican Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, former Reagan-era Education Secretary William Bennett, and Wall Street financier Andrew Graves, a major fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital through Curetivity.

Ifrah outlined to the Washington Examiner some of NexusOne's near-term policy targets, many of which fall in line with Trump's already-stated goals in both Big Tech sectors.

On the crypto side, NexusOne plans to advocate creating a federal strategic digital asset reserve, building on efforts already underway in states like Texas.

“There's an interest in establishing the strategic reserve and looking at stablecoin — how this would work and who the players would be,” Ifrah said, adding that developments in these areas could happen by year's end.

On AI, NexusOne plans to push for new takedown mechanisms for AI-generated content, similar to Section 230's notice-and-takedown structure for internet platforms, along with stronger consumer disclosure rules about the use of AI in digital communications. 

“It's very much the data privacy angle,” Ifrah said, adding, “I think that type of legislation is probably short-term. … I would say by the end of the year.”

Political lobbying for Big Tech policies hit a fever pitch during the 2024 election, with the crypto industry spending upward of $133 million on the election and influencing nearly 100 races, according to the lobbying watchdog site FollowtheCrypto.org.

One of the most ambitious tech initiatives announced under Trump's second term is the Stargate project, a sweeping $500 billion private-sector effort aimed at securing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. Backed by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and others, Stargate plans to build massive AI supercomputing infrastructure to compete directly with China's rapidly expanding tech sector. 

Trump has framed the project as a national security imperative, warning that American leadership in AI is critical to preventing China from overtaking the United States in technological and military innovation.

THE INTEGRATION ERA: HOW AI IS UPENDING OUR INSTITUTIONS

Trusty said he believes the firm is well situated, both in its repertoire and physical proximity to the White House, to push the Trump administration to embrace crypto and AI further as a national interest.

”We are perfectly positioned to help both the Executive Branch and private industry understand and appreciate each other's roles and abilities in forging the new economy,” Trusty said.

On April 14, someone put in a sell order for 2,500 bitcoin, worth roughly $212 million, on the Binance order book at $85,600, around 2-3% above the spot prices trading at the time. 

Seeing such a large order, the bitcoin price started to gravitate to this level at around 17:00 UTC. 

Suddenly, the order was gone, as seen using Coin Glass data, which caused a brief moment of market apathy as bulls and bears tussled to fill a void in liquidity.

The bitcoin price at the time, however, was already on shaky ground due to geopolitical concerns. Subsequently, it went lower after the vanishing order caused chaos for the traders.

So what happened?

One answer could be an illegal technique that involves placing a large limit order to rile trading activity and then removing the order once the price comes close to filling it. This is called "order spoofing," defined by the 2010 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act as "the illegal practice of bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before execution."

As seen in the liquidity heatmap in the image above, on the surface, the order with a price of $85,600 seemed like a key area of resistance, which is why market prices started to gravitate towards it. However, in reality, that order and liquidity were likely spoofed, giving traders the illusion of a stronger market.

Liquidity heatmaps visualize an order book on an exchange and show how much of an asset rests on the book at each price point. Traders will use a heatmap to identify areas of support and resistance or even to target and squeeze under-pressure positions. 

In this particular case, the trader seemed to have placed a possible spoof order when the U.S. equity market was closed, usually a time period of low liquidity for the 24/7 bitcoin market. The order was then removed when the U.S. market opened as the price moved towards filling it. This could still have had the desired effect, as, for instance, a large order on one exchange might spur traders or algorithms on another exchange to remove their order, creating a void in liquidity and subsequent volatility.

Another reason could be that the trader placing a $212 million sell order on Binance wanted to create short-term sell pressure to get filled on limit buys, and then they removed that order once those buys were filled. 

Both options are plausible, albeit still illegal. 

Former ECB analyst and current managing director of Oak Security, Dr. Jan Philipp, told CoinDesk that manipulative trading behavior is a "systemic vulnerability, especially in thin, unregulated markets."

"These tactics give sophisticated actors a consistent edge over retail traders. And unlike TradFi, where spoofing is explicitly illegal and monitored, crypto exists in a gray zone."

He added that "spoofing needs to be taken seriously as a threat as it helped trigger the 2010 Flash Crash in traditional markets, which erased almost $1 trillion in market value."

Binance, meanwhile, insists that it is playing its part in preventing market manipulation.

"Maintaining a fair and orderly trading environment is our top priority and we invest in internal and external surveillance tools that continuously monitor trading in real-time, flagging inconsistencies or patterns that deviate from normal market behavior," a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk, without directly addressing the case of the vanishing $212 million order.

The spokesperson added that if anyone is found manipulating markets, it will freeze accounts, report suspicious activity to regulators, or remove bad actors from its platform.

Spoofing, or a strategy that mimics a fake order, is illegal, but for a young industry such as crypto, history is rife with such examples.

During 2014, when there was little to no regulatory oversight, the majority of trading volume took place on bitcoin-only exchanges from retail traders and cypherpunks, opening the industry to such practices. 

During 2017's ICO phase, when trading volume skyrocketed, tactics such as spoofing were also expected, as institutions were still skeptical about the asset class. In 2017 and 2018, traders regularly placed nine-figure positions that they had no intention of filling, only to pull the order shortly after. 

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said in a 2017 blog post that he "found it incredible" that spoofing was illegal. He argued that if a smart trader wanted to buy $1 billion of BTC, they would bluff a $1 billion sell order to get it filled.

However, since the 2021 bull market, the crypto market has experienced waves of institutional adoption, such as Coinbase (COIN) going public, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) going all-in on bitcoin, and BlackRock launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 

At the time of writing, there are no such large orders that indicate further spoofing attempts, and spoofing attempts have seemed to have become less blatant. However, even with billions traded by TradFi firms, examples of such a strategy still exist across many crypto exchanges, particularly on low-liquidity altcoins.

For example, last month, cryptocurrency exchange MEXC announced that it had reined in a rise in market manipulation. An internal investigation found a 60% increase in market manipulation attempts from Q4 of 2024 to this first quarter of this year. 

In February, a trader manipulated the HyperLiquid JELLY market by tricking a pricing oracle, and HyperLiquid's response to the activity was met with skepticism and a subsequent outflow of capital.

The burden ultimately lies with the exchanges and regulators. 

"Regulators should set the baseline," Dr. Jan Philipp told CoinDesk." [Regulators] should define what counts as manipulation, specify penalties and outline how platforms must respond."

The regulators have certainly tried to clamp down on such schemes. In 2020, rogue trader Avi Eisenberg was found guilty of manipulating decentralized exchange Mango Markets in 2022, but the cases have been few and far between.

However, crypto exchanges must also "step up their surveillance systems" and use circuit breakers while employing stricter listing requirements to clamp down on market manipulation, Philipp said. 

"Retail users won't stick around if they keep getting front-run, spoofed and dumped on. If crypto wants to outgrow its casino phase, we need infrastructure that rewards fair participation, not insider games," Philipp concluded.

Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was formerly regarded as the most likely challenger to Bitcoin's role as the dominant cryptocurrency, as well as the best positioned to make blockchain technology more usable.

During the major cryptocurrency booms of 2017 and 2021, Ethereum was at the center of the action, with its price rising far faster than Bitcoin.

Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Is 60% ETH Price Collapse on Horizon?

ByTomiwabold Olajide





However, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have surged in recent months, Ethereum has failed to keep up. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin is up 53% yearly, while Ethereum is down 42%.

On X, legendary trader Peter Brandt highlighted a downtrend that could signal deeper weakness for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In response to a tweet, Brandt shared a chart of the ETH/BTC pair, highlighting an ongoing decline. The chart showed Ethereum continually losing ground to Bitcoin as it failed to keep pace with Bitcoin's momentum in recent months.

For now, Brandt's chart adds to the warning that Ethereum may face further downside against Bitcoin unless a significant trend reversal occurs.

Ethereum vs Bitcoin: Much More Upside for ETH Ahead, Analyst Says

ByVladislav Sopov





In good news for Ethereum, U.S. Ethereum ETFs experienced their first positive net inflow following eight weeks of outflows, according to Glassnode. The inflow was relatively modest, roughly 40,000 ETH, but marks a potential shift in sentiment around ETH exposure.

At press time, ETH was outperforming Bitcoin in both daily and weekly gains. Ethereum was up 1.12% in the last 24 hours to $1830 and up 13% weekly, while Bitcoin traded up 0.17% in the past day to $94,947 and up 7.24%.

In the coming days, the market will be watching for signs of reversal in the ETH vs. BTC pair, which might signal strength for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization following a prolonged downtrend.

Among the top altcoins in the crypto market, Ethereum, XRP and Sui are gaining attention due to strong investor confidence, growing interest from institutions, and recent technological advancements.

Some of the key developments include leadership changes and ETF entries for Ethereum, progress in regulatory issues and ETF movements for XRP, and rapid growth in total value locked (TVL) and institutional interest for Sui. As a result, these three altcoins are expected to stay in focus for investors in the short to medium term.

Ethereum has been showing positive signs recently, both in on-chain data and technical indicators. Blockchain data revealed that large addresses holding more than 0.1% of the circulating supply have been increasing their ETH holdings. This suggests that big investors are taking advantage of Ethereum's lower prices to buy.

Additionally, ETH-based ETFs saw a net inflow of $157 million after eight weeks of outflows. These developments indicate that investor confidence in Ethereum is starting to rise again.

Another important development was the Ethereum Foundation's decision to change its leadership structure after receiving criticism from the community. Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stanczak were appointed as co-executive directors, a move seen as a key step for the foundation's long-term vision.

The Ethereum Foundation plans to focus on three main areas in the coming period: improving the scalability of the main network, integrating Layer 2 solutions, and enhancing user experience. The Pectra update, scheduled for May, is crucial for achieving these goals.



From a technical perspective, data shows that selling pressure on Ethereum is beginning to shift towards buying. However, the cryptocurrency has faced resistance at around $1,830 since April 23, which suggests the cryptocurrency is at a critical point.

This price level marks the upper limit of the bearish channel that started in December and has been followed throughout this year. Analyzing the chart, it is clear that ETH has attempted to break this downward channel four times, but has failed each time. Now, it is attempting to break through this trend for the fifth time.

If ETH can break the $1,830 resistance (Fib 0.144), it could quickly move to the next resistance level in the $2,060-$2,100 range. This area aligns with Fib 0.236 and the 3-month EMA, forming a strong resistance. A break above $2,100 could signal a trend reversal for ETH. If it fails to break through, the upside potential may remain limited.

In summary, if Ethereum experiences an upward movement, the momentum towards the $2,100 level should be closely monitored. Increased selling pressure at this point may lead to a retest of the $1,800 level. However, if $1,800 holds as support, it could trigger a stronger uptrend in the second phase.

Currently, the $1,830 resistance is expected to be tested. If this level is not broken, a pullback towards the $1,450-$1,500 range could occur, which would indicate that ETH is still moving within a bearish channel.

XRP has gained attention again due to developments on the regulatory front. Ripple's resolution of its legal dispute with the SEC marked a turning point for XRP, boosting its price and attracting institutional investor interest. With this clarity, XRP has been relisted on major exchanges, making it more accessible to individual investors.

One of the key developments for XRP is ProShares' XRP futures ETF launch. Additionally, ETF applications from major financial institutions like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have raised expectations for a potential $8 billion inflow to XRP. The launch of XRP futures by CME Group is expected to further expand its use in financial markets. Moreover, Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road for corporate finance infrastructure is seen as a significant investment for the future.

As a result of these positive developments, XRP followed the general altcoin market trend in April. It initially fell to a support level tested in November 2024 but began to gain attention with a steady rise afterward.



Currently, the $2.3 level for XRP is a crucial resistance point for the continuation of the trend. This level corresponds to Fib 0.382 relative to the downtrend in the first quarter of 2025. A clear daily close above this resistance could push XRP to $2.5 and $2.71. If the upward movement continues, a rally towards $3 could be seen in the short term.

However, if the $2.3 resistance is not broken, XRP may experience a pullback towards $2.00, followed by a potential drop to $1.90.

The Sui network has experienced significant growth recently, especially in total locked assets (TVL) and on-chain user data. Last week, TVL increased by 38% to reach $1.73 billion, while stable crypto reserves hit $879 million, indicating strong confidence in the DeFi ecosystem.

Grayscale's launch of the Sui Trust and 21Shares' application for an SUI ETF clearly show growing institutional interest in Sui. Additionally, the virtual card solution developed in partnership with xPortal and supported by Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is seen as a major step that could enhance the real-world usability of the SUI token.

Investments in the blockchain-based gaming sector have further boosted interest in SUI. The partnership with Parasol and the integration of SEGA-licensed game content into the blockchain network have positioned SUI as a key player in digital asset infrastructure. Additionally, the number of active wallets on the network surpassing 2 million serves as another indicator of its rapid growth.

Lastly, the collaboration with the Athens Stock Exchange has enhanced SUI's strength in institutional solutions. The integration of smart contracts and zk-proof technologies into donation systems has also been a significant development, further strengthening SUI's technical capabilities.



With the impact of all these positive developments, SUI has shown a positive divergence from the overall market in a short period of time. SUI, which has gained more than 75% in the last week, is aiming to continue the uptrend it began last month.

SUI established strong support around $2 in March. Despite flat and low volumes in early April, it saw a significant price increase last week. However, buyer sentiment has weakened in recent days. As the price approaches the $3.6 resistance, holding above this level is crucial for the continuation of the uptrend.

If profit-taking increases, the $3.2 and $2.7 levels can act as support. Especially if $3.2 holds as support, there may be potential for a rise towards $4.5 in the next phase. Otherwise, a horizontal consolidation in the range of $2.7-$3.6 might begin.

President Trump's embrace of crypto — from regulation reforms to personal ventures — is reshaping America's digital future.

The intersection of politics and the crypto industry has often been unpredictable. Still, few developments have been as surprising — or as consequential — as U.S. President Donald Trump's growing involvement in the digital asset markets. Once a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, President Trump's views have undergone a dramatic transformation, mirroring broader trends in the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and the increasing role of digital assets in shaping economic fortune across nations.

Today, Trump's name is not only linked to crypto regulation and federal policy initiatives but also to personal ventures that have captured the attention of both supporters and critics. From advocating for the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to launching his meme coin associated with Truth Social, Trump's influence on the cryptocurrency industry has become impossible to ignore. His involvement in crypto projects has also reignited debates around money laundering risks and the need for clear rules, particularly regarding the issuance and trading of tokens within the digital asset markets.

His entry into the digital economy reflects the broader political shift toward recognizing the value and inevitability of decentralized technologies. As the ownership of digital assets becomes a new form of economic power, President Trump's initiatives serve both as a promise of future prosperity and as an example of how traditional political leaders are adapting to a blockchain-driven world. Agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission have found themselves under pressure to modernize oversight frameworks, ensuring that innovation is not stifled while safeguarding financial integrity.

In recent years, the digital asset landscape has witnessed an unexpected figure stepping onto the stage — President Donald Trump. Initially a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, he expressed serious concerns about Bitcoin's volatility and its potential use for illicit activities, such as money laundering, aligning his early views with broader skepticism within the federal government and among federal agencies.

However, by January 2024, the picture had changed dramatically. Trump recognized the shifting tides of finance and technology, recalibrating his position to appeal to tech-savvy voters and investors seeking fortune in new markets. His public endorsement of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry was seen as both a political promise and a strategic push to cement America's leadership in digital innovation.

Following his return to office, one of Trump's most ambitious crypto ventures was the proposal to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — a digital asset stockpile designed to bolster the U.S. dollar and provide economic resilience against future crises. This move reflected a new philosophy: blockchain regulation should be permissive enough to encourage growth, while still ensuring security, enforcing clear rules, and protecting against financial abuses.

Trump's ability to read the evolving market sentiment placed him at the forefront of a growing movement to integrate cryptocurrency directly into national economic strategies. In contrast to the Biden administration's more cautious regulatory stance, Trump framed digital assets, including emerging forms of tokens, as critical tools for maintaining American financial dominance in an increasingly competitive and decentralized global landscape.

Currently, TRUMP trades at a market price of

President Trump's approach to crypto regulation signaled a sharp departure from the restrictive measures often associated with the Biden administration. In his first week back in office, President Trump signed several executive orders aimed at streamlining compliance requirements for crypto companies, sending a clear message that the U.S. intended to lead, not follow, in the global blockchain race.

One of Trump's most significant actions was the revitalization of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, directing it to create new frameworks for the ownership and operation of digital assets. The working group, now populated with crypto-friendly voices and supported by leaders like David Sacks, played a crucial role in coordinating with Congress and the Treasury Department to implement wide-reaching reforms.

The efforts of the working group culminated in landmark legislation that sought to clearly define the roles of federal agencies in overseeing cryptocurrencies, including differentiating between securities and commodities. Trump's administration emphasized that a permissive regulatory environment was essential not only for innovation but also for attracting companies that might otherwise move operations overseas.

Moreover, by advocating for flexible blockchain regulation, Trump encouraged companies across various sectors to adopt decentralized technologies, ensuring that the U.S. would remain a leader in the digital economy. His government aimed to establish the United States as the preferred jurisdiction for emerging crypto ventures, from startup exchanges to large-scale tokenized asset platforms.

Trump's proactive stance has also intensified international competition, with nations like China, the United Arab Emirates, and members of the European Union accelerating their own blockchain initiatives in response. As global governments move to implement their digital strategies, the U.S. faces both opportunities and challenges in maintaining its leadership position. The alignment of federal agencies under a unified vision for clear rules around tokens, securities classification, and money laundering prevention has become a defining feature of Trump's policy legacy.

At the same time, critics warn that a permissive environment could expose markets to greater volatility and regulatory arbitrage. Nevertheless, President Trump's emphasis on fostering domestic crypto companies and encouraging innovation at the intersection of finance and technology has sparked a wave of entrepreneurship. Many blockchain startups and established financial institutions now view the U.S. as the most promising jurisdiction for growth, setting the stage for an era where digital assets could become as central to economic power as traditional currencies.

Beyond government-level reforms, President Trump's ventures into the crypto industry have been equally headline-grabbing. His ownership ties to various projects, including his own meme coin linked to the Truth Social platform, have exemplified how digital assets can be used to energize political bases and generate new revenue streams.

The launch of Trump's meme coin in March 2025, heavily promoted through his media outlets, became an example of how a political figure could directly participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While critics raised concerns about conflicts of interest, the initiative's success demonstrated the growing appetite among Trump's supporters to invest in projects aligned with their political and financial values.

Furthermore, Trump's embrace of crypto ventures served as a rallying cry for broader adoption among conservative circles, who had previously viewed digital assets with suspicion. His messaging framed blockchain technology not only as a tool for economic freedom but also as a means to challenge centralized control by traditional institutions. This narrative resonated strongly with his political base.

Meanwhile, the appointment of an AI czar to oversee both artificial intelligence and blockchain innovation within the federal government underscored Trump's belief that the United States must dominate the next generation of technological infrastructure. In partnership with Congress and agencies like the Treasury, Trump pushed for aggressive legislation to ensure that American companies would lead the world in these sectors.

The cryptocurrency industry has evolved rapidly under Trump's influence. His policies have helped shift the perception of digital assets from speculative investments to legitimate components of national economic policy. Trump's legacy in this arena will likely be seen in the continued expansion of the digital asset markets, the establishment of pro-crypto government frameworks, and the elevation of crypto ownership to a matter of national interest.

As the Senate continues to debate future crypto-related bills, many of which were initiated during Trump's renewed tenure, it's clear that the president's push for deregulation and innovation will leave a lasting mark. His willingness to intertwine political branding with crypto ventures sets a powerful — and controversial — example of leadership in the emerging digital economy.

In the coming years, the influence of President Trump's actions on the cryptocurrency industry could shape not only America's financial system but also the global balance of digital power, as countries race to establish their own digital asset stockpiles and blockchain frameworks.

With coins pricing at around $90,000 the math just doesn't add up.

As I wipe the dust from my coffin I arise to tell you all that I was there when they first started mining the cryptocurrencies from the bowls of the digital frontier. I was there early enough to look at my old rig and wonder if it was worth setting up to see if it could score a few coins over the course of a month or so. I've known a few people who did things like acccidentally throw away drives full of BTC. I even knew people who got in early and cashed out fast, otherwise known as 'bastards'.

Since its early days, crypto has been, to put it politely, an absolute shitshow of cryptoglogical proportions. Even when it was somewhat viable to put your rig to work it'd still be a long haul of wait and see before you might eventually unearth yourself a coin here and there. And of course your old GPU has been worked into dust and your power bill has skyrocketed for the trouble.

For those reasons it's been a long time since I considered mining Bitcoin as a viable investment, and it looks like the landscape is finally shifting to meet my preconceptions. Even specialists such as CoinShares (via Overclockers) are starting to doubt this business investment, despite it recently reaching an all time high price.

New data tells us that mining a single Bitcoin or one BTC costs the largest public mining companies over $82,000 USD, which is nearly double the figure it did the previous quarter. Estimates for smaller organisations say you need to spend about $137,000 to get that single BTC in return. BTC is currently only valued at $94,703 USD, which seems to be a problem in the math department.

These costs can even get worse depending on the country you're doing your mining. Germany is typically considered to be one of the worst places to mine BTC from a profit perspective. It costs around $200,000 USD to mine a single coin there.

So why would anyone be mining BTC in this day and age? Well the main reason, other than perhaps dim hopes that they'll strike it rich, is about technology. Currently optimising farms to mine faster on lower power has been the goal. Plus seeking out places where electricity is cheaper to try to maximise those gains.

Once you've got these incredibly efficient, and hopefully relatively power friendly setups in place, you've not only dropped your potential mining overheads but you likely have a computation setup that could complete other tasks. This makes it an attractive option for larger companies who may look to lease their mining operations for other computations when they're unable to make money from mining. Then they can swap back if and when the market picks up once again.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

For now the big takeaway is that mining crypto isn't going to be viable for individuals, possibly ever again. With huge centres being setup in key positions you just won't be able to beat out the larger companies acting here. Any new coin that comes up they can point their rigs to it and begin the process all over again. It's almost like you're better off using your sweet rigs for gaming, not crypto mining, just like the good lord intended.

Trump's First 100 Days

The pitch from “ZMoney” arrived on the encrypted messaging app Signal just days before Donald J. Trump's presidential inauguration.

“ZMoney” was Zachary Folkman, an entrepreneur who once ran a company called Date Hotter Girls and was now representing World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency firm that Mr. Trump and his sons had recently unveiled. Mr. Folkman was writing to a crypto startup in the Cayman Islands, offering a “partnership” in which the firms would buy each other's digital coins, a deal that would bolster the startup's public profile.

But there was a catch, The New York Times found. For the privilege of associating with the Trumps, the startup would have to make, in effect, a secret multimillion dollar payment to World Liberty.

“Everything we do gets a lot of exposure and credibility,” Mr. Folkman wrote, asserting that other business partners had committed between $10 million and $30 million to World Liberty.

The Cayman startup rejected the offer, as did several other firms that received a similar pitch from World Liberty, executives said. They considered the deal unethical, concluding that World Liberty was essentially selling an endorsement — and hiding the arrangement from the public.

World Liberty's executives, who have maintained that they did nothing improper, were undeterred. They successfully pitched similar deals to other firms while also marketing their coin to buyers around the world, reaping more than $550 million in sales, with a large cut earmarked for the president's family.

FTX Trading and the FTX Recovery Trust filed lawsuits Monday against token issuers NFT Stars and Kurosemi, which does business as Delysium, alleging the companies failed to deliver tokens promised under investment agreements with Alameda Research's venture arm, Alameda Ventures.

The complaints, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, seek to compel the companies to turn over tokens that FTX claims were purchased through Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs. 

“We urge token and coin issuers to return assets that rightfully belong to FTX, and are willing to initiate litigation barring adequate engagement,” the FTX Estate said in a statement.

The lawsuits mark the latest effort by FTX to recover assets for creditors following its collapse in November 2022. Once one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX filed for bankruptcy after revelations surfaced that around $8 billion in customer funds had been misused by executives to cover risky bets made by FTX's affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research. 

The collapse shook the broader cryptocurrency industry, triggering regulatory scrutiny and resulting in billions of dollars in losses for customers and investors. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX, was convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The company began its restructuring plan earlier this year, through which it plans to repay creditors. 

Part of how it is doing that is collecting funds held by other companies it believes belong to FTX. The court documents allege that NFT Stars and Delysium breached contracts by failing to transfer the tokens despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter outside of court. 

FTX is seeking the immediate return of the assets, damages for breach of contract, and sanctions for alleged violations of bankruptcy protections, including those related to the automatic stay under U.S. bankruptcy law.

According to the Delysium complaint, Alameda Ventures, now known as Maclaurin Investment, paid $1 million in January 2022 for the right to receive 75 million $AGI tokens. The tokens launched in April 2023 and were subject to a vesting schedule, with 20% unlocking after a 12-month cliff period and additional tokens unlocking quarterly thereafter. 

However, Delysium, an AI agent blockchain project, allegedly extended the vesting schedule unilaterally to 48 months and refused to transfer any tokens, with a company representative stating in a public Discord message that they would not allocate tokens to FTX due to the bankruptcy proceedings.

In the case against marketplace NFT Stars, FTX claims it paid $325,000 in November 2021 for rights to 1.35 million SENATE tokens and 135 million SIDUS tokens. While NFT Stars initially delivered some of the tokens, it allegedly failed to complete further transfers following FTX's bankruptcy filing. 

FTX says NFT Stars now owes more than 831,000 SENATE tokens and 83 million SIDUS tokens, citing breaches of contract and violation of the automatic stay.

Between June 2023 and September 2024, FTX's advisors attempted to contact NFT Stars 15 times and Delysium 13 times, without receiving a response. Decrypt has approached both for comment.

CLIMATEWIRE | The Trump administration on Monday dismissed all of the scientists working on the newest version of the National Climate Assessment, a sweeping report that outlines the growing dangers of rising temperatures for lawmakers, policy experts and the public.

The sixth installment of the congressionally mandated report, which was due to come out by 2028, has typically been put together by about 400 researchers, many of whom are top scientists at universities who volunteer their time. The assessment is used to craft environmental rules, legislation and infrastructure project planning. It seen by experts as the definitive body of research about how global warming is transforming the country.

Work had already begun on the sixth version. The Trump administration ended that with a note sent to researchers Monday.

“At this time, the scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990,” contributors were told in an email obtained by POLITICO's E&E News.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move was roundly criticized by climate scientists late Monday as the news spread. The assessments help Americans “understand how climate change is impacting their daily lives already and what to expect in the future,” said Rachel Cleetus, one of the researchers who was dismissed.

“Trying to bury this report won't alter the scientific facts one bit, but without this information our country risks flying blind into a world made more dangerous by human-caused climate change,” said Cleetus, a senior policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a statement. “The only beneficiaries of disrupting or killing this report are the fossil fuel industry and those intent on boosting oil and gas profits at the expense of people's health and the nation's economic well-being.”

The plan closely tracks with a proposal by White House budget director Russ Vought, who has urged the Trump administration to toss out all work on the assessment that began under former President Joe Biden. Vought wants to help pick a new group of researchers to issue a report that reflects the administration's claims that climate change is not a serious threat. That report might focus on how climate change “benefits” the U.S., according to a plan he outlined in Project 2025, the conservative policy proposal produced by the Heritage Foundation.

Earlier this month, the administration defunded the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which supports the assessment. The program, which coordinated the work of 13 federal agencies, had existed for 35 years through Republican and Democratic presidencies, including Trump's first term.

Trump officials were caught by surprise by the timing of the fourth National Climate Assessment as it was being prepared for release in 2018. Some wanted to withhold the report and fire the scientists who worked on it, but that plan was scuttled. Instead, the White House tried to downplay the report by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving, but that only increased the attention it received.

It's unclear whom Vought would try to recruit for the next assessment, if there is one.

There is a relatively small pool of credentialed researchers who downplay the scientific consensus that climate change could push the planet past a series of dangerous tipping points. Some have already told E&E News that they are willing to be involved with the new effort.

On Monday, some of the dismissed researchers pledged to continue their work in some fashion. That includes Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University, and an author of the chapter on ocean coasts that was being prepared for the sixth report.

“I know many of the authors would like to find a way to ensure that Americans can still have an updated, evidence-based assessment of our country's climate,” he wrote on Bluesky.

A new study shows that tiny gold particles could circumvent damaged photoreceptors in patients with macular degeneration and help restore vision.

The term “goldeneye” once only described spy thrillers and waterfowl. But soon, it could mean groundbreaking therapy for people with failing vision. 

Scientists at Brown University injected gold nanoparticles into the retinas of laboratory mice and successfully restored vision in those with retinal disorders like macular degeneration. The researchers see this breakthrough as the basis for a possible prosthesis for those with retinal disorders, though it would require wearing a small laser device embedded in a pair of sunglasses or goggles. The results of the study were published in the journal ACS Nano.

At first glance, the method may seem counterintuitive—how does injecting a miniscule amount of a soft metal repair damaged photoreceptors in patients with macular degeneration? Well, instead of letting the eyes rely on rods and cones for vision, this method uses gold nanoparticles and laser light to stimulate bipolar and ganglion cells that are “further up on the visual chain,” according to the researchers. 

These cells typically interpret the signals made by the photoreceptors and send them to the brain. This gold-tinted technique bypasses those photoreceptors by focusing infrared light directly on the nanoparticles, which in turn generate heat that activates the bipolar and ganglion cells. This is particularly valuable for the millions of patients with macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa—those diseases leave these “further up” cells unscathed, so this stimulation technique could improve sight overall. 

“This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification,”  Jiarui Nie, lead author on the study, said in a press statement. “We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions.”

Nie and her team tested this process on mice and, by using probes to analyze increased activity of the visual cortices, confirmed that there was at least partial restoration of vision. Additionally, the team confirmed that the nanoparticles and laser stimulation caused no adverse side effects by searching for markers of inflammation or toxicity.

To transfer this tech to humans, the researchers imagine using a pair of glasses or goggles capable of capturing data from the surrounding environment and driving the infrared laser pattern. Once these laser pulses stimulated the nanoparticles in the eyes, those laser patterns would be interpreted in the brain. 

Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has given the go ahead on a similar intervention that relies on electrodes surgically implanted in the eye. However, Nie said that this technique would be much less invasive and could even provide increased resolution, as the nanoparticle solution covers the entire retina. 

Throughout human history, gold has been on of Earth's most precious metals. But for those struggling with retinal disorders, it could very well be priceless.

Understanding human intelligence, here we come.

Scientists have mapped an unprecedentedly large portion of the brain of a mouse. The cubic millimeter worth of brain tissue represents the largest piece of a brain we've ever understood  to this degree, and the researchers behind this project say that the mouse brain is similar enough to the human brain that they can even extrapolate things about us. A cubic millimeter sounds tiny—to us, it is tiny—but a map of 200,000 brain cells represents just over a quarter of a percent of the mouse brain. In brain science terms, that's extraordinarily high. A proportionate sample of the human brain would be 240 million cells.

Within the sciences, coding and computer science can sometimes overshadow the physical and life sciences. Rhetoric about artificial intelligence has raced ahead with terms like “human intelligence,” but the human brain is not well enough understood to truly give credence to that idea. Scientists have worked for decades to analyze the brain, and they're making great progress despite the outsized rhetoric working against them.

That said, artificial intelligence designed for specific tasks is essential to research like this. In a series of eight papers in the peer reviewed journal Nature, the team behind the Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) project—hailing from the Allen Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, and Princeton University—described how they used machine learning to “reverse engineer the algorithms of the brain.”

The field in which scientists map the brain and other parts of the nervous system (of humans or any other creature) is called connectomics. The term comes from the same suffix as in biome or genome, referring to a complete picture or map of something. This work expands on the connectome—which is only the physical map—by adding data about each neuron's function.

In one of the team's papers, the researchers were able to make an overall classifying system to cover 30,000 neurons by their different shapes, or morphologies. These neurons are excitatory, meaning they're involved with transmitting messages in the brain. The alternative to excitatory is inhibitory, which is circuitry that stops a message from being passed, like an insulator.

Inhibitory neuron shapes are better understood, partly because their shapes can be separated into diverse (but discrete) groups. In this study, scientists used machine learning to help classify excitatory neurons, which seem to need a more complicated classifying system. By turning the neurons into measurements, observations ,and layers, the scientists could then use statistical methods to find how often certain types or qualities of these cells appeared. This may sound like an oxymoron, but code can generalize more precisely than human scientists are able to.

The conclusion about a continuum is really important. Having categories for neurons can be and has been useful in studying the brain, but computing power can deepen this understanding and add a great deal of nuance. With more information, we can turn broad types into something more individualized.

Another paper in the set found confirmation of an existing theory that “like connects like” within neuron structures. Neurons that perform certain tasks in the visual cortex of the mouse brain reach out and link up with each other, whether they're adjacent or layers apart. Because of the size of this dataset, the scientists were able to extend this established theory into further-away parts of the brain region. And since even this large mapping of brain tissue is still very incomplete, the number of “like” neurons is likely even higher in reality.

The data and maps from this project are available for the public to check out by following the instructions on their website. It's wild that you don't even have to download anything—you can map the brain using your web browser.

Agonists and antagonists of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) enhance body weight loss induced by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonism. However, while GIPR agonism decreases body weight and food intake in a GLP-1R-independent manner via GABAergic GIPR+ neurons, it remains unclear whether GIPR antagonism affects energy metabolism via a similar mechanism. Here we show that the body weight and food intake effects of GIPR antagonism are eliminated in mice with global loss of either Gipr or Glp-1r but are preserved in mice with loss of Gipr in either GABAergic neurons of the central nervous system or peripherin-expressing neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing shows opposing effects of GIPR agonism and antagonism in the dorsal vagal complex, with antagonism, but not agonism, closely resembling GLP-1R signalling. Additionally, GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism both regulate genes implicated in synaptic plasticity. Collectively, we show that GIPR agonism and antagonism decrease body weight via different mechanisms, with GIPR antagonism, unlike agonism, depending on functional GLP-1R signalling.

Co-agonism at the receptors for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has been established as a highly effective strategy to manage obesity1,2,3,4 and type 2 diabetes5,6,7,8,9,10. Although GIPR agonism has long been stigmatized as potentially enhancing body weight via stimulation of adipocyte lipid deposition11,12, long-acting GIPR agonists decrease body weight and food intake in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice13,14,15 and amplify weight loss induced by GLP-1R agonism13,14,15,16,17. We and others have shown that long-acting GIPR agonists have a preserved ability to decrease body weight and food intake in Glp-1r-deficient mice15,18, which is lost in obese mice with Nestin-Cre-mediated neuronal loss of Gipr15. We and others further showed a similar effect in mice with Vgat-Cre-mediated deletion of Gipr in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons14,19. Consistent with the demonstration that GIPR agonism decreases body weight and food intake via central GIPR signalling in rodents14,15, chemogenetic activation of GIPR neurons in either the hypothalamus20,21 or the hindbrain20 decreases food intake in mice. Although infusion of long-acting (acyl) GIP into the lateral ventricle decreases body weight and food intake in DIO wildtype (WT) mice, these effects vanish in mice with central nervous system (CNS) loss of Gipr15.

Superiority of the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 to yield greater weight loss and further inhibition of food intake relative to GLP-1R agonism is diminished in mice with loss of Gipr in either the CNS15 or in GABAergic neurons14, indicating that GIPR agonism also contributes to weight loss induced by such a co-agonist. Notably, while long-acting GIPR agonists act in the brain in a GLP-1R-independent manner to decrease body weight and food intake via GABAergic GIPR neurons, GIPR antagonism also decreases body weight and food intake in DIO mice and non-human primates, particularly when used in co-therapy with GLP-1R agonism22,23,24,25,26,27,28. Thus, surprisingly, GIPR agonism and antagonism appear to have similar metabolic end points when it comes to body weight control. AMG133, a bispecific hybrid that comprises two GLP-1R agonists conjugated to a monoclonal anti-GIPR antagonist25,26 is currently in phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. It shows superiority in decreasing body weight relative to targeting of each individual receptor in DIO mice and non-human primates25. In a recent phase 1 study, AMG133 induced more than 10% weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment in healthy humans26. Together, these findings support the notion that both GIPR agonism and antagonism hold therapeutic value to accelerate GLP-1-induced weight loss.

The mechanisms underlying the reduction of body weight induced by GIPR antagonism, however, are largely unknown, although some studies suggest that GIPR agonism and antagonism may decrease body weight via similar mechanisms29. Here, to test this hypothesis, we set out to assess the metabolic effects of two validated GIPR antagonists22,23 in mice with whole-body or targeted deletion of Gipr. Like GIPR agonism14, we find that the body weight and food intake reducing effects of GIPR antagonism are lost in global Gipr-deficient mice. However, in contrast to GIPR agonism14, we find that GIPR antagonism fully retains its body weight and food intake reducing effects in mice with Vgat-Cre-mediated deletion of Gipr in GABAergic neurons, as well as in mice with loss of Gipr in peripherin-expressing neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, and again in contrast to GIPR agonism14,18, we find that the body weight and food intake inhibitory effects of GIPR antagonism are absent in global Glp-1r-deficient mice, suggesting dependency on GLP-1R-mediated signalling. Consistent with this finding, single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) revealed that GIPR agonism and antagonism have opposing effects in the brain, with GIPR antagonism but not agonism mimicking the transcriptional responses of GLP-1R agonism in the dorsal vagal complex of the hindbrain (DVC), and with GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism both modulating DVC gene programmes implicated in synapse formation and neuronal plasticity. Collectively, we show that while GIPR agonism and antagonism have similar effects on body weight and food intake, they do so via different neuronal mechanisms, with GIPR antagonism, but not GIPR agonism, depending on GLP-1R signalling to affect energy metabolism.

We recently showed that loss of Gipr in Vgat-expressing GABAergic neurons renders DIO mice resistant to weight loss and inhibition of food intake by GIPR agonism14. To test whether Gipr antagonism affects energy metabolism via a similar mechanism, we treated DIO Vgat-Cre+Giprwt/wt (WT) and Vgat-Cre+Giprflx/flx (Vgat-Gipr knockout (KO)) mice for 24 days with either vehicle, a long-acting GLP-1R agonist (acyl-GLP-1, 10 nmol kg−1)13,14,15 or the combination of acyl-GLP-1 (10 nmol kg−1) and a validated long-acting (acylated) peptide GIPR antagonist (1,500 nmol kg−1)22. Vgat-Cre-mediated Gipr KO was confirmed by RNAscope (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Notably, and in contrast to GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonism, which loses its superiority to GLP-1R agonism with respect to decreases in body weight and food intake in Vgat-Gipr KO mice14, the co-therapy of GLP-1R agonism and GIPR antagonism maintained the enhanced effect on weight loss (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1c–f) and on inhibition of food intake (Fig. 1c) relative to treatment with acyl-GLP-1 alone in Vgat-Gipr KO mice, without a difference of the co-therapy on either body weight or food intake in WT and Vgat-Gipr KO mice. Treatment with the co-therapy decreased body fat and lean tissue mass with comparable efficacy in WT and Vgat-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). The co-therapy also improved glucose tolerance with comparable efficacy in WT and Vgat-Gipr KO mice relative to vehicle controls, albeit without superiority to acyl-GLP-1 (Fig. 1f–h). No differences were observed in fasting levels of blood glucose (Fig. 1i), but levels of insulin (Fig. 1j) and insulin sensitivity, as estimated by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Fig. 1k), were equally improved by treatment with acyl-GLP-1 and the co-therapy, and without difference between WT and Vgat-Gipr KO mice. No differences were observed in plasma levels of triglycerides (Fig. 1l), but levels of cholesterol were decreased after treatment with acyl-GLP-1, but not after treatment with the co-therapy, in both WT and Vgat-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 1m). In summary, and in contrast to GIPR agonism14, these data indicate that GIPR+ GABAergic neurons are dispensable for GIPR antagonism to amplify GLP-1-induced weight loss and inhibition of food intake.

Expression of Gipr has been demonstrated in various regions of the PNS30,31. In light of its role in the bi-directional transfer of information between the periphery and the brain, the PNS is well positioned to control energy metabolism, not only by modulating glycaemia via regulation of sympathetic outflow to the skeletal muscle32, but also by promoting GIP-induced vasodilation in the mesenteric vasculature, including the adipose tissue33,34. Considering these effects, we next assessed whether targeted Cre-mediated deletion of Gipr in neurons of the PNS affects energy and glucose metabolism. Mice with deletion of Gipr in neurons of the PNS were generated by crossing C57BL/6J Giprflx/flx mice35,36 with C57BL/6J mice that express Cre-recombinase under control of the promoter for peripherin (MGI 3841120)37. Peripherin is a neuronal intermediate filament protein with largely restricted expression in neurons of the PNS38. Consistent with this, we found expression of peripherin largely absent in the hippocampus, DVC, hypothalamus, sciatic nerve, pancreas and white adipose tissue, but it had robust expression in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Outside the PNS, expression of peripherin was highest in the ileum, but with more than 31-fold lower expression relative to the trigeminal ganglion, and with even lower to absent expression in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, midbrain, kidney, testis, pituitary, adrenal gland, stomach, duodenum, jejunum and colon (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Collectively, these data indicate that expression of peripherin is largely restricted to neurons of the PNS. In line with previous reports in rats showing that peripherin is expressed in only 46% of DRG neurons39, we find expression of Gipr decreased by ∽43% in the DRG of Per-Cre+Giprflx/flx mice (Per-Gipr KO) relative to Per-Cre+Giprwt/wt (WT) controls, and without differences in relative expression of Gipr in either the hypothalamus, hindbrain, sciatic nerve, epididymal white adipose tissue, pancreas, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, pituitary, kidney, duodenum, jejunum, ileum or colon (Extended Data Fig. 2c–p). Consistent with the high expression of peripherin in the trigeminal ganglia and the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), we also confirmed Per-Cre-mediated deletion of Gipr in the trigeminal ganglion and the DRG in Per-Gipr KO mice using RNAscope (Extended Data Fig. 2q,r).

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), male Per-Gipr KO mice showed no overt differences in body weight, body composition or food intake relative to WT controls (Fig. 2a–d). We further observed no differences in energy expenditure, locomotor activity or substrate utilization (Fig. 2e–g). However, we did find that DIO Per-Gipr KO mice had a higher glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and slightly impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. 2h,i) with normal insulin sensitivity, but impaired secretion of insulin and GIP after oral bolus glucose administration compared with WT mice (Fig. 2j–l). The insulin secretory response to GIP and GLP-1 was, however, fully preserved in pancreatic islets isolated from WT and Per-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 2m), indicating that the impaired insulinotropic response observed in the Per-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 2k) did not result from impaired GIPR signalling in the islets. We also observed no differences in fasting levels of blood glucose, insulin or triglycerides (Fig. 2n–p). We also found that the metabolic phenotype of male DIO Per-Gipr KO mice was recapitulated in female DIO Per-Gipr KO mice, which, like male Per-Gipr KO mice, showed no difference in body weight, body composition, food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity or substrate utilization, but the females did have robust glucose intolerance with impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, despite normal insulin tolerance and unchanged plasma levels of blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol (Extended Data Fig. 3a–p). Collectively, these data indicate that in both sexes, GIPR signalling in peripherin-expressing peripheral neurons is required for normal GIP and insulin responses to orally ingested glucose, but is not necessary for regulation of body weight, body composition or food intake.

Data in a, d and i–k were analysed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test for comparison of individual timepoints. Data in b, c, h, i and n–p were analysed using two-sided, two-tailed Student's t-test. Data in f and g were analysed using a two-tailed, unpaired Mann–Whitney test. Data in m were analysed using a one-way ANOVA. Data in e were analysed using ANCOVA with body weight as the covariate.

Data represent mean ± s.e.m. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. Individual P values are shown in the Source data, unless P < 0.0001.

Consistent with previous data showing that GIPR agonism acts in the CNS15 to decrease food intake via GABAergic GIPR neurons14, we found that the inhibition of food intake following single subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of acyl-GIP (100 nmol kg−1) was fully preserved in DIO Per-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 3a). Notably, however, we found that the co-therapy of acyl-GLP-1 (10 nmol kg−1) and the acylated GIPR antagonist (1,500 nmol kg−1) equally decreased body weight in DIO WT and Per-Gipr KO mice, with superiority of the co-therapy relative to treatment with acyl-GLP-1 alone (Fig. 3b,c). Expectedly, this effect is more clearly pronounced when expressing the data as per cent relative to absolute changes (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4a).The co-therapy decreased food intake with comparable efficacy in WT and Per-Gipr KO mice, but with significance of the co-therapy over acyl-GLP-1 reached only in the WT mice (Fig. 3d). Mice treated with the co-therapy exhibited a greater decrease in fat and lean tissue mass relative to treatment with acyl-GLP-1, without an overt difference between WT and Per-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). In both WT and Per-Gipr KO mice, we found that the co-therapy improved glucose tolerance without superiority to GLP-1R agonism alone (Fig. 3g–i). Fasting levels of blood glucose were comparably decreased in mice treated with the co-therapy or acyl-GLP-1, but with significance reached only in the Per-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 3j). In both WT and Per-Gipr KO mice, we found that the fasting levels of insulin were decreased and insulin sensitivity increased after treatment with the co-therapy, but without superiority of the co-therapy to GLP-1R agonism alone (Fig. 3k,l). We observed no differences in either treatment or genotype regarding plasma levels of triglycerides (Fig. 3m). Collectively, these data show that the ability of GIPR antagonism to enhance GLP-1-induced weight loss is not mediated by GIPR signal inhibition in peripherin-expressing peripheral neurons. Furthermore, and consistent with our data in the Vgat-Gipr KO group (Fig. 1f–h), we found no major additional glycaemic benefits of the co-therapy relative to GLP-1R agonism alone (Fig. 3g–i).

We next assessed the ability of a mouse GIPR neutralizing antibody23 (Kb of 5 nmol l−1, potency for antagonism of GIP-induced cAMP accumulation) to affect HFD-induced weight gain and food intake in lean mice kept at thermoneutrality (28 °C), an environmental temperature where potential confounding effects due to differences in metabolic rate are lowest. Interestingly, single s.c. treatment with the anti-GIPR antibody (30 mg kg−1) attenuated body weight gain and decreased food intake in lean WT mice (Fig. 4a–c), but not in mice with global loss of either Gipr (Fig. 4d–f) or Glp-1r (Fig. 4g–i). Of note, these data demonstrate that the body weight and food intake reducing effects of GIPR antagonism not only depend on functional GIPR signalling, but also on GLP-1R signalling. The latter contrasts with GIPR agonism, which we and others showed to exhibit a fully preserved ability to decrease body weight and food intake in Glp-1r-deficient mice15,18.

In contrast to our observation in Per-Gipr KO mice (Fig. 2a), we recently showed that body weight is decreased in HFD-fed mice with CNS-targeted loss of Gipr15, suggesting that the decrease in body weight that is induced by GIPR antagonism is mediated via neurons of the central rather than the peripheral nervous system. This is consistent with our observation that weight loss induced by GIPR antagonism depends on GLP-1R signalling (Fig. 4g–i), which also decreases body weight via central, rather than peripheral mechanisms40. To delineate the similarities and differences of GIPR (ant)agonism in the brain, we next performed snRNA-seq in the hypothalamus and the DVC, two regions implicated in regulation of food intake by GIPR agonism20,21, after single s.c. treatment of DIO mice with either vehicle, acyl-GIP13,14,15 (150 nmol kg−1), acyl-GLP-1 (50 nmol kg−1)13,14,15, the acylated peptide GIPR antagonist (1,500 nmol kg−1)22 or the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 (50 nmol kg−1)13,14,15 (Fig. 5a,b). The rationale for assessing drug responses after acute treatment was to minimize confounding effects arising from differences in body weight after chronic drug treatment. Treatment groups largely overlapped across tissues, with comparable distribution of cell types, and with neurons constituting most of the captured nuclei across the treatment groups (Fig. 5c–f). We further found higher expression of Gipr in the DVC relative to the hypothalamus, while the opposite was found for the expression of Glp-1r (Fig. 5g). After exclusion of low-quality cells, we notably obtained RNA transcriptomes from 57,798 DVC and 211,537 hypothalamic nuclei (Fig. 5h).

a,b, A schematic of the experimental design (a) and the body weight (b) of 36-week-old male C57BL/6J WT mice fed either a standard chow diet (cntrl.) or a HFD and treated s.c. with a single dose of either vehicle (vhcl), acyl-GIP (150 nmol kg−1), acyl-GLP-1 (50 nmol kg−1), an acylated peptide GIPR antagonist (1,500 nmol kg−1) or the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 (50 nmol kg−1) (n = 6 each group). c–f, UMAP representations of gene expression coloured by C12-level cell type in the DVC (c) and C25-level cell type in hypothalamus (d), as well as by experimental group in the DVC (e) and hypothalamus (f). g, A bar graph showing mean expression of Glp-1r and Gipr in the DVC and hypothalamus. h, The number of nuclei isolated from each brain region.

We found that DVC gene expression changes correlated negatively between mice treated with acyl-GIP or the GIPR antagonist (Fig. 6a), but positively between mice treated with acyl-GLP-1 versus the GIPR antagonist (Fig. 6b). These data indicate that GIPR antagonism triggers DVC transcriptional responses like those of GLP-1R agonism, and further corroborate that GIPR agonism and antagonism decrease body weight and food intake via different mechanisms. These data are further in agreement with our observation in vivo showing that GIPR antagonism, unlike GIPR agonism15,18, depends on functional GLP-1R signalling to decrease body weight and food intake (Fig. 4g–i). Expectedly, a strong positive correlation in gene expression changes was observed in mice treated with MAR709 versus acyl-GIP (Fig. 6c), but notably not with MAR709 versus acyl-GLP-1 (Fig. 6d) or MAR709 versus GIPR antagonism (Fig. 6e). These data are consistent with the established role of MAR709 as a potent GIPR agonist13,14,15,41, and indicate that neither acyl-GIP nor the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 works as a functional GIPR antagonist. In line with this is our further observation that gene expression changes correlate positively between mice treated with acyl-GLP-1 versus the GIPR antagonist (Fig. 6b), but negatively between mice treated with acyl-GLP-1 versus acyl-GIP (Fig. 6f). Notably, the observation that DVC gene expression changes are stronger in mice treated with MAR709 versus acyl-GIP (Fig. 6c) relative to mice treated with MAR709 versus acyl-GLP-1 (Fig. 6d) indicates that GIPR is the primary target of MAR709 in the DVC, with fewer transcriptional changes induced by MAR709 via GLP-1R. In agreement with this notion, we found that expression of Glp-1r concentrated in specific neuronal populations, which include two GABAergic neuronal clusters (C35 GABA3 and C35 GABA4) and one glutamatergic neuronal cluster (C35 Glut 8) (Fig. 6g), while expression of Gipr is more broadly distributed across DVC neuronal populations, with particularly high expression in a small population of 5-HT-positive neurons (Fig. 6g–j). We observed no large differences in Gipr and Glp-1r expression across experimental groups (Fig. 6k).

We next performed cell-type prioritization analysis using Augur42 to determine which types of neurons were most affected by individual drug treatment in the DVC (Fig. 7a–d). The higher the Augur score, the more information about group identity is embedded in its gene expression profile, indicating a greater change in gene expression in response to drug treatment. Notably, we found that among the three neuronal populations that were most affected by GIPR antagonism are the two main Glp-1r-expressing clusters C35 GABA4 and C35 GABA3, but with C35 Glut10 neurons being the most affected (Fig. 7a). These same neuronal populations also ranked high (sixth, ninth and third, respectively) after treatment with acyl-GLP-1 (Fig. 7b), but ranked low following treatment with acyl-GIP or MAR709 (Fig. 7c,d). Collectively, these data again suggest that GIPR antagonism, unlike agonism, mimics GLP-1R agonism in the DVC and that GIPR, unlike GLP-1R, is the primary target for MAR709 in the DVC.

a–d, Bar plots and UMAP representations of gene expression in DVC neurons of male DIO mice treated with a GIPR antagonist (ant.) (a), acyl-GLP-1 (b), acyl-GIP (c) or MAR709 (d) (n = 6 mice per group, from which n = 3 mice were pooled to receive n = 2 independent biological replicates per group).

Only the top 15 DEGs are highlighted. Venn diagrams show the overlap of significant DEGs (adjusted P < 0.05) from GIPR antagonist and acyl-GLP-1 groups. P values of DEGs were obtained by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

We next compared the differentially expressed genes induced by either GIPR antagonism or GLP-1R agonism in the C35 Glut10, C35 GABA4 and C35 GABA3 clusters (Fig. 7e–g), that is, in the three neuronal populations most affected by GIPR antagonism (Fig. 7a). In all three neuronal clusters, we found a similar pattern of gene expression changes after treatment with the GIPR antagonist and acyl-GLP-1, with 29 genes in the C35 Glut10 cluster, 29 genes in the C35 GABA4 cluster and 45 genes in the C35 GABA3 cluster affected by both GLP-1R agonism and GIPR antagonism (Fig. 7e–g). Most of the genes downregulated by GLP-1R agonism and GIPR antagonism were associated with neural plasticity and synapse formation, including neuregulin 3 (Nrg3), neurexin 3 (Nrxn3), discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 2 (Dlg2), sodium leak channel, non-selective (Nalcn), neurotrimin (Ntm), leucine rich repeat and Ig domain containing 2 (Lingo2), leucine rich repeat containing 4C (Lrrc4c), interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein like 1 (Il1rapl1) and glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B (Grin2b) (Fig. 7e–g). Notably, Nrxn3, which encodes for a synaptic adhesion protein critical for maintaining synaptic function43, was downregulated by GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism in both the C35 GABA4 and the C35 GABA3 cluster (Fig. 7f,g), while Nrg3, which regulates excitatory synapse formation44, was strongly downregulated in C35 Glut10 and C35 GABA3 neurons by GIPR antagonism but not by GLP-1R agonism (Fig. 7e,g). Furthermore, we found that Lrrc4c and Il1rapl1, both of which encode for factors that are involved in excitatory synapse formation45,46,47, were downregulated by GIPR antagonism and by GLP-1R agonism in the C35 Glut10 cluster (Fig. 7e). In summary, these data not only show that GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism act on the same neuronal populations in the DVC, but also that they similarly downregulate gene programmes implicated in synaptic plasticity and synapse formation.

We next turned our attention to the hypothalamus. Here, we found only low expression of Gipr across all neuronal types, while Glp-1r was more robustly expressed; particularly, and keeping with the HypoMap48 annotations, in C66-19: Pomc.GLU-5; C66–22: Caprin2.GLU-6; C66–41: Nkx2-4.GABA-3; C66–45: Ghrh.GABA-3; C66–49: Satb2.GABA-6 and C66–50: Chat.GABA-7 neurons (Fig. 8a–e). In contrast to our observations in the DVC (Fig. 7a,b), cell type prioritization analysis revealed that neuron types with high Glp-1r expression do not consistently have the largest changes in gene expression after treatment with either the GIPR antagonist or acyl-GLP-1 (Fig. 8f,g). This observation aligns also with a generally lower correlation in gene expression in hypothalamic neurons of both mice treated with the GIPR antagonist or acyl-GLP-1, and further in mice treated with acyl-GIP or MAR709 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–f). Notably, we found that C66–48: Meis2.GABA-5 neurons are the most affected by GLP-1R agonism, and C66–45: Ghrh.GABA-3 neurons are most affected by GIPR agonism, but both of these populations were less affected after treatment with the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h).

To infer whether the observed changes in transcriptional gene programmes indicative of reduced synaptic plasticity by GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism in the DVC translate to altered signalling in the hypothalamus, we performed a cell–cell communication analysis using the LIANA+49 implementation of the CellPhoneDB50 algorithm, and the receptor–ligand database from NeuronChat51 (Fig. 8h). Cell–cell communication analysis in dissociated single-cell data infers likely communication events from the expression of known ligand–receptor pairs across different cell types to predict interactions based on transcriptomic profiles. We found similar alterations in the probability of cell–cell communication events between C35 GABA4 and C35 Glut10 sender neurons and hypothalamic receiver neurons after treatment with acyl-GLP-1 or the GIPR antagonist compared with vehicle DIO controls, which clearly diverge from that of acyl-GIP (Fig. 8h). Treatment with the GIPR antagonist and acyl-GLP-1 both led to a reduction in the likelihood of Nrxn3-Nlgn1 signalling between C35 GABA4 neurons and Pomc.GLU-5 and Agrp.GABA-4 neurons, a change that was specific to these feeding-related neurons and absent in other hypothalamic neurons (Fig. 8h). Similarly, we observed a decrease in the likelihood of Nrxn1-Nlgn1 signalling from C35 Glut10 neurons to Pomc.GLU-5 and Agrp.GABA-4 neurons (Fig. 8h). We did not observe a difference between Pomc.GLU-5 and Agrp.GABA-4 neurons and all other hypothalamic neurons in these signalling pathways in mice treated with acyl-GIP or MAR709 (Fig. 8h and Extended Data Fig. 5i). Together, these data suggest that GLP-1R agonism and GIPR antagonism may exert their effects on energy balance by downregulating signalling from DVC C35 GABA4 and C35 Glut10 neurons to hypothalamic feeding circuits.

In non-neuronal cells, we found in the DVC the highest expression of Gipr in oligodendrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d), which further constituted the most affected cell type in this area after treatment with either acyl-GIP or MAR709 (Extended Data Fig. 6e–h). In contrast to this, while non-neuronal Gipr expression was also in the hypothalamus highest in oligodendrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7a–e), this cell type was, in this area, among the least affected after treatment with either acyl-GIP or MAR709 (Extended Data Fig. 7f–i). We also found tanycytes and ependymal cells among the most affected cell types in all treatment groups in the hypothalamus, that is, cell types with privileged access to the third ventricle and which have previously been implicated in the food intake inhibitory effects of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide52.

To compare cell types with the neuronal populations we identified, we integrated our DVC data with two publicly available murine DVC datasets from Hes et al.53 and from Ludwig et al.54. This presented a particular challenge as, in addition to the expected variation from different laboratories, each dataset had been produced using different experimental groups. As each dataset has multiple experimental groups, to correct for the variance between studies while preserving variance between cell types and experimental groups, we trained the single-cell variational inference (scVI) model55 on the control groups from each study with the study as the batch key, and then integrated the experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). Most experimental groups from all three datasets integrated well, however, neurons from mice treated once daily with semaglutide in the Ludwig54 dataset did not integrate well, suggesting that longer-term administration of GLP-1R agonists continue to have a large impact on DVC neuron cell state after the initial dose, although this difference may be confounded by the reduction in body weight (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

To validate our cell typology framework, we predicted the cell-type labels from our framework using progressive learning through scHPL56 and compared them to the author-provided cell types for both the Hes53 and Ludwig54 datasets (Extended Data Figs. 9a and 10a). We observed good concordance of major cell types at the C12 annotation level between our data and both the Hes53 and Ludwig54 datasets; however, at the C35 level, most neuron subclusters mapped to the largest glutamatergic or GABAergic neuron cluster, probably owing to the persistent differences between cells from the different experimental conditions.

In this study, we assessed the effect on energy metabolism by GIPR antagonism in several mouse lines with global or targeted deficiency of Gipr or Glp-1r. We further delineated the transcriptional similarities and differences of GIPR (ant)agonism, GLP-1R agonism and GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonism in the hypothalamus and DVC of DIO mice using snRNA-seq analysis. Similar to GIPR agonism15,18, we found the reduction of body weight and food intake caused by GIPR antagonism was eliminated in mice with global loss of Gipr. However, while we and others previously showed that GIPR agonism remains fully efficacious to decrease body weight and food intake in mice deficient for Glp-1r15,18, here we found that loss of Glp-1r renders mice resistant to weight loss and inhibition of food intake by GIPR antagonism. Furthermore, while we and others previously showed that GIPR agonism decreases body weight and food intake via Gipr signalling in GABAergic neurons14,19, here we found that the ability of GIPR antagonism to amplify GLP-1-induced weight loss does not depend on the presence of GIPR in GABAergic neurons. Likewise, we show that the ability of GIPR antagonism to enhance GLP-1-induced weight loss is also preserved in mice with peripherin-Cre-mediated loss of Gipr in the PNS. We should note here that the preservation of weight loss and food intake inhibition by GIPR antagonism in mice with disturbed GIPR signalling in the PNS is not unexpected, given that mice with CNS loss of Gipr (thus, mimicking the use of an antagonist) show decreased body weight and food intake when fed a HFD15, suggesting that the reduction in body weight by GIPR antagonism is mediated by neurons of the central rather than peripheral nervous system. Consistent with this is also our observation that the body weight-lowering effects of GIPR antagonism depend on GLP-1R signalling, which likewise are mediated via central rather than peripheral, mechanisms40. Relevant brain areas implicated in GLP-1 control of body weight and food intake include the the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus57,58,59 and the hindbrain DVC59,60, hence the same brain regions that are targeted by long-acting GIPR agonists15,20,21. Notably, the same brain regions are also targeted by the bispecific GIPR antagonist-GLP-1R agonist antibody, GIPR-Ab/GLP-1, as shown in an accompanying manuscript by Liu et al.61. In that study, the authors further utilized pharmacology and mouse genetics to provide complementary evidence supporting a role for attenuation of CNS GIPR signalling in the enhancement of the weight loss effects induced by the GLP-1R agonist dulaglutide61. Furthermore, weight loss achieved using GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 was attenuated in mice with CNS loss of either Gipr or Glp-1r61. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the major experimental findings described herein, and further corroborate that GIPR antagonism acts centrally to amplify GLP-1-induced weight loss. Nonetheless, although mice with GIPR signal inhibition in the PNS do not show alterations in body weight and remain fully sensitive to weight loss induced by GIPR antagonism, these mice develop glucose intolerance with impaired glucose-induced secretion of insulin and GIP when fed a HFD. We hence establish a crucial role of GIPR signalling in peripheral neurons in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, but not body weight, under conditions of diet-induced obesity. Collectively, our data show that GIPR agonism and antagonism decrease body weight and food intake via different neuronal mechanisms, with GIPR antagonism, unlike agonism, depending on GLP-1R signalling but not GIPR signalling in either GABAergic or peripheral neurons.

In agreement with this finding, our snRNA-seq analysis revealed that GIPR antagonism, but not agonism, mimics GLP-1R agonism in the DVC. DVC neuronal gene expression changes correlate negatively in mice after treatment with GIPR agonism versus antagonism, but positively in mice treated with GIPR antagonism versus GLP-1R agonism. We observed the greatest transcriptional changes induced by GIPR antagonism in the C35 GABA4, C35 GABA3 and C35 Glut10 neurons, which were also among the highest affected neuronal populations targeted by GLP-1R agonism, but not by GIPR agonism. Interestingly, within these neuronal clusters, GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism are separated from GIPR agonism in that they both similarly downregulate gene programmes indicative of neuronal plasticity and synapse formation. These findings further support the notion that GIPR antagonism and GLP-1R agonism are functionally related and act similarly on DVC neurons, and in a clearly distinct manner from GIPR agonism. In summary, we show here that GIPR agonism and antagonism affect body weight and food intake via different, rather than similar mechanisms, with GIPR antagonism affecting body weight and food intake via modulation of GLP-1R signalling. The observation that gene expression changes induced by GIPR agonism versus its antagonism correlate negatively further argues that our GIPR agonist is not a functional antagonist.

It warrants clarification as to how GIPR antagonism decreases body weight in a GLP-1R-dependent manner. The observation that the body weight-lowering effect of GIPR antagonism vanishes in mice with global deletion of both Gipr and Glp-1r potentially points to an inhibitory mechanism by which non-GABAergic GIPR+ neurons partially silence GLP-1R+ neurons so that the latter are less than maximally efficacious. Antagonization of these GIPR+ neurons may thus either directly or indirectly derepress the action of downstream GLP-1R+ neurons to further decrease body weight and food intake. Notably, like previous studies21, we here find expression of Gipr enriched in 5-HT neurons. Given their established role in regulating hunger and satiety62,63 and the recent demonstration that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist lorcaserin acts on brainstem GLP-1 neurons to augment food intake suppression by GLP-1R agonism64, it seems plausible to hypothesize that weight loss induced by GIPR signal modification may involve modulation of the hypothalamic and/or hindbrain serotonergic system.

Limitations of our study include that peripherin-Cre does not target all neurons of the PNS. We hence cannot exclude the possibility that peripherin-negative neurons of the PNS play a functional role in the metabolic effects of GIPR antagonism. Since expression of peripherin is not fully exclusive for the PNS, we further cannot exclude the possibility that GIPR was also deleted in our studies in peripherin-expressing neurons outside the PNS. Different molecules with GIPR (ant)agonism may further differ in their pharmacokinetics, including their biodistribution and brain penetrance, which may affect their mode of action in the brain and the periphery. The lack of commonly available and sufficiently selective antibodies to detect GIPR further remains a notable limitation that hinders in-depth immunohistochemical analysis of GIPR in the brain. Notably, expression of drug effects appears generally more robust when comparing relative as compared with absolute values, which is a common problem in biomedical sciences that resides in the typically observed greater data variability in absolute versus relative data. Another limitation of our study is that we only compared drug effects using snRNA-seq after single acute drug treatment, hence not allowing conclusions on transcriptomic changes after more chronic treatment. Further limitations are that the Vgat-Gipr KO and WT mice differ in their starting body weight, which urges caution when comparing drug-induced effects across genotypes. We further only demonstrated the GLP-1R-dependent body weight-lowering effect of GIPR antagonism in mice with global deletion of GLP-1R and GIPR. It warrants clarification whether this effect holds true also in mice with more CNS-targeted deletion of GIPR and GLP-1R. We further only tested drug effects in DIO and glucose intolerant male mice, since female mice are largely resistant to development of diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance65. It should further be noted that measures of drug effects on body weight are generally more robust than changes in food intake, since mice often have a tendency to shred their food, which if unnoticed, may contribute to a certain degree of bias in the analysis. To not interfere with drug-induced body weight effects, we could further only measure glucose tolerance at the end of the study. Since instant assessment of insulin tolerance using an intraperitoneal (i.p.) insulin tolerance test was not possible due to animal ethics reasons, we were further only able to measure insulin sensitivity using the HOMA-IR, which nonetheless correlates well with direct measures of insulin sensitivity using either i.p. insulin tolerance test or clamps66,67,68,69.

Experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Protection Law of the European Union after permission by the Government of Upper Bavaria, or the Eli Lilly and Company Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were double or single housed and, unless otherwise indicated, fed ad libitum with either a regular chow (1314, Altromin) or a HFD (58% fat, D12331, Research Diets) diet under constant ambient conditions of 22 ± 2 °C with constant humidity (45–65%) and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. C57BL/6J Vgat-ires-cre knock-in mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (028862) and crossed with C57BL6/J Giprflx/flx mice35,36 to generate Vgat-cre+/−Giprflx/flx (Vgat-Gipr KO) mice and Vgat-cre+/−Giprwt/wt (WT) controls. Per-Cre mice37 (MGI ID:3841120) were crossed with C57BL/6J mice for >10 generations before pairing with C57BL6/J Giprflx/flx mice35,36 to receive Per-cre+/−Giprflx/flx (Per-Gipr KO) mice and Per-cre+/−Giprwt/wt (WT) controls. Body composition was analysed using a magnetic resonance whole-body composition analyser (EchoMRI).

For assessment of drug effects under room temperature (22 ± 2 °C), male age-matched mice were double housed and fed with a 58% HFD (D12331, Research Diets) for approximately 20 weeks, followed by random assignment into groups of matched genotype, body weight and body composition. Mice were treated at the indicated doses with either long-acting acyl-GIP (IUB0271)13,14,15, acyl-GLP-1 (IUB1746)13,14,15, the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 (refs. 13,14,15) or an acylated peptide GIPR antagonist ([Nα-Ac,L14,R18,E21]hGIP(5–31)-K11(γE-C16))22. All peptides were provided by the Novo Nordisk Research Center Indianapolis, and have been previously validated in vitro and in vivo for receptor specificity and their ability to decrease body weight in DIO mice13,14,15,22,41. All sequences of the used peptides are published elsewhere13,14,15,22. For assessment of drug effects under thermoneutrality (28 °C), 12–14-week-old male age-matched mice were acclimatized to the housing temperature 2 weeks before start of the studies. At study start, male C57BL6J WT, as well as global Glp-1r−/− and Gipr−/− deficient mice were continued to be housed at thermoneutrality (28 °C) and given ad libitum access to a HFD (60% fat, D12492; Research Diets) and treated with a single dose (30 mg kg−1) of either a control mAb or a GIPR antagonist mAb23 (synthesized and provided by Eli Lilly and Company).

Plasma levels of glucose and insulin were measured after 6 h fasting. For assessment of glucose tolerance, glucose was administered i.p. at a dose of 1.5–2 g kg−1. For assessment of insulin tolerance, insulin (Humalog; Eli Lilly) was injected i.p. at a dose of 0.75–1.5 U kg−1. HbA1c was assessed from fresh blood using the DCA Vantage Analyzer (Siemens). For assessment of glucose-induced insulin secretion, glucose was given orally at a dose of 4 g kg−1 in 6 h fasted mice, followed by blood sampling at timepoints 0, 2, 5, 15 and 30 min after glucose administration. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used according to the manufacturer's instruction to measure insulin (Crystal Chem Zaandam, 90080), total GIP (Sigma-Aldrich, EZRMGIP-55K), triglycerides (Wako Chemicals, 290-63701 or Abcam, ab65336) or total cholesterol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10178058).

Energy expenditure, food intake, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and locomotor activity were assessed for 96–132 h, and after 24 h of acclimatization, in single-housed mice using the Promethion climate-controlled indirect calorimetric system (Sabel Systems). For assessment of acute food intake, mice were treated with either vehicle or acyl-GIP (IUB0271)13,14,15 at the indicated doses, followed by measurement of food intake for 16 h. Data for energy expenditure were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with body weight as a covariate70,71.

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) or the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was profiled using SYBR green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Quantstudio 7 flex cycler (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression levels of each gene were normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (Ppia), hypoxanthin-phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (Hprt) or the TATA-binding protein (Tbp). The decision to use either Ppia, Hprt or Tbp was made based on the lowest variability of the housekeeper across the samples in the given tissue. Primer sequences were Ppia-F: 5′-GAG CTG TTT GCA GAC AAA GTT C-3′; Ppia-R: 5′-CCC TGG CAC ATG AAT CCT GG-3′; Hprt-F: 5′-AAG CTT GCT GGT GAA AAG GA-3′; Hprt-R: 5′-TTG CGC TCA TCT TAG GCT TT-3′; Gipr-F: 5′-GGC CCA GAT CAT GAC CCA AT-3′; Gipr-R: 5′-AGC CAA GAA GCA GGT AGC AG-3′; Prph-F: 5′-AAG TTT AAA GAC GAC TGT GCC TG-3′; Prph-R: 5′-TGC TGT TCC TTC TGG GAC TCT-3′; Tbp-F: 5′-GAA GCT GCG GTA CAA TTC CAG-3′; Tbp-R: 5′-CCC CTT GTA CCC TTC ACC AAT-3′. All raw CT values are stated in the Source data.

For brain isolation, mice were perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were then fixed for 24 h at 4 °C in 4% PFA and then transferred to 15% sucrose for 24 h, followed by 24 h in 30% sucrose at 4 °C. For DRG, trigeminal ganglion and nodose ganglion, tissues were extracted and fixed for 1–2 h in 4% PFA and transferred to 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. All tissues were frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T (Sakura Finetek, 4583), cut in 12–14 µm sections and placed on microscopic slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10149870). The slides were heated for 30 min at 60 °C followed by antigen retrieval using a steamer, then processed by the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent kit v2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323270) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, a custom-made probe was designed to bind to the deleted exons of mouse Gipr (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 1138821-C1) and Vgat (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 319191-C2) hybridized to the RNA, before preamplifiers, amplifiers and dyes were added for visualization of GIPR and Vgat. The slides were incubated with rabbit anti-peripherin antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA316723; 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 30 min incubation with goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A16096, 1:1,000) at room temperature. TSA vivid dyes 650 and 520 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323271 and 323273, both 1:500 dilution) were added to detect GIPR, peripherin or vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), respectively. Slides were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 320858) and imaged using Leica SP8 Laser Confocal Microscope using LAS X (version 3.5.7.23225).

Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, followed immediately by clamping of the bile duct and perfusion with collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics, 11249002001). Tissues were incubated in a 15 ml Falcon tube with 1 ml of collagenase P solution for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 12 ml of cold G-solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifugation at 586g at room temperature. The pellet was subsequently washed with 10 ml of G-solution (500 ml HBSS (Life Technologies, BE10-508F) with 10% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, 126615-25 ml) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies, 15140122)) and resuspended in 5.5 ml of gradient solution comprising 15% Optiprep (5 ml 10% RPMI (Life Technologies, 11875093) + 3 ml of 40% Optiprep that was diluted from 60% Optiprep with G-solution (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556)) per sample, and placed on top of 2.5 ml of the gradient solution. To form a three-layer gradient, 6 ml of the G-solution was added on the top. Samples were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 630g. The interphase was then collected and filtered through a 70 μm nylon filter (BD Falcon, 352350), before washing with G-solution. Islets were handpicked by a micropipette under the microscope and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, 11875093) overnight.

Culture medium was removed and islet microtissues were equilibrated for 1 h with Krebs Ringer HEPES buffer (131 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 25 mM HEPES, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4 and 2% BSA) containing 2.8 mM glucose. The supernatant was collected as a sample under the low glucose condition for 45 min incubation, and islets were incubated for another 45 min at 37 °C with Krebs Ringer HEPES buffer containing 16.7 mM glucose and supplements as above. The supernatant was collected as a sample under the high glucose condition and stored at −20 °C. For drug-induced insulin secretion, native mouse GIP or GLP-1 (provided by Novo Nordisk) were diluted in 1× KRK buffer with 20 mM glucose to reach a concentration of 50 nM. Cells were subsequently treated with either mouse GIP or GLP-1 for 45 min. Insulin concentrations were determined using a Mouse Insulin ELISA (Crystal Chem, 90082).

For snRNA-seq, 35-week-old DIO mice were treated 2 h before the end of the light phase with a single s.c. injection of either vehicle (PBS), acyl-GIP (150 nmol kg−1)13,14,15, acyl-GLP-1 (50 nmol kg−1)13,14,15, the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 (50 nmol kg−1)13,14,15 or an acylated peptide GIPR antagonist (1,500 nmol kg−1)22. The hypothalamus and DVC were collected 8 h after drug administration and stored in liquid nitrogen. Mice were euthanized followed by immediate decapitation and then the skull was removed. An earlier alignment of the brain was determined using a brain matrix and the entire hypothalamus (includes all the nuclei) was collected by microdissection. The hindbrain DVC was microdissected in an area postrema-centric manner after removal of cerebellar cortex. Tissue samples were flash frozen into liquid nitrogen and frozen tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen vapour phase for further processing to single-nuclei isolation. Nuclei were isolated using the 10X Genomics Chromium Nuclei Isolation kit including RNase Inhibitor (10X Genomics, PN-1000494), and using the 10X Genomics protocol for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression (10X Genomics, CG000505 Rev A). Nuclei concentration was determined using a Luna-II Automated Cell Counter (Logos biosystems, L40002) and adjusted to 6,250 nuclei per microlitre after pooling of n = 3 mice per sample. Nuclei were then processed using the 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression (Rev. E) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pooled samples were loaded into two lanes per group for a total of 24 lanes across three 10X Chromium chips. Equal numbers of cells per sample were loaded on a 10X Genomics Chromium controller instrument to generate single-cell gel beads in emulsion at the Helmholtz Munich Genomics Core Facility. Single-nucleus multimodal libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. FASTQ files were generated from base calls with bcl2fastq software v2.20 (Illumina). Reads were mapped to the pre-built mm10 mouse reference (University of California Santa Cruz mm10 reference genome) using Cell Ranger ARC (v2.0.2, 10X Genomics) with default parameters. The resulting cell-by-peak and cell-by-gene matrices (ATAC and gene expression assays, respectively) from the 24 samples were integrated using Cellranger aggr (10X Genomics).

The raw gene expression matrix was filtered after removal of cells with either more than five mean absolute deviations more mitochondrial gene expression unique molecular identified counts, fewer than 500 detected genes or with more than 5 mean absolute deviations in total unique molecular identified counts. Scrublet72 was used to identify likely doublets, Leiden clustering was performed and clusters containing majority likely doublets were removed. After filtering, 211,537 nuclei from the hypothalamus and 57,798 nuclei from the DVC were used for further analysis. The processed gene expression matrix was imported into Scanpy (v1.9.8)73 and normalized using Scran74. The 4,000 most-variable genes were used for principal component analysis and the top 50 principal components were used for the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization. We built a k-nearest neighbour graph for clustering using k = 50 nearest neighbours. Then, the Leiden clustering algorithm was used to group the cells into different clusters. To annotate hypothalamic cells, we used scArches75 to transfer labels from the HypoMap48 at the C66 cell annotation level. Then the expression of marker genes from the HypoMap was evaluated in each Leiden cluster, and then was manually annotated informed by marker gene expression and the majority cell type from scArches label transfer. The HypoMap hierarchical cell-type annotation framework was then used to map C25, C7 and C2 cell-type annotations. To annotate DVC cell types, as there is no comparable atlas and annotation framework to the hypomap for the DVC, each Leiden cluster was manually annotated into 35 fine-grained cell types (C35 cell type), and were then mapped to the coarser-grained C12 and C2 levels of cell type based on the expression of marker genes. DVC neurons were further subdivided into individual clusters labelled by major neurotransmitter expression.

For comparison of gene expression differences in DVC and hypothalamic neurons, the mean log fold difference in normalized expression of each gene was compared between the treatment groups and the DIO control group. Linear regression and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between treatment groups. Cell type prioritization was done using the Pertpy76 implementation of Augur42, which uses a random forest classifier to assess how accurately the experimental condition of cells within a given cell type can be predicted based on their gene expression profiles. The Augur score is given by the performance of the classifier, measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Cell type prioritization comparisons are always made between the experimental group and the DIO vehicle control. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using Scanpy's tl.rank_genes_groups function to identify genes that were differentially expressed between two experimental groups within a given cell type, genes with fewer than 30 counts were filtered for each comparison. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to assess differences in gene expression between groups. Default parameters were used, and multiple testing was accounted for by adjusted P values using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Only genes with an adjusted P value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Cell–cell communication between DVC and hypothalamic cells was performed using LIANA+49 implementation of the CellPhoneDB50 algorithm combined with the receptor–ligand database from NeuronChat51. DVC neurons were specified as sender cell types and hypothalamic neurons as receiver cell types.

We selected the 2,500 most variable genes in our DVC snRNA-seq data and used scVI55 to integrate snRNA-seq data from Ludwig et al.54 and Hes et al.53, subset to the same 2,500 genes. We used treeArches to create a manual tree with three layers of granularity in cell type in our data. We trained the scVI model on the control groups from each dataset using the study as the batch variable, then updated the model with the experimental groups. We mapped our own data with the Hes53 and Ludwig54 datasets into a joint latent space using scArches75, and then mapped the parameters for hierarchical progressive learning from scHPL v1.0.5 (ref. 56) to predict the cell type from our annotation framework each cell type from the Hes53 and Ludwig54 datasets correspond to.

In vivo studies were performed in male or female age-matched mice that were randomly distributed to achieve groups of equal body weight and body composition. The number of independent biological samples per group is indicated in the figure legends and Source data. No animals were excluded from the studies unless health issues demanded exclusion of single mice (for example, due to fighting injuries) as indicated in the Source data. For in vivo studies, drugs were aliquoted by a lead scientist in number-coded vials and most, but not all, handling investigators were blinded to the treatment condition. Analyses of glucose and insulin tolerance were performed by experienced research assistants who did not know prior treatment conditions.

For animal studies, sample sizes were calculated based on a power analysis assuming that a body weight difference of ≥5 g between the treatment groups can be captured with a power of ≥75% when using a two-sided, two-tailed statistical test under the assumption of a s.d. of 3.5 and an α level of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical tools implemented in GraphPad Prism10 (version 10.0.3) and after testing of data for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, D'Agostino and Person test, Anderson–Darling test or Shapiro–Wilk test implemented in GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.3). Nonparametric tests such as the Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to analyse data that were not normally distributed. Normally distributed data were analysed with the following parametric tests: two-tailed Student's t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA with time and genotype as co-variants followed by Bonferroni's post hoc multiple comparison test for individual timepoints. All data met the assumption of the statistical tests used. All results are given as mean ± s.e.m. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, with asterisks indicating significance at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. Differences in energy expenditure were calculated using ANCOVA with body weight as co-variate using SPSS (version 24). No data were excluded from the analysis unless for animal welfare reasons (for example, injury due to fighting) or identification of singular outlier using Grubbs test. Individual P values and outliers are shown in the Source data, unless P < 0.0001.

The snRNA-seq data are available in the GEO under SuperSeries accession number GSE288514. All data used for the statistical analysis are available in the data source file, along with the GraphPad Prism-derived report on the statistical analysis. The statistical report contains the mean difference between the treatment groups, the 95% confidence intervals, the significance summary and the exact p values (unless P < 0.0001).

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes nearly 38,000 cancers a year, including most cervical and throat cancers. Now recent research suggests HPV infection also increases the risk of heart disease. An analysis of seven studies with a total of nearly 250,000 participants found that those who tested positive for HPV were 33 percent more likely than those who tested negative to develop cardiovascular disease.

Now Stephen Akinfenwa, an internal medicine resident at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and one of the lead authors of the analysis, says he would like to study whether the HPV vaccine, which can prevent 90 percent of cervical cancers, also reduces the risk of heart disease.

The vaccine, which has been recommended for adolescents since 2006, protects against infection with nine strains of HPV, including high-risk types that are the most likely to cause cervical cancer, as well as strains that cause genital warts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that boys and girls receive a series of two HPV shots at ages 11 or 12 as part of their routine childhood vaccinations—and that people receive three shots if their first dose is instead administered between the ages of 15 and 26. The vaccine is most protective when given before people become sexually active.

The HPV vaccine has been strikingly effective. Cervical cancer deaths in women under age 25—the first generation eligible to receive the vaccine—fell by 65 percent from 2012 to 2019.

Learning that heart disease may be related to HPV is exciting because HPV infection is preventable, Akinfenwa explains. “It feels like good news,” he says. “We're hoping that [the vaccine] will be a powerful tool for prevention.”

Akinfenwa and his colleagues presented a condensed version of their analysis in March at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology. It has not yet been published as a peer-reviewed study. The analysis included studies published between 2011 and 2024 that followed women for three to 17 years.

The largest study included in the analysis was published by researchers in South Korea in 2024 and followed apparently healthy women who were tested for 13 strains of high-risk HPV as part of a routine screening for cervical cancer. The women returned for health checks every year or two for an average of 8.6 years. Although heart disease and death were rare among these women, who had an average age of 40, those who tested positive for high-risk HPV were nearly four times as likely as those who tested negative to develop blocked arteries or die from heart disease, the study found.

Women aren't the only ones at risk, Akinfenwa says. In one paper included in the analysis, a 2017 study of people undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, 75 percent of patients were men. (Head and neck cancers are more than twice as common in men as they are in women, according to the National Cancer Institute.) The 2017 study found that people who tested positive for HPV were more likely to have strokes compared with those who tested negative.

HPV is ubiquitous and the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Among sexually active people, more than 90 percent of men and more than 80 percent of women are infected with HPV during their lifetime. About half of HPV infections involve high-risk strains that cause the bulk of cancers of the cervix, throat, vagina, vulva, anus and penis.

Vaccine hesitancy and lack of awareness about HPV has kept many parents from vaccinating their children against the infection, research shows. Some parents are reluctant to vaccinate their kids against HPV because they don't think their children will have sex as teenagers. Only 61 percent of adolescents are up to date on all HPV vaccines.

Even without a study that has specifically analyzed the effect of HPV vaccination on heart disease, the link between HPV and heart disease suggests that “vaccination is a good idea, and our study definitely supports that,” Akinfenwa says.

Given what scientists know about HPV, it's likely that the vaccine could prevent cases of heart disease related to the virus or at least the nine strains of the virus that are included in the shot, says Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who studies emerging infectious diseases and was not involved in the new analysis.

Other experts aren't so sure about the link between HPV and heart disease. Mark Einstein, chair of obstetrics and gynecology and women's health at Montefiore Einstein, who also was not involved in the analysis, says researchers have a long way to go before they can confidently say that the virus causes heart disease. “This sort of association has come up a number of times over the years,” Einstein says. “When you have a common disease—heart disease—and a common infection—HPV—it's easy to use statistical nuance to show a correlation,” he says. But “association is different than causality.”

Scientists don't know exactly how HPV may increase the risk of heart disease, but it's unlikely that the virus directly infects the heart or blood vessels, says C. Noel Bairey Merz, director of the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center at the Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute in Los Angeles, who was not involved in the new research.

HPV causes cancer in parts of the body that come into direct contact with the virus through sexual activity, says Kevin Ault, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine. The virus is not thought to travel to distant organs and cause lung or liver cancer, for example. “We usually don't think of human papillomavirus as going all around the body,” Ault says. “It's going to infect mostly skin” or mucous membranes.

Instead, Merz says, HPV probably increases the risk of heart disease by causing inflammation, which occurs as the immune system attempts to control the virus. Chronic inflammation has been shown to irritate blood vessels and can lead to the hardening of fatty plaques in the lining of the arteries, which reduces blood flow to the heart. Inflammation can also cause those plaques to burst and form blood clots, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.

Although the immune system naturally controls most HPV infections within a year or two, a small number of infections become chronic, a problem that increases the risk of cervical cancer, says Rebecca Perkins, obstetrician and gynecologist at the Woman, Mother and Baby Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center.

Even after HPV is controlled, the virus doesn't disappear from the body. Like the virus that causes chicken pox (varicella-zoster), HPV can lie dormant in the body for decades. And just as the varicella-zoster virus can reactivate decades after a childhood infection and cause shingles, HPV can wake up and cause women to test positive during cervical cancer screenings, Perkins says.

The studies included in the new analysis typically cited the result of a single test for HPV, Akinfenwa says. HPV tests are now included in most routine cervical cancer screenings, either alone or in combination with a Pap smear. So a positive test result cannot distinguish among a recent exposure, a reactivation of the virus and a chronic infection, Akinfenwa says.

Many pathogens can cause heart disease, Adalja says. A wide variety of viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi can trigger myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, which can make the heart too weak to pump blood efficiently. Those include the viruses that cause influenza and COVID. And untreated strep throat and scarlet fever, caused by Streptococcus bacteria, can lead to rheumatic fever, which can damage heart valves and cause heart failure.

“Many infectious diseases set off inflammatory cascades that can prompt cardiovascular and neurological events like heart attacks, blood clots and strokes,” Adalja says. “By staving off infection, [vaccinating] against these agents—such as influenza, varicella-zoster virus and, presumably, HPV—these events will be prevented or become less likely.”

Doctors have frequently been surprised by unexpected or off-target benefits from vaccines, Adalja says. A growing number of studies suggest that the shingles vaccine also reduces the risk of dementia—possibly by preventing the inflammation that contributes to the disease, Adalja says. The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis also has been found to reduce risk of other diseases in which the immune system goes awry, including type 1 diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. And an analysis published in 2024 found that meningitis vaccines reduced the incidence of gonorrhea by 30 to 59 percent. Such cross-protective immunity can occur when two bacteria are from similar families. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea is related to the meningococcus bacterium, which causes most cases of meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes around the brain, Adalja says.

To better understand how HPV damages the heart and whether the HPV vaccine might offer protection, Merz says, researchers could compare rates of chronic inflammation in adolescents who were vaccinated with rates in those who weren't vaccinated. “It's logical to think preventing the HPV infection itself via vaccination will reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,” Akinfenwa says. “Having said that, it needs to be tested.”

Metrics details

Qubit frequency shifts, which often contain information about a target environment variable, are detected with Ramsey interference measurements. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of this protocol is limited by decoherence. We introduce a new protocol to enhance the sensitivity of a qubit frequency measurement in the presence of decoherence by applying a continuous drive to stabilize one component of the Bloch vector. We demonstrate our protocol on a superconducting qubit, enhancing sensitivity per measurement shot by 1.65 × and sensitivity per qubit evolution time by 1.09 × compared to Ramsey. We also explore the protocol theoretically, finding unconditional enhancements compared to Ramsey interferometry and maximum enhancements of 1.96 × and 1.18 × , respectively. Additionally, our protocol is robust to parameter miscalibrations. It requires no feedback and no extra control or measurement resources, and can be immediately applied in a wide variety of quantum computing and quantum sensor technologies.

Ramsey interferometry1 has been long established as the most sensitive measure of a qubit's frequency2. In a Ramsey measurement, a qubit is prepared in a superposition of energy states, allowed to evolve freely and acquire phase, and then measured along some axis. The phase acquired (and thus the measured state probability) depends on the qubit frequency. This protocol has been used for quantum sensing of magnetic field and other continuous variables3,4,5, for foundational physics6,7, for biomedical applications8, for detection of non-equilibrium quasiparticle densities9,10,11, and for rapid recalibration of a qubit's frequency12, among many other applications. Decoherence at a rate γ2 = 1/T2 limits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of quantum sensors. To date, most work has focused on SNR scaling beyond the standard quantum limit of \(\sqrt{N}\) (where N is the number of independent qubits and/or measurements)13,14,15,16,17, using dynamical decoupling to enhance frequency discrimination and reduce or characterize non-Markovian decoherence18,19,20, using measurement-based feedback to rapidly lock in on large signals21, time-varying signals22, or an unknown signal axis23, and compensating for measurement errors24. Likewise, researchers have developed sensors which are less prone to decoherence25,26,27 and couple more strongly to wanted signals28,29,30. However, no results have shown improvement over traditional Ramsey interferometry for increasing the SNR from a single qubit measuring a small, static (zero frequency) signal.

Here, we demonstrate a protocol for enhanced quantum sensing of static fields. The protocol is based on a recent theory of quantum property preservation31 generalizing the coherence preservation results of ref. 32, showing how certain scalar functions of a quantum state can be stabilized using purely Hamiltonian control. We use deterministic Hamiltonian control of a single qubit to stabilize one Bloch vector component (vx), enabling increased phase accumulation in the orthogonal component vy and thus enhanced sensitivity. Our protocol gives a significant signal enhancement over standard Ramsey interferometry, up to a factor of 1.96 per measurement shot or 1.18 per qubit evolution time. We derive analytical expressions for the signal enhancement in the small-signal regime, and show simulations of the protocol's robustness to miscalibrations. The protocol is robust to variation in environmental parameters, requires no feedback (i.e., is unconditional and deterministic), and can be applied in a wide variety of experimental systems. Our results demonstrate a general technique for enhanced quantum sensing.

Consider a sensor that maps some environmental variable B to a qubit's frequency, and thus to the detuning Δ between qubit frequency and drive. We assume the transduction function Δ = f(B) is a fixed and known property of the sensor. The challenge is then to design a protocol that measures Δ as precisely as possible.

The qubit's state is given by the Bloch vector \(\overrightarrow{{{{\bf{v}}}}}=({v}_{x},{v}_{y},{v}_{z})=(\langle {\sigma}_{x} \rangle,\langle {\sigma}_{y} \rangle,\langle {\sigma}_{z} \rangle)\). We choose coordinates such that the initial state lies in the xz plane, \(\overrightarrow{{{{\bf{v}}}}}(0)=({v}_{x}(0),0,{v}_{z}(0))\). Detuning causes rotation about the z-axis, leading vy to grow proportionally to vx at a rate Δ. For small rotation angle, vy(t) is linearly proportional to Δ—this is the relevant limit for a weak signal with Δ ≪ γ2 = 1/T2. We can thus write vy = aΔ, where a depends on the protocol used and on γ2. The uncertainty in a measurement of Δ is thus

where N is the number of iterations of the measurement and the approximation is valid in the limit of small vy (see Supplementary Material for derivation). This means that to minimize δΔ, one should maximize \(a\sqrt{N}\), which is equivalent to maximizing \(\sqrt{N}{v}_{y}\) for a given detuning Δ.

We assume that state preparation and measurement errors affect all protocols equally and, therefore, ignore them for this analysis. We further assume that γ2 is a property of the sensor and is not affected by the protocol.

The task is thus to choose a protocol that will maximize \(\sqrt{N}{v}_{y}=\sqrt{\frac{T}{t+{t}_{i}}}{v}_{y}(t)\) for a given detuning Δ and decoherence rate γ2. Here T is the total experiment time, t is the time the qubit spends accumulating phase in an iteration, and ti is the “inactive” time spent preparing, reading out, and resetting the qubit in an iteration. When ti ≫ t ~ T2, N is essentially fixed and the goal is to maximize vy(t); when t ~ T2 ≫ ti, the goal is to maximize \({v}_{y}(t)/\sqrt{t}\).

Consider a qubit subject to relaxation at rate γ1 = 1/T1, dephasing at rate γϕ, detuning Δ, and a coherent drive Hdrive(t) = hy(t)σy. In a Ramsey sequence the qubit is prepared in the state \(\overrightarrow{v}(0)=(1,0,0)\) and allowed to freely evolve (hy = 0). When Δ ≪ γ2 = γϕ + γ1/2, this leads to a maximum y-component

at time t ≈ T2, and a maximum y-component per root evolution time

at t ≈ T2/2 (see Supplementary Material for derivations). These cases have \(a={(e{\gamma}_{2})}^{-1}\) with \(a\sqrt{N} \sim a\) and \(a={(2\sqrt{e}{\gamma}_{2})}^{-1}\) with \(a\sqrt{N} \sim a/\sqrt{t}={(2e{\gamma}_{2})}^{-1/2}\), respectively. As we can see, the value of a depends on the protocol used, including the measurement time chosen. We define the signal improvement ratio Rv (i.e., the SNR improvement per measurement shot) as the ratio of maximum vy from the given protocol to that from the Ramsey experiment, the latter being given by (2). Likewise, we define the signal per root evolution time improvement ratio Rs (i.e., the SNR improvement for fixed total evolution time) as the ratio of maximum \({v}_{y}/\sqrt{t}\) from the given protocol to that from the Ramsey experiment, the latter being given by (3). Note that the uncertainty in a measurement of detuning δΔ is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{N}{v}_{y}\) as given in (1). This means that our protocol reduces δΔ by a factor of Rv when N is fixed and by a factor of Rs when N ~ 1/t.

Our protocol uses Hamiltonian control to preserve state coherence32 and enhance sensitivity. The general theory is derived in31. Here we report the central results, with full details given in the Supplementary Material. Again, we have initial state \(\overrightarrow{{{{\bf{v}}}}}(0)=({v}_{x}(0),0,{v}_{z}(0))\). For small, unknown Δ ≪ γ2, we can stabilize vx(t) ≈ vx(0) for 0 ≤ t ≤ tb so long as vz(t) ≠ 0 by setting

where the stabilization is exact to 2nd order in Δ/γ2. In general, coherence will be transferred from vz to vx until vz → 0. At this breakdown time tb, the protocol fails and coherence must decay. However, stability can be achieved indefinitely if \({v}_{x}(0)\le \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{{\gamma}_{1}}{{\gamma}_{2}}}\), since at low temperature relaxation deterministically causes growth of vz towards its thermal value vz = 1—that is, relaxation takes the qubit to the ground state, and so the ground state population in an ensemble grows as a function of time. The drive can then rotate vz towards vx, transferring this ground state population to the desired vx, preserving coherence. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of a Bloch trajectory with coherence stabilization. Temperature effects are discussed later in the text and in the Supplementary Material.

a Simulated trajectories of the Bloch vector in the xz plane for a qubit state which is either allowed to freely evolve (star markers; steady decay of vx) or stabilized with our protocol (triangle markers; stabilized vx up to a breakdown time, followed by steady decay), with T1 = T2 = 1 and vx(0) = 0.68. The black curve is the ∣v∣ = 1 limit for a pure state. b, c 3D Bloch sphere plot of the same trajectories for stabilization (b) and free evolution (c). d Pulse sequence schematic of our stabilization protocol. We prepare a state in the xz plane at an angle θ from the z-axis, then stabilize the Bloch component \({v}_{x}=\sin \theta\) up to a breakdown time. After the breakdown we turn off the control and the state is allowed to freely decay. After a variable evolution time we perform quantum state tomography.

When vx is thus coherence-stabilized at \({v}_{x}^{c}\approx {v}_{x}(0)\) and the unknown detuning Δ ≠ 0, vy grows to an asymptotic maximum \({v}_{y}^{c}\to \frac{{v}_{x}(0)}{{\gamma}_{2}}\Delta\), leading to a signal improvement ratio (SNR per measurement shot improvement ratio) relative to Ramsey of Rv = evx(0). The maximum stable \({v}_{x}(0)=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{{\gamma}_{1}}{{\gamma}_{2}}}\) thus gives \({R}_{v}=\frac{e}{2}\sqrt{\frac{{\gamma}_{1}}{{\gamma}_{2}}}\). In the limit where relaxation dominates decoherence (γ1 = 2γ2), \({R}_{v}=\frac{e}{\sqrt{2}}\approx 1.922\).

We achieve a larger advantage, especially when γ1 < 2γ2, by using a state with a larger vx(0) and thus a finite breakdown time tb. We stabilize vx(t) until breakdown and then set hy = 0. In the small detuning limit, this gives improvement ratio

While there is a closed-form expression for tb in terms of vx(0)31, it does not allow an analytical solution for the maximum of (5) over all values of vx(0). Instead we optimize numerically, as discussed below, reaching a maximum of Rv = 1.96 when γ1 = 2γ2. Even in the limit of no relaxation where γ1 → 0, we find Rv = 1.09. Thus, our protocol can achieve an unconditional vy signal boost compared to Ramsey interferometry.

When the inactive time ti is negligible and (3) applies, we instead maximize the signal per root evolution time \({v}_{y}^{c}/\sqrt{t}\) over all times and initial states. In this case, using a permanently-stabilized state gives a maximum achievable advantage (when γ1 = 2γ2) of only Rs = 1.052, and can be disadvantageous when dephasing is non-negligible. However, using an initial state with a finite breakdown time leads to a larger and unconditional SNR enhancement. Once again we can find an analytic expression for the maximum SNR and improvement ratio in terms of the initial state vx(0) and breakdown time tb, but must numerically optimize over vx(0), as discussed in the Supplementary Material. We find Rs ≥ 1 for all values of γ1/γ2, reaching a maximum Rs = 1.184 when γ1 = 2γ2.

We can compare this protocol to others that use control to reduce the effects of decoherence such as spin locking and dynamical decoupling (DD). In spin locking, a strong constant drive along the axis of the Bloch vector causes any noisy Hamiltonian terms along orthogonal axes to average out, provided these terms are constant over the period required for the drive to rotate the vector a full revolution. Likewise, dynamical decoupling uses fast pulsed rotations to average out quasi-static noise. In both cases the protocols suppress decoherence due to slowly-varying noise and would cause complete insensitivity to detection of a static detuning, while sensitivity to an oscillatory detuning at particular frequencies is enhanced; this enhancement has been used in the past for optimizing sensing18,19,20. In contrast, our coherence stabilization protocol works for broadband Markovian decoherence and maintains sensitivity to static Hamiltonian terms.

We demonstrate our protocol using a superconducting qubit; device parameters and experimental details are given in the Methods. We first show coherence stabilization with Δ = 0. The experimental pulse sequence is shown in Fig. 1. We prepare a state in the xz plane with \(\overrightarrow{{{{\bf{v}}}}}(0)=(\sin \theta,0,\cos \theta)\). We then continuously drive the qubit to rotate the Bloch vector about the y-axis towards the x-axis. If the control exceeds the maximum output amplitude of our control electronics (near breakdown), we set it to 0 for the remainder of the evolution. We cut off the control after breakdown to prevent rotations from vx to vz that would decrease vx faster and reduce the growth of our vy signal.

Quantum state tomography data showing coherence stabilization for two different initial states is presented in Fig. 2a, b, along with theoretical predictions (not fits) generated by solving the Bloch dynamics for our system parameters. Depending on the initial state and the ratio γ1/γ2, the stabilization may exhibit a breakdown (panel (a)) or long-time stability (panel (b)). When the qubit is detuned from the drive frequency by some small detuning Δ ≪ γ2, vy(t) grows to some maximum. We set Δ/2π = 396 Hz and 324 Hz for the same states as Fig. 2a, b, respectively, and measure vy (Fig. 2c, d). We compare to vy from Ramsey sequences (vx(0) = 1) for the same detunings. For both states there is an enhanced vy signal compared to Ramsey, validating the essential aspect of our protocol. Note that these data were taken on different days and T2 drifted from 73 μs (c) to 89 μs (d), which accounts for the larger signal in (d) despite a smaller Δ.

a, b Bloch vector evolution, as measured through quantum state tomography, for a state with a vx(0) = 0.652 and breakdown at 148 μs and b vx(0) = 0.599 with no breakdown (i.e, a stable state). c, d Evolution of vy for the same initial states as in (a, b), with added small detuning Δ/2π = 396 Hz (c) and 324 Hz (d). Crucially, the stabilized states exhibit significantly larger signal than the Ramsey value.

To quantify the enhancement of signal Rv, we sweep the detuning Δ and measure the coherence-stabilized \({v}_{y}^{c}({t}_{\max},\Delta,\theta)\) for each initial state polar angle θ. Here, \({t}_{\max}\) is the predicted time of maximum \({v}_{y}^{c}\) (see Supplementary Material); for solutions with no breakdown we use \({t}_{\max}=350\,\mu {{{\rm{s}}}}\approx 5{T}_{2}\). We also measure the Ramsey evolution \({v}_{y}^{R}({T}_{2},\Delta)\) at t = T2 when theory predicts \({v}_{y}^{R}\) will be maximized. We then fit the slopes of \({v}_{y}^{c}\) and \({v}_{y}^{R}\) vs Δ and take their ratio to compute Rv. Results are plotted in Fig. 3(a.i), along with the theoretically-predicted Rv for the measured T1/T2 ratio. During this experiment we measured T1/T2 = 0.749 ± 0.112 and T2 = 83.4 ± 9.9 μs. Using our protocol with initial state θ = 0.198π and N shots, we are able to detect the qubit frequency with a minimum 1 − σ uncertainty of \(\sqrt{N}\delta {f}_{c}=3.4\pm 0.8\,{{{\rm{kHz}}}}\sqrt{{{{\rm{shots}}}}}\), compared to \(\sqrt{N}\delta {f}_{{{{\rm{R}}}}}=5.5\pm 0.7\,{{{\rm{kHz}}}}\sqrt{{{{\rm{shots}}}}}\) for Ramsey (variances are over repetitions of the experiment; see Supplementary Material for an explanation of the sensitivity calculation and units). Thus, our protocol reduces qubit frequency detection uncertainty by a factor of Rv = 1.62 ± 0.13 when t ≪ ti. Theory predicts \({v}_{y}^{c}\) will be maximized when θ = 0.213π [vx(0) = 0.671], with predicted Rv = 1.649. We find good agreement with the data with no free parameters, indicating that our protocol behaves as predicted.

Error bars are calculated from the variance of the ratio across many measurements. The dashed line is a theoretical prediction, not a fit, showing good agreement. Bottom row: Numerically simulated improvement ratio Rv (a.ii) and Rs (b.ii) as a function of initial state and T1/T2 ratio, for small detuning. Also shown are numerically simulated (markers) and analytically derived (dashed line) improvement ratio Rv (a.iii) and Rs (b.iii) at optimal initial state as a function of T1/T2.

To test the protocol under different environmental parameters, we numerically simulate the evolution as a function of initial state and T1/T2 ratio, all at small detuning Δ = 0.01/T2. Results are plotted in Fig. 3a.ii. We maximize over initial state at each T1/T2 and plot these maxima in Fig. 3a.iii. We find that Rv reaches a maximum value of 1.96 in the limit where relaxation dominates dephasing (T2 = 2T1), and has a minimum of 1.09 in the limit where dephasing dominates relaxation (T1 ≫ T2), as predicted by analytical theory (shown as a dashed line).

To quantify the enhancement of SNR per qubit evolution time Rs, we use a similar procedure as above, except that we measure the stabilized vy and Ramsey vy at the times theory predicts will maximize \({v}_{y}/\sqrt{t}\) (see Supplementary Material). Experimental, theoretical, and numerical results are plotted in Fig. 3b. During these measurements, T1/T2 = 0.764 ± 0.156 and T2 = 69.5 ± 10.6 μs. Using our protocol with initial state θ = 0.315π and total experiment time T, we find a minimum frequency detection uncertainty of \(\sqrt{T}\delta {f}_{c}=63\pm 4\,{{{\rm{Hz}}}}/\sqrt{{{{\rm{Hz}}}}}\), compared to \(\sqrt{T}\delta {f}_{{{{\rm{R}}}}}=70\pm 1\,{{{\rm{Hz}}}}/\sqrt{{{{\rm{Hz}}}}}\) with Ramsey. Again, our protocol reduces uncertainty by a factor of Rs = 1.11 ± 0.03 when ti ≪ t (see Methods). Our experimental results once more agree well with the theory, which predicts a maximum Rs = 1.094 at θ = 0.283π [vx(0) = 0.776] for this T1/T2 ratio. Theory and simulation show the improvement ratio Rs ranges from 1.184 when T2 = 2T1 to 1 when T1 ≫ T2.

A quantum sensor may have comparable inactive time ti and evolution time t, between the limits we study. For a fixed ti, the problem is to optimize \({v}_{y}(t)/\sqrt{t+{t}_{i}}\). Again, the Ramsey protocol can be optimized analytically, while our coherence stabilization protocol can be optimized numerically by the same procedure used above. The SNR improvement ratio will land somewhere between our two limiting cases, but will always be ≥1. For instance, when T2 = 2T1 and ti = 0.1T2, the SNR improvement is by a factor of 1.23, by a factor of 1.43 when ti = T2, and by a factor of 1.76 when ti = 10T2.

Optimal sensing depends on accurate knowledge of T1 and T2. To quantify the robustness of our protocol to miscalibrations, we simulate the Bloch evolution using the initial state, control field, and measurement time that would be optimal for a nominal T1 = T2 = 1 while varying the actual values of T1 and T2 that control the dynamics. Thus, we simulate a situation in which T1 and T2 have changed unbeknownst to the experimenter. We simulate Ramsey experiments with the same miscalibration: measurements are performed at times determined by the nominal T2, not the actual simulated one. We plot the SNR improvement ratios as a function of percentage change in γ1 = 1/T1 and γ2 = 1/T2 in Fig. 4. We see little change in the improvement ratios when T1 and T2 are miscalibrated by the same factor, as shown by the near-constant values along lines of constant T1/T2 ratio running diagonally from bottom left to top right. We see some dependence of the improvement ratios on changes in the T1/T2 ratio, as shown by the steepest gradient running approximately diagonally from top left to bottom right. The majority of this dependence is not due to miscalibration, but rather is due to the fact that Rv and Rs depend on T1/T2 even when perfectly calibrated. This can be seen in the plots as the large regions where SNR is improved even more than at the perfectly calibrated T1 and T2 (red color), due to the fact that T1/T2 has decreased. There is some additional SNR suppression due to using a suboptimal initial state and measurement time, which is evident in the top left corner of Fig. 4(b)—Rs dips slightly below 1, indicating worse performance than Ramsey, while an optimal protocol would always have Rs ≥ 1. Still, this requires quite a large deviation, with actual T2/T1 ~ 2/3 of its nominal value, and so the protocol is relatively robust to fluctuations in T1 and T2. Furthermore, we see from the experimental measurements in Fig. 3 that improvement on par with the theoretical maximum value for that T1/T2 ratio can be achieved, even in a real system with fluctuating coherence times.

a Rv and b Rs to miscalibrations of decoherence rates 1/T1 and 1/T2, for nominal T1/T2 = 1. Miscalibration of 1/T is defined as (Tnominal/Tactual − 1). White color is defined as the value at the perfectly-calibrated center point.

All results and theory thus far are derived or acquired in the low temperature limit where the qubit deterministically relaxes to the ground state (vz grows to 1). Higher temperature reduces the improvement our protocol can provide since there is no longer as fast of a growth in vz that can be transfered back to vx for stabilization. However, this only applies if the qubit begins in a state that is more pure than the thermal equilibrium state. In the case where the qubit is initialized in a partially-mixed thermal state, both Ramsey and stabilization protocols are affected equally, the breakdown time becomes independent of temperature, and the improvement factors Rv and Rs recover their low-temperature values. The effect of high temperature is also mitigated when relaxation is negligible. Even when state preparation is perfect, our protocol provides an signal boost Rv by a factor of at least 1.05 so long as T1 > 10T2 or the thermal state has \({v}_{z}^{{{{\rm{thermal}}}}} > 0.5\). In all cases our stabilization protocol is guaranteed to be non-inferior to Ramsey, as it reduces to a Ramsey protocol in the limit where vx(0) → 1.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a protocol for enhancing qubit sensitivity to weak environmental fields by stabilizing partial qubit coherence. Our protocol requires only deterministic Hamiltonian control and is therefore applicable to a wide variety of qubit technologies. In the limit where decoherence is dominated by relaxation, we show a theoretical maximum of a 1.96× improvement over standard Ramsey interferometry in SNR per measurement shot, and a 1.184× improvement in SNR per root qubit evolution time. In our experimental apparatus with dephasing comparable to relaxation and with fluctuating system parameters, we achieve improvements of 1.6× and 1.1× , respectively. Our results show a resource-efficient, broadly-applicable technique for unconditionally enhancing the SNR from qubit-based sensors and speeding calibration of qubit parameters.

A natural application of our technique is to sensing magnetic fields or, equivalently, measuring the field-to-frequency transduction function of a spin species. These measurements are typically done in ambient conditions far from the low-temperature limit which would seem to reduce the benefit that our protocol could give. However, often the system is initialized in a thermal state and so the low-temperature enhancement of signal versus Ramsey would apply.

While our technique provides a significant SNR boost over Ramsey interferometry, it is not fully optimal. For instance, if γ1 > 0 and the optimal measurement time is after breakdown, there will be some nonzero vz that could be used to boost signal. Thus, for each set of environmental conditions, there is likely a Bloch trajectory (i.e., an initial state and control Hamiltonian) that provides an even larger signal than our protocol of stabilizing coherence. This is a problem of optimal control, and as such can be tackled with control theory techniques33,34. It is a relatively unconstrained problem, as the initial state, final state, and final time are all variable. Given this lack of constraint, numerical solution methods will likely be required. Such optimal control has already been pursued in quantum sensing of time-varying signals20,35 and large signals36, and inspiration can be drawn from these results. In addition, it should be possible to stabilize properties of multi-qubit states31, including various entanglement measures37. Future work could therefore explore the possibility of extending our sensitivity enhancement to entangled states. We note that, like Ramsey, our protocol cannot achieve the Heisenberg limit of SNR scaling linearly with total experiment time T. Instead it maintains the standard quantum limit scaling of SNR with \(\sqrt{T}\). Combining our stabilization protocol with entanglement-based sensing, continuous weak-measurement feedback, and other sophisticated techniques could allow for further sensitivity gains38.

Our device is a standard grounded superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a quarter-wave transmission line cavity. Device parameters are given in Table 1, and the design is available on the SQuADDS database39. The qubit and cavity are far off resonance. In this dispersive regime there is approximately 0 energy exchange between qubit and cavity, but the cavity frequency shifts by χ/2π = 150 kHz when the qubit changes state. We measure the qubit by driving the cavity with an on-resonant pulse generated by mixing a carrier at the cavity frequency with a Gaussian envelope. The pulse transmits through the device, interacting with the cavity as it passes, then passes through an amplification chain up to room temperature, where we mix it back down to DC with an IQ mixer, giving a two-channel DC voltage signal that we then digitize. A diagram of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 5. We project the measured two-channel voltage onto an axis which gives maximum discrimination between the signals for qubit ground and excited states. We drive rotations of the qubit state by driving it with an on-resonance microwave pulse. The amplitude and duration of the pulse determine the total rotation angle, while the phase determines the rotation axis in the xy plane.

All qubit control envelopes are generated by the Zurich Instruments HDAWG, then upconverted and combined with measurement pulses from the ZI UHFQA before being fed into a heavily attenuated line. Readout signals are amplified and then downconverted and fed back into the UHFQA for analysis.

We begin by measuring the qubit's T1 (using a population decay measurement) and its T2 and frequency (using a standard Ramsey measurement). If the qubit frequency has drifted, we reset the drive frequency to be resonant, then detune it by Δ. We then calculate the control waveform to stabilize vx for our chosen initial state; in the case where we are stabilizing a state with a breakdown time and we want to extend the evolution past breakdown, we set the control to 0 after breakdown. We then calibrate the strength of our drives with a Rabi measurement, where we drive the qubit with a pulse of constant duration and variable amplitude. This pulse has a cosine envelope and is 2.35 μs in duration. We measure oscillations of the qubit population and thus extract the driven Rabi frequency at a given control output voltage. We use this to convert our calculated control waveform into output voltage units for our control electronics. Note that long qubit manipulation pulses are used because our control line is heavily attenuated in order to give fine resolution of the continuous control waveform.

We note that we initialize the qubit in a thermal state. Therefore the temperature factors into the state preparation fidelity and the low-temperature limit applies.

We use the same pulse envelope and duration for all qubit control pulses (except the continuous coherence-stabilizing drive)—we change the pulse rotation angle by changing the amplitude of the pulse, and change the rotation axis by changing the phase of the pulse. We therefore prepare a state with \({v}_{x}(0)=\sin \theta\) by driving a pulse with amplitude \(\frac{\theta}{\pi}{A}_{\pi}\), where Aπ is the amplitude of a π rotation pulse calibrated via the Rabi measurement. We next drive the continuous control waveform to stabilize the state for a time t. We then stop the control and perform quantum state tomography, measuring the qubit state along one axis. To measure vx, we apply a -π/2 rotation pulse about the y-axis, then drive a readout pulse on the cavity. To measure vy we use a π/2 rotation about the x-axis, then a readout pulse; to measure vz we use a 2π rotation about the y-axis, then readout. After a measurement we either do nothing or drive a π rotation of the qubit, conditional on the measurement outcome, to reset it to the ground state. We wait an additional 60 μs to damp any residual excited state population. We repeat each time point three times to measure all three Bloch vector components, then sweep t. Before measuring the first time point, we perform a measurement to calibrate the voltage corresponding to the ground state vz = 1; after the last time point, we perform a π rotation on the qubit and then measure to calibrate the voltage corresponding to the excited state vz = −1. We then repeat this entire process many times and directly average the measured voltages. We use these voltages as the reference values for vi = ±1 (i = {x, y, z}).

When comparing the signal from coherence stabilization vs Ramsey, we interleave the measurements to avoid errors due to drifts in qubit parameters. We use threshold assignment of the readout voltage to the ground or excited state in order to reduce noise in these small signals. To speed data collection, we only measure vy and ignore the other Bloch components and only measure at the optimal times for maximizing vy and \({v}_{y}/\sqrt{t}\) (T2 and T2/2, respectively, for Ramsey, and the times derived in the Supplementary Material for coherence-stabilized measurements). We interleave coherence-stabilized and Ramsey measurements for a given detuning and coherence-stabilized initial state, repeating many times to build up accurate estimates of vy. We then move on to the next detuning while keeping θ constant. We repeat these detuning sweeps many times to build up statistics, re-measuring T1 and T2 before each sweep. We then move on to the next initial state θ.

We take this set of coherence-stabilized and Ramsey data from the many detuning sweep iterations for each θ and break it into chunks of  ~10 iterations, interspersed throughout the dataset. For instance, one chunk might contain our 1st, 11th, 21st, ...,91st iteration. We rescale the detuning axis of this data by the T2 measured in that iteration, and likewise divide the measurement times by T2 to render them dimensionless. We then take all the vy data in a given chunk and fit it simultaneously to a linear dependence on ΔT2, extracting a slope for coherence stabilized and Ramsey measurements. In the case where we are calculating Rs, we then divide each slope by √t/T2, where t is the time at which the measurement was taken in each iteration. Note that t will vary linearly with T2, so even as T2 fluctuates through iterations, this ratio remains constant (so long as T1/T2 remains roughly constant). We take the ratio of the coherence-stabilized slope to the Ramsey slope, then average over all N ~10 chunks to give an estimate of Rv or Rs. We compute the variance of these ratios and divide them by N as an estimate of the error.

Metrics details

As conventional electronic materials approach their physical limits, the application of ultrafast optical fields to access transient states of matter captures imagination. The inversion symmetry governs the optical parity selection rule, differentiating between accessible and inaccessible states of matter. To circumvent parity-forbidden transitions, the common practice is to break the inversion symmetry by material design or external fields. Here we report how the application of femtosecond ultraviolet pulses can energize a parity-forbidden dark exciton state in black phosphorus while maintaining its intrinsic material symmetry. Unlike its conventional bandgap absorption in visible-to-infrared, femtosecond ultraviolet excitation turns on efficient Coulomb scattering, promoting carrier multiplication and electronic heating to ~3000 K, and consequently populating its parity-forbidden states. Interferometric time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy reveals dark exciton dynamics of black phosphorus on ~100 fs time scale and its anisotropic wavefunctions in energy-momentum space, illuminating its potential applications in optoelectronics and photochemistry under ultraviolet optical excitation.

Excitons in insulators and semiconductors1 are the primary quasiparticles of light-matter interaction governed by quantum mechanical selection rules2. Optical excitation creates a valence band (VB) hole and a conduction band (CB) electron that form an exciton state bound by the screened Coulomb interaction. Excitons are quanta that can transduce the energy and information of light, and define the optical-electrical-chemical properties of matter. When the VB and CB carry opposite spin or possess different momentum, optical transitions between them are forbidden, and their excitons are said to be dark3,4,5. The suppressed radiative electron-hole recombination makes dark excitons longer-lived, attracting keen interest to switch them on at will6,7,8,9. The parity of electronic wavefunctions, defined by switching (‘−') or retention (‘+') of sign upon point reflection, also defines the strength of optical transitions. A striking example is the metastable excited state of helium, whose decay time to the same parity ground state is > 106 longer than for the parity-allowed states10.

The optical selection rules require that the product of symmetry characters Γ is equal to one. The parity symmetry selection rule is satisfied when the electronic wave functions and light:

where the individual characters stand for VB and CB bands, photon, and exciton envelope11,12,13,14. The component \({\varGamma }_{{VB}}\otimes {\varGamma }_{{CB}}\otimes {\varGamma }_{{photon}}\) symmetry determines the optical CB ← VB transitions, where \({\varGamma }_{{photon}}=-1\) restricts single-photon transitions to occur between electronic bands of opposite parity11. The exciton envelope parity is defined by the orbital angular momentum quantum number \(l\) as \({\varGamma }_{{exciton\_envelope}}={\left(-1\right)}^{l}\) (ref. 12,14), rendering the lowest-lying 1 s exciton ground state of \({\varGamma }_{{exciton\_envelope}}=1\). Therefore, 1 s exciton for one-photon CB ← VB transitions between bands of opposite parity is bright (Fig. 1a), but dark when they have the same parity (Fig. 1b). The parity selection rule can be circumvented by breaking the inversion symmetry, as has been done by introducing lattice-distorting polarons in strongly confined perovskite quantum dots15 or distorting the electronic wave functions by external magnetic or electric fields in carbon nanotubes13,16,17.

Here, we show how the parity-forbidden dark exciton state can be switched on in a bulk material even when its intrinsic crystal symmetry is maintained (Fig. 1c). BP is a particularly well-suited semiconductor18,19 for this study because (i) it has a direct band-gap20 with remarkable optical responses21; (ii) its low atomic number22 gives it a negligible spin-orbit coupling; (iii) its excitonic wavefunctions express the highly anisotropic band dispersions in the Z-S (armchair, AC) and Z-T (zigzag, ZZ, Fig. 1d) directions23; and (iv) its crystal structure exhibits multiple symmetries, providing an ideal platform to interrogate the optical selection rules (Supplementary Note 1). Especially, under three-dimensional space inversion, the CB2 as well as VB1-VB3 have even parity (ref. 21, Fig. 1d), making the CB2 ← VB1-VB3 transitions strictly parity-forbidden (Supplementary Note 1.1). Previous research on BP with infrared excitation has focused on the allowed CB1 ← VB1 transition24,25 and its bright exciton26,27. Herein we study by energy-momentum-time-resolved two-photon photoemission (2PP) spectroscopy the high-lying parity-forbidden CB2(e−)←VB1(h+) dark exciton formation under femtosecond UV excitation.

Conventional angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) of BP excited with a He lamp reproduce the known18,20,21,28 anisotropic dispersions of the VB1-VB3 along the high-symmetry Z-T and Z-S lines (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1). 2PP spectra excited with \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}=4.59{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) femtosecond pulses record the electronic band structures of transiently populated CBs (Fig. 2a–c). Figure 2a shows the dispersions of CB2 and CB3 recorded in the 2PP \(E({k}_{||})\) spectrum, for s-pol excitation with ZZ direction of BP aligned in the optical plane. Tuning the light polarization from s-pol (θ = 90°) to p-pol (θ = 0°) selectively probes different CBs and the free-electron dispersing image potential state (IPS)29 (Fig. 2b,c). The observed band assignments are established by comparing the experimental and calculated band energies and masses (Supplementary Fig. 2), as summarized in Fig. 2d. Independent of the light polarization, the line traces taken at \({k}_{{ZZ}}=0\,{{{{\text{\AA }}}}}^{-1}\) show that the 2PP signal rises from the surface work function (WF) edge of BP at \({E}_{{final}}=4.68{eV}\), and thereafter, gradually decreases to higher energies (right panel in Fig. 2a–c). The decreasing signal with \({E}_{{final}}\) represents a hot thermal electron distribution within CB1. This suggests that the photoexcitation occurs by a Drude-like second-order inelastic scattering process30 that populates all accessible CBs. At the intermediate θ = 60° excitation polarization, an additional band appears ~ 85 meV below the CB2 with flatter dispersion that cannot be assigned within the single-particle band structure of BP (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3). Considering its binding relative to CB2, we attribute it to the CB2 exciton.

The left and right ordinates, respectively, numerate the intermediate state and final photoelectron energies (\({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) and \({E}_{{final}}\)), in the 2PP process, relative to the Fermi level (EFermi). The dashed curves guide the band dispersions. The right spectra are line profiles taken through \({k}_{{{{\rm{ZZ}}}}}=0\,{{{{\text{\AA }}}}}^{-1}\); the arrows point to the active bands in each spectrum. In (b and c), the higher energy range intensities are magnified to visualize low-intensity spectral peaks. d Sketch of the observed CBs along \({k}_{{{{\rm{ZZ}}}}}\) with their specific dispersions. e A colormap composed of a series of line profiles taken at \({k}_{{{{\rm{ZZ}}}}}=0\,{{{{\text{\AA }}}}}^{-1}\) in 10° intervals for light polarization range from θ = − 90° to 90° (s → p → s). f Polar plots of the relative peak intensity of each state after background subtraction vs. the light polarization θ = 0° to 360°. The red dashed lines show the calculated θ dependences of |TDMs|2 for each \({E}_{{final}}\leftarrow\)CBs one-photon and the coherent \({E}_{{final}}\leftarrow\)IPS ← VB1 two-photon processes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Assignments of the detected CB bands are affirmed by distinct polarization dependences of their 2PP spectra. As shown by the line profiles at \({k}_{{ZZ}}=0\,{{{{\text{\AA }}}}}^{-1}\) taken by stepwise tuning of the s → p → s excitation polarization (presented in the color map of Fig. 2e), the intensity maxima for CB1, CB4, and exciton state occur for p-pol, while for CB2 and CB3 they occur for s-pol. In polar coordinates, by comparing the relative 2PP intensity θ dependences with those of the calculated moduli square of transition dipole moments (|TDM | 2) for each CB (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Note 1.2), we conclude that the \({\cos }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) dependence of CB1 and CB4, and the \({\sin }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) dependence of CB2 and CB3 are defined by one-photon transitions from these transiently populated bands to the \({E}_{{final}}\) photoemission continuum, in line with their incoherent population and subsequent photoemission. Further symmetry analysis of CBs explains their distinct polarization dependences. Specifically, when the ZZ azimuth of BP is aligned in the optical plane, the pseudospin symmetry is even for CB1 and CB4, and odd for CB2 and CB3, which defines their respective detection by p-pol and s-pol (Supplementary Note 1.3). By contrast, the IPS has intensity maxima at θ = ± 45°, which stands out because photoemission from IPS is always maximum for normal emission. This, however, can be elegantly understood as a consequence of a coherent two-photon \({E}_{{final}}\leftarrow\)IPS ← VB1 excitation that must have distinct \({\sin }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\cdot {\cos }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) dependence (Supplementary Fig. 4). The CB2 exciton state appears for p-pol, because its joint electron-hole character of CB2 and VB1 both of odd symmetry, gives it a total even symmetry.

We next establish the exciton state energy by tuning excitation \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}=3.94-4.77{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Figure 3a records the \({E}_{{final}}\) shift of each state with \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\), where the approximate fitted slopes of ~ 1 confirm their incoherent population in the 2PP process, and determine the exciton binding energy of Eb ~ 80 ± 20 meV relative to CB2 (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, 2PP recorded for ZZ to AC azimuths capture the anisotropies of CBs bands and CB2 exciton (the AC measurements are shown in Supplementary Figs. 6, 7 and analyzed in Supplementary Note 1.4). Surprisingly, the CB2 exciton dispersion reverses from positive along kZZ to negative along kAC (Fig. 3c, d). A detailed description of the dispersion extraction in Supplementary Fig. 3, 7, gives the exciton effective masses \({m}_{{ex}}^{*}({ZZ})=0.90\,{m}_{e}\) and \({m}_{{ex}}^{*}({AC})=-0.36\,{m}_{e}\) (\({m}_{e}\) is the free electron mass).

The slopes of ~ 1 signify that the 2PP experiment measures their incoherently excited populations. The data with hollow and solid circles are extracted from s-pol and p-pol 2PP spectra in Supplementary Fig. 5, respectively. b Data from a transformed to \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) to obtain the state energies (indicated by the numbers). The errors give the standard deviation. c, d 2PP spectra of CB2 excitons measured with \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}=4.59{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) for the ZZ and AC azimuths, respectively. For ZZ, the polarization is set at θ = 60° to record both the CB2 and CB2 exciton, while for AC, it is at θ = 0°. The measured dispersions of CB2 and CB2 exciton are indicated by white and orange curves, respectively. The lower panels show the k|| momentum intensity distributions of CB2 excitons. The black curves indicate the fitting of the exciton wavefunctions densities via \({\left|\phi \left(k\right)\right|}^{2}=1/{\left[1+{\left(k{a}_{{ex}}\right)}^{2}/4\right]}^{4}\) (ref. 32), reporting the anisotropic exciton Bohr radii \({a}_{{ex}}=\,12.3\pm 0.6\,{{{\text{\AA }}}}\,\left({ZZ}\right)\) and \(15.6\pm 0.5\,{{{\text{\AA }}}}\,({AC})\). e, f The simulated spectra of CB2(e−)←VB1(h+) excitons along \({k}_{{ZZ}}\) and \({k}_{{AC}}\), whose spectral dispersions are shown by the orange dashed curves. g The nonlinear order N obtained by fitting the s-pol (upper panel) and p-pol (lower panel) power-dependent 2PP spectral intensities (Supplementary Fig. 8) to \(Y={I}^{N}\), plotted vs. Eint (Efinal).

The spectrum at 90 K shows Gaussian function fits for the CB2 and CB3 peaks (gray shading), and Fermi-Dirac (F-D) distribution for hot electrons giving \({T}_{e}=2650\,\pm \, 16\, K\) (blue shading). i The obtained hot electron \({T}_{e}\) values plotted for different sample temperatures. The error bars in (g and i) are given by the 95% confidence interval for the nonlinear least-square parameter estimates. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We note that the true dispersion of an exciton is defined by the sum of the electron and hole masses31, whereas its photoemission spectra record the “apparent dispersion” from its photoemitted electron32,33,34. Photoemission dissociates an exciton, with the energy and momentum conservation constraining its \(E\left({k}_{\parallel }\right)\) distribution by that remaining with the VB hole32,33,34. Simulation of the “apparent dispersion” by the effective mass approximation model34 shows that the effective exciton temperature, \({T}_{{ex}}\), can tune the “apparent dispersion” to be close to VB dispersion at \({T}_{{ex}}\to 0\) and to CB dispersion at \({T}_{{ex}}\to \infty\) (Supplementary Note 2.1). The CB2 has a strong upward dispersion along kZZ, and the VB1 has a strong downward dispersion along kAC (blue and red curves in Fig. 3e, f). This can generate the reverse “apparent dispersions” for CB2(e−)←VB1(h+) exciton along kZZ and kAC at a modest \({T}_{{ex}}\), where the experimentally observed dispersions are best simulated for \({T}_{{ex}}=340{K}\) (color contrast in Fig. 3e, f). Furthermore, many-body perturbation theory calculation supports that the observed exciton is the 1 s ground state of CB2(e−)←VB1(h+) exciton with a calculated Eb ~ 60 meV and anisotropic wave function in real-space (Supplementary Note 2.1).

As explained, parity forbids direct optical CB2 ← VB1 transitions, and therefore its 1 s exciton is strictly a parity-forbidden dark state. So, elucidating excitation provides insight into the optical response of BP. The laser intensity (I) power-law29 for photoelectron yield (Y) by two-photon absorption, \(Y={I}^{N}\), is expected to be N = 2. The measured N > 2 values below the highest energy photoelectron states, however, imply that there must be a carrier multiplication processes (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 8). This can occur by Auger-type scattering as it happens in copper35,36 and layered materials29,37.

Like the quasi-two dimensional (2D) semimetal graphite29, weak screening of the Coulomb interaction in the Van der Waals layered BP enables ultrafast electron excitation to CBs by second-order Coulomb scattering channels that are only restricted by energy and momentum conservation but not symmetry. This is immediately evident in the unstructured hot electron signal from CB1 in 2PP spectra of BP, whose intensity decreases above the WF edge following UV excitation. We attribute this signal to hot thermalized electrons with an effective electron temperature (Te) given by the Fermi-Dirac (F-D) distribution, \(f\left({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\right)=1/[1+\exp \left(\frac{{E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}-{E}_{{Fermi}}}{{k}_{B}{T}_{e}}\right)]\) (\({k}_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant). Fitting to the F-D distribution gives \({T}_{e}=2650-3240 \, K\) range for sample temperatures of 90–300 K (Fig. 3h, i). The effect of the sample temperature on the effective hot electron temperature implies that electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering also contributes to the hot electron generation and thermalization.

Evidence for the delayed excitation of dark states and hot electron heating is conspicuous in the interferometric time-resolved 2PP measurements for excitation with a pair of identical, collinear, phase-correlated pump-probe pulses at \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}=4.02{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) (Fig. 4). The measurements generate 3D movies of \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}({k}_{{||}})\) vs. \(\delta\) scanned in 0.064 fs/frame steps to capture the coherent and incoherent electron dynamics with sub-optical-cycle accuracy (Supplementary Movies 1, 2). Extracting the \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}(\delta )\) at \({k}_{{||}}=0\,{{{{\text{\AA }}}}}^{-1}\) from the movies generates 2D interferograms of the polarization and population dynamics for each state (Fig. 4a for s-pol and Supplementary Fig. 9c for p-pol). With s-pol excitation, the interferogram shows the main features of CB2 and CB3 superposed on the dominant hot electron signal with decreasing intensity above the WF edge in the vertical line trace at \(\delta=0{fs}\) (Fig. 4a). Plotting the vertical line traces at Δ\(\delta\)=20 fs intervals show the hot electron signal component to be decreasing (Fig. 4b). Fitting this component by F-D distribution (Fig. 4c) shows that \({T}_{e}\)(\(\delta\)) has the primary maximum at \(\delta=0{fs}\) where the laser fluence is maximum, and tellingly, a secondary maximum at \(\delta=\sim 80{fs}\) (red arrow in Fig. 4c) where the hot electron population is multiplied and heated. We attribute the rising signal to retarded Auger-type scattering processes38,39,40.

a Interferometric time-resolved 2PP interferogram at \({k}_{{{{\rm{ZZ}}}}}=0\,{{{{\text{\AA }}}}}^{-1}\), displays the photoelectron counts (color scale) vs. \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) (ordinate) and \(\delta\) (abscissa), excited by s-pol \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}=4.02{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) light (ZZ azimuth). The orange curve is a line profile at \(\delta=0{{{\rm{fs}}}}\). b A series of vertical line profiles extracted from a taken in intervals of Δ\(\delta\)= 20 fs, and intensities normalized at WF edge. The spectrum at \(\delta=260{{{\rm{fs}}}}\) is fitted by the F-D distribution (blue shaded; \({T}_{e}=2130 \, K\)), and Gaussian lineshapes for the CB band peaks (gray). c nonmonotonically evolving \({T}_{e}\) from F-D fitting of profiles with increasing \(\delta\) in (b). d Interferometric two-pulse correlation (I2PC) traces extracted as horizontal line profiles from a for \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) at the WF edge, CB2, and CB3, respectively, with intensities normalized at \(\delta=0{{{\rm{fs}}}}\). The black curves are obtained by Fourier transformation of the I2PC data and reverse transformation of its zero-frequency \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) component to emphasize its slowly evolving hot electron signal. The green curve is the in situ pulse autocorrelation reference (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). e, f Inverse Fourier transforms the map of the \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) signal from the data in a for s-pol, and from the Supplementary Fig. 9c for p-pol excitation; the intensities are normalized at \(\delta=0{{{\rm{fs}}}}\). The transiently populated longer-lived dark CB2 and its exciton populations are evident g, h The delayed Auger/direct population ratio \({{{\rm{\alpha }}}}\) and the hot electron lifetime \({\tau }_{e}\) from the OBE simulation of \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) traces, plotted as a function of \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\), for s-pol and p-pol measurements. The vertical line in (h) indicates the limiting time resolution of ~30 fs (for \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}} \, > \, 1.8{eV}\), \({\tau }_{e}\) extraction is not reliable). In the \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}=0.7-1.8{eV}\) range, the data are fitted with \({\tau }_{e}\, \sim \,{\left({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\right)}^{-n}\), giving n = 1.93 ± 0.12 and 1.89 ± 0.11 for the s-pol and p-pol measurements, respectively. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The contribution of the retarded carrier scattering is evident in the interferometric two-pulse correlation (I2PC, Fig. 4d) traces obtained as horizontal line profiles through the interferogram in Fig. 4a, as well as the enhanced (N > 2) nonlinear order of 2PP signals in Fig. 3g. The phase-independent \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) signal obtained by Fourier filtering41 of the I2PC scans records the incoherent electron dynamics (black traces in Fig. 4d). The \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) trace for CB3 at \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}=2.5{eV}\) is almost identical to the reference pulse autocorrelation (green trace), because the electron dynamics at that energy are too fast to resolve. By contrast, the \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) signals for CB2 and WF edge show a delayed rise and pedestal formation at \(\delta \, > \, 50{fs}\), giving evidence for carrier multiplication35,36. Plotting the \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) traces at different \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) shows that the delayed rise feature primarily occurs at low \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) and becomes invisible at \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}} \, > \, 2.4{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), indicating that the CB population by carrier multiplication decreases as \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) increases to reach the expected N = 2 for a two-photon process at \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}={{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\). Particularly, pronounced delayed rise signals appear at Eint of CB2 and CB2 exciton, as are evident in the \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) maps under s-pol and p-pol light excitation (Fig. 4e, f). Moreover, the delayed rise features appear earlier under higher light fluence (Supplementary Fig. 10), as expected for the Auger-type scattering process42.

Optical Bloch equation (OBE) simulations at specific \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) including the delayed Auger-type generation, can well reproduce the \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) traces (Supplementary Note 3), from which we can extract the hot electron lifetime \({\tau }_{e}\)35,36, and the ratio, α, of the delayed to the prompt hot electron population. As \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) increases from the WF edge, the value of α decreases non-monotonically (Fig. 4g), gaining secondary maxima at CB2 and CB2 exciton, signifying their dominant excitation is by carrier multiplication. The obtained \({\tau }_{e}\) is longest (~ 180 fs) at WF edge (\({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}=0.7{eV}\)) and decreases at higher \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\) (Fig. 4h) with an approximate \({\tau }_{e}\, \sim \,{\left({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\right)}^{-1.9}\) dependence, which is close to the inverse quadratic dependence of \({\tau }_{e}\) for e-e scattering in normal Fermi liquids43. This invites a conclusion that for \({E}_{{{\mathrm{int}}}}\ge 0.7{eV}\) above EFermi, e-e scattering dominates on the ~ 100 fs time scale, while closer to the CB minimum, the e-ph scattering may dominate on a longer time scale43.

The semiconducting BP with a layer thickness tunable bandgap presents a broad optical response in the visible-to-infrared range21,24 and attracts interest in its variable-spectrum optoelectronic applications44. Its absorption in \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) = 3 − 4 eV UV range is regarded to have a “colossal”, five orders-of-magnitude, increase in photoconductivity relative to the visible-near-infrared excitaiton45. Wu et al. attribute this changeover to the excitation of flat bands (G-Z direction) that may contribute a high density-of-states for excitation from ~ − 2 to 2 eV45. Our femtosecond deep UV (\({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) = 4.68 − 3.94 eV) pulse 2PP spectroscopy of BP shows the photoexcitation unconventionally occurs through a second-order Drude-like process where transient e-−h+ pairs turn on Coulomb interactions that activate carrier-carrier scattering that populates CB1-CB4, in sharp contrast to the conventional band-to-band transitions under visible excitation (Supplementary Note 4). Consequently, in the primary response, energy and momentum are conserved, generating the hot electron gas with Te up to 3000 K in CB1 and populating CB2-CB4. The concomitantly generated hot holes participate in Auger-type interband carrier-carrier scattering. Particularly, VB1 electrons participate in impact ionization, where the energy of one recombing with a deep hole is transferred to the other to populate the CB2 to generate the parity-forbidden CB2(e−)←VB1(h+) dark exciton state (Supplementary Fig. 11). The energy and momentum conservations in impact ionization determine the exciton distribution with finite center-of-mass (COM) momentum, thereby achieving the observed exciton temperature of \({T}_{{ex}}=340 \, K\) (Supplementary Fig. 15). Such unconventional optical response with exceptional dark exciton formation and hot electron generation extend the potential applications of BP in optoelectronics11,21,37,44 and photochemistry46,47 under femtosecond UV excitation.

The involvement of carrier scattering in UV absorption can be attributed to weak and time-dependent screening of the Coulomb interaction in 2D materials. The UV excited transient excitonic virtual e-h pairs scatter within the 30-fs excitation pulse window to generate real thermalized hot electrons and holes48. The generated hot carrier plasma can undergo further carrier multiplication scattering on < 100 fs time scale that is seen as the delayed dark state rise. This analysis is entirely consistent with the understanding that, while the electronic band structure picture of 2D materials is valid, the quasiparticle picture of their excitations is equivocal because of charge carrier Coulomb correlations that favor second-order scattering processes48. Thus, our energy-momentum-time-resolved nonlinear 2PP spectroscopy shows that under femtosecond UV excitation, the optical response of 2D materials can deviate from band-to-band dipole transitions, opening new routes to access novel dark state with singular properties relative to the starting ground state. We expect that the departure from the quasiparticle concept under strong excitation is a general feature of 2D materials that show evidence of Coulomb correlations under weak excitation and low-temperature conditions49.

The single-crystalline BP samples are grown by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method in a two-zone tube furnace using high-purity red phosphorus, tin iodide and tin powders as the starting materials50. Commercial BP samples (HQ Graphene) are also used to check for the consistency of 2PP experiments. The BP surface is cleaved in situ under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). A low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy at constant current mode (STM, Omicron LT) is used to establish the surface cleanness (Supplementary Fig. 1a)

A 1030 nm femtosecond laser (Light conversion, Pharos-20W) operating at a 500 kHz repetition pumps a self-built noncollinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) to produce tunable excitation pulse trains between 500 − 930 nm (\({{\hslash }}{{{{\rm{\omega }}}}}_{L}\) = 2.48 − 1.33 eV) with an average output power of ~ 60 − 80 mW. The pulses are compressed by multiple reflections from a matched pair of negative dispersion mirrors to ~20–30 fs for further frequency doubling by a BBO crystal to 250 − 465 nm (\({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) = 4.96 − 2.67 eV). Dispersion compensation for UV pulses uses a series of four dispersive prisms to reach a pulse duration of ~30 fs. The laser beam is focused onto the sample at an incident angle of 45° from the surface normal with a spot diameter ~ 50 μm.

2PP measurements are carried out mainly at room temperature in a UHV chamber with a base pressure < 1.5 × 10−10 mBar. The manipulator can also cool the samples down to 90 K with liquid nitrogen, such as for the measurements in Supplementary Fig. 7 and 10, for a better signal-to-noise ratio. The 2PP spectra are collected with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (Specs, Phoibos 150, ± 15° acceptance angle). A 2D DLD delay-line detector (Surface Concept) records Efinal(k||) values in single photoelectrons counting acquisition mode. A bias of 3 V is applied between the sample and the analyzer to collect low-energy photoelectrons. When \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}} \, < \, {{{\rm{WF}}}}\), two-photon absorption excites electrons from below EFermi to above the vacuum level (EV), to overcome the surface work function and undergo photoemission. The observed electron dynamics occur dominantly in bound intermediate states Eint(k||) = Efinal(k||) -\(\,{{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\). During the electronic system evolution, absorbing the second photon projects electrons into the photoemission continuum, where their energy and momentum are recorded.

As shown in Fig. 1e, the incident laser beam, the sample surface normal, and the analyzer slit are aligned in the optical plane. A λ/2 waveplate sets the excitation polarization between p- and s-pol. A 5-axis manipulator with in-plane azimuth rotation can align the ZZ or AC edges of BP crystals to the optical plane, where its crystalline orientations are further verified by recording the LEED pattern analysis (SPECS ErLEED 100, Supplementary Fig. 1b).

The conventional ARPES (referred to as 1PP) is excited by \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}=21.2{{{\rm{eV}}}}\) from a He discharge lamp (VG Scienta, VUV5000). The optical excitation pathways for 1PP and 2PP are schematically shown in Supplementary Fig. 1f.

A Mach-Zehnder interferometer generates identical, collinear, phase-correlated pump-probe pulse pairs for time-resolved 2PP measurements30. A piezoelectrically actuated translation stage scans the pump-probe time delay (\(\delta\)), enabling the phase coherent response to be recorded with each frame recording 2D Eint(k||) images. Scanning the delay over \(\delta\) = 280 to − 50 fs range in 64 attosecond steps records a 3D interferogram movie (Supplementary Movies 1, 2) of the variation of photoelectron counts in the energy-momentum-time domains41,51,52,53,54,55,56. To improve the counting statistics, more than 200 pump-probe scans are accumulated together with the delay time calibration interference fringes at the laser center frequency. The calibration fringes define the time axis with a constant optical cycle at specific excitation \({{\hslash }}{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\). From the accumulated 3D interferogram movie, we extract the 2D interferograms of Eint vs. \(\delta\) at specific k||, such as in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9.

Such interferograms are Fourier transformed (FT) from time to frequency domains to analyze responses at the dominant coherent polarization frequencies corresponding to \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}},\,1{{{\rm{\omega }}}},\,2{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) harmonics (\({{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) is the laser frequency). For further analysis, 2D-FT spectra are inverse Fourier transformed back to the time domain, in particular, the \(0{{{\rm{\omega }}}}\) phase-averaged component (Fig. 4e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10) is used for the analysis of optical phase-independent hot electron population dynamics. The OBE simulation details of the population dynamics are in Supplementary Note 3.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed with the projector-augmented wave method (PAW)57 as implemented in Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP)58,59. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional60 is used for the exchange-correlation potential. For geometry optimization, the vdW interaction is considered at the vdW-DF level with the optB88 exchange functional (optB88-vdW)61,62. The plane wave cut-off energy is set as 400 eV. An 18 × 18 × 6 k-mesh is used to sample the Brillouin zone. The atomic geometry is fully optimized until a residual force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å−1. Electronic band structure is calculated by hybrid functional (HSE06)63 methods based on the atomic structures obtained from the full optimization by optB88-vdW, and the result is shown in Fig. 1d. Ab initio GW plus Bethe-Salpeter Equation (GW-BSE)64,65 calculations is performed using VASP as well to evaluate the exciton binding energy and wave function, with the same structure, energy cutoff and k-grid as in DFT calculation.

Metrics details

Reinforcement learning theory explains human behavior as driven by the goal of maximizing reward. Conventional approaches, however, offer limited insights into how people generalize from past experiences to new situations. Here, we propose refining the classical reinforcement learning framework by incorporating an efficient coding principle, which emphasizes maximizing reward using the simplest necessary representations. This refined framework predicts that intelligent agents, constrained by simpler representations, will inevitably: 1) distill environmental stimuli into fewer, abstract internal states, and 2) detect and utilize rewarding environmental features. Consequently, complex stimuli are mapped to compact representations, forming the foundation for generalization. We tested this idea in two experiments that examined human generalization. Our findings reveal that while conventional models fall short in generalization, models incorporating efficient coding achieve human-level performance. We argue that the classical RL objective, augmented with efficient coding, represents a more comprehensive computational framework for understanding human behavior in both learning and generalization.

The aphorism “A man can never step into the same river twice” speaks to the ever-changing nature of the world. Making sense of this dynamic reality requires the ability to generalize; that is, to extract knowledge from past experiences and apply it to new, unseen futures. Effective generalization remarkably improves the capacity of intelligent agents to adapt to rapid changes. For example, consider a child learning to ride a bike. She makes numerous attempts, falling and adjusting her balance through trial and error. Once bike riding is mastered, the child can then generalize those balancing skills to ride a scooter, allowing her to quickly master the scooter without having to learn from scratch. Given its importance to adaptive learning, generalization has been the focus of study in both cognitive neuroscience1,2,3 and machine learning4,5,6.

Recent research illustrates that representation learning is one of the cornerstones that support generalization7,8,9. Representation learning involves the transformation of raw environmental stimuli or events into robust abstract states (“state abstraction”), which summarize underlying patterns and regularities in the raw data. For example, riding a bike and scooter may be conceptually abstracted into one activity, enabling a child to realize they can transfer balancing skills previously learned from riding a bicycle to a scooter. In addition, effective representations can detect and extract a subset of the most informative and rewarding features within environments (“rewarding feature extraction”). For instance, although bicycles and scooters have distinct designs, their shared feature of having two wheels requires similar balancing skills. Historically, there has been a gap in the theoretical and comprehensive understanding of how to constitute effective representations. Bridging this gap and developing algorithms that learn generalizable representations has become a central pursuit in recent research on human cognitive neuroscience9,10,11,12 and artificial intelligence7,13,14,15,16.

This paper focuses on understanding how humans learn effective representations that enhance their generalization abilities. One influential framework for understanding human behavioral learning is reinforcement learning (RL), which views intelligent behavior as seeking to maximize expected reward17,18. This framework provides a normative understanding of a spectrum of human learning processes19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 and offers theories on the underlying neural mechanisms27,28,29,30. However, by itself, the traditional RL framework provides very limited insights into human representation learning and generalization10,20,31,32,33. The framework often assumes a predefined, fixed set of task representations on which learning can operate directly, without the need for additional representation learning17. However, in real-world decision-making, humans are not provided with predefined representations. Instead, they must infer these representations from complex and dynamic environmental observations.

Here, we propose augmenting the classical RL theory to incorporate the principle of efficient coding34: while maximizing reward, intelligent agents should use the simplest necessary representations. The origin of this approach lies in the basic fact that the human brain, as a biological information processing system, possesses finite cognitive resources35. The idea of efficient use of cognitive resources has had profound impacts across many domains in psychology and neuroscience, including perception36,37,38, working memory39,40, perceptual-based generalization3, and motor control41. Furthermore, our approach aligns with Botvinick's42 proposal that the efficient coding principle can be instrumental in understanding the representation of problems in learning and decision-making. Our work extends their proposal by concretely operationalizing efficient coding using information theory, providing a calculable measure within the RL framework, and validating this idea on human data.

Critically, our proposed approach suggests that, driven by the principle of efficient coding, an intelligent agent can autonomously learn appropriate simplified representations, which enables both state abstraction and the extraction of rewarding features, naturally resulting in generalization. To validate these predictions, we designed two experiments focusing on learning and generalization. Participants first learned a set of stimulus-action associations and were then tested on their ability to generalize to a new set of associations they had not encountered before. The first experiment investigates the emergence of state abstraction, while the second explores the extraction of rewarding features. Human participants displayed strong generalization abilities in both experiments, correctly responding to new associations without additional training. We developed a principled model based on efficient coding and demonstrated its capacity to achieve human-level generalization performance in both experiments—performance that classical RL models have not accomplished. These findings lead us to conclude that generalization is an inherent outcome of efficient coding. Given humans' remarkable capacity for generalization, we assert that the classical RL objective augmented with efficient coding and reward maximization presents a more comprehensive computational objective for human learning.

Humans exhibit two types of generalizations: perceptual-based and functional-based generalizations. Perceptual-based generalization occurs when two stimuli share a similar appearance1,38,39. Functional-based generalization, in contrast, occurs between stimuli that have similar functions (e.g. linked to the same actions), even when they do not look alike2,43,44,45,46. The latter type of generalization is more complex because it necessitates the acquisition of unseen environmental statistics before it can occur.

To investigate both types of generalization, we leveraged the acquired equivalence paradigm2,43,44. This experimental framework first links two visually distinct stimuli with identical actions, then assesses the increase in generalization between these stimuli based on their shared actions. This approach effectively establishes the functional similarity between the two stimuli, enabling a controlled experimental investigation into participants' ability of functional-based generalization.

Specifically, participants performed a two-stage task. In each trial, participants were shown an alien (stimulus \(s\)) and were told that different aliens preferred to visit different locations. For a given stimulus, participants were required to choose one of two places (action \(a\)) that they believed the alien would prefer to visit (Fig. 1A). During the training stage, participants were trained on six stimulus-action associations, each repeated ten times to learn the equivalence between stimuli based on their associated actions (Figs. 1B and 1C). For example, if aliens s1 and s2 both preferred to visit a desert (a1) rather than a forest (a2), then they are equivalent and the psychological similarity of the two aliens may increase. During the training stage, participants received feedback (reward \(r\), taking a value of either 0 or 1) after every choice.

The alien stimuli were used with modifications with permission from Isabel Gauthier and Michael Tarr. Please cite85,86 as the original sources. The scene stimuli were adopted without modifications from Zhou et al.87. A One trial consists of three screens: a 500-ms fixation screen, a 10-s response screen, and a 1-s feedback screen. Each response screen displays an alien stimulus, as well as two location pictures representing different actions. B One block contains two stages. The training stage trains three associations with feedback. The testing stage tests an untrained association (dashed line) in addition to the three trained associations without feedback. C One block contains two groups, each with two stimuli. The incorrect actions of one group correspond to the correct actions of the other. The structure of the stimuli is not disclosed to participants. D Stimuli used in Experiment 1 are designed to be the same color but with different shapes and appendages to control for perceptual similarity. The four stimuli are referred to as \(x,\,{x}^{{\prime} },{y},{y}^{\prime}\), with \(x\) and \(x^{\prime}\) associating with the same actions, as do \(y\) and \(y^{\prime}\). E Stimuli used in Experiment 2. Each block contains a different type of perceptual similarity. F The model architectures. The classical reinforcement learning policy gradient (RLPG) model learns a policy that maps from stimuli \(s\) to a distribution of action \(a\). Due to the introduction of representation \(r\), the policies of the cascade policy gradient (CPG) and the efficient coding policy gradient (ECPG) model are broken into an encoder \(\psi\) and decoder \(\rho\). The ECPG and CPG model have the same architecture except that the ECPG model optimizes to use simpler representations \(z\).

In the testing stage, participants were tested on eight associations: the six trained associations plus two untrained associations that were not presented in the training stage. The untrained associations were used to evaluate people's generalization performance. For example, if the participant learned during the training stage that \({s}_{1}\) and \({s}_{2}\) were similar to each other (had similar preferences), then participants might generalize other preferences from \({s}_{1}\) to \({s}_{2}\), even though no feedback was given about those preferences. No feedback was provided during the testing stage, and each association was repeated six times.

To quantify human generalization ability, we calculate the “untrained accuracy”, which is the response accuracy for the untrained associations that were not presented during training. The higher the untrained accuracy, the better a participant's generalization ability. Similarly, “trained accuracy”—the response accuracy for trained associations that were presented in the training stage—serves as a measure of human learning performance. Both metrics are crucial and will be used extensively throughout this paper.

All data were collected online via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

David Marr47 famously argued that the human brain can be understood at three levels: the computational level, which defines the goals to be achieved; the algorithmic level, which details the specific algorithms the human brain used to reach these goals; and the implementational level, which describes how these algorithms are physically realized. In psychology and cognitive science, researchers often build models at the algorithmic level. They typically postulate specific cognitive mechanisms within the human brain, describe these mechanisms using computer programs, and demonstrate their explanatory power over human behavioral data45,46,48.

However, the question of whether the human brain reconstructs efficient representations for task stimuli is situated at the computational level. Therefore, we need to construct models at this same level. In concrete, we formalized our hypotheses—with or without efficient coding—as distinct computational goals, each addressed using the simplest possible algorithm. Unlike algorithmic-level models, computational-level models do not presume specific mechanisms; Instead, these mechanisms naturally emerge during the process of achieving the defined computational goal. Thus, computational-level models not only explain human behaviors but also shed light on the potential cognitive mechanisms underlying these behaviors, thereby demonstrating superior explanatory power over algorithmic-level models.

We built three computational-level models. First, we established a classical RL baseline, named Reinforcement Learning Policy Gradient (RLPG; see Fig. 1F and “Method-Models-RLPG”), which assumes that humans do not learn simplified representations. The computational goal is formulated as follows:

where \(\pi ({a|s})\) is a policy that maps a stimulus, \(s\), to a distribution of actions, \(a\). On each trial, an agent had to choose between two possible actions, each with a 50% chance of being correct. Prior to making a decision, the agent was expected to have a baseline reward expectation of \(b\) = 0.5. This baseline was used to evaluate the “goodness” of the actual reward received. A reward was considered positive if it exceeded the agent's expectation, otherwise negative. The RLPG model interpreted human behavior as involving the search for the policy that yielded the greatest reward (above the baseline) in the process of interacting with the environment.

Second, we developed an Efficient Coding Policy Gradient model (ECPG; Fig. 1F and “Method-Models-ECPG”), which posits that humans learn simpler representations through efficient coding. The challenge in modeling this principle lies in defining the complexity (or simplicity) of representations. Recent studies on human perception have conceptualized perception as an information transmission process, where an encoder transmits environmental sensory signals (\(s\)) into internal representation (\(z\))3,39,40. These studies measure the complexity of representations by the amount of information transmitted by the encoder, quantified by the mutual information between stimuli and representations \({I}^{\psi }({S;Z})\). Based on these works, the computational goal of efficient coding is formalized as maximizing reward while minimizing the representation complexity,

The critical parameter \(\lambda \ge 0\), referred to as the simplicity parameter, controls for the tradeoff between the classical RL objective and representation simplicity. When \(\lambda\) = 0, the agent does not compress stimuli representations for simplicity, and the efficient coding goal reduces to the RL goal. Conversely, as \(\lambda \to \infty\), the agent learns the simplest set of representations, encoding all stimuli into a single, identical representation. Therefore, the optimal \(\lambda\) should be a moderate value, balancing compressing without oversimplification. Due to the introduction of latent representation \(z\), the policy needs to be broken down into an encoder, \(\psi\), and a decoder, \(\rho\), which are simultaneously optimized according to Eq. 2 (Fig. 1F).

To test whether humans learn compact representations, the establishment of the RLPG and ECPG models would typically be sufficient, because the contrasting hypotheses they represent (RLPG stands for “No”, ECPG stands for “Yes”) together cover the entire hypothesis space. One concern, however, is that the introduction of the representation in ECPG has changed the model architecture, potentially introducing confounding factors. To control these confounders, we implemented a third model, Cascade Policy Gradient (CPG; “Method-Models-CPG”), which also supports the non-efficient coding hypothesis. The CPG is a special case of the ECPG model which sets the simplicity parameters to 0 (\(\lambda\) = 0 in Eq. 2) (Fig. 1F),

This model serves as an intermediary between the RLPG and ECPG models, optimizing for the classical RL objective while concurrently updating the representations.

To ensure that observed behavioral differences result only from optimizing different computational goals, we carefully controlled for all other model components. First, all three models address their computational goals using the same policy gradient approach, where models explicitly learn and maintain a parameterized policy17,49. The method was selected over the more commonly used value function approach in psychology and neuroscience because it introduces a minimum number of parameters, therefore better distilling the computational essence of each computational goal. Second, the three models were initialized to (nearly) the same state. Due to the distinct appearances of stimuli in the experiments, we pretrained the encoders of the CPG and ECPG models to achieve a 99% initial discrimination accuracy among the four stimuli (see “Method-Pretrain an encoder”). We chose a threshold of 99% instead of 100% for two reasons: first, to model the perceptual noise present in the human visual system, and second, to prevent gradient vanishing, which is an engineering concern. The RLPG model implicitly assumes perfect discrimination between stimuli and, therefore, does not require the same pretraining as others. Lastly, we used the same model fitting method for all three models, fitting the parameters to each participant separately using maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation (“Method-Model fitting”), based on behavioral data from both the training and the testing stages.

In the following sections, we demonstrate that, at the computational level, only the ECPG model—which incorporates representation simplification—can qualitatively account for human generalization behaviors. We also compare the ECPG model to several published algorithmic-level models and show that, even without presuming any specific algorithmic details about cognitive mechanisms, the ECPG model surpasses models with handcrafted cognitive mechanisms in describing human behavior. Overall, our findings show that integrating efficient coding into the classical RL objective provides a more comprehensive computational framework for understanding human learning and generalization.

Experiment 1 studies human generalization using the standard acquired equivalence paradigm. In this setting, the four alien stimuli within each block share the same color but differ in shapes and appendages (Fig. 1D). This design allows us to specifically study functional-based generalization, because the perceptual features (color, shape, and appendage) provide no cues for generalization.

Why can humans generalize? The proposed efficient coding principle posits that, to achieve simplified representations, an agent must appropriately abstract environmental stimuli into robust latent states. Within each of these abstract states, the stimuli can then mutually generalize. To illustrate this, we simulated the ECPG model at different levels of simplicity, controlled by the parameter λ (0, 0.07, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5), while keeping other parameters constant (See simulation details in “Method-Simulation”). Note that when \(\lambda\) = 0, the ECPG model reduces to the CPG model, which does not employ efficient coding.

The simulations first demonstrate that efficient coding drives state abstraction. As shown in Fig. 2A (\(\lambda\) = 0.1), representation complexity decreases significantly from the beginning of training (t = 0) to the end (t = 60). This representation simplification significantly affects the model's internal representations (\(\lambda\) = 0.1). Before training, when representations are complex, each stimulus is encoded in an unstructured way, with a one-to-one correspondence in representation space (Fig. 2D, t = 0). Driven by efficient coding, the ECPG model compresses representations, discarding redundant information and mapping stimuli associated with the same actions into similar representations, forming abstract states (Fig. 2D, t > 20, red arrows). We quantify the degree of the state abstraction using the Silhouette score50, which measures an object's (\(x\)) similarity to its own latent state (\(x^{\prime}\)) relative to other states (\(y\) and \(y^{\prime}\)). A score close to 0 indicates poor abstraction, while a score close to 1 indicates strong abstraction—stimuli within each abstract state (\(x\) and \(x^{\prime}\)) are encoded similarly and associate with each other, while stimuli across abstract states (\(x\) and \(y\)) remain distinct. Figure 2B (\(\lambda\) = 0.1) shows the Silhouette score increasing from 0 toward 1, indicating emergence of stable, meaningful abstract states from the initially unstructured set of representations. The stimuli shared the same preferences became associated with each other.

A–E are generated by averaging over 400 simulations. A Representation complexity \({I}^{\psi }({S;Z})\) throughout the training process. The cross makers at t = 0, 10, 20, 40, 60 indicate the trials that are sampled for detailed analysis. B Throughout the training process, the effectiveness of state abstraction is measured by the silhouette score. C The proportion of correct responses for associations that were presented (trained) and not presented (untrained) during the training stage reflects learning and generalization performance, respectively. This figure includes only data from the testing stage. Dashed lines represent the 50% chance level. D Encoders \(\psi ({z|s})\) with \(\lambda\) = 0.1 at the sampled training trials. An encoder maps a stimulus \(s\in \{x,{x}^{{\prime} },x,y^{\prime} \}\) to a distribution of internal representations \({z}_{1}\) - \({z}_{4}\). Each row stands for a categorical distribution that sums to 1. Darker shades indicate higher probability values. See Supplementary Note 1.2 for encoders for other \(\lambda s\). E Policies \(\pi ({a|s})\) with \(\lambda\) = 0.1 at the sampled training trials. A policy maps a stimulus \(s\in \{x,{x}^{{\prime} },x,y^{\prime} \}\) to a distribution of actions \({a}_{1}\) - \({a}_{4}\). In each row, actions (\({a}_{1}\), \({a}_{2}\)) and (\({a}_{3}\), \({a}_{4}\)) form a probability distribution. See Supplementary Note 1.2 for policies for other \(\lambda s\). F Predefined correct associations in the training and testing stages. The dark tiles indicate the correct associations, and the pink tiles stand for the associations not shown to the participants.

We further show that stimuli within the same abstract state can generalize to each other. After abstract states stabilize (t > 40), the model begins to decode policies from the structured representations, and changes in representation complexity become more nuanced (Fig. 2A, \(\lambda\) = 0.1). Policies decoded from stimuli within the same abstract state are similar (Fig. 2E, red arrows), illustrating the ECPG model's ability to generalize from training to testing associations. This is reflected by the model's significantly above-chance untrained accuracy (Fig. 2C, \(\lambda\) = 0.1), despite being exposed to only a subset of the associations during training (Fig. 2F). Similar results can be observed when \(\lambda\) is set to 0.2 (Supplementary Note 1.2).

Note that the degree of state abstraction is critical; both insufficient and excessive abstraction impair generalization. As \(\lambda\) increases, the model prioritizes representation simplification over reward maximization, resulting in more intense and rapid abstraction (Fig. 2A). For lower \(\lambda\) (0 or 0.07), the ECPG model becomes more reward-focused and exhibits little or no reduction in representation complexity (Fig. 2A, \(\lambda\) = 0.07 and 0). The insufficient compression prevents the model from associating stimuli that share the same actions, leading to a failure in state abstraction (Fig. 2B, \(\lambda\) = 0.07 and 0) and, consequently, compromised generalization performance (Fig. 2C, \(\lambda\) = 0.07 and 0). Conversely, overly compressed representations (Fig. 2A, \(\lambda\) = 0.5) tend to oversimplify abstraction, assigning all stimuli to a single internal state. This results in significant reward loss and unstable state abstraction, as reflected by the oscillating Silhouette score (Fig. 2B, \(\lambda\) = 0.5). Such oversimplified abstraction can be detrimental to both generalization and learning performance (Fig. 2C, \(\lambda\) = 0.5).

So far, our theoretical framework has outlined how efficient coding could result in functional-based generalization. To verify whether these principles in humans, we collected behavioral data from 165 participants performing two blocks of the standard acquired equivalence task. We fitted all three models to the data and evaluated them using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The ECPG model best described the majority of participants (Fig. 3A), with a stronger advantage in the testing stage, where generalization occurs (Table 1). Some participants' behaviors were poorly captured by the ECPG model, primarily due to their low effort, which resulted in poor learning (Pearson's r(165) = −0.96, p < 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.97, −0.94]) and generalization performance (Pearson's r(165) = −0.52, p < 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.63, −0.40]). We also conducted a Bayesian group-level comparison and reported the protected exceedance probability (PXP)—the probability that a model accounts for the data better than the others, beyond the chance level (the log model evidence was estimated using the BIC)51. As expected, the ECPG model again was ranked first among the three models (PXP > 0.999; Fig. 1B). These findings underscore the unique capability of the ECPG model in capturing human learning and generalization performance.

Models were fit to all behavioral data of each participant in both training and testing stages. A Models' Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for each participant. The RLPG model has 1 parameter, the CPG model has 2 parameters, and the ECPG model has 3 parameters. Also, see Table 1 for the exact value. B Protected exceedance probability (PXP) tallies for each model. C Change in representation complexity after training. Scatterplot data located above the horizontal dashed line indicate representation expansion, while those below the line indicate representation compression. The RLPG model assumes that environmental stimuli are always perfectly reconstructed and, therefore, yield no change in complexity. Error bars reflect the mean ± standard deviation (SD) across 165 valid participants. D Proportion of correct responses for trained and untrained associations in the testing stage, representing learning and generalization performance, respectively. Only data from the testing stage is included. The dashed lines indicate the 50% chance level. Error bars reflect the mean ± SD across 165 valid participants. E Proportion of correct responses over the number of trials for each association. The dashed line splits the experiment into two stages: on the left is the training stage, and on the right is the testing stage. Data from untrained associations is excluded from this learning curve analysis. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean across 165 human participants, while the shaded areas represent the 95% CI of the mean for the corresponding model simulations.

To show that only the ECPG model learns simplified representations, we computed the change in representation complexity during training, which was quantified as the difference in the mutual information \({I}^{\psi }({S;Z})\) before and after training (Fig. 3C). The ECPG model successfully reduced complexity, indicating that it learned simplified representations as expected. In contrast, the two control models did not compress their representations. Furthermore, we examined the simplicity parameter \(\lambda\) of the ECPG model and found it to be significantly greater than 0 (two-sided t(164) = 4.29, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI = [0.11, 0.29]) (see Supplementary Note 1.1 for model parameters). This finding suggests that the representation simplification plays an important role in capturing human behaviors.

Human participants generalized effectively. Despite receiving no training, the untrained accuracy for human participants is significantly greater than the 50% chance level, though slightly lower than trained accuracy (Fig. 3D, blue). This observation, consistent with many prior studies2,43,44, indicates that human participants effectively generalized from prior learning. The ECPG model closely captures this generalization phenomenon, whereas the two control models cannot generalize at all, with the untrained accuracy remaining at the 50% chance level (Fig. 3D, gray and orange). More importantly, the ECPG model's strong performance in capturing human generalization did not compromise its explanatory power for human learning behavior. It offers a description as precise as that of the two control models concerning the human learning curve throughout the training stage (Fig. 3E).

Based on both quantitative and qualitative evidence, we conclude that humans' ability to generalize originates from their computational goal of efficient coding. This process promotes the emergence of abstract latent states, which form the foundational basis for generalization.

Experiment 2 extended the standard paradigm to examine both functional-based and perceptual-based generalizations in humans. The experiment featured two primary modifications. First, we manipulated the stimuli's perceptual cues--shape, color, and appendage--to ensure each feature provided a different amount of information about the environment's rewards. We designed three experimental conditions, each with a distinct rewarding configuration (Fig. 1E):

In the consistent condition, the alien stimuli with the same color were associated with the same actions, making the color the most rewarding feature.

In the control condition, the colors of the stimuli were mutually different, and all features were equally rewarding. This condition, like Experiment 1, only tested the functional-based generalization and the state abstraction ability of an agent.

In the conflict condition, stimuli with the same color were associated with different actions, making shapes and appendages the rewarding features, while the color cue yielded a negative reward.

These three conditions also indicated three levels of difficulty in rewarding feature extraction. In the consistent and conflict condition, the four stimuli shared two colors, making color cues more frequent and salient. For example, while the “cylinder” shape was associated with rewards twice during training, the color “red” might have been rewarded four times. The consistent condition was the easiest because this salient feature yielded positive rewards, while the conflict condition was the most difficult because the agent needed to first suppress the color cue, the salient feature, before being able to detect rewarding ones.

The second primary modification in Experiment 2 was the incorporation of a probe stimulus during the testing stage; this stimulus was entirely new and had not been encountered during training. This probe was used to assess humans' ability to extract informative and rewarding features at a behavioral level. A more detailed introduction to the use of this probe design follows below, along with the presentation of our model's predictions. All other aspects of the experiment remained identical to those in Experiment 1.

We reused the three models in Experiment 1, only adding a feature embedding function to encode perceptual information. Each of the three visual features was encoded into a five-dimensional one-hot code, where each dimension indicated a specific feature value. For example, the shape “cylinder” was [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], the color “purple” was [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the color “yellow” was [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Each stimulus was represented by a combination of three such codes, concatenated into a 15-dimensional vector to form the model's input. We refer to the models used in Experiment 2 as feature RLPG (fRLPG; “Method-Models-fRLPG”), feature CPG (fCPG; “Method-Models-fCPG”), and feature ECPG (fECPG; “Method-Models-fECPG”) models to highlight their integration of the feature embedding construct.

To evaluate the model's feature extraction ability, we analyzed the importance assigned to each feature by perturbing one feature dimension and measuring changes in representations52,53. A larger change in the representations indicated a higher feature importance (see “Method-Perturbation-based feature importance”). Therefore, in this experiment, if a model consistently assigns more importance to the predefined rewarding perceptual cue across all three conditions, we conclude that this model can effectively detect and extract rewarding features.

Now that the stage is set, we can focus on answering three central research questions. First, does the principle of efficient coding drive a model to extract rewarding features? Second, if so, how can we validate that humans follow this principle in their learning processes? Third, how does the rewarding feature extraction interact with the state abstraction ability examined in Experiment 1?

For the first question, we ran stimulations and showed that efficient coding does promote reward feature extraction. As designed in the experiment, color served as the rewarding feature in the consistent condition, while it yielded negative rewards in the conflict condition. Driven by the need for simpler representations—reflected in a focus on fewer features—the fECPG model (\(\lambda\) = 0.2) must selectively assign more importance to the color cue in the consistent case; and less importance when the color becomes unrewarding (Fig. 4B, consistent). Conversely, in the conflict condition, the model had to first deemphasize the salient cue color, due to its negative rewards, and then reallocate importance to the other features contributing to positive rewards (Fig. 4B, conflict). The demand for simplicity drives the model to focus on a subset of features, and the goal of maximizing reward ensures that these focused features must be rewarding. In contrast, a model without efficient coding (\(\lambda=0\)) cannot adaptively reallocate feature importance during its interaction with the environment. The model exhibits nearly the same feature importance assignment for both consistent and conflict cases (Fig. 4A), indicating its inability to detect rewarding information. It is worth noting that the fECPG model unintuitively predicts that shape and appendage are rewarding features before training. We believe this is caused by our simplistic approach to encoder initialization. We will further elaborate this point in the discussion section. However, this observation does not undermine our conclusion.

All panels are generated by averaging over 400 simulations. A Simulated feature importance along with training of the fECPG model with \(\lambda\) = 0, which collapses to the fCPG model. Note that the “shape” and “appendage” curves always overlap. B Simulated feature importance along with training of the fECPG model with \(\lambda\) = 0.2. C The predictive “probe” representation and policy of the fECPG agent (\(\lambda\) = 0.2) at the end of the training stage. An encoder maps a stimulus \(s\in \{x,{x}^{{\prime} },x,y^{\prime} \}\) to a distribution of internal representations \({z}_{1}\) - \({z}_{4}\), and a policy maps a stimulus \({s}\in \{x,{x}^{{\prime} },x,y^{\prime} \}\) to a distribution of internal representations \({a}_{1}\) - \({a}_{4}\). Darker tiles denote higher values. The policies for the control and conflict conditions are more stochastic than are those in the consistent condition. The predictive policies applied to the probe stimuli are visualized in both a heatmap and a bar plot. D Representation complexity throughout learning. E Learning and generalization performance for the fECPG model with different levels of simplicity, λ = 0, 07, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5.

To address the second question, we adopted a “probe” design. The probe stimulus, introduced only during the testing stage and not present in the training, was designed to always share the same color as stimulus \(x\) and the same shape as stimulus \(y^{\prime}\). In the consistent condition, where color was the most important feature, the probe stimulus should be perceived as similar to stimulus \(x\) (Fig. 4C, consistent, encoder), leading to a response that coincides with the one for stimulus \(x\) (Fig. 4C, consistent, policy). In this scenario, it is expected that human participants will demonstrate a higher preference for actions \({a}_{1}\) and \({a}_{3}\) when responding to the probe stimuli. Conversely, in the conflict condition where color was neglected, the probe stimulus should be perceived as more similar to stimulus \(y^{\prime}\) (Fig. 4C, conflict, encoder), which should be also reflected in the response (Fig. 4C, conflict, policy). Therefore, human participants would be likely to use \({a}_{2}\) and \({a}_{4}\). In the control condition, given the lack of a dominant rewarding feature, the response to the probe stimulus should not show a strong preference, being distributed between those for stimuli \(x\) and \(y^{\prime}\) (Fig. 4C, control, policy).

For the third question, we observed that the efficiency of rewarding feature extraction extends or shortens the time it takes to form stable abstract states, influencing the agent's learning and generalization. In the consistent condition, the fECPG model rapidly identified the rewarding feature and formed stable abstract states (Fig. 4D, consistent), enabling a high degree of generalization (Fig. 4E, consistent). However, in the control condition, where no salient cue dominates, the model experienced a slower state abstraction process (Fig. 4D, control). In the conflict condition, the need to suppress color prolonged the time required to extract rewarding features, thereby further extending the state abstraction period (Fig. 4D, conflict). Consequently, the time available for policy decoding was reduced, resulting in poorer learning and generalization performance in the conflict case (Fig. 4E, control, conflict).

To validate these model predictions, we collected behavioral data from 313 participants who each completed three task blocks corresponding to consistent, control, and conflict conditions. We fit all three feature-based models and found that both BIC and PXP preferred the fECPG model as the best model for capturing human behavioral data, consistent with the findings from Experiment 1 (Fig. 5A, B and Table 2).

Models were fit to all behavioral data of each participant in both training and testing stages. A Models' Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for each participant. The fRLPG model has 1 parameter, the fCPG model has 2 parameters, and the fECPG model has 3 parameters. The BICs for a fully random policy are represented by dashed lines. Participants with lower BIC scores generally exhibit better learning and generalization performance. See Table 2 for the exact value. B Protected exceedance probability (PXP) tallies for each model. C Learning and generalization performance of human participants and models for each experimental condition. Dashed lines indicate the 50% chance level. Only data from the testing stage is included in the analysis. Error bars reflect the mean ± SD across 313 valid participants.

More importantly, as the principle of efficient coding predicts, human participants exhibit different levels of generalization across experimental conditions. They achieved high untrained accuracy in the consistent condition, lower in the control condition, and lowest in the conflict condition (Fig. 5C, blue). Beyond the overall trend, humans' generalization behaviors are also characterized by high variability. Some participants generalized effectively across all conditions, while others always negatively transferred their knowledge. This variability is also accurately captured by the fECPG model (Fig. 5C, red), but not by the two classical RL models without efficient coding (Fig. 5C, gray and orange).

To our surprise, the ECPG model shows a significant advantage in predicting human learning performance—an area where classical RL models have traditionally been preferred. Participants demonstrated a more rapid improvement in the consistent condition than in the control and conflict conditions. Specifically, the learning curve in the conflict condition was markedly slower when compared to the other conditions. Only the fECPG model captured the significantly slower trend (Fig. 6A).

Dashed lines split the experiment into training and testing stages. The analysis excludes responses to the untrained associations and the probe stimulus. Error bars represent the 95% CI of the mean across 165 human participants, while the shaded areas represent the 95% CI of the mean for the corresponding model simulations. B Humans and the fECPG model respond to the probe stimuli. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval for the mean estimate. C Correlation between model predictions and human responses to probe stimuli. The annotated value represents Spearman's correlation coefficient under different experimental conditions. The bold values highlight the highest correlation under each specific learning condition.

The probe design further validated the human participant's ability to extract rewarding features as predicted by the efficient coding principle. Human participants' responses to the probe stimuli were consistent with the fECPG model predictions (Fig. 6B, C; Spearman's r > 0.60, p < 0.001 for all conditions; see “Method-Correlation between humans' and models' probe response” for the correlation calculation). In contrast, models without efficient coding, fRLPG and fCPG, failed to replicate such behavioral patterns (see Supplementary Note 1.5 for their probe responses), exhibiting significantly weaker correlations with human behavioral data (Fig. 6C).

It is important to note that there is a discrepancy between our prediction and human behavior in the control condition. Human participants were likely to use the policy of stimulus \(x\) rather than a random policy in response to the probe. This phenomenon could have arisen from two potential factors. First, during training, the experiment might not have adequately balanced the presentation frequency of the stimuli. Participants learned two associations with stimulus \(x\) and one with stimulus \(y^{\prime}\) (with the other association tested in the testing stage), which implies that stimulus \(x\) was shown twice as frequently as was stimulus \(y^{\prime}\). Consequently, participants might have adaptively adjusted their encoding and decision-making on these statistics and placed more attention on stimulus \(x\). Second, the color feature might have been inherently more salient to humans. When the three features were equally informative, participants may have naturally prioritized the color feature. However, this gap does not undermine our conclusion that the fECPG model best captures human participants' responses to the probe stimulus.

All evidence leads to one conclusion: during learning, humans strive to distill representations into their simplest and most essential forms. Driven by this goal, humans learn representations using a small subset of rewarding features within their environments. They further simplify these representations by abstracting them into compact, lower-dimensional internal states, which naturally leads to generalization.

A potential argument is that the classical RL objective is still sufficient to explain human behavior once it is augmented with cognitive mechanisms at the algorithmic level. We oppose this view for two reasons. First, a range of current algorithmic-level models fail to capture human behaviors as effectively as the ECPG model (as detailed below). Second, the mechanisms embedded in these models inherently simplify representations, essentially pursuing efficient coding.

We developed and compared three algorithmic-level models (Fig. 7A). The first model, the Latent Cause model45,46,54,55 (LC; “Method-Models-LC”) employs a hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian process to simulate human state abstraction. During the learning period, the LC model categorizes observed stimuli into latent clusters and learns the decision policy for these clusters. The second model, called the Memory-Association model (MA; “Method-Models-MA”), memorizes all stimuli and their preferred actions, establishing associations between stimuli that share the same actions. These associations facilitate the inference of correct actions in untrained tasks, thereby enabling generalization. The third model, Attention at Choice and Learning48,56,57 (ACL; “Method-Models-ACL”) learns the value of each feature and calculates the feature importance based on these values. The model uses a linearly weighted feature value for decision-making. Notably, the LC and MA models emphasize state abstraction ability, whereas the ACL model is designed to extract and prioritize rewarding features. Both abilities could emerge by optimizing for the efficient coding goal, but in a different computational formulation.

A An overview of models across hierarchical levels. The central research question explores whether the human brain optimizes for efficient coding to enhance generalization. At the computational level, the ECPG model affirms this hypothesis (“Yes”), whereas the RLPG and CPG models represent the opposing viewpoint (“No”). These models collectively represent the entire hypothesis space at the computational level. Below this, the ECPG model is contrasted with various algorithmic-level models (LC, MA, ACL), each designed with specific cognitive mechanisms. Additionally, the ECPG model is compared against several common machine learning regularizers (L2PG, L1PG, DCPG) that also aim to reduce model complexity, but through different methods. B Model comparisons for all models in terms of BIC and PXP in Experiment 2. Error bars reflect the mean ± SD across 313 participants. Refer to Supplementary Note 1.3 for the model comparison in Experiment 1. Additionally, see Supplementary Note 3 for an analysis of why other models perform worse in fitting. C Learning and generalization performances across all models in the control case of Experiment 2. Error bars reflect the mean ± SD across 313 participants. See Supplementary Note 1.4 for generalizations in other conditions. D Correlation between model predictions and human responses to probe stimuli at different experimental conditions. See Supplementary Note 1.5 for the bar plots. The bold values highlight the highest correlation under each specific learning condition.

We tested these algorithmic-level models on Experiment 2, with a focus on two qualitative metrics: generalization in the control case to examine their latent cause abstraction ability (Fig. 7C) and response to probe stimuli to evaluate their rewarding feature extraction (Fig. 7D). All three models underperformed the fECPG model in terms of BIC and PXP (Fig. 7B, Table 2). The LC and MA models failed to account for human responses to probe stimuli (Fig. 7D) due to lacking feature extraction mechanism. The ACL model struggled with generalizing in the control case (Fig. 7C) as well as extracting rewarding features in both the control and conflict cases (Fig. 7D), because its feature importance calculations cannot deemphasize the negatively-rewarded feature effectively (see Supplementary Note 3.2 for further discussion). These results underscore the superior performance of the fECPG model, a computational-level model, in modeling human behaviors and support our hypothesis that human participants learn simplified representations when maximizing rewards.

From a machine learning perspective, the fECPG model proposed here defines a regularized optimization objective. This raises a final question: can the efficient-coding term be substituted by other commonly used machine learning regularizers? We implemented an L1-Norm Policy Gradient (L1PG; “Method-Models-L1PG, L2PG, and DCPG”) and an L2-Norm Policy Gradient (L2PG), incorporating L1 or L2 norms as heuristic approximations for representation complexity. While the L1PG model underperformed, the L2PG model showed comparable performance to fECPG (Fig. 7B, C, and D). Although a substantial portion ( ~ 36%) of participants were better described by the L2PG model, these participants displayed distinct behavioral dynamics: compared to participants better captured by the fECPG model, they tended to learn more slowly and showed weaker generalization (see Supplementary Note 3.3 for further details). This suggests that the ECPG model has a unique capability in capturing humans' fast learning and strong generalization patterns. For completeness, we also tested a Random Regularizer Policy Gradient (RNDPG; “Method-Models-RNDPG”), which injects noise into the encoder weights58, as well as a Decoder Complexity Policy Gradient (DCPG), which constrains decoder complexity. However, both models failed to generalize in the control condition or extracting rewarding features (Fig. 7B, C, D).

Finally, we validated our conclusions by performing a model recovery analysis to test our ability to differentiate between models (Supplementary Note 1.6). Importantly, we found that the ECPG model can be uniquely distinguished from the other models. The low false positive rate (with other models unlikely to be misidentified as ECPG) indicates that the ECPG model's superior performance over the control models is not due to its expressiveness but to its accurate description of human behavior. Thus, these findings support our conclusion that the ECPG model, with its efficient coding-augmented RL objective, best accounts for human learning and generalization.

The classical RL framework has limitations in terms of its ability to explain human representation learning and generalization. In this paper, we proposed augmenting the classical RL objective with the efficient coding principle: an intelligent agent should distill the simplest necessary representations that enable it to achieve its behavioral objectives. A computational-level model derived from the revised framework (Efficient Coding Policy Gradient; ECPG), predicts that an intelligent agent automatically learns to construct representations with a small set of rewarding features with the environment. These representations are further simplified by abstracting them into compact, lower-dimensional internal states, which naturally results in generalization. These predictions were validated in two behavioral experiments, where the ECPG model consistently provided a more accurate description of human behavior than two classical RL models without efficient coding as well as several published human representation learning models. These findings indicate that efficient coding offers a more suitable computational objective in understanding human behavior.

In this paper, we examine whether the classical RL objective alone, or in combination with efficient coding, better aligns with Marr's computational level in explaining human behavior. A potential critique of our approach in section “The human brain optimizes efficient coding to enhance learning and generalization” is the lack of comparison with an alternative model capable of generalizing without representation simplification. However, we found no such model in the existing literature. This absence reflects the historical context of the acquired equivalence paradigm on which our study builds. Although generalization within this paradigm has long been documented59, previous explanations—including categorization60, stimulus association2, and selective attention61—are all encompassed by our efficient coding framework. In other words, algorithmic models based on selective attention, for example, inherently implement mechanisms predicted by the computational-level goal of efficient coding.

Previous research using the acquired equivalence paradigm has demonstrated that people with schizophrenia62,63, mild Alzheimer's disease64, hippocampal atrophy43, and Parkinson's disease43 exhibit dysfunction in performing acquired equivalence task. Despite these findings, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying these impairments remain incomplete understanding. The ECPG model, which provides a detailed computational representation of human learning and generalization within this paradigm, may offer a framework for investigating the cognitive and neural processes underlying these cognitive anomalies. However, this potential application of the ECPG model remains untested and requires empirical validation through experimental studies.

Beyond serving as a better empirical model for human learning, the proposed computational objective could potentially represent a rational strategy (specifically, a resource-rational strategy; see below) for humans. The classical RL objective was designed to maximize expected reward in narrowly defined settings, where agents focus on learning a single, well-defined task17. However, humans live in more complex and dynamic real-world environments, where decision-making requires agents to generalize effectively from past experiences to earn rewards in unseen scenarios. Moreover, the human brain is innately capacity-constrained35; it has inherent limitations in processing and storing information, which requires the efficient use of cognitive resources. Therefore, learning simpler representations that facilitate generalization is a crucial component in the pursuit of maximizing reward in real-world decision-making. We believe that this insight can also improve learning and generalization in artificial intelligence operating under real-world conditions.

The idea of linking RL to efficient coding has been applied to understand learning and generalization in various contexts22,42,65,66,67,68,69. For example, this approach has been shown to better explain monkeys' neural activity in frontal areas65, humans' risky choice behavior67, and meta-level generalization between tasks66. Here, we present a specific formalization of efficient coding using information-theoretic measures. We demonstrate that this approach provides a better empirical description of both human learning and generalization behaviors compared to several alternatives.

Our study also helps bridge the gap between representation learning in the human brain and machine learning. In cognitive science, researchers have applied latent cause clustering (LC) and Association-Choice Learning (ACL) models to understand a variety of phenomena9. Latent cause clustering can explain Pavlovian conditioning and extinction55, memory modification54, social classification70, and functional-based generalization45,46,71. Selective attention, on the other hand, has been used to explain concept formation72, the evolution of beliefs73, and has received neural evidence from eye-tracking and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies48,56. In machine learning, researchers have focused on how information-theoretic regularizers facilitate an artificial agent performing complex cognitive tasks. For example, information-theoretic regularizers may help an agent learn robust state abstractions that enhance learning speed74,75,76 and form a simple but informative world model77,78. Our study demonstrates that in a simple cognitive task, both mechanisms serve the unified objective of minimizing representation complexity, guided by an information-theoretic regularizer. This finding facilitates communication between the two fields and contributes to a unified research framework for understanding both machine and human intelligence. Building on this line of thought, we plan to extend the current framework in future research to more complex task settings, such as multi-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and explore whether complex human behaviors like planning and multi-task learning align with the predictions of information-theoretic regularizers within machine learning.

Recent research has suggested that human intelligence is more accurately described by the principle of resource-rationality79,80 than by the classical notion of rationality81. The resource-rationality principle emphasizes the need to consider computational costs in the pursuit of maximum reward, building on the classical notion of rationality. The combination of efficient coding and reward maximization principles applied in this study encapsulates the idea of resource-rationality, with reward maximization representing the notion of rationality and representation complexity representing computational costs. The basic idea is that information transmission in the brain incurs significant metabolic costs, thus minimizing representation complexity (a quantification of average information transmitted into the brain) serves as a reasonable proxy to minimize computational costs82. Notably, while numerous studies have employed resource-rationality to explain deviations from pure rationality in human behavior38,83,84, our research further emphasizes the advantages conferred by the principle, particularly in accounting for state abstraction, rewarding feature extraction, and generalization.

Participants gave informed consent. The experimental protocol was approved by the University Committee on Activities involving Human Subjects at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (IRB-2055). Our experiment did not collect any demographical information from participants, including gender.

The experiments were designed based on the paradigm of acquired equivalence (AE)2,43,44. The experiment included two types of pictures: alien and scene. For the alien pictures, we utilized the “greebles” stimuli reported by Gauthier and Tarr85,86 (http://www.tarrlab.org/). The original greeble stimuli are purple. We created several new variants by modifying their color. Regarding the scene pictures, we sampled from the “Places205” picture database, as reported in Zhou et al.87 (http://places.csail.mit.edu/downloadData.html).

In the main experiment blocks, aliens and scenes were organized into sets. Each set comprised four alien stimuli (\(x\), \(x^{\prime}\), \(y\), \(y^{\prime}\)) and four scenes (\({a}_{1}\), \({a}_{2}\), \({a}_{3}\), \({a}_{4}\)), resulting in eight unique associations per set. Six of these associations were trained during the association stage, while all eight were tested in the testing stage. It is important to note that the stimuli in the AE task are defined to be “superficially dissimilar”. In our experiment, the greeble stimuli within a block were required to have the same color but exhibit mutually different shapes and appendages. There was no correlation between the alien's shape (the configuration of its appendages) and the correct response.

We recruited 302 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)88. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. All participants gave informed consent before starting the experiment. Each participant completed two practice blocks. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the experiment, participants were required to achieve at least 70% accuracy in the second practice block to progress to the main experimental stage. Those who did not meet this criterion were allowed to repeat the second practice block until they achieved the necessary performance level; otherwise, they could not proceed to the main experiment. Participants received a base payment of $2 plus a bonus of up to $3 based on their response accuracy in this 20-minute experiment.

This project aimed to study generalization within the learning process, meaning participants who did not learn were outside the scope of this study. Consequently, we excluded 137 participants who failed a screening criterion (average accuracy lower than 60% for the last 24 trials, equating to 4 repetitions, in the training stage). All analyzes in Experiment 1 were conducted with the remaining 165 qualified participants.

The experiment consisted of two types of trials: training and testing. Each training trial comprised three screens. Following a 500 ms fixation screen, the trial presented an alien stimulus in the upper middle of the screen, along with photographs of scenes, offering one correct and one incorrect choice. Participants were instructed, “Which scene is associated with this alien?” and asked to respond by pressing the “F” or “J” key. These choices' left-right order was counterbalanced across trials. The stimulus screen remained visible for ten seconds, followed by a one-second feedback screen displaying either “Correct! You got 1 point.” or “Incorrect! You got 0 point”. The test stage trials were identical, except that no feedback was provided after responses. In the testing stage, the experiment was directed to the next fixation screen following the participant's response or after a maximum duration of ten seconds.

Experiment 1 included two experimental blocks. Each block consisted of a training stage, during which participants learned the stimulus-action associations, and a testing stage, during which participants were tested on the learned associations as well as an untrained generalization probe (the dashed associations). The training stage involved each association being trained ten times with feedback, resulting in 6 (associations) × 10 (repetitions) = 60 training trials. The testing stage tested both the trained and untrained associations six times, resulting in 8 (associations) × 6 (repetitions) = 48 testing trials. Participants were explicitly informed of the transition between the two experimental stages, and they were also reminded to keep and reapply their training experiences to achieve better performance.

Before the main blocks, each participant was required to complete two practice blocks. The first practice block contained a simple trial-and-error learning task, where participants were trained to learn the correct answer through feedback. They were asked to correctly associate \(x-{a}_{1}\) and \(y-{a}_{2}\) without being asked to build any between-stimuli equivalence. This block provided a gentle introduction to the experiment, with ten trials and unlimited response time. The primary goal of the first practice was to familiarize participants with the trial-and-error training process. The second practice served as a quiz. This block included a simplified version of the main training stage, where participants were presented with four stimuli but only required to choose from two actions. It contained 4 (associations) × 10 (repetitions) = 40 training trials. Participants needed to achieve 70% accuracy to pass the quiz; otherwise, they were required to repeat the second practice block before progressing to the main experimental blocks. The practice blocks were designed to help participants learn to establish between-stimuli equivalence in preparation for the main experimental blocks and used similar materials as the main blocks.

We recruited 497 participants from MTurk. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. All participants gave informed consent prior to the experiment. Each participant completed two practice blocks. To ensure full understanding of the experiment, they needed to achieve at least 70% accuracy in the second practice block to proceed to the main experimental stage. Those who did not meet this criterion were given the opportunity to repeat the second practice block until they reached the required accuracy. All participants received a $3 base payment plus up to a $4.5 bonus based on their response accuracy in this 30-minute experiment.

We filtered the participants' data using the same screening criterion as in Experiment 1. A total of 184 participants were excluded because they did not achieve an average accuracy of 60% for the last 24 trials (equivalent to 4 repetitions) in the training stage. All analyzes in Experiment 2 were conducted with the remaining 313 qualified participants.

Note that Experiment 2 included twice as many qualified participants as Experiment 1. This is because each participant in Experiment 1 completed two identical experimental blocks, while in Experiment 2, participants completed three different blocks, each corresponding to a different experimental condition. To ensure that each condition in Experiment 2 had a comparable amount of data to Experiment 1, we increased participant enrollment.

After completing the same practice blocks as in Experiment 1, participants were required to complete three main experimental blocks: a consistent block, a control block, and a conflict block. The sequence of these blocks was counterbalanced among participants. The three blocks were almost identical; the only difference lay in the stimuli's appearance.

Within each block, participants were required to complete a 60-trial training stage, which was the same as in Experiment 1. They then entered the testing stage, where they had to respond to eight regular testing associations plus an additional probe stimulus. Consequently, the testing stage comprised 9 (associations) × 6 (repetitions) = 54 trials.

The remaining details of Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1. Note that, unlike the untrained associations, we did not predefine a correct answer for the probe stimulus. We simply record participants' responses and hope to uncover which feature people were attending to by analyzing the response distribution.

To set the stage, we first formalize a dynamic decision process in the AE paradigm. For consistency, we adopt a notation system similar to that used in the experimental paradigm.

We refer to a participant or decision maker as an agent. In each trial \(t\), an agent is presented with an alien stimulus \({s}_{t}\) from the set \(\{x,\,{x}^{{\prime} },{y},{y}^{\prime} \}\). The agent's task is to select an action, specifically a scene picture \({a}_{t}\), from the set \(\{{a}_{1},\,{a}_{2},\,{a}_{3},\,{a}_{4}\}\), with the objective of maximizing the reward \(r({s}_{t},{a}_{t})\) based on the feedback received. The subscript \(t\) denotes the variable at a particular trial. Both the stimulus \(S\) and action \(A\) are defined as categorical variables.

RLPG is a computational level model. The goal of the RLPG model is to identify a policy \(\pi\) that optimizes the classical RL goal.

In the AE experiment, an agent was required to choose from two possible actions; before receiving any feedback, each action had a 50% chance of being correct. The agent should have had a baseline estimation of reward, denoted as \(b\), prior to making a decision. An action is considered positive when it yields a reward higher than the baseline and negative when the reward is lower. We revised Eq. 4 to include this baseline reward estimation \(b\),

The formula indicates that the RL baseline learns to adjust the policy π(a|s) to maximize received reward subtracted by the baseline r(st,at)-b. The reward subtracted by the baseline is commonly called advantage in the machine learning community. In this AE task, we assumed \(b\) = 0.5, corresponding to an expected reward of 0.5 (reward of 1 with 50% probability).

The objective function can theoretically be tackled by any RL algorithm, but we have chosen a particular approach for its simplicity: the policy gradient method. We assume the policy follows a parameterized softmax distribution, transforming the optimization problem into a parameter search:

where \(\phi\) denotes the parameters of the policy. Here, \(\phi\) is a 4-by-4 table (4 stimuli by 4 action). See Supplementary Note 2.1 for a graphical illustration of the model architecture. For simplicity, we will denote this softmax formula as \({{{\rm{softmax}}}}(\phi (s,a)).\)

Let \(J\left(\phi \right)={\max }_{\phi }E\left[r\left({s}_{t},{a}_{t}\right)-b\right]\), then the policy parameters were updated based on the gradient of the objective function \({\nabla }_{\phi }J(\phi )\),

where \({\alpha }_{\pi }\ge 0\) is the learning rate of policy \(\pi\). This policy learning rate is the only parameter in the RL baseline model. The policy parameters \(\phi\) were initialized to 0 before the experiment. Equation 7 updates the policy via its gradient, which gives the name “policy gradient”. We have derived the analytical gradient for both models and verified the derivation using pyTorch package89. See supplementary material for detailed derivation. The RLPG model features a single parameter: the policy's learning rate, \({\alpha }_{\pi }\).

There are two remarks related to this simple model. First, though not explicitly shown, the RLPG assumes a perfect representation that fully reconstructs the stimulus. If we construct a model that explicitly includes the representation \(z\) and assume that each stimulus \(s\) deterministically maps to a unique representation \(z\), the model nevertheless collapses to the RLPG model described above. Second, the RLPG model introduced in this study behaves similarly to the classic Q-learning model which is extensively used in psychology25. The most significant advantage of RLPG is its simplicity. The model has a single learning rate parameter, simultaneously approximating the effects of both the “learning rate” and “inverse temperature” parameters in the classic model. This allows for a more effective distillation of the computational essence underlying representation compression.

The ECPG model is designed with a dual computational goal: to maximize reward while minimizing representation complexity.

The parameter \(\lambda \ge 0\), referred to as the simplicity parameter, controls for the tradeoff between the classical RL objective and representation simplicity. When \(\lambda=0\), the agent does not compress stimuli representations for simplicity, focusing solely on reward maximization. Conversely, as \(\lambda \to \infty\), the agent learns the simplest set of representations, encoding all stimuli into a single, identical representation. Therefore, an optimal \(\lambda\) balances compression and oversimplification.

The introduction of latent representation \(z\) divides the policy into an encoder, \(\psi\), and a decoder, \(\rho\), both of which are optimized according to Eq. 8. Like the RLPG, we solve Eq. 8 using the policy gradient. Here, we considered a parameterized softmax encoder \(\psi ({z|s;}\theta )\) and a decoder ρ(a│z;ϕ). The encoder parameter θ is a 4-by-4 table (4 stimuli by 4 representations) and the decoder parameter \(\phi\) is also a 4-by-4 table (See Supplementary Note 2.3.3 for a graphical illustration of the model architecture). The policy \(\pi\) is derived from the combination of the encoder and decoder:

We iteratively update the encoder and decoder to optimize Eq. 8 using the following scheme:

Here, \(p(z)\) indicates the prior preference to the representation \(z\). The first two optimization problems were solved using gradient ascent with learning rate parameters, \({\alpha }_{\psi }\) and \({\alpha }_{\rho }\). The prior representation probability \(p(z)\) was updated according to the definition of marginal probability. In practice, we also experimented with updating the prior in the gradient formula but found it made no significant difference in modeling human behavior. Therefore, we adopted the current scheme to reduce the number of free parameters.

The initialization of the representation variable \(z\) is critical. In this article, \(z\) is a categorical variable that shares the same sample space as the stimulus. The encoder parameters \(\theta\) are initialized by passing the product of an identity matrix and an initial value through a softmax function,

where I is an identity indicator \({{{\bf{I}}}}\left(s,z\right)=1\,{{{\rm{if\,}}}}{z}=s\) \({{{\rm{otherwise}}}}\,0\). We pretrained the encoders to reach 99% discrimination accuracy by tuning the initial value \({\theta }_{0}\). The initial encoder in this case encoded stimuli almost orthogonally, reflecting the “superficially dissimilarity” in the definition of AE. See “Method-Pretrain an encoder” for more details.

In summary, the ECPG model has three parameters: an encoder learning rate \({\alpha }_{\psi }\), a decoder learning rate \({\alpha }_{\rho }\), a simplicity parameter \(\lambda\). The stimulus encoder parameters were initialized through pretraining, and the parameters of the decoder were initialized to 0.

The ECPG model's encoder acts as a generative component, similar to the encoder in the beta variational autoencoder (\(\beta\)VAE) as described by Higgins et al.13 but with a categorical hidden layer instead of a continuous Gaussian distribution. This design facilitates the computation of mutual information and the quantification of representation complexity, building upon the work of Lu et al.90.

The cascade policy gradient (CPG) model is a special case of the ECPG model, with the simplicity fixed at 0, \(\lambda=0\). Therefore, the model has only two parameters: the learning rate for the encoder \({\alpha }_{\psi }\) and the learning rate for the decoder \({\alpha }_{\rho }\).

The feature-based models we developed are extensions of the models previously introduced. The primary difference lies in the incorporation of a feature embedding function \({{{\mathcal{F}}}}\) that maps a stimulus \(s\) onto a set of features \(f\). We crafted a feature embedding function to decompose a greeble stimulus into three distinct features: shape, color, and appendage, using “one-hot encoding” for clear differentiation. For instance, the color “purple” is represented as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] and “yellow” as [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The feature function \({{{\mathcal{F}}}}\) each input stimulus with its one-hot code and concatenates these codes into a 15-dimensional vector \(f\), which serves as the model's input (See Supplementary Fig. S7C).

We modified the policy of the fRLPG model to create a feature-based baseline RL model that does not compress stimuli. This model proposes that visual similarity alone could account for human generalization performance, without the need for a representation compression mechanism. With the feature embedding function \({{{\mathcal{F}}}}\) defined, the policy at trial \(t\) can be expressed as follows,

The parameter \(\phi\) now is a 15-by-4 table. As before, the parameter \(\phi\) was updated using the policy gradient method Eq. 7, and actions are selected by sampling from the softmax policy, Eq. 12. The model has one parameter, the learning rate of policy \({\alpha }_{\pi }\).

We modified the ECPG encoder to include the feature embedding function and preserved the previous ECPG decoder formulation (See Supplementary Fig. S7D),

The parameter \(\theta\) now is a 15-by-4 table. The decoder \(\rho ({a|z;}\phi )\) remains unchanged.

A new challenge we faced was initializing the encoder parameters for the feature-based model. The previous method, which relied on an identity matrix, was no longer suitable because stimuli with overlapping features naturally appear more similar. For instance, a purple greeble should be more similar to another purple greeble than to a yellow one.

To address this, we introduced a new initialization technique:

First, we measured the visual similarity between a stimulus \(s\) and all possible stimuli \(z\) (including stimuli \(s\) itself) by calculating the dot product of their feature embeddings,

Second, we multiplied these similarity scores by a scalar \({\theta }_{0}\) and passed them through a softmax function to form the representation of stimuli \(s\),

As before, the initial value \({\theta }_{0}\) is tuned through pretraining. This value controls the perceived similarity between stimuli. When \({\theta }_{0}\) is small, stimuli with overlapping features look similar.

Finally, we used the representation \(\bar{\psi }\left(z,|,s\right)\) as supervised labels to train the model encoder \(\psi \left(z{{{\mathcal{F}}}}\left(s\right),\,\theta \right)\) by minimizing their cross-entropy loss

Once the training has converged, the encoder for the fECPG model is considered initialized. The subsequent learning and decision-making processes are consistent with the original ECPG model.

The model has three parameters \(\{{\alpha }_{\psi },\,{\alpha }_{\rho },\lambda \}\): the learning rate for the encoder \({\alpha }_{\psi }\), the learning rate decoder \({\alpha }_{\rho }\), and the simplicity parameter \(\lambda\).

The fCPG model is special case of the fECPG with the simplicity parameter fix to 0, \(\lambda=0\). The model has two parameters \({\alpha }_{\psi }\) and \({\alpha }_{\rho }\): the learning rate for the encoder \({\alpha }_{\psi }\), the learning rate for decoder \({\alpha }_{\rho }\).

The LC model is an algorithmic-level model, adopted and modified from Gershman et al.54. The central idea of the LC model is to use a non-parametric Bayesian process—Chinese Restaurant Process—to model the cognitive process of latent-cause clustering. The original model cannot be directly applied to the acquired equivalence task, as it is a model of associative learning, not instrumental learning. We modified the model to learn a stimulus-action value function that allows instrumental learning. See more implementation details in Supplementary Note 2.4.

The MA model is an algorithmic-level model that combines memory and association mechanisms. It memorizes stimuli-action pairs and forms associations between stimuli with shared actions or features, using these associations to infer actions for untrained tasks. Stimuli with salient shared features (like “color”) are more easily associated. See more implementation details in Supplementary Note 2.5.

The ACL model is an algorithmic-level model that model humans' rewarding feature extraction ability using a linear selective attention mechanism. The model was from Leong et al.56 with two modifications. First, the original ACL model was developed on a different paradigm and could not be directly applied to the current generalization task. We modified the ACL model to include a feature-action value \(Q(f,a)\) design as in Ballard et al.57. Second, instead of using the attention weights calculated from the eye-tracking and functional MRI data, we estimated the attention weight using an attention model. The original authors constructed two types of models to examine the bidirectional relationship between learning and attention. The “choice models” utilize attention data, collected through eye tracking and fMRI, to predict human behaviors. Conversely, the “attention models” use human behavioral data as input and predict the recorded attention data. In this study, we implemented the ACL model by combining the best choice model (the ACL model in the original paper) and the best attention model (the VALUE model in the original paper). We chose this approach because our study lacks attention data, such that we have to use the best attention model to provide reasonable estimation of the attention weights. See more implementation details in Supplementary Note 2.6.

The three models have similar computational goals with the ECPG model, except that the representation complexity \({I}^{\psi }({S;Z;}\theta )\) terms in Eqs. 8 and 13 was respectively replaced by L1 norm (\({\left|\left|\theta \right|\right|}_{1}\)), L2 norm (\({\left|\left|\theta \right|\right|}_{2}\)), and decoder complexity \({I}^{\rho }({Z;A;}\phi )\).

The RNDPG considers replacing the mutual information regularizer \({I}^{\psi }\left({S;Z}\right)\) with a random noise penalty \({R}^{\psi }(\varepsilon )\) on the encoder weights,

where \({R}^{\psi }\left(\varepsilon \right)\) is a Gaussian noise injected to the encoder weights58. Unlike the other regularized policy gradient models, such as ECPG and L1PG, there is no close-form solution for the RNDPG model. Instead, we implemented this model using a sampling method. Please see more implementation details in Supplementary Note 2.7.

AE describes the phenomenon where generalization between two “superficially dissimilar” stimuli increases after they have been paired with the same actions. To ensure their dissimilarity, we selected stimuli that are easily distinguishable by human participants. We operationally defined this dissimilarity by setting a criterion: all four input stimuli must be classifiable with an accuracy of 99%. In order to accurately model human behaviors in the AE task, all models should undergo pretraining to achieve this level of discrimination accuracy.

The key step of the pretraining is to search for an appropriate \({\theta }_{0}\). This is because all models' encoders were specially designed such that they can be initialized once the \({\theta }_{0}\) is decided,

The initial discrimination accuracy of the encoder can be quantified as follows:

Given these constructs, we can search for an appropriate \({\theta }_{0}\) by addressing the following objective,

Addressing this optimization objective, we initialized ECPG and CPG model using \({\theta }_{0}^{*}=\,5.232\). To initialize the fECPG and fCPG, we used \({\theta }_{0}^{*}=1.459\) for the consistent and conflict case; \({\theta }_{0}^{*}=1.329\) for the control case.

A standard RL problem considers decision-making as sampling an action from the policy \(\pi \left(a,|,{s}_{t}\right)\), a categorical distribution over the possible action space. In the AE problem, the possible action space varied from trial to trial. Participants were instructed to choose between \({a}_{1}\) and \({a}_{2}\) in one trial, while they were presented with \({a}_{3}\) and \({a}_{4}\) in another trial. To run both RL-base models in the AE task, we applied a technique called invalid action masking91.

The simplest masking is to add a large negative number \(\zeta\) (in this work, \(\zeta=-1e12\)) to logits of the actions that are not presented in the current trial. That is, when an RLPG agent needs to choose between \({a}_{1}\) and \({a}_{2}\), we can calculate its renormalized policy as,

where \(\widetilde{\phi }\) is,

We then sampled from this renormalized policy to model human decision-making.

For the ECPG and CPG models, we masked and re-normalized the decoder for all representations \(z\),

To investigate the importance of different features (color, shape, appendages) to humans, we adopted a perturbation-based measurement approach52,53, applied to our model fitted to human behavior. This method calculates the importance of each feature by theorizing that if an agent focuses heavily on a particular feature, then a minor perturbation in that feature might lead to significant changes in the output. This perturbation-based importance has been applied to extract measures of attention from large-scale deep reinforcement learning models in artificial intelligence, which was shown to be similar to human eye-tracking attention data53.

In the present work, we calculated the perturbation-based feature importance following the pseudo-algorithm 1 (Supplementary Note 2.2), modified based on the feature importance algorithm described in92.

For each model, we estimated its free parameters separately for each subject, using all behavioral data from both the training and testing trials without cross-validation. This approach is consistent with many previous human learning studies, which are often structured with 2 to 4 parallel blocks due to various practical constraints e.g84,93,94,95. Given the insufficient number of blocks, these studies, including ours, do not meet the prerequisites for effective cross-validation.

The parameters were estimated via maximum a posteriori (MAP):

where \({{{\rm{M}}}}\) refers to the model architecture, and \(\xi\) the model parameters. \(N\) is the number of trials for each participant. \({s}_{i}\) and \({a}_{i}\) are the presented stimuli and human responses recorded on each trial. We selected a very flat prior \(p\left(\xi \right)={{{\rm{Halfnorm}}}}(0,\,50)\) for all parameters with a range of \((0,\infty )\) only to avoid extreme parameter values without biasing estimation. This prior is uninformative yet ensures that parameter estimates remain within a reasonable range. Parameters with a range of \((0,\,1)\) used a uniform prior.

Parameter estimation was performed using the BFGS algorithm, implemented with the Python package scipy.minimize. For each participant, we ran the algorithm with 50 different randomly chosen parameter initializations to avoid local minima in the non-convex landscape.

The parameter we are interested in is the simplicity degree (\(\lambda\)). We simulated the ECPG model's learning and generalization behaviors by varying \(\lambda\), while keeping the other two learning rate parameters constant. In Experiment 1, the learning rate of the encoder was fixed at \({\alpha }_{\psi }=40\), and that of the decoder was fix at \({\alpha }_{\rho }=4\). In Experiment 2, the learning rate of the encoder was fixed at \({\alpha }_{\psi }=8\), and that of the decoder was fix at \({\alpha }_{\rho }=4\).

For each participant within a block, we calculated the frequency for each action as an estimation of human probe policy. We applied the same method to the simulated data to obtain models' probe policy. Subsequently, we computed the Spearman's correlation between human participants and models based on the probability of selecting actions \({a}_{1}\) and \({a}_{3}\). These two actions sufficiently characterize a policy.

It will need a lot more chips and power to do so.

Huawei's next-generation HiSilicon Ascend 910D AI processor is expected to offer better performance than Nvidia's H100, reports Reuters. The new processor will be slower on a chip vs chip basis compared to Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Blackwell Ultra B300 GPUs, never mind the next-generation Rubin GPUs slated to launch next year. However, Huawei's approach of building pods with hundreds of processors should allow the Ascend 910D to compete against pods based on Nvidia's current Blackwell and upcoming Rubin GPUs.

Huawei is preparing to start tests of its most advanced artificial intelligence processor, the Ascend 910D, with the performance goal of surpassing Nvidia's H100 and offering a domestic alternative amid U.S. export restrictions. According to sources, Huawei has approached several local companies to assess whether the new Ascend 910D chip meets performance and deployment requirements. Initial samples are expected by late May.

Separately, Huawei plans to start large-scale shipments of its dual-chiplet Ascend 910C AI processors to Chinese customers (and probably full systems based on the chips) as early as next month. The majority of of these processors were reportedly produced by TSMC for a third-party company. It remains to be seen whether the Ascend 910D will be made by China-based SMIC, or whether — nearly five years after the U.S. government restricted Huawei's access to leading-edge semiconductor production capabilities — Huawei will once again find a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions.

Reaching Nvidia H100 performance levels won't be easy for Huawei. The company's latest dual-chiplet Ascend 910C offers around 780 BF16 TFLOPS of performance, whereas Nvidia's H100 can deliver around 2,000 BF16 TFLOPS. In order to achieve H100 performance levels, Huawei will have to redesign the internal architecture of the Ascend 910D and possibly increase the number of compute chiplets.

To stay competitive in the AI industry next year, Huawei will have to achieve performance comparable to that of AI clusters developed in the U.S. This year, the company introduced its CloudMatrix 384 system with 384 Ascend 910C processors. It can reportedly beat Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 in certain workloads, but at the cost of significantly higher power consumption due to dramatically lower performance-per-watt. It also has over five times as many 'AI processors' as an NVL72 rack. Whether the interconnect can scale well to the required number of processors remains to be seen.

Without access to leading-edge process technologies, it will become significantly more difficult for Huawei to maintain competitive positions next year. Nvidia is on-track to introduce its codenamed Rubin GPUs for AI and HPC in 2026. Rubin GPUs are set to be made on TSMC's N3 (or a more advanced) fabrication process, and they should offer even higher performance-per-watt than the current-generation Blackwell GPUs.

Rubin GPUs are slated to offer around 8,300 TFLOPS of FP8 training performance, and presumably half that for BF16 — about twice the performance of the B200. Huawei's Ascend 910D and next-generation CloudMatrix systems with 384 of such processors could theoretically offer competitive AI performance on the rack level. However, it remains to be seen what performance benefits Huawei's Ascend 910D and Nvidia's Rubin GPUs will offer compared to existing offerings. Also, it should be noted that Nvidia will barely be able to sell its high-performance Rubin GPUs in China, so for that market Huawei won't really have a direct competitor.

Regardless of performance or efficiency, Huawei's Ascend 910D processors will likely become China's workhorses when it comes to AI training in the coming years. Given the strategic importance of AI, the power consumption of the Ascend 910D (or any other domestic AI processor) will not be a limiting factor, as the number of deployed units could offset the efficiency of Nvidia's (or AMD, Intel, Broadcom, etc.) AI processors. The main limiting factor for China will be its ability to produce enough processors — either domestically, or overseas using proxy companies.

So far, the impact of Donald Trump's trade war with China has mostly only been felt in the markets. The worst is yet to come for consumers, according to Pegatron, a Taiwanese company that plays a key role in the supply chain of Apple and other electronics companies like Dell. An executive from the company, speaking to Reuters, warned that Trump's on-again, off-again, add another 25% for retaliation approach to tariffs will likely lead to shortages as we head toward summer.

“Within two months, shelves in the United States … might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing,” Pegatron chairman T.H. Tung told Reuters.

Obviously, the extremely high 145% tariff that the US placed on China plays a major role in the potential shortfall of devices—that's a pretty major tax for companies to pay and likely pass onto consumers. But the bigger issue may simply be the uncertainty around what exactly the Trump administration is going to do next, which makes it difficult for any company to plan more than a few months ahead. “We won't immediately adjust our long-term plans just because of two or three months of tariff changes. Manufacturing bases require long-term planning,” Tung said.

You can see this play out pretty clearly with Apple. When Trump first announced his “reciprocal” tariffs earlier this month, which initially included a 34% tax on imports from China, Apple started scrambling to move its current stock and manufacturing supply chain around in a way that would minimize the pain. The company moved $2 billion worth of iPhones from India to the US before the tariffs hit, and then started the pretty complicated process of shifting manufacturing out of China (as Trump cranked the tariffs all the way up to a cartoonish 145% tax) to India, where tariffs are 10%. Even India could see an additional 26% added by July if no deal is struck.

About two weeks into the trade war, Trump announced his administration would exempt devices like smartphones and computers from the current tariff regime, which provided a reprieve to companies like Apple and their suppliers…for exactly one day, before Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said actually that is only temporary and new sector-specific tariffs will go into effect in a month or two. What will that tariff be? Will it ever actually come to fruition? And if it does, how long will it stay? No one knows. You just gotta guess.

Obviously, that is not exactly how these companies with massive, international supply chains like to operate. So inevitably, they are going to wait and see before committing to any major shift. That means supply is likely to thin out in the meantime. So if you stop into an Apple Store in June, don't be surprised if the display models are the only iPhones in the building.

White House officials held a press conference Tuesday morning to talk about the economy, as Americans get extremely nervous about the tariffs on China that are starting to cause prices to rise. And while Trump's goons put on a brave face, it was clear they're in panic mode. In fact, one question about Amazon really got them flustered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted things were all going according to plan, even though Americans are starting to see 145% surcharges added to their shipments from Chinese retailers like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress. But when a reporter asked about a report from Punchbowl on Tuesday that Amazon would be listing tariff costs when consumers check out, Leavitt flipped her lid.

“This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” said Leavitt. “Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?”

Amazon probably didn't add an “inflation” surcharge during the Biden years because that's not a real thing that any normal person thinks of doing. But it's very easy to add a tariff line because we know exactly how much that is going to cost consumers. In the case of Trump's 145% tariff on goods from China, it's going to be 145%.

Leavitt went on to hold up a printout of a Reuters article from 2021 titled “Amazon Partnered With China Propaganda Arm.” The article notes that Amazon was marketing a collection of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speeches and writings on its online store in China about two years earlier. The crux of the story is that Amazon disabled reviews in the country after Chinese officials complained about negative reviews and added a page called China Books that promoted materials favorable to the government.

Leavitt didn't really provide any context for why she was talking about this story from years earlier, but clearly intended for the headline to be damning in its insinuations about collaboration with the Chinese government.

But it looks like that report about Amazon listing tariffs wasn't true. Or, at least things changed after the story broke. Reached for comment on Tuesday after the White House press conference, Amazon told Gizmodo that it won't actually be adding a tariff line item to purchases.

“The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement.

CNN reports that Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after the Punchbowl news story landed Tuesday morning. A White House official told CNN that Trump was “pissed” adding “Why should a multi-billion-dollar company pass off costs to consumers?”

Well, that part seems obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of economics. If the cost of importing goods is going up 145%, Amazon isn't going to just eat that entire charge. They're going to raise prices for consumers. White House advisor Stephen Miller was asked about the Amazon pricing controversy on Fox News and tried to play it off like as no big deal.

“I'll just take Amazon's statement at face value, which is that they said this is an idea that had been discussed, was not being actioned, and now we can take heart in knowing that they formally rejected the idea,” Miller said.

Miller was then asked about whether Trump had indeed called Bezos and the White House advisor laughed it off, insisting that things worked out just fine in the end.

STEPHEN MILLER: I have no news to add on it. All I can say is things worked out exactly as they should.

Trump later confirmed that he had spoken with Bezos earlier in the day, saying, “Jeff Bezos was very nice, he was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he's a good guy.”

The consumer confidence index fell this month for the fifth straight month in a row, according to the Associated Press. And if you take a quick look at the calendar, five months ago was November, the same month Trump was elected.

Bessent was asked Tuesday about supply chains that are expected to break down in the coming weeks, as ships from China have basically stopped leaving for U.S. ports. But the Treasury Secretary insisted that everything would be fine since he imagined businesses have already planned ahead for any disruptions.

“I wouldn't think that we would have supply chain shocks,” said Bessent. “And I think retailers that have managed their inventory in front of this. I speak to dozens of companies sometimes daily, but definitely weekly, and they know that President Trump is committed to fair trade and have planned accordingly.”

Bessent has made this same argument repeatedly in recent days. He asserts that there won't actually be supply chain shocks because every business knew this was coming and should've planned appropriately. That argument ignores the fact that it's difficult to just find a new supplier for inexpensive Chinese goods in less than a month, if you're able to do that at all by some miracle.

Adidas warned Tuesday it would soon be raising prices on goods for Americans. And some companies are already doing layoffs over the economic situation, with shipping company UPS announcing Tuesday it was cutting 20,000 jobs from its 490,000-person workforce. The company said in a regulatory filing that it was “in connection with our anticipation of lower volumes” from Amazon, the company's largest customer.

Trump has claimed that he's signing new trade deals with every country, given the fact that even America's closest allies have been hit with a 10% tariff. But there's scant evidence that any trade deal is anywhere close to being completed. Bessent keeps teasing the idea that deals are almost done with Japan and India, but the timing on when those could be done isn't clear at all. Trump has also said he's negotiating with China, but that doesn't seem to be true either.

“Let me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday, according to CNBC.

Fox News, Trump's favorite TV channel, has done its best to sell the idea that these tariffs are good, but even there, we're starting to see some dissent. Dana Perino, a host on the network and former press secretary for the White House under George W. Bush, said on Tuesday that she doesn't like tariffs and is worried about how small businesses are going to do under them.

“I think that it's one thing as a consumer to say I will be able to accept the pain,” Perino said. “But the small- and medium-sized business owner, who right now are looking at the possibility of losing everything that they've worked for in the next four to six weeks, is very real.”

There's understandably been a fixation on tariffs this week, as Americans are starting to learn about how they will soon pay more for just about everything. But Trump is also working hard to make the United States an unlivable hellhole in other ways. The president's regime is terrorizing immigrant communities, jailing political dissidents like Rumeysa Ozturk, who did nothing more than write an op-ed against the war in Gaza, and kicking pediatric cancer patients out of the country without their medications.

Trump's FBI also arrested a judge in Wisconsin last week for allegedly not doing enough to help ICE detain an immigrant in her courtroom. And the president signed an executive order on Monday that experts warn will further militarize American police.

A recent poll from PRRI shows that 52% of Americans agree with the statement that Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” The president's approval rating is in the toilet, and Trump's right-hand oligarch, Elon Musk, is getting similar marks, with just 35% of Americans approving of his obliteration of the government with DOGE.

Yes, Trump is hurting everything good about America. But at least everything's going to be much more expensive soon. America truly shot itself in the foot by electing Trump again. And with Trump promising to stay in office illegally after 2028, there's no telling when the madness may end.

The end-to-end encrypted communication app WhatsApp, used by roughly 3 billion people around the world, will roll out cloud-based AI capabilities in the coming weeks that are designed to preserve WhatsApp's defining security and privacy guarantees while offering users access to message summarization and composition tools.

Meta has been incorporating generative AI features across its services that are built on its open source large language model, Llama. And WhatsApp already incorporates a light blue circle that gives users access to the Meta AI assistant. But many users have balked at this addition, given that interactions with the AI assistant aren't shielded from Meta the way end-to-end encrtyped WhatsApp chats are. The new feature, dubbed Private Processing, is meant to address these concerns with what the company says is a carefully architected and purpose-built platform devoted to processing data for AI tasks without the information being accessible to Meta, WhatsApp, or any other party. While initial reviews by researchers of the scheme's integrity have been positive, some note that the move toward AI features could ultimately put WhatsApp on a slippery slope.

“WhatsApp is targeted and looked at by lots of different researchers and threat actors. That means internally it has a well understood threat model,” says Meta security engineering director Chris Rohlf. “There's also an existing set of privacy expectations from users, so this wasn't just about managing the expansion of that threat model and making sure the expectations for privacy and security were met—it was about careful consideration of the user experience and making this opt-in.”

End-to-end encrypted communications are only accessible to the sender and receiver, or the people in a group chat. The service provider, in this case WhatsApp and its parent company Meta, is boxed out by design and can't access users' messages or calls. This setup is incompatible with typical generative AI platforms that run large language models on cloud servers and need access to users' requests and data for processing. The goal of Private Processing is to create an alternate framework through which the privacy and security guarantees of end-to-end encrypted communication can be upheld while incorporating AI.

Users opt into using WhatsApp's AI features, and they can also prevent people they're chatting with from using the AI features in shared communications by turning on a new WhatsApp control known as “Advanced Chat Privacy.”

“When the setting is on, you can block others from exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features,” WhatsApp wrote in a blog post last week. Like disappearing messages, anyone in a chat can turn Advanced Chat Privacy on and off—which is recorded for all to see—so participants just need to be mindful of any adjustments.

Private Processing is built with special hardware that isolates sensitive data in a “Trusted Execution Environment,” a siloed, locked-down region of a processor. The system is built to process and retain data for the minimum amount of time possible and is designed grind to a halt and send alerts if it detects any tampering or adjustments. WhatsApp is already inviting third-party audits of different components of the system and will make it part of the Meta bug bounty program to encourage the security community to submit information about flaws and potential vulnerabilities. Meta also says that, ultimately, it plans to make the components of Private Processing open source, both for expanded verification of its security and privacy guarantees and to make it easier for others to build similar services.

Last year, Apple debuted a similar scheme, known as Private Cloud Compute, for its Apple Intelligence AI platform. And users can turn the service on in Apple's end-to-end encrypted communication app, Messages, to generate message summaries and compose “Smart Reply” messages on both iPhones and Macs.

Looking at Private Cloud Compute and Private Processing side by side is like comparing, well, Apple(s) and oranges, though. Apple's Private Cloud Compute underpins all of Apple Intelligence everywhere it can be applied. Private Processing, on the other hand, was purpose-built for WhatsApp and doesn't underpin Meta's AI features more broadly. Apple Intelligence is also designed to do as much AI processing as possible on-device and only send requests to the Private Cloud Compute infrastructure when necessary. Since such “on device” or “local” processing requires powerful hardware, Apple only designed Apple Intelligence to run at all on its recent generations of mobile hardware. Old iPhones and iPads will never support Apple Intelligence.

Apple is a manufacturer of high-end smartphones and other hardware, while Meta is a software company, and has about 3 billion users who have all types of smartphones, including old and low-end devices. Rohlf and Colin Clemmons, one of the Private Processing lead engineers, say that it wasn't feasible to design AI features for WhatsApp that could run locally on the spectrum of devices WhatsApp serves. Instead, WhatsApp focused on designing Private Processing to be as unhelpful as possible to attackers if it were to be breached.

“The design is one of risk minimization,” Clemmons says. “We want to minimize the value of compromising the system.”

The whole effort raises a more basic question, though, about why a secure communication platform like WhatsApp needs to offer AI features at all. Meta is adamant, though, that users expect the features at this point and will go wherever they have to to get them.

“Many people want to use AI tools to help them when they are messaging,” WhatsApp head Will Cathcart told WIRED in an email. “We think building a private way to do that is important, because people shouldn't have to switch to a less-private platform to have the functionality they need.”

“Any end-to-end encrypted system that uses off-device AI inference is going to be riskier than a pure end to end system. You're sending data to a computer in a data center, and that machine sees your private texts,” says Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptographer who previewed some of the privacy guarantees of Private Processing, but hasn't audited the complete system. “I believe WhatsApp when they say that they've designed this to be as secure as possible, and I believe them when they say that they can't read your texts. But I also think there are risks here. More private data will go off device, and the machines that process this data will be a target for hackers and nation state adversaries.”

WhatsApp says, too, that beyond basic AI features like text summarization and writing suggestions, Private Processing will hopefully create a foundation for expanding into more complicated and involved AI features in the future that involve processing, and potentially storing, more data.

As Green puts it, “Given all the crazy things people use secure messengers for, any and all of this will make the Private Processing computers into a very big target.”

When it comes to digital rights and protection, the United States' federal government has generally failed to establish comprehensive legislation. On Monday, Congress seemed to make progress by nearly unanimously passing a bill to combat nonconsensual intimate images online. But as the bill heads to President Trump, who already voiced his intentions to sign it, digital rights advocates warn that a combination of vague language and lack of safeguards makes it ripe for misuse.

Introduced by Sens. Ted Cruz and Amy Klobuchar in 2024, the Take It Down Act criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) which includes “revenge porn” and AI deepfakes. It also requires specific platforms to establish processes to report NCII and remove offending content within 48 hours of notification.

The bill has garnered bipartisan support, including from Trump's own family as his wife, Melania, hosted a White House roundtable about it in March. That same month, Trump told Congress that he “look[s] forward to signing that bill into law” during his address at a joint session. He added, “I'm going to use that bill for myself too if you don't mind because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.”

In February, the bill unanimously passed the Senate, and it cleared the House with a 409-2 vote, which Cruz celebrated as a “historic win.” In a statement, Cruz said, “By requiring social media companies to take down this abusive content quickly, we are sparing victims from repeated trauma and holding predators accountable.”

“These images can ruin lives and reputations,” Klobuchar said in the same statement. “Victims will now be able to have this material removed from social media platforms and law enforcement can hold perpetrators accountable.”

Although the majority of states have laws prohibiting nonconsensual pornography, they don't adequately protect a growing pool of victims. In a 2019 study, one of twelve participants reported victimization at least once in their lives, with women reporting higher rates of victimization. As AI further accelerates the issue by generating content featuring adults and children, states also struggle to define and regulate “deepfakes”.

On its surface, the Take It Down Act should be celebrated as a major advancement. But on Monday, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which focuses on combating nonconsensual images, outlined numerous issues, including that the takedown provision is “highly susceptible to misuse and will likely be counter-productive for victims.” For example, there aren't any safeguards against fake complaints, so it can easily be misappropriated to remove other content.

CCRI isn't alone in its criticisms. In a statement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation also criticized the takedown provision, writing, “Services will rely on automated filters, which are infamously blunt tools.” With the law's tight timeframe, platforms will likely “choose to avoid the onerous legal risk by simply depublishing” content before checking if it's actually a problem.

These aren't unfounded concerns. While some argue that the legislation is sound and cannot be misused by bad-faith individuals, including government officials, there are examples to look to. Between June 2019 and January 2020, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act received over thirty thousand false notices, which may be attempts to censor online speech or protect the reputation of public officials. YouTube famously has a takedown first, ask questions later copyright policy.

With the Take It Down Act expected to become law soon, other pending legislation like the DEFIANCE Act, which allows deepfake victims to sue those who create, share, and receive them, could build on its protections. But in a statement, Public Knowledge's Senior Policy Counsel, Nick Garcia, said, “This was a chance to get it right, but unfortunately, Congress only got it half right—and half right laws can do real damage.”

Black Friday is famous for its great deals, but there are periods during the year when Amazon goes even further. It pays to keep your eyes wide open because amazing discounts can pop up any time outside the “normal” sale times. This is exactly what is occurring right now with the SanDisk 2TB portable SSD which is available at an all-time low price on Amazon.

You can now get the SanDisk 2TB extreme portable SSD for just $84, which is a record low that's a fantastic 60% off its normal $209 price tag. To put this into perspective, this is a record-low on this specific mode, but also significantly lower than we were quoted during Black Friday (where prices were in the region of $120).

What makes this offer even better is that the 2TB unit is now literally cheaper than the 1TB unit which already was offered at a discount for $89. If you're looking for high-capacity, high-speed storage, this is an offer that (very) rarely comes along. SanDisk 2TB extreme portable SSD has become the #1 best-seller on Amazon with this offer – and since it combines the speed, reliability, and resilience.

It arrives with NVMe technology which gives up to 1050MB/s read rate and up to 1000MB/s writing rate. Whether you're a photographer offloading massive RAW files, a videographer transferring 4K footage, or a gamer, you'll love how quickly even the largest files move. Its USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface and USB-C connectivity ensure broad compatibility with modern laptops, desktops and even some smartphones.

Another important thing is that this SanDisk SSD is IP65-rated which means it's dust- and water-proof. It's also drop-tested up to three meters so you can carry it around easily if you're traveling or just commuting. Its compact pocket-sized dimensions and integrated carabiner loop allow it to clip onto a belt loop or backpack with ease.

You will also appreciate that the drive has 256-bit AES hardware encryption and password protection, so your private files are kept safe even if the drive gets lost or stolen. Your files are easily controlled with the SanDisk Memory Zone app included which enables you to organize files by category and automatically clear space when space runs low.

Given the rarity of such a deep discount (and the great quality of this product), this deal is unlikely to last long. If you've been considering a storage upgrade, you should better act now.

Google on Tuesday is releasing three new AI experiments aimed at helping people learn to speak a new language in a more personalized way. While the experiments are still in the early stages, it's possible that the company is looking to take on Duolingo with the help of Gemini, Google's multimodal large language model.

The first experiment helps you quickly learn specific phrases you need in the moment, while the second experiment helps you sound less formal and more like a local. 

The third experiment allows you to use your camera to learn new words based on your surroundings.

Google notes that one of the most frustrating parts of learning a new language is when you find yourself in a situation where you need a specific phrase that you haven't learned yet. 

With the new “Tiny Lesson” experiment, you can describe a situation, such as “finding a lost passport,” to receive vocabulary and grammar tips tailored to the context. You can also get suggestions for responses like “I don't know where I lost it” or “I want to report it to the police.”

The next experiment, “Slang Hang,” wants to help people sound less like a textbook when speaking a new language. Google says that when you learn a new language, you often learn to speak formally, which is why it's experimenting with a way to teach people to speak more colloquially, and with local slang. 

With this feature, you can generate a realistic conversation between native speakers and see how the dialogue unfolds one message a time. For example, you can learn through a conversation where a street vendor is chatting with a customer, or a situation where two long-lost friends reunite on the subway. You can hover over terms you're not familiar with to learn about what they mean and how they're used.

Google says that the experiment occasionally misuses certain slang and sometimes makes up words, so users need to cross-reference them with reliable sources.

The third experiment, “Word Cam,” lets you snap a photo of your surroundings, after which Gemini will detect objects and label them in the language you're learning. The feature also gives you additional words that you can use to describe the objects. 

Google says that sometimes you just need words for the things in front of you, because it can show you how much you just don't know yet. For instance, you may know the word for “window,” but you might not know the word for “blinds.”

The company notes that the idea behind these experiments is to see how AI can be used to make independent learning more dynamic and personalized.

The new experiments support the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan), English (Australia, U.K., U.S.), French (Canada, France), German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), and Turkish. The tools can be accessed via Google Labs.

Amazon has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to building a constellation of internet satellites in low Earth orbit, but the company has successfully deployed its first mission in an effort to compete with industry giant SpaceX.

The Kuiper-1 mission launched on Monday at 7:01 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The first batch of 27 satellites was packed into a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V for the inauguration of the Project Kuiper constellation, which has been a long time in the making. “All Kuiper-1 satellites have successfully deployed into space,” the company wrote on X a few hours after liftoff.

The following day, Amazon confirmed that the mission is off to a good start with the satellites operating as expected. “We've already established contact with all 27 Kuiper satellites in orbit, and initial deployment and activation sequences are proceeding as planned,” the company announced.

The Kuiper satellites will orbit at an altitude between 367 and 391 miles (590 and 630 kilometers) above Earth. The satellites are built with an active propulsion system, which includes a custom thruster built in-house and a krypton-filled propellant tank, to combat atmospheric drag and maintain satellite altitude within 5.6 miles (9 km) of target operational orbits.

Project Kuiper is Amazon's answer to Starlink, a satellite constellation beaming down fast, affordable internet connectivity to different parts of the world. The initiative suffered several delays, with the company initially aiming to deploy its first satellites in early 2024. Amazon is also under a time crunch due to a 2020 authorization order from the Federal Communications Commission, which stipulates that the company must launch 50% of its Project Kuiper satellites by 2026, and the rest by 2029. If it fails to meet its deadlines, Amazon will likely be forced to apply for an extension.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has launched more than 7,000 Starlink satellites to space, and is already providing high-speed internet to 70 countries. Unlike his space billionaire rival Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos is hoping to launch a total of 3,200 low Earth orbit satellites, securing 80 upcoming launches with multiple commercial providers, including Arianespace, ULA, and Bezos' other space venture, Blue Origin, to form its initial constellation.

Amazon has already launched two prototype satellites, KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2, on an Atlas V rocket in late 2023. The test mission was successful, with the two satellites pulling off controlled maneuvering in low Earth orbit. “There's room for lots of winners there,” Bezos said during an interview with Reuters. “I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well.”

Gov press sec says Amazon is partnered with a 'Chinese propaganda arm.'

A significant rift appears to be opening between the Trump Administration and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, sparking an explosive press briefing earlier today. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described Amazon's purported plans to display the costs of tariffs next to product listings as a "hostile and political act" and accused Amazon / Bezos of partnering with a "Chinese propaganda arm."

The media storm was precipitated during a briefing to mark 100 days of the second Trump presidency when a reporter asked about the above-linked report. Tariffs were already hotly debated, and then the Punchbowl News report asserting that Amazon is preparing to "display tariff costs" up-front in its product listings was highlighted. The source publication only cites someone familiar with the plans, and Amazon hasn't responded to these reports yet. Nevertheless, the knives were quickly unsheathed during the White House presser.

According to CNBC, the question about Amazon's purported plans was rather pointed. An unnamed reporter asked if the government representatives agreed that Amazon's move was a "crystal clear demonstration that it's the American consumer, and not China, who is going to have to pay for these policies."

Leavitt didn't hold back in her criticism of this notion. She stepped up, saying she had just gotten off the phone with the President discussing this matter. "This is a hostile and political act by Amazon," asserted Leavitt, before adding, "This is another reason why Americans should buy American." The press secretary had her own questions, and retorted, "Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?"

If this 'tariff transparency' initiative happens, it will mark a sharp change in Amazon's recent Trump appeasement plans. Bezos warmly congratulated Trump on his election victory and donated $1 million to the new President's inauguration fund. Amazon might have thought it was smartly dodging the ire of its customers by shifting the blame for impending price rises to tariffs. Now, instead, it is facing fire from the White House.

Would Amazon be right to follow in Temu and Shein's footsteps in highlighting tariffs as part of product pricing? Perhaps that decision hasn't even been made yet – and the warning shots from the White House could steer Amazon / Bezos to play the plausible deniability card.

American nuclear is in 25-year-old Isaiah Taylor's blood: his great-grandfather worked on the Manhattan Project. In 2023, Taylor, who dropped out of high school to work in tech, started his own nuclear company, Valar Atomics. It's currently developing a small test reactor, named after Taylor's great-grandfather. But the company says that overly onerous regulations imposed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the country's main regulatory body for nuclear reactors, has forced Valar Atomics to develop its test reactor overseas.

In early April, Valar Atomics, in addition to another nuclear startup, Deep Fission, as well as the states of Florida, Louisiana, and Arizona's state legislature, signed onto a lawsuit against the NRC. The lawsuit, originally filed in December by Texas, Utah, and nuclear company Last Energy, blames the NRC for “so restrictively regulat[ing] new nuclear reactor construction that it rarely happens at all.”

The US has historically been the global powerhouse of nuclear energy, yet only three reactors have come online over the past 25 years, all behind schedule and with ballooning budgets. Meanwhile, other countries, like China and South Korea, have raced ahead with construction of reactors of all sizes. Some nuclear advocates say that the US's regulation system, which imposes cumbersome requirements and ultra-long timelines on projects, is largely to blame for this delay—especially when it comes to developing new designs for smaller reactors—and that some reactors should be taken from the NRC's purview altogether. But others have concerns about potential attempts to bypass the country's nuclear regulations for specific designs.

The NRC has long been criticized for its ultra-slow permitting times, inefficient processes, and contentious back-and-forth with nuclear companies. “The regulatory relationship in the US has been described as legalistic and adversarial for nuclear,” says Nick Touran, a licensed nuclear engineer who runs the website What Is Nuclear. “That is kind of uniquely American. In other countries, like France and China, the regulators are more cooperative.”

The lawsuit takes these criticisms one step further, claiming that by regulating smaller reactors, the NRC is misreading a crucial piece of nuclear legislation. In 1954, Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act, which created modern nuclear regulation in the US. That law mandated regulations for nuclear facilities that used nuclear material “in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security” or that use it “in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public.”

“We would love the NRC to respect the law that was written,” says Taylor, who believes the reactor his company is working on sits outside of that mandate. “What it would do for us is to allow innovation to happen again. Innovation is what drives the American economy.”

“The NRC will address the litigation, as necessary, in its court filings,” agency spokesperson Scott Burnell told WIRED in an email.

While we generally think of nuclear reactors as huge power plants, reactors can be made much smaller: Models known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, usually produce a third of the energy of a larger reactor, while even smaller reactors known as microreactors are designed small enough to be hauled by semitruck. Because of their size, these reactors are inherently less dangerous than their large counterparts. There's simply not enough power in an SMR for a Three Mile Island–style meltdown.

The lawsuit argues that by mandating a cumbersome licensing process for all types of reactors—including those that are safer because of their size—the NRC is both violating the Atomic Energy Act and stifling progress. A company called NuScale, the only SMR company to get NRC approval for its model, spent $500 million and 2 million hours of labor over several years just to get its design approved. In late 2023 it pulled the plug on a planned power plant in Idaho after customers balked at the projected high price tag for power, which soared from an estimated $58 per megawatt-hour in 2021 to $89 per megawatt-hour in 2023.

The lawsuit comes at a unique time for nuclear power. Public sentiment around nuclear energy is the highest it's been in 15 years. Dozens of new nuclear startups have cropped up in recent years, each promising to revolutionize the American nuclear industry—and serve power-hungry industries like data centers and oil and gas. Private equity and venture capital invested more than $783 million in nuclear startups in 2024, doing twice the number of deals in the sector as they did in 2023.

The lawsuit “is about getting steel in the ground. This is about getting nuclear on the grid,” says Chris Koopman, the CEO of the Abundance Institute, a nonprofit focused on encouraging the development and deployment of new technology. The Institute, which was founded last year, has no standing in the lawsuit and does not represent any plaintiffs but has served as a “thought partner,” per Koopman, who coauthored an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in January announcing the lawsuit.

Deep Fission, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, seeks to generate electricity using small modular reactors placed a mile underground—a model its CEO, Liz Muller, says is both safer and cheaper than traditional construction. Even though Deep Fission is a party in the lawsuit, the company has also begun pre-licensing its design with the NRC. Muller sees the lawsuit as bringing a new approach to the agency regarding SMRs: helping it to develop “a regulatory sandbox, where we're allowed to explore approaches to regulations while we're moving forward at the same time.”

The lawsuit posits that individual states “are more than capable of regulating” smaller reactors. Thirty-nine states are already licensed by the NRC to handle and inspect nuclear material, while Koopman points out that the states involved in the lawsuit have recently passed legislation to speed the construction of nuclear projects in-state. “All of the states involved in the case have already entered into agreement with the NRC, in which the NRC has recognized that they know their stuff,” he says.

Taylor believes allowing states to compete on regulation would help boost safety within the field of small modular reactors. “Innovation is what drives the safety ball down the field, and the only way to do that is to have different regulators with different ideas,” he says. “That's federalism 101.”

Adam Stein, the director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation program at the Breakthrough Institute, an eco-modernist policy center, sees some serious flaws with this approach. He says that while some states, like Texas, may have the resources and the knowledge to create their own effective regulatory body, other states may struggle. Stein likens a patchwork of different regulations as being akin to car seat laws, where the age of the child required to be in a car seat varies across states, making it tough for a parent to plan a road trip.

“Some states are less consistent in applying safety standards than others,” he says. “Some states would prefer their standards to be stricter than national standards. Some states have reduced safety standards from nationally recommended standards.”

Muller says she understands these concerns. “There is a risk if we get wildly different regulatory processes, that would not be a great result,” she says. “But I think there's also an opportunity for states to move forward and then for other states to piggyback on what has been developed by the earlier adopter.”

Stein also foresees a possibility for continued red tape, as even with state-level regulation, the NRC would still be forced to review individual reactor designs to see if they were safe enough to pass off for state review. “A developer couldn't just assert that their design is so safe, that it's below the line,” he says. “It's still going to have to go through a review to determine whether the NRC should review it.”

Just because a nuclear reactor can't cause massive damage to big populations doesn't necessarily mean it's fail-safe. The only deadly nuclear accident on US soil occurred at a tiny reactor in Idaho, which killed its three operators in the early 1960s. Designs for small reactors have made leaps and bounds in safety since then—a development Touran says is thanks in part to regulations from the federal government.

“I believe a well-designed small reactor, subject to reasonable nuclear design standards based on years of lessons learned, would be very safe,” says Touran. “I do not believe that this means anyone should be able to go out and build a small reactor with minimal oversight.”

There have been efforts in recent years to speed up the NRC's permitting process. In 2019, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act; among its many reforms, it mandated that the NRC shift around key licensing processes and create a new process for licensing smaller, more technologically varied reactors. Last year, President Joe Biden signed the ADVANCE Act, which made even more changes to the NRC process; both of these pieces of legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.

“At this point, the NRC says pretty willingly that they're working hard to be more efficient, that they understand they need to be more efficient, that they have been more efficient with recent licensing applications,” says Klein.

For developers like Taylor, this progress is too little, too late. “Do we really want China and Russia to be the global nuclear developers for the world?” he says. “I don't. I would like the United States to be the nuclear developer of the world.”

Permitting reform alone, especially in the SMR space, may not solve the issue of competing with other world powers. Nuclear energy might be overregulated, but it is also expensive to build, even for smaller reactors, requiring big up-front investments and a large amount of labor. NuScale did lose valuable time and money on a cumbersome regulatory process—but its energy was also competing in price against gas and renewables, which are, on average, cheaper than nuclear power from plants that have been running for decades.

After decades of battling public fear of nuclear plants, nuclear acceptance has reached a pivotal moment. When compared to the massive health toll from fossil fuels, which research shows are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths around the world, nuclear power is exorbitantly safe. But there's a sense from some advocates that some of the hard-won trust nuclear energy now has from the public—supported by decades of careful regulation—is in danger if the movement becomes too cavalier about safety.

When Valar announced it would join the lawsuit, Taylor published a blog post on the company's website that claimed that the company's reactor was so safe that someone could hold the spent fuel in their hands for five minutes and get as much radiation exposure as a CAT scan. Touran questioned this claim, leading Taylor to post the numbers behind the company's analysis on X. Another nuclear engineer ran his own calculation using these inputs, finding that holding fuel under the conditions provided by Valar would give a “lethal dose” of radiation in 85 milliseconds. (Taylor told WIRED that Valar is working on a “thorough analysis” in response that will be public in a few weeks and that the initial claims around the spent fuel were simply “a thought experiment we did for our own internal illustration purposes” and not part of the lawsuit materials.)

“We've operated reactors so well for so long that a whole new breed of advocates and even founders mistakenly believe that they're fail-safe by default,” says Touran. “The reality is they're made fail-safe by very careful and well-regulated engineering and quality assurance.”

Kaplan will take TC Sessions: AI attendees behind the scenes on hybrid reasoning models — which balance quick responses to simple queries with deeper processing for complex problems — and share insights into Anthropic‘s risk-governance framework for mitigating potential AI risks. (Kaplan was appointed Anthropic's responsible scaling officer in October.)

Get the details on his session and check out all the AI trailblazers joining us — visit the TC Sessions: AI agenda page.

Jared Kaplan has a pretty remarkable résumé. Before co-founding Anthropic, he spent 15 years as a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, exploring quantum gravity, field theory, and cosmology. Since then, his research on scaling laws has been credited with revolutionizing how the AI industry understands and predicts the behavior of advanced systems. In fact, before Anthropic, Kaplan played a role in developing GPT-3 and Codex at OpenAI; meanwhile, at Anthropic, Kaplan helped develop Claude, the company's family of AI assistants.

It's been a wild ride for Kaplan and company. Anthropic's remarkable growth has been fueled by several major developments in just recent months alone, including its launch of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in late February, which the company described as its “most intelligent model yet” and the first hybrid reasoning model that can handle both simple and complex queries with appropriate processing time for each.

The company more recently introduced an autonomous research capability and Google Workspace integration, transforming Claude into what Anthropic has characterized as a “true virtual collaborator” for enterprise users.(Anthropic is reportedly developing a voice assistant feature for Claude to compete with similar offerings from other AI companies.)

Unsurprisingly, investors have noticed. In March, Anthropic announced that it had completed a new fundraising deal that valued the company at $61.5 billion, up from about $16 billion roughly a year earlier. 

At TC Sessions: AI, Kaplan will share his vision for how AI will transform human-computer interaction, work processes, and social dynamics. But beyond the theoretical and technical aspects, Kaplan will offer tactical takeaways for teams of all sizes that are looking to implement AI and maximize its impact.

One of AI's sharpest voices is taking the stage — and you won't want to miss it. Save $210 when you register today, and score 50% off an extra ticket for your plus-one. Lock in your spot here at this must-see session!

The geological processes that create rocks usually take place over thousands if not millions of years. With the help of a coin and a soda can tab, researchers have identified rocks in England that formed in less than four decades. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the cause is human activity.

Researchers from the University of Glasgow's School of Geographical and Earth Sciences discovered that slag (a waste product of the steel industry) formed a new type of rock in West Cumbria in 35 years—at most. As detailed in a study published April 10 in the journal Geology, the researchers claim to be the first to fully document and date a complete “rapid anthropoclastic rock cycle” on land: a significantly accelerated rock cycle that incorporates human-made materials. They suggest that this phenomenon is likely harming ecosystems and biodiversity at similar industrial waste locations around the world.

“When waste material is first deposited, it's loose and can be moved around as required. What our finding shows is that we don't have as much time as we thought to find somewhere to put it where it will have minimal impact on the environment–instead, we may have a matter of just decades before it turns into rock, which is much more difficult to manage,” co-author Amanda Owen said in a university statement.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Derwent Howe in West Cumbria hosted heavy iron and steel industries. The 953 million cubic feet (27 million cubic meters) of slag generated by the factories turned into cliffs along the coastline, where strange formations along the human-made cliffs caught Owen and her colleagues' attention, according to the statement.

By analyzing 13 sites along the coast, the researchers concluded that Derwent Howe's slag contains deposits of calcium, magnesium, iron, and manganese. When exposed to seawater and air through coastal erosion, these reactive elements create natural cements such as brucite, calcite, and goethite—the same ones that bind natural sedimentary rocks together over thousands to millions of years.

“What's remarkable here is that we've found these human-made materials being incorporated into natural systems and becoming lithified–essentially turning into rock–over the course of decades instead,” Owen explained. “It challenges our understanding of how a rock is formed, and suggests that the waste material we've produced in creating the modern world is going to have an irreversible impact on our future.”

Modern objects stuck in the lithified slag, such as a King George V coin from 1934 and an aluminum can tab from no earlier than 1989, substantiated the team's dating of the material. Because slag clearly has all the necessary ingredients to create rocks in the presence of seawater and air, co-author David Brown suggested that the same process is likely happening at similar coastal slag deposits around the world.

Whether it's in England or elsewhere, “that rapid appearance of rock could fundamentally affect the ecosystems above and below the water, as well as change the way that coastlines respond to the challenges of rising sea levels and more extreme weather as our planet warms,” Owen warned. “Currently, none of this is accounted for in our models of erosion of land management, which are key to helping us try to adapt to climate change.”

Moving forward, the team hopes to continue investigating this new Earth system cycle by analyzing other slag deposits. Ultimately, the study suggests that humans aren't just driving global warming—we're also accelerating the ancient geological processes unfolding beneath our very feet.

They are getting engineering and telecom services far cheaper than they can provide in their own country, and the cost to provide terrestrial in their own (OP's stated alternative) would be phenomenal.

It doesn't matter so much that the nominal price is low, only that it is cheaper to buy bandwith from the satellite provider than their alternatives. If the local populace can't afford it as an individual subscription an internet cafe will buy it, and as the economy develops it slowly disperses into individual subscriptions rather than by the town internet cafe.If you wait until everyone in developing nation has individual subscriptions you've already lost the game to someone else. Ground zero isn't selling internet to a goat farmer who can't afford it, it's selling one subscription to 100 goat farmers and one to the rich corrupt policeman and then capturing additional subscriptions as their wealth increases as their nation develops.

Mega constellations are a new focus, obviously inspired by Starlink, but it's entirely rational given the context of Bezos already owning a rocket company.  Operating a fleet of communication satellites has been proven as a working strategy for paying for a lot of rocket launches.  At this point, any rocket company that doesn't have similar plans in the works is asking to be out of business.

The "Kessler syndrome" worst case scenario - I'm just recalling stuff from Scott Manley videos here - I think is a 'really bad decade' where a cascade of collisions makes launching in to LEO impossible until everything settles down in 10ish years. Bad, yeah, terrible even, but possibly worth it in some sense? I mean, it makes about as much sense to me as growing subsidized corn for ethanol gas, I suppose. I'm sure someone is making money.


reply



Space junk is not in the top 5 reasons, and with better tracking and using low altitudes (like Starlink does, where debris deorbits very quickly), we can probably fit a factor of 100 times more satellites in LEO safely.(People underestimate how much of a difference better tracking makes to this issue. Space is huge, and the real isn't actual conjunctions, but the fact that the uncertainty range for objects is so large that you end up getting hundreds of times more false alarms and probably-unneeded avoidance maneuvers than you'd have if you had much better tracking.)

This is a repeated trope and more ridiculous each time I hear it. Starlink is a private company that is in the business of selling the US Government as well as consumers its services. You can't just "nationalize" it on a whim; after all, the US isn't Cuba.GPS was always owned and operated by the US military so it's an apples and oranges comparison at best.

In other words GPS scales very flat. Launching the constellation costs X, control activities cost Y per month. And those prices don't change if there is only a single receiver, a thousand, or a billion. Basically allowing GPS to be used by civilians didn't cost them any extra on top of what they were already paying to keep it operational for the military. Plus there is no natural limit on how many gps receivers there can be.This is not the same for Starlink. There user stations have a two way connection with the satelites. The system have very real limits on how many users it can serve. And every new user cost something to the provider. Because of this the government would need to manage who can have access and how much they can use the constellation. That would be a nightmare to manage for a government and everyone would be unhappy with them. In short: not a good idea.

GPS has only 31 satellites and they orbit at a far distance of like 12,550 miles from earth.Starlink alone has over 7000 satellites and plans for 12,000 by 2026 and possibly 30,000 beyond that.  And they orbit at a distance of 340-382 miles.You could have thousands of GPS satellite companies before even matching the orbit pollution of Starlink alone.I am not saying that satellite internet shouldn't be done by a singular governmental org.  But to say the reason they did it was to prevent un-necessary orbit pollution doesn't seem like a very strong reason.I think that it was done because it doesn't really cost anything to allow the GPS signals to be used by everyone, and because it costs a lot to launch satellites.Internet satellites are a whole different story because they deal with signal bandwidth limits in both directions, so there is a cost per user added to use them.

SpaceX's strategy here is quite brilliant: they induce demand for launches and prove Falon 9 reuse while deploying satellites at relatively low cost (because of the reuse) at a price level absolutely nobody can compete with. They're doing well over 100 launches a year at this point.Bezos seems to want to repeat this with Amazon, Blue Origin and Kuiper but I think they've lost before they've even started. Blue Origin simply doesn't have the orbital launch capability that SpaceX does and certainly not anywhere near the price point. BO has underdelivered on BE-$ and New Glenn. SpaceX did too to be fair but that's in the past (ignoring Starship).Starlink is a relatively simple design: it's surface-to-surface through a single hop. I think satellite Internet is likely already a saturated market given you're competing with 4G/5G wireless and fixed line. There's only so many remote locations and people on the move to sell to.[1]: https://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via-satellite-at-30-t...

China-based online retailer Temu started adding “import charges” for orders being sent to the U.S. in recent days, often more than doubling the cost. The charges are all thanks to President Donald Trump's tariffs. And American customers are not too happy about any of it.

“I haven't been keeping up with news or what's going on?!?! I have been ordering a lot this past month for my daughters wedding.. did I miss something???” one Redditor asked in a discussion about Temu's prices skyrocketing on Monday.

That commenter was ridiculed for being oblivious to Trump's tariffs but clarified later that they knew tariffs were coming. They just didn't know about the timing and exact percentage, given the fact that Trump has changed both so frequently since his “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2. And that's a reasonable thing to be confused about, since Trump has caused so much chaos and confusion with his on-again, off-again tariffs.

As it stands now, Trump has slapped China with a 145% tariff on goods, which may not have been a problem for retailers like Temu and Shein at first glance. That's because shipments valued under $800 were previously allowed to avoid tariffs under what was called the de minimis exemption. But Trump has pledged to close that loophole on May 2, meaning sellers on Temu are now starting to add on that 145% tax for the goods they ship to the U.S.

“This is crap,” one commenter on r/TemuThings wrote with a screenshot showing how their $28 purchase had risen to $71.

“Nah dawg, I'm out,” wrote another, showing how their $38 order had turned into $94.

Customers at fast fashion giant Shein are struggling with the changes as well, though the subreddit for the company is noting more empty shelves, as it were, than higher prices. It seems that Shein is sometimes opting to just pull products rather than bothering to try and send things at a much higher price.

The users of r/AliExpress were also posting screenshots of their shockingly expensive shopping carts. In one post, a user showed their purchase of some glitter fabric roll, which went from $20 to $72.

Others were posting about possible workarounds, including the idea that perhaps Americans could get things shipped to a third country with lower tariffs as a go-between so that the goods didn't appear like they were actually coming from China.

Most people seem dismayed at the tariffs, with users writing obituaries for the services they liked best.

“Rest In Peace [AliExpress] It was nice while it lasted. We know is not your fault but unfortunately this is the world we live in now. We will have to adapt to this newer, not better times.(United States of America),” one user wrote.

“For us, the United States of Americans, Aliexpress Will die this week,” the comment continued. “It just doesn't make sense to buy from you anymore at all. And we understand why. (From USA) So long our Chinese friends…”

Trump keeps insisting that his team is talking to Chinese officials to negotiate a “better” trade deal, but that doesn't seem to be true. China has continued to deny that any talks are taking place, and whenever reporters get the opportunity to ask Trump about specifics, he either speaks generally about the situation or says something so ridiculous that even a child could tell he's lying.

“We've been meeting with China,” Trump insisted last week. But that's not what China says. At all.

“Let me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday at a press conference, according to CNBC.

Last week, Trump went so far as to claim that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called the White House to negotiate a deal, another claim that Chinese officials deny. What will happen if China and the U.S. can't agree to a deal? It appears those inflated prices will stick around on goods coming into the U.S. And many experts expect store shelves to start feeling a lot emptier in a couple of weeks.

Gary Cohn, one of Trump's top economic advisors during his first term, was on Face the Nation on Sunday. He explained how it takes about 8 weeks for goods leaving China to find themselves on U.S. store shelves.

Gary Cohn says the impact of tariffs aren't going to really hit for another 2-4 weeks.

“The vast majority of small business toy stores cannot order toys today because they cannot afford the 145% tariff. […] They're either going out of business or they're just going to wait and see what happens.”

There's still the possibility that Trump could roll back the tariffs. People in MAGAland have floated leaks to the press that try to suggest tariffs on China could be lowered to 65%. That, to be clear, would still be a substantial tax on goods. But it would be less drastic than 145%.

Nobody knows for sure what's ahead, not only for tariffs against China but for other nations as well. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that India could be the first country to sign a new trade deal with the U.S., but nobody knows how seriously to take his comments. Other rumors have swirled that maybe Japan would sign a trade deal with the U.S., but it's unclear how seriously to take those assertions either.

All we know is that, soon, we're all going to be spending more on goods that used to be relatively cheap. And as more and more people realize that, it should be interesting to see how Americans respond. Trump can imprison people for writing op-eds, kick pediatric cancer patients out of the country without their meds, and toss a judge in jail without the average American getting too riled up. But if you take our cheap goods from China, that could be a step too far.

Apple's AirPlay feature enables iPhones and Macbooks to seamlessly play music or show photos and videos on other Apple devices or third-party speakers and TVs that integrate the protocol. Now newly uncovered security flaws in AirPlay mean that those same wireless connections could allow hackers to move within a network just as easily, spreading malicious code from one infected device to another. Apple products are known for regularly receiving fixes, but given how rarely some smart-home devices are patched, it's likely that these wirelessly enabled footholds for malware, across many of the hundreds of models of AirPlay-enabled devices, will persist for years to come.

On Tuesday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm Oligo revealed what they're calling AirBorne, a collection of vulnerabilities affecting AirPlay, Apple's proprietary radio-based protocol for local wireless communication. Bugs in Apple's AirPlay software development kit (SDK) for third-party devices would allow hackers to hijack gadgets like speakers, receivers, set-top boxes, or smart TVs if they're on the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker's machine. Another set of AirBorne vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to exploit AirPlay-enabled Apple devices too, Apple told Oligo, though these bugs have been patched in updates over the last several months, and Apple tells WIRED that those bugs could have only been exploited when users changed default AirPlay settings.

Those Apple devices aside, Oligo's chief technology officer and cofounder, Gal Elbaz, estimates that potentially vulnerable third-party AirPlay-enabled devices number in the tens of millions. “Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch—or they will never be patched,” Elbaz says. “And it's all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything.”

Despite Oligo working with Apple for months to patch the AirBorne bugs in all affected devices, the Tel-Aviv-based security firm warns that the AirBorne vulnerabilities in many third-party gadgets are likely to remain hackable unless users act to update them. If a hacker can get onto the same Wi-Fi network as those vulnerable devices—whether by hacking into another computer on a home or corporate network or by simply connecting to the same coffeeshop or airport Wi-Fi—they can surreptitiously take over these gadgets. From there, they could use this control to maintain a stealthy point of access, hack other targets on the network, or add the machines to a botnet of infected, coordinated machines under the hacker's control.

Oligo also notes that many of the vulnerable devices have microphones and could be turned into listening devices for espionage. The researchers did not go so far as to create proof-of-concept malware for any particular target that would demonstrate that trick.

Oligo says it warned Apple about its AirBorne findings in the late fall and winter of last year, and Apple responded in the months since then by pushing out security updates. The researchers collaborated with Apple to test and validate the fixes for Macs and other Apple products.

Apple tells WIRED that it has also created patches that are available for impacted third-party devices. The company emphasizes, though, that there are limitations to the attacks that would be possible on AirPlay-enabled devices as a result of the bugs, because an attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as a target to exploit them. Apple adds that while there is potentially some user data on devices like TVs and speakers, it is typically very limited.

Below is a video of the Oligo researchers demonstrating their AirBorne hacking technique to take over an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker to show their company's logo for AirBorne. (The researchers say they didn't intend to single out Bose, but just happened to have one of the company's speakers on hand for testing.) Bose did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

The AirBorne vulnerabilities Oligo found also affect CarPlay, the radio protocol used to connect to vehicles' dashboard interfaces. Oligo warns that this means hackers could hijack a car's automotive computer, known as its head unit, in any of more than 800 CarPlay-enabled car and truck models. In those car-specific cases, though, the AirBorne vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the hacker is able to pair their own device with the head unit via Bluetooth or a USB connection, which drastically restricts the threat of CarPlay-based vehicle hacking.

The AirPlay SDK flaws in home media devices, by contrast, may present a more practical vulnerability for hackers seeking to hide on a network, whether to install ransomware or carry out stealthy espionage, all while hiding on devices that are often forgotten by both consumers and corporate or government network defenders. “The amount of devices that were vulnerable to these issues, that's what alarms me,” says Oligo researcher Uri Katz. “When was the last time you updated your speaker?”

The researchers originally started thinking about this property of AirPlay, and ultimately discovered the AirBorne vulnerabilities, while working on a different project analyzing vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access internal services running on a target's local network from a malicious website. In that earlier research, Oligo's hackers found they could defeat the fundamental protections baked into every web browser that are meant to prevent websites from having this type of invasive access on other people's internal networks.

While playing around with their discovery, the researchers realized that one of the services they could access by exploiting the bugs without authorization on a target's systems was AirPlay. The crop of AirBorne vulnerabilities revealed today is unconnected to the previous work, but was inspired by AirPlay's properties as a service built to sit open and at the ready for new connections.

And the fact that the researchers found flaws in the AirPlay SDK means that vulnerabilities are lurking in hundreds of models of devices—and possibly more, given that some manufacturers incorporate the AirPlay SDK without notifying Apple and becoming “certified” AirPlay devices.

“When third-party manufacturers integrate Apple technologies like AirPlay via an SDK, obviously Apple no longer has direct control over the hardware or the patching process,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “As a result, when vulnerabilities arise and third-party vendors fail to update their products promptly—or at all—it not only puts users at risk but could also erode trust in the broader Apple ecosystem."

Updated 10 am ET, April 29, 2024: Clarified that the logo in Oligo's video is for AirBorne, not the company itself.

The U.S. government admitted on Monday that it has “lost” a very, very expensive jet after it slipped off a moving aircraft carrier last week.

The warplane, a US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, somehow tumbled off the USS Harry S. Truman after the ship reportedly came under fire from Houthi rebels. The carrier has been deployed in the region for months as part of the U.S. effort to deter activity by the Yemen-based fighters, the Associated Press reports.

“The F/A-18E was actively under tow in the hangar bay when the move crew lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft and tow tractor were lost overboard,” a U.S. Navy statement says. “Sailors towing the aircraft took immediate action to move clear of the aircraft before it fell overboard. An investigation is underway.” After falling off the ship, the plane, as planes are wont to do, promptly sank, another official told CNN.

“A US official said that initial reports from the scene indicated that the Truman made a hard turn to evade Houthi fire, which contributed to the fighter jet falling overboard,” CNN reports.

One sailor suffered minor injuries as a result of the incident, the Navy said. Gizmodo reached out to the Defense Department for more information and was referred to the previously published press release.

CNN reports that the jet cost some $60 million, though some online estimates place the value closer to $70 million.

It's just the latest headache for Trump's new Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, who has been having one helluva time finding his footing since being confirmed to the new role. Hegseth, who previously served as a Fox News personality, was humiliated last month after accidentally texting war plans involving the Houthis to the head editor of The Atlantic. The messages were sent in a group chat that used the encrypted messenger Signal. Since then, it has been revealed that Hegseth also shared Yemen-based war plans with his wife, brother, and lawyer via yet another Signal chat. Last week, new reporting showed that Hegseth had also installed Signal on his computer using a “dirty line” that flouted traditional bypass security protocols.

Hegseth has also been criticized by former staffers who say that the new DoD head is obsessed with his own image but is not a particularly effective leader. Hegseth was also criticized recently after it was reported that he had installed a “makeup studio” at the Pentagon so that officials could be more camera-ready for media appearances.

          Hegseth isn't the only government official irresponsibly using Signal. But he's definitely the messiest.
        


          "Disgruntled former employees are peddling things to try to save their ass," Hegseth told Fox News.
        


          Sources told NPR that the White House is actively searching for Hegseth's replacement.

Are we getting a Starlink rival soon?

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just confirmed that the company's Project Kuiper has begun deploying satellites in low-earth orbit. “Important moment for @ProjectKuiper as we just confirmed our first 27 production satellites are operating as expected in low Earth orbit,” Jassy said on his status on X (formerly Twitter). “While this is the first step in a much longer journey to launch the rest of our low Earth orbit constellation, it represents an incredible amount of invention and hard work. Am really proud of the collective team.”

This deployment will just be the first of many, especially as the company has previously sought permission to launch 3,236 satellites to deliver internet services around the globe. It took six years for Amazon to go from applying for permits from the FCC to launching its satellites, and it will probably take a few more years before it can fully launch the rest of its planned constellation. We will also likely have to wait a few more months before Amazon starts offering satellite internet services to its customers — after all, it took Starlink about one year and five months after the initial launch of its satellites before it could offer subscriptions.

Amazon said that it hopes to deliver internet services to millions of underserved customers globally, meaning it will compete directly against Starlink. However, Musk started earlier than Bezos, with SpaceX launching satellites for Starlink just as Project Kuiper was getting permits from the FCC in 2019. It also has a much larger constellation, with over 7,000 satellites already in low-earth orbit at the time of writing (and plans for 35,000 more).

Because of this, Starlink already has a wide reach, with the company counting customers all over the globe — from the US to the Philippines and from Ukraine to Australia. Furthermore, it offers coverage aboard vessels, with United Airlines offering in-flight internet through the company. Even some enterprising Navy chiefs were able to sneak a Starlink illegally onboard a US Navy ship while it was deployed.

Still, Amazon's offering of a competing satellite internet service is crucial for consumers, as this will allow for competition and give customers the option to pick a service that fits their needs better. Another company is also trying to enter the satellite internet space — China-based SpaceSail already has 648 satellites in low-earth orbit and has agreements in place with Kazakhstan and Brazil, with plans to expand to 15,000 satellites by 2030. These new entrants in the low-earth orbit satellite internet industry will pressure Starlink to offer cheaper and better services. While this might be a cause for concern for Musk and his shareholders, this could be the ultimate win for the end-user.

MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI.

Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. That's why we've created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.

AI agents are the AI industry's hypiest new product—intelligent assistants capable of completing tasks without human supervision. But while they can be theoretically useful—Simular AI's S2 agent, for example, intelligently switches between models depending on what it's been told to do—they could also be weaponized to execute cyberattacks. Elsewhere, OpenAI is reported to be throwing its hat into the social media arena, and AI models are getting more adept at making music. Oh, and if the results of the first half-marathon pitting humans against humanoid robots are anything to go by, we won't have to worry about the robot uprising any time soon. 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

We're starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us—but there's still a lot we don't know.

Veterans of the European startup scene, who've launched multiple consumer apps in the past, are partly coming out of stealth Tuesday with a new app. On the face of it, Grouphug will simply generate memes from the archive of a group WhatsApp chat. However, that masks a wider play. 

Grouphug is led by Felix Petersen, one of the most experienced and seasoned B2C founders in Europe, who built the Amen and Plazes apps. 

Right now, all users can do on Grouphug is export the text from a group WhatsApp chat and generate funny images from the content. 

However, this is just a taster of things to come. Underlying this simple exercise to acquire beta users is an app still in stealth mode. But Petersen hinted to TechCrunch that the company plans to launch a platform to generate more value out of WhatsApp groups using generative AI. 

“We think we've cracked AI humor. For now, Grouphug will create jokes based on what happened in the group. We turn your WhatsApp chats into memes. But then we have other plans for it,” he told TechCrunch. “There is this world of group chats where most of the things happening, like on Reddit or X, are conducted in public. But everything that's in WhatsApp groups is not part of the public internet. That's an opportunity.”

The startup has already raised a €1.5 million ($1.7 million) pre-seed round led by Berlin-based Blueyard VC, alongside Tiny VC, Charles Songhurst (a Meta board member), Atlantic Labs, and others.

Petersen is joined by Joseph Djenandji, who recently exited his well-known multi-channel travel brand LostIn. The third founder is Matthew Balazsi, who has worked on AI and ML for the last 10 years.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most common malignancies and the second most frequent urogenital tract tumor. Cell and gene therapy, which offer many advantages in treating BLCA, are urgently needed. However, there is an important limitation of the currently reported single chain antibody used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting domain. Specifically, CAR aggregation leads to CAR-T depletion, which may originate from the linker peptide and folding stability between the variable domains (VH and VL) of the single chain antibody of the CAR. Humanized, small size, strong affinity single domain antibodies (variable domain of heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody [VHH]) derived from camelids are promising alternatives.

Second-generation Nectin4-targeted VHH-CAR-T cells were constructed and the specific killing efficacy was determined against BLCA cells in vitro. VHH Nectin4-CAR lentivirus was transduced into human T cells and CAR-T cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell killing efficacy was assessed using Nectin4-positive BLCA cells (SW780 and RT4) and Nectin4-negative U87-MG cells as controls using the xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analysis system. Cytokine secretion expression (IFN-γ and IL-2) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

VHHNectin4-CAR lentivirus treatment increased the proportion of CD4+ T and memory T cells. VHHNectin4-CAR-T cells had increased specific killing ability compared to the control using VH-VL-based CAR-T cells, specifically recognized Nectin4+ BLCA cells, secreted cytokines, and mediated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, VHHNectin4-CAR-T had no effect on Nectin4- U87-MG cell growth.
VHHNectin4-CAR-T cells were established with potent killing ability that specifically recognized Nectin4+ BLCA cells in vitro.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. While scientists believe that gut microbiota play an important role in both the onset and progression of CRC, emerging evidence points to the significance of intratumoral microbiota-microbiota inside tumors-in CRC progression.

Nevertheless, little research has been done on the impact of genetics on intratumoral microbiota in CRC patients.

Now, a recent study by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with Sun Yat-sen University and the University of Hong Kong, has focused on this relationship and its effect on CRC. The study shows that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2355016-a tiny DNA change that some people carry-affects how intratumoral microbiota adhere to tumor cells, promoting CRC progression. These findings were published in Cell Host & Microbe.

For this study, the researchers conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the connection between host genetics and intratumoral microbiota in 748 CRC patients. Host genetics were analyzed using the Asian Screening Array, while intratumoral microbiota were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing. Genome-wide association study analyses assessed the relationships between SNPs and intratumoral microbiota.

The results indicated that SNP rs2355016, which is located in the intronic region of the KCNJ11 gene (ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 11), was significantly correlated with levels of F. nucleatum-an anaerobic bacterium that mainly lives in the human mouth and gut-in CRC tissues.

Additionally, analyses of the expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) and protein Quantitative Trait Locus (pQTL) regions, i.e., regions of chromosomal DNA, showed that the A allele of SNP rs2355016 downregulates the expression of KCNJ11 in CRC cells. This downregulation may increase the presence of Gal-GalNAc on the surface of tumor cells. The increased Gal-GalNAc interacts with Fap2, enhancing the adhesion and invasion of F. nucleatum, ultimately contributing to CRC growth.

These findings enhance our understanding of CRC progression and may inform the development of effective treatments aimed at curbing tumor growth driven by intratumoral microbiota. Furthermore, this study broadens our understanding of the complex dynamics between host and microbiota interactions, shedding light on the role of intratumoral microbiota in other types of cancer.

This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao Science and Technology Project (Category C project), among others.

Patients suffering from depression, anxiety and trauma-related disorders experienced significant relief from their symptoms after a new treatment that uses sound waves to modulate deep brain activity, according to new research from Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. The study, published this month in Molecular Psychiatry, demonstrates that low-intensity focused ultrasound technology can safely and effectively target the amygdala - a brain region known to be hyperactive in mood and anxiety disorders - without surgery or invasive procedures.

Participants showed marked improvements across a range of symptoms after just three weeks of daily treatments. What makes this approach revolutionary is that it's the first time we've been able to directly modulate deep brain activity without invasive procedures or medications."

Gregory Fonzo, Ph.D., senior author of the study and assistant professor, Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at Dell Med

In the double-blind study, 29 patients with various mood and anxiety disorders received MRI-guided focused ultrasound to the left amygdala. The results showed both immediate reductions in amygdala activity, and after three weeks of daily sessions, patients experienced clinically significant improvements in negative affect and symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD.

"For decades, the amygdala has been a target of interest, but access has required either brain surgery or indirect approaches through cortical stimulation," said Fonzo. "This technology opens a new frontier in psychiatric treatment, potentially offering relief to patients who haven't responded to traditional therapies."

The treatment was well tolerated with no serious adverse events, suggesting a promising safety profile as researchers move toward larger clinical trials.

How your body weight influences the interaction of plant compounds with your gut: New research reveals that rutin and genistein elicit distinct gut metabolite changes, depending on BMI, paving the way for personalized nutrition strategies.



Modulation of the human fecal metabolome – Effect of polyphenols depends on the BMI

In a recent study published in the journal Current Research in Food Science, researchers in Germany comprehensively analyzed the impacts of rutin and genistein, two plant-derived polyphenols, on the human fecal metabolome. Their findings reveal substantial differences in metabolic diversity based on the human volunteers' body mass index (BMI), with individuals having a lower BMI demonstrating significantly more diverse metabolic responses.

Importantly, the study utilized pooled fecal samples from volunteers, which means that individual-level variability was not assessed; therefore, the findings should be considered exploratory.

Additionally, this study highlights that rutin and genistein increase participants' glutamine, tryptophan, and glycine levels while decreasing histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine concentrations.

The researchers also observed that butyrate levels increased in the high BMI group following rutin treatment, while ethanolamine levels also rose, a change considered potentially detrimental to gut barrier integrity in obesity.

These findings offer novel insights into the interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiota metabolomes, informing future research on obesity and metabolic health. However, the authors emphasize that larger studies and dietary interventions are needed to validate these preliminary results.

Obesity, a condition characterized by unwanted and unhealthy body fat accumulation, is a public health concern, with more than 1 billion adults estimated to live with the disease. It is closely associated with several metabolic and physiological diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), inflammatory disorders, hypertension, and even certain cancers, highlighting the need for research and policy implementations aimed at curbing its population-wide prevalence.

Recent research has revealed that obesity arises from a complex and multifaceted interplay among genetics, lifestyle, health behaviors (including diet, sleep, and exercise), and gut microbial interactions.

Studies on the gut microbiome have confirmed that individuals with obesity exhibit significantly altered gut microbial diversity compared to their counterparts with a standard body mass index (BMI), potentially promoting inflammation, appetite dysregulation, enhanced fat storage, and increased insulin resistance.

Parallel research has highlighted the importance of dietary interventions in reversing microbiome dysbiosis and promoting gut health, which in turn benefits obesity outcomes. Studies on polyphenols have shown that these plant-derived bioactives, which often escape digestion, are regularly metabolized by gut microbiota, exerting anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and microbiome diversity-altering effects.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms of polyphenols' action on host physiology remain partially understood, with insufficient knowledge on their interactions with bacterial metabolic pathways and circulating metabolites.

The present study aims to address these knowledge gaps and contribute to furthering medical understanding of microbiome- and obesity-driven processes by exploring the impacts of rutin and genistein, two polyphenols with known obesity-associated benefits, on postbiotic effects. It also investigates whether host BMI (and, by extension, the degree of obesity) can influence the diversity of hosts' fecal microbiota and the metabolites generated through the metabolism of these polyphenols.

Study samples (human fecal samples) were obtained from two volunteer cohorts: one with a low BMI (18.5–25 kg/m²; n = 7) and one with a high BMI (>40 kg/m²; n = 7). Samples were pooled within each BMI group to mask individual variability, and these samples were incubated for 48 hours under controlled conditions (10% H₂, 10% CO₂, and 80% N₂; temperature = 37°C) with high-purity (≥98%) rutin and genistein (Cayman Chemical, Estonia) in triplicate. Following incubation, an adapter-based SIMPLEX protocol was used to extract both hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites for characterization and subsequent downstream analyses.

Characterization was achieved using a direct injection Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (DI-FT-ICR-MS) and tandem high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Resultant chromatograms were analyzed using the MetaboScape (2021b) platform, with subsequent annotation leveraging the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB 5.0) annotation database.

The HMDB database was also used to elucidate metabolite grouping and pathway enrichment. Finally, the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 platform was used to evaluate the differences between metabolite profiles of individuals with high BMI, low BMI, and control BMI.

The study identified 361 metabolites (35 groups) that were significantly regulated (i.e., concentrations higher or lower than corresponding controls) by rutin and genistein. Notably, fecal material from low BMI volunteers demonstrated responses from more substance classes (more metabolites and groups; n = 88 metabolites) than high BMI fecal samples (n = 45 metabolites). 16S rRNA gene metagenomics confirmed these findings by revealing a higher α-diversity in lower BMI fecal matter than in higher BMI fecal matter post-incubation.

“…a higher diversity in the response may be associated with a higher diversity of the microbial composition. It is known that there is a decrease in gut microbial diversity in the context of obesity, as was first described by Turnbaugh et al. Nicholson et al. postulated that the state or condition of the intestinal microbiome is reflected in human biofluids such as serum and can be determined by metabolomics.”

Rutin and genistein were observed to alter concentrations of amino acids, peptides, and their analogs the most, followed by carbohydrates and carbohydrate derivatives. Notably, several identified regulated metabolites have been implicated in prior research on chronic diseases, highlighting the complex interplay between dietary polyphenols, microbial diversity, and host health.

Furthermore, while some metabolites demonstrated beneficial regulation (e.g., increased butyrate levels and reduced lactate levels in high BMI samples following rutin treatment), others (e.g., increased ethanolamine levels in the high BMI group) were found to be detrimental in the context of obesity.

“This suggests the possibility that the application of polyphenols may not be equally suitable for everyone and thus may not lead to the same results or potential beneficial effects for all individuals, emphasizing the idea of personalized nutrition. Therefore, results of the explorative study would require validation with a larger sample size, biological replicates, and/or an intervention study.”

The present study provides novel insights into the mechanisms governing the interactions between dietary polyphenols, gut microbial health, and host health. It demonstrates that these interactions are not unidirectional but rather bidirectional—BMI can alter gut microbial profiles, thereby altering polyphenol metabolism, which, in turn, impacts BMI. Moreover, specific BMI-dependent differences were noted, such as beneficial changes (e.g., higher butyrate and glycine) and potentially adverse ones (e.g., higher ethanolamine), highlighting the complexity of host-microbe-polyphenol interactions. It also provides a methodological approach for future research to investigate the impacts of plant compounds, dietary components, and drugs on gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles.

However, the authors caution that, due to the small sample size, pooling of samples, and exploratory design, these results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed in larger, well-controlled human studies.

Researchers in Japan have developed a predictive model that could improve treatment decisions for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. By combining tumor marker readings with patients' genetic information, their model predicts patient survival outcomes with greater accuracy and better identifies candidates who would benefit from surgery. The researchers found that specific genetic variations have a greater impact on tumor marker levels than the severity of the cancer. 

It is expected that the new model will be used as an indicator to determine if surgery is a good option for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment. The study was published in the British Journal of Surgery. 

A tumor marker is a substance found in the body that may indicate the presence of cancer. These substances can be proteins, genes, molecules, or other biological compounds that are produced by cancer cells or by the body in response to cancer. 

Doctors normally evaluate tumor marker levels using standardized reference ranges or by measuring percentage changes in their levels during treatment. However, traditional tumor markers used to decide on treatment options are unreliable indicators on their own because they differ significantly between patients. 

Genetic variants of specific genes affect how tumor markers are produced in an individual's body. Some people have genetic variants that naturally result in higher or lower levels of these markers, regardless of the state of the disease. This means that two patients with identical cancer severity might show very different tumor marker readings simply because they have different genetic profiles. 

The new "Tumor Marker Gene Model" (TMGM) addresses this limitation by including genetic information when making a prognosis. The model assesses the patient's genotype-the complete set of genetic information or DNA sequences that an organism inherits from its parents-to determine what should be considered normal or elevated tumor marker levels for individual patients. 

Researchers analyzed DNA from pancreatic cancer patients and found that FUT2 and FUT3 genotypes significantly impacted patients' survival outcomes. These genes influence what are considered normal tumor marker levels when no cancer is present. They affect an individual's ability to synthesize tumor markers and how these markers appear in blood tests when cancer is present. 

The new model incorporates these two genotypes with tumor marker levels. Results showed more accurate survival prediction rates for patients with tumors initially classified as inoperable (before receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment). The TMGM had approximately 15% more accuracy than the standard model. This suggests that current tumor marker evaluations are inadequate for these genetic profiles. 

Tumors classified as inoperable are usually too risky to remove through surgery, however, treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be used to shrink these tumors and make surgery feasible. The difficulty is determining which patients would benefit from surgery. 

The researchers found that the TMGM was particularly valuable for making these decisions. By assessing genetic information alongside tumor marker changes, doctors could more accurately identify which patients with tumors initially classified as inoperable would likely benefit from surgery after treatment. 

Importantly, the researchers found that tumor marker levels were more closely linked to a patient's genetic makeup than to how advanced their cancer was. This suggests that genetic information is crucial for accurately interpreting what changes in tumor markers mean for individual patients. This finding is significant because doctors rely on tumor markers to assess cancer severity and treatment response. Therefore, interpreting these markers without considering genetics could lead to incorrect conclusions about a patient's condition or treatment effectiveness. 

We found that the TMGM could more accurately identify which patients would really benefit from surgery. This could prevent some from undergoing unnecessary procedures and offer surgical opportunities to others who might have been overlooked."

A newly published study involving researchers from Karolinska Institutet indicates that prostate cancer can be diagnosed at an early stage through a simple urine sample. With the aid of AI and extensive analyses of gene activity in tumors, they have identified new biomarkers of high diagnostic precision.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common causes of male death globally. One of the main diagnostic hurdles is the lack of exact biomarkers able to identify the presence of an early tumor.

In this present study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), Imperial College London (UK) and Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing (China), have identified new, precise biomarkers. The results are presented in the journal Cancer Research.

On analysing the mRNA activity of all human genes in thousands of individual cells in prostate tumors, and knowing the position and degree of cancer of each cell, the researchers were able to construct digital models of prostate cancer.

The models were analyzed with AI to find proteins that can be used as biomarkers. These biomarkers were then analysed in the blood, prostate tissue and urine of almost 2,000 patients.

The researchers identified a set of biomarkers in urine that were able to indicate the presence and severity of prostate cancer with a high degree of precision. According to their calculations, they surpass PSA, which is the blood biomarker in current clinical use.

There are many advantages to measuring biomarkers in urine. It's non-invasive and painless and can potentially be done at home. The sample can then be analyzed using routine methods in clinical labs."

Mikael Benson, principal investigator, senior researcher at the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet

Large-scale clinical trials are being planned for the next phase of the research. One such is being discussed with Professor Rakesh Heer of Imperial College London, co-author of the study and head of TRANSFORM, the UK's national prostate cancer study, which offers a platform for expediting the testing of promising biomarkers.

"New, more precise biomarkers than PSA can lead to earlier diagnosis and better prognoses for men with prostate cancer," says Dr Benson. "Moreover, it can reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies in healthy men."

The study was largely financed by the Swedish Cancer Society, Radiumhemmet and the Swedish Research Council. Mikael Benson is the scientific founder of Mavatar, Inc.

The influenza virus manipulates the body's gene regulation system to accelerate its own spread, according to researchers at the University of Gothenburg. Their study also shows that an already approved drug could help strengthen immune defenses—though its effect in humans remains to be confirmed.

The study, published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research, concerns a previously unknown strategy used by the influenza A virus to take over the body's own systems. The study shows that the virus manipulates a protein that normally helps regulate which genes should be active in the cell, turning this protein against the immune system.

The protein, referred to as AGO2, is involved in what is known as RNA interference, a mechanism that regulates gene activity. While AGO2 usually works outside the cell nucleus, in conjunction with infection, the virus manages to move the protein into the nucleus, where it turns off genes that are key to the immune system.

This primarily concerns type I interferons - signaling substances used by infected cells to warn their neighbors and strengthen the body's defenses.

Aishe Sarshad, associate professor of cellular and molecular biology at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, is one of the study's senior authors:

"Most surprising was that the virus manages to hijack such a fundamental and well-regulated system as RNA interference - even using it inside the nucleus, where it isn't normally found," says Aishe Sarshad.

Much of the laboratory work was performed by Hsiang-Chi Huang, a postdoc member of the group at the time. The work shows that the AGO2 protein follows the tumor suppressor p53 into the nucleus, binding itself to genes that regulate the body's alarm signals and turning them off.

The researchers also investigated whether the manipulative actions of the virus could be stopped. To this end, they used arsenic trioxide (ATO), a drug approved for treating a type of blood cancer. In both cell cultures and mice, the drug was shown to increase the production of interferons and reduce the amount of virus in the lungs.

This discovery indicates that it may be possible to influence the body's own RNAi system to slow viral infections - and not just influenza, but perhaps even other RNA viruses.

Now, we want to continue our investigations to see whether the same mechanism is found in other types of infections. This paves the way for a completely new type of antiviral treatment, where we target not only the virus, but also how it uses our own cells."

The role of radiosurgery in the treatment of grade 2 meningioma remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with grade 2 meningiomas and to identify factors influencing tumor control and survival.

In this retrospective study, seventy patients underwent GKRS for grade 2 meningioma between 2007 and 2016. Tumor recurrence was categorized as local, marginal, or distant. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, while the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model were employed to analyze potential risk factors.

The median follow-up period was 48 months (range: 8 to 132 months). The one-year, three-year, and five-year local control rates were 92%, 73%, and 65%, respectively. The one-, three-, and three-year progression-free survival rates were 87%, 51%, and 44%, respectively. Multiple lesions and multiple prior recurrences were identified as negative predictors of marginal control and progression-free survival. Similarly, multiple lesions and marginal doses ≤13 Gy were associated with poor local control. Serious complications related to gamma knife use occurred in 4% of patients.

Our results support the use of GKRS as a reasonable treatment option in the management of grade 2 meningiomas. A higher margin dose should be considered to achieve better local control. Outfield progression (marginal and/or distant recurrence) was common, particularly in patients with multiple prior recurrences and/or multiple lesions. More aggressive treatment strategies should be explored for patients with these risk factors.

Time is running out for Mauricio Pochettino to get the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) ready for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with plenty to improve upon following their disastrous performances at the CONCACAF Nations League.

With an eye on improving the USMNT's roster, many MLS fans have been calling on Pochettino to give Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, the son of the Argentine's predecessor Gregg, a shot. The 23-year-old has caught the eye this season for the MLS-leading Whitecaps, with recent goals in the Champions Cup semi-final win against Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and against Minnesota United in the league intensifying suggestions he deserves to be called up by Pochettino.

One such fan hoping the former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea head coach gives Berhalter a chance to earn his first international appearance is former USMNT defender and current Fox Sports analyst, Alexi Lalas. In a recent tweet, the longtime MLS star suggested Berhalter deserved to be called up for this summer's Gold Cup, scheduled to be hosted across the U.S. from June 14 to July 6.

“In a moment when motivation of current #USMNT players is being questioned, at least Seb Berhalter works hard, fights, is hungry, and is consistent,” Lalas tweeted. “You give him a look at the Gold Cup. Nothing to lose. And there is precedent of #USMNT coach coaching his predecessor's son.”

Lalas subsequently expanded on this in the latest State of the Union podcast, saying, “Is he flashy? No. Is he even a game changer when it comes to potentially here with the National Team? No.

“But I think he's worth a flyer on for Mauricio Pochettino coming into this summer for a Gold Cup with the understanding that ultimately you're going to be judged next summer in the actual World Cup.

“But there is a question as to, do you have the right collection of players? It's not the best players, it's the best collection of players. And who knows, maybe someone like Sebastien “Berhalter comes in and is just simple and is predictable in the most positive sense and provides Pochettino with something that's not sexy but gets the results that you need.

“And I think that from a Pochettino perspective, if there is to be success next summer, it's not going to be in a romantic version, it's not going to be sexy.”

Berhalter's next chance to break into the USMNT roster will be in early June, with Pochettino's side set to take on Turkey and Switzerland ahead of the Gold Cup. This tournament will not only be an invaluable opportunity to test his players, but it will also be their final competitive set of games before the world's best teams descend on the U.S., Mexico, and Canada for the 2026 World Cup.

As U.S. Men's National Team star Christian Pulisic's second Serie A season comes to a close, AC Milan is keen to tie down the 26-year-old to a new deal.

Since arriving in Italy for just over $24 million, Pulisic has proved a revelation, returning to the heights expected during his early days at Borussia Dortmund, before a mixed spell with Premier League side Chelsea. Currently the Rossoneri's leading scorer with 16 goals in all competitions, Pulisic also has 11 assists in 45 games to date - second most on the team.

Now with just two years remaining on his existing contract, Milan are closing in on a new deal with Captain America, which would see him stay at the San Siro through at least the summer of 2029. While the specifics of Pulisic's proposed new deal have yet to become clear, he is expected to have earned a raise on his current $4.6 million annual salary, as per La Gazzetta dello Sport.

This news comes a matter of days after he became the only Rossoneri star to have scored at least 15 goals in both of their first two seasons at the San Siro since the legendary Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as per CBS Sports.

With the Pennsylvanian expected to put pen to paper on his new deal soon, Milan's attention can now turn to what to do with the rest of their roster, following a disappointing season.

One player whose future appears up in the air is defender Theo Hernandez, with La Gazzetta dello Sport claiming that the French international, who will be a free agent in the summer of 2026, has been offered an extension, although at a lower salary.

This roster reconstruction comes with Milan currently languishing in ninth in Serie A, and their hopes of European soccer next season resting almost entirely on their upcoming Coppa Italia final against high-flying Bologna. A win would secure Milan not only their second piece of silverware of the season, following January's Supercoppa Italiana win, but also a UEFA Europa League spot next year.

That being said, with four league games still to go, there is still a chance Milan could secure European qualification the old-fashioned way, as they sit just six points behind sixth-placed Roma, in what is the final Europa League qualifier spot. Just two points ahead of Claudio Ranieri's side sits Juventus in the fourth and final Champions League spot.

Next up for Sergio Conceicao's side, in what could be his first and final season in charge of Milan, is a trip to 13th-placed Genoa. Should Milan leave with three points, it would mark their first back to back to back wins under Conceicao.

A home game against Bologna follows, before Pulisic and Co. travel to Roma where they'll face the fifth-placed side once more in the Coppa Italia final.

A pro with a famous Dutch club and the subject of a tug-of-war for her international services, Lily Yohannes is the youngest and most unconventional prospect on the top-ranked U.S. women's national team.

This spring, 17-year-old Lily Yohannes and her father, Daniel, were at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport when they heard the call to board their flight to the United States.

Lily had grown accustomed to these transatlantic trips: Since her family left Northern Virginia in 2017 to live in the Netherlands, she had flown often with her parents and two older brothers to visit relatives in the D.C. area and Dallas.

For the past year, though, most of her stateside voyages have been not for family purposes but for her blossoming soccer career. A pro with a famous Dutch club since she was 15 and the subject of a tug-of-war for her international services, Yohannes is the youngest and most unconventional prospect on the top-ranked U.S. women's national team.

As they stepped onto that flight to San Francisco in late March, Yohannes turned one way to find her business-class seat, paid for by the U.S. Soccer Federation. Traveling on his own dime, her father headed back to coach.

“Okay, bye. I'm back with the peasants! Don't forget about me,” Daniel, laughing, recalled telling his daughter.

The Sports Moment newsletter

Yohannes has, indeed, worked her way into elite status. In June, eight days before her 17th birthday, she scored in her U.S. debut against South Korea. Early this year, she made her first start for Coach Emma Hayes, who has begun integrating young players into the talent pool as part of the buildup to the 2027 World Cup in Brazil.

Hayes cautions that Yohannes is “17 years of age, and we have to proceed with an appreciation that she hasn't fully matured yet.” Nonetheless, Yohannes is on the right track. She starts in central midfield for Ajax, the Amsterdam club renowned for its men's program and a relative newcomer to the women's game. In November 2023, at 16½, she became the youngest starter in group-stage history of the UEFA women's Champions League, the ultimate testing ground for European teams.

Big clubs in Europe have kept a close eye on Yohannes's progress and, with her Ajax contract expiring after the 2025-26 season, she has become a prized transfer target.

“You can tell Lily has been a pro for a few years in terms of her maturity and the way she carries herself,” said U.S. right back Emily Fox, a fellow Virginian. “I could go on and on about her assets.”

Yohannes has taken a twisting road from her DMV roots. Her hometown is Springfield, Virginia. She attended D.C. United games at Audi Field and played for youth clubs in Fairfax and Loudoun counties. Several dozen relatives on her father's side live in the D.C. area. Her parents still own the home in the region; they're throwing her an 18th birthday party there this summer.

For close to eight years, though, the Yohanneses have lived in the Dutch village of Muiderberg, 14 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Citing their desire to expand their children's cultural and soccer horizons, Daniel and Semhar Yohannes listed their Virginia home on Airbnb and headed abroad.

One day, Lily was a student at Hunt Valley Elementary School, the next she was off to Europe.

“It was cool,” she said with a shrug. “I was a 10-year-old, just going with the flow, moving with my family. We had been to Europe before, so it was just sort of like, ‘Oh, we're going to Europe.' It was an exciting moment.”

Daniel Yohannes's work in IT risk management provided flexibility. The children were quick to adjust.

“We are of a diverse background,” he said, referencing their Eritrean ancestry. “We pushed culture and have a different worldview: Let's make that move to a place where there is no language barrier and where there is a good football education.”

He added: “You get the culture side, the football side — let's give it a try for a couple years. That's how it started.”

Family ties to the Horn of Africa and to soccer run deep. Lily's maternal grandfather, Bokretsion Gebrehiwot, played for the Ethiopian national team and scored a famous goal against Ivory Coast at the 1968 Africa Cup of Nations.

Gebrehiwot immigrated to the United States and helped launch the Eritrean Sports Festival, a celebration that rotates among North American cities annually. At the 2000 event in Houston, Daniel and Semhar met. They married and settled in the D.C. area.

Moving abroad, “I missed things at first, but I got used to it,” Lily said. “The most important thing for us — for me and my brothers — was football. Once we joined clubs and started playing and making friends in school, things became sort of normal and you just sort of adapted.”

The soccer culture in one of the sport's hotbeds was different, too.

“All the kids, going outside, playing on the little [soccer] courts, football sort of was the center of a lot of people's lives in the Netherlands,” she said. “I just thought that was super cool, always playing and having fun with it.”

At 10, Lily began her Dutch soccer immersion playing on an under-14 team. However, she was not facing the depth of competition she would have received in the United States, where the girls' and women's game have thrived for decades. So her parents moved her to clubs that allowed her to play against boys of her age.

At 11, she caught the attention of the Royal Dutch Football Association and received invitations to regional camps, a pathway to the national program. Although she was not Dutch and couldn't play for the junior national teams, the Dutch federation was laying the groundwork in case she someday became eligible.

Lily thrived at a local youth club before joining Ajax's academy, which, for more than a century, has developed hundreds of world-class men's players. It was also building up its women's program. For Lily, the move seemed right.

“The Ajax mentality, you can really tell the DNA of how they play: attacking football, possession based, technically and tactically strong, just being dominant on the ball,” she said.

Though far from home, she had not gone undetected by the U.S. staff, which invited her to youth camps in 2021 and 2022.

In April 2023, two months shy of her 16th birthday, she signed a pro contract with Ajax.

Though she is younger than her brothers, Lily was first to sign. Aethan, 21, enrolled in D.C. United's academy, played two seasons at Wake Forest University, represented U.S. youth national teams and is now with the under-21 squad at Den Bosch, a Dutch second-division club. Jayden, 19, is also with a second-tier Dutch side, playing for Telstar's U-21s.

Lily's first pro season featured 32 appearances across all competitions, including 28 starts and five goals. Ajax won the Dutch cup, finished second in the league and advanced to the Champions League quarterfinals before losing to Chelsea, which, at the time, was coached by Hayes.

In the middle of the 2023-24 campaign, Lily was invited to the Dutch under-19 national team. Still ineligible to play in official matches, she participated in workouts and continued integrating into the program.

Six months later, though, she accepted an invitation to Hayes's first camp in charge of the U.S. squad. Twelve minutes into her debut, she scored against South Korea. Because it was a friendly, she remained eligible for the Dutch team.

With her profile rising, Lily soon needed to decide her international future. Dutch citizenship was on the horizon, but her roots were American.

She and her parents spoke often with both federations.

“This is a lifetime decision,” Daniel Yohannes said. “We didn't want her to rush it; let her take her time. She could've gone in either direction. It took her a while to make that call.”

That call came in November, less than a month before the U.S. was scheduled to play a friendly in the Netherlands.

“When you have a big decision to make, it's always thinking about the pros and cons,” she said, “and about what really speaks to your heart.”

Dutch Coach Andries Jonker did not take it well.

“I read that she dreams of playing in an American shirt her whole life,” he said at a news conference before that international window. “She could have said that right away. It would have saved [the Dutch federation] a lot of work. … I don't want a player who would rather play in another shirt.”

Daniel Yohannes said Jonker's comments were “a bit disappointing.” He said others at the Dutch federation were “super professional, genuinely wonderful people.” When the teams met in Amsterdam, Yohannes entered in the 66th minute. Many fans booed her.

Since then, she has started two SheBelieves Cup matches and appeared as a sub and a starter in friendlies against Brazil in early April.

“It's a step-by-step process,” Hayes said.

Hayes has tasked the roster's veteran core with mentoring prospects, such as Yohannes and 19-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton.

“Sometimes we get so overexcited about the less experienced players, but the more experienced ones that do it again and again and again and again are going to be the key factor in ensuring … players like Lily or Claire feel they can be supported in the right way, so the expectation isn't too ridiculous,” Hayes said.

Yohannes has embraced the guidance.

“Looking up to the [U.S.] teams since I was a little kid and now being here with Emma and my teammates, it's just been great,” she said. “I'm learning from them in every camp, and I hope for many more experiences in this incredible environment.”

Question marks surround Antonio Rüdiger's place at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup after the Real Madrid defender underwent a serious knee surgery that ended his season.

Real Madrid confirmed the 32-year-old went under the knife to repair "a tear in the outer meniscus of his left knee." With only five games left in the 2024–25 season, Rüdiger will spent the rest of Los Blancos' La Liga campaign on the sidelines.

The news comes after Rüdiger was forced to come off the pitch in the 111th minute of the Copa del Rey final due to the injury. Just a few minutes later, the center back received a red card for throwing ice at referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea and had to be held back from confronting the official. 

Rüdiger faces a lengthy suspension for the incident that would have likely ruled him out for the rest of Real Madrid's season, but now, he will certainly not only miss Los Blancos' upcoming matches, including El Clásico, but he also is a doubt for this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

Barring any setbacks, Rüdiger is expected to be available for Real Madrid in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. The Germany international is looking at a two-month recovery from his knee injury, per ESPN, and could return to the pitch before this summer's tournament concludes on July 13.

Although Rüdiger is a doubt to recover in time for Real Madrid's opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup against Al Hilal on June 18, the center back could feature in the knockout stage of the competition should Los Blancos make a run.

Of course, there is always the possibility that Real Madrid will not want to risk Rüdiger and therefore would keep the 32-year-old sidelined for the entire summer, even if he is technically fit to play. 

If it was up to Rüdiger, though, the former Chelsea defender would feature in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, as well as the Nations League semifinals for Germany.

After I have played more than seven month with severe pain, it was unfortunately unavoidable that I had to undergo a meniscus surgery. Now I'm finally pain-free again, and the surgery was a success. 🙌🏾 Thanks to the medical team. I want to be able to play again as soon as… pic.twitter.com/HhrFD3Io1u

"After I have played more than seven month with severe pain, it was unfortunately unavoidable that I had to undergo a meniscus surgery. Now I'm finally pain-free again, and the surgery was a success.  Thanks to the medical team," Rüdiger shared on X.

"I want to be able to play again as soon as possible as two big tournaments with the Nations League and the Club World Cup are in front of me, but I have to look from week to week now and we will see. I will do everything I can to make it happen. See you soon and take care of yourselves."

Germany take on Portugal in the Nations League semifinals on June 4. It will be a close race for Rüdiger to be back in time to represent his country this summer, but his participation in the competition, as well as the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, will remain uncertain until he gets further into his recovery.

Chelsea are plotting a summer move for Cole Palmer's friend Morgan Rogers as they look to take advantage of Aston Villa's financial predicament.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

"The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want," Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

"I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do," Adams said postgame. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us."

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

"I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic," Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen."

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

"I'm never concerned, man. It's football," he said. "You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to."

FIFA Club World Cup

The Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami — and possibly LAFC, if FIFA opts for a play-in game between the 2022 MLS Cup champs and Club America — will get a windfall this summer when the MLS teams compete in FIFA's expanded Club World Cup.

FIFA announced that each participating Concacaf team will receive $9.55 million for taking part in the tournament. That figure increases with every positive result. Teams get another $2 million for every win and $1 million for every draw.

Advertisement

Should an MLS team advance out of the group stage — far from a guarantee, but a possibility nonetheless — that club would be due another payment of $7.5 million. The prizes continue for each advancing round.

For MLS teams that still struggle to break even, and with many of them losing money, that sort of payout is a massive boost. For the players on those teams, however, there will be significantly fewer riches to be gained by participating in the tournament.

According to the terms of the current collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in February 2021, MLS players will be paid a maximum of $1 million in prize money from the highly lucrative tournament. The cap comes from section 10.8 of the CBA, which defines tournament bonus pools. That section lays out payouts for known tournaments, like the U.S. Open Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup. What it didn't account for at the time was a new FIFA-run tournament with unprecedented prize pools.

Thus, players are limited by a carve out for compulsory and non-compulsory tournaments. The exact language reads:

If an MLS Team or MLS receives prize money by virtue of the Team's performance and/or participation in a Compulsory Tournament or Non-Compulsory Tournament (other than the tournaments set forth above i.e., USOC, Canadian Championship, CCL, Campeones Cup, Leagues Cup), Players competing in that tournament will receive the following: (a) If the Team or MLS receives prize money, fifty percent (50%) of such prize money up to a maximum payment to the Players (collectively) of $1,000,000 per tournament.

The MLS Players Association recently reached out to MLS to engage in discussions about the bonuses, per a league source, however no formal discussions have yet taken place and no movement has occurred beyond what is spelled out in the CBA.

If each team maxed out its roster at the MLS limit of 30 players, that would amount to $33,333 per player. That bonus would not be reflected in a player's salary budget charge.

Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan, who is the team's player rep with the MLSPA, told The Seattle Times he hoped “the compensation part gets settled with the PA and what not, but I'm really excited about the opportunity to compete and play against these big teams.”

It is an unfortunate set of circumstances for the players, as this level of prize money is unprecedented in club soccer, especially for an MLS side. It simply wasn't something that could have been anticipated. Whether MLS sees it the same way, or feels any sort of obligation to budge, remains to be seen.

Interestingly, this comes at a time when the league is weighing flipping the calendar to a fall-spring format, something that would require MLSPA approval. A calendar change would mostly suit players, especially if it's paired with roster rule and spending changes, but will also come with hardships related especially to training in colder weather.

At minimum, this comes at a time in which fostering collaboration between the players and league is at a premium.

NWSL

As recently as 2011, the professional soccer landscape was in relative stasis.

On the men's side, Major League Soccer (MLS) had only recently stabilized and begun its growth, with fewer than 20 active clubs until 2015. The men's lower divisions had splintered into two leagues: the North American Soccer League (NASL) occupied the second-division rung, and the United Soccer League (USL), then branded as USL Pro, kicked off as a third division. On the women's side, the first-division Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) played its final season, two years before the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) debut.

Advertisement

The four leagues had a combined 44 teams, only six of which were women's clubs.

In 2025, there are 119 professional clubs, with 22 women's teams between the two Division I leagues, NWSL and the USL Super League. More are expected to join next year, including the dawn of professional lower-league women's soccer, which has been lacking due in large part to historical underfunding. Despite the eye-popping valuations of clubs today, the NWSL — the third attempt at professional women's soccer in the U.S. and the one that has been around the longest — has only recently reached its point of acceleration with the newest expansion team, Denver, paying $110 million to join.

On Friday, CBS Sports reported that the NWSL sent an application to U.S. Soccer to launch a second-division league. In its petition to the federation, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said launching this league would be “essential for (its) development and sustainability,” citing player and staff development.

The proposed league resembles a reserve league rather than a second tier; Berman's letter likened it to Major League Baseball's minor leagues. Affiliates are common in sports as a way of developing players and providing another path to pros for those not quite ready for primetime. It's also an avenue for markets that wouldn't be considered for the top division to get in on the fun, all while helping players and staff bolster their resumes for upward mobility.

But is the scale of increase answering a need, or causing a convoluted shape that looks less like a pyramid and, instead, becoming something far more amorphous?

In a statement shared with The Athletic after the news of its request for Division II sanctioning, the NWSL added an unmissable second factor: “The demand for professional soccer has never been higher.”

Long touted as the “sport of the future,” the organizers of professional soccer have viewed the past decade (and the half-decade to come) as their optimal growth window. The men's World Cup will come stateside next summer; the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2031 Women's World Cup extend the window of major global tournaments at home, fueling investors' interest in launching clubs, leagues and events like The Soccer Tournament.

What the NWSL has proposed is a minor league, but there's room for argument that the space needs a proper lower division. NWSL leaving the door open for unaffiliated teams to join in the future is evidence of that. However, wanting to launch lower-division soccer leagues is one thing; curating them to endure with genuine stability is a far more difficult venture.

When the USL announced its intention to launch a professional women's league after previously launching the amateur W-League, it seemed like a clear solution to launching lower-division women's soccer. The USL had established itself in the men's landscape, even recognizing the first player's union for lower-league soccer players.

Instead, the USL launched the Super League with first-division sanctioning requirements, citing a desire to operate at the highest baseline standard possible. It also complicated how to contextualize its launch: was this a rival league for the NWSL or a developmental platform independent from it?

The USL Super League is nearing the end of its inaugural regular season, with the playoff semifinals on June 7 and a final on June 14. The Carolina Ascent has been the clear initial power, topping the league table as well as the attendance rankings with an average home draw of 3,859, including a high mark of 10,553 for the inaugural match.

But leagues aren't cheap. Nor are the individual clubs.

Scouring the USL's publicly available Franchise Disclosure Documents, Colton Coreschi reported on the Super League clubs' first-year financial expenditure for Backheeled. Per his reporting, the expansion fee to join the Super League stands at $10 million — five times the fee paid by Angel City, the San Diego Wave and the Utah Royals to join NWSL, per Sportico. Player expenses (including salaries, insurance and housing) range from $732,000 to $1.8 million annually per club. Coaches add another $175,000 to $350,000 onto the ledger, while facilities are even more expensive to secure: $725,000 to $2.3 million.

Tack on travel and off-field costs like front-office staff, broadcasts, supplies and annual dues, and the range of estimated operational expenses per year goes from $3.4 million to $7.7 million on top of the one-time $10 million expansion fee. It's an expensive pursuit to execute well, and one that isn't for the faint of heart.

While the women's soccer pyramid is still burgeoning, the men's leagues provide a cautionary tale.

After the (second) NASL ceased operation in 2017, the USL on the men's side had brief but total command over the second and third-division levels. Its flagship rebranded as the USL Championship in 2019, the same year it launched a new circuit, USL League One, to fill the void left in the third-division tier.

Around the same time, U.S. Soccer also granted third-division sanctioning to the National Independent Soccer Association (NISA). That league never really gained a foothold with frequent backroom reorganization, its stable of clubs varying greatly each season and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nevertheless, its launch sent a message: U.S. Soccer would grant (non-provisional) sanctioning within the same tier of its pyramid to multiple leagues, so long as their proposal was sound. MLS soon followed, launching Next Pro as a Division III league to house its affiliate (not reserve, per league guidance) clubs in 2022.

The disjointed competition has left a myriad of Division III men's leagues looking for meaning. While USL League One is in its seventh season and expanding, NISA is on a partial hiatus and Next Pro is largely an MLS developmental league with only a small portion of its clubs being independent. Some MLS teams still send their top prospects who need more training on loans to USL clubs in the Championship and League One.

Somehow, this doesn't quite feel like the utopian ideal that the “sport of the future” promised. Still, there's a promise of future payoff, especially in women's soccer.

But dedicated support from fans requires more than proximity and abundance. It requires operational stability at the club and league levels: enough time for memories, often emotional, to occur. There has yet to be an investment or strategy in the lower-division landscape to produce despite recent efforts.

NWSL's Division II proposal is up against WPSL Pro, another league that announced its intentions to apply for Division II status last week. For those keeping track, that's two Division I leagues, two Division II, no Division III and multiple amateur offerings.

(As a related aside: if the NCAA extends the college soccer season, it could leave well over a hundred amateur soccer clubs that play in the summer, in leagues like the USL W-League and modern WPSL, needing to decide if they can scale up and go professional or if they'll struggle to contend.)

It's a conundrum of U.S. Soccer's own creation by opening the landscape like a marketplace instead of working to ensure a coherent structure — a far more Darwinistic method of curation than the launches of MLS and the NWSL. It leaves the act of bringing more soccer to the country feeling more like a pure investment with an eye on profit, the one-time sport of the future now promising a growth opportunity, rather than creating community assets. If a player or coach happens to benefit from the league and go on to do great things, it's a bonus rather than proof of concept.

Launch events are cool, but they aren't the ultimate aim. The first league that can coherently prove that being a second-division market should be a badge of honor with grassroots appeal and not a consolation prize for missing out on the NWSL will be the real breakthrough in the women's landscape.

Seemingly, that isn't the intention for the USL Super League, and the NWSL's plan leans heavily on reserve teams that are unlikely to garner rabid followings in the senior team's backyards. Maybe the WPSL is best positioned to fill that void with its own independent circuit, and can form a critical mass of sports-mad cities like Cleveland that'll create unique and intimate atmospheres that make them a draw to fans and neutrals alike.

But even within the leagues that are trying to fill the void now, not every team is built to last.

Over the last eight seasons, 26 independent lower-division men's clubs in the prominent leagues have folded or relocated, leaving their local fans with a void. These include three from the NASL, 11 from the USL Championship, four from USL League One, seven from NISA, and one from MLS Next Pro. Even in this golden age of American soccer, where interest has never been higher, at least three lower-league markets — in locals as notable as Saint Louis and San Francisco, and even those storied New York Cosmos — lose their hometown team each winter.

Even with the cautionary tales, a noble and overdue pursuit is at the heart of this all. Forming lower-league structures in both the women's and men's landscape is worth fighting for with three undeniable drivers: player development, staff development and giving a greater number of communities a team to fall in love with, even if they aren't at an NWSL scale or standard.

College was that developmental launchpad for a long time, but as USL Super League president Amanda Vandervort told The Athletic before the league's launch last summer: “There's a delta (of opportunities) there that needs to be filled — because if we don't, we're going to fall behind.”

Short-term opportunities can only help so much. A unified push with a coherent plan to set clubs up for success would make this even more impactful. Players and staff need to know where to best evolve, while fans need to trust that their team is here to stay. We'll see if they can find it.

It appears as though the future is set in stone for Real Madrid, with Xabi Alonso looking set to replace Carlo Ancelotti as manager for the 2025/26 season. Amid rumours that Ancelotti could face the axe following a disappointing campaign at the Bernabeu, it was revealed that the Italian had agreed to become the head coach of the Brazil national team, a job he has been linked with for several years.

This has allowed for an amicable parting of the ways between club and manager, and will reportedly allow Alonso, who has long been viewed as the long-term successor to Ancelotti, to take the hotseat in the Spanish capital. However, despite the fact the current boss won't be in charge for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, it has been explained why Alonso wants to wait until after to join up with the squad.

Live Draw for the FIFA Club World Cup, involving Real Madrid, Inter Miami, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.

According to reports coming out of Spain, Alonso wants to wait until after the Club World Cup has finished before taking over as he does not want to inherit a squad that is already exhausted from a long season and would rather start from scratch when Los Blancos commence with the pre-season training ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.

It is believed that the plan of action currently in place will see Ancelotti continue hs duties as manager until the end of the domestic term, before moving on to immediately start his preparations for the 2026 World Cup with Brazil in his first job as an international manager.

Instead of Alonso coming in for the summer tournament, club director and former manager Santiago Solari will take charge of the side in the United States, with Alonso then coming to power prior to the start of the new season.

GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Xabi Alonso played 236 games for Real Madrid as a player, winning five trophies.

From Carlo Ancelotti to Pep Guardiola, European football's biggest competition has seen some managerial heavyweights take charge.

While it seems Alonso is set to land the job that felt destined to be his, reports did indicate that club president Florentino Perez and Alonso himself were unsure about making the move. Perez had been a big supporter of Ancelotti and Alonso knew this and a combination of that and the fact he didn't want to rush into such a big job, left the move on the fence.

When it became clear a change was needed, which reportedly was decided on after the Champions League elimination at the hands of Arsenal, it was proposed to Perez by some of his closest advisors that if there were any lingering doubts over Alonso, that he should make a move for Jurgen Klopp.

The German has been out of management since last summer after leaving Liverpool, but now works as the global head of soccer for Red Bull. However, Klopp is said to be unhappy in his current role, which opened the door for potential talks with Madrid.

TOPICS:

In a recent guest appearance on the Unfiltered Soccer podcast, former U.S. Men's National Team head coach and current San Jose Earthquakes head coach/sporting director, Bruce Arena, expressed his concern with the USMNT appointing a foreign manager to lead the team.  “If you're an American coaching the U.S. team,” said Arena, “you know the culture, you know the pride and how important the national team is. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it.”

This week, the show's co-host and legendary American goalkeeper Tim Howard added his perspective to the conversation suggesting that the level of buy-in from an American coach may differ from that of a foreign coach.



“When you're an American coach [who is coaching the USMNT], you care about your legacy. It's where you live. It's where you've grown up. You're going to be forever attached to that country, win or lose. Some of the foreign coaches that we've had... they don't really care if their legacy is tarnished in America. They're not American. The buy-in isn't the same.”

Howard, who made 121 appearances for the United States and was a member of 3 World Cup teams, questioned if a foreign manager holds the U.S. job in the same regard that an American might.

“I have seen managers for the U.S. Men's National Team, particularly foreign managers... they use it as a stepping stone. They use it as an opportunity to get another job. They use it as a payday.

“That's different,” Howard continued, “than when you get a manager like Bruce Arena, like a Bob Bradley, who all they've ever done is dream about coaching the national team, right? That's a huge difference. The buy-in is just, it's not the same.”

In 1990, under American coach Bob Gansler, the U.S. Men qualified for their first World Cup in 40 years.  Since Gansler's tenure ended in 1991, U.S. Soccer has employed 7 full-time head coaches for the Senior team, four of whom – Steve Sampson, Bruce Arena, Bob Bradley and Gregg Berhalter – were American with Arena serving two separate terms.  The United States' current head coach, Mauricio Pochettino, is the first foreign manager to lead the team since Jurgen Klinsmann was fired in November of 2016.

Ultimately, Howard contends that the U.S. Men's National Team can be managed by a coach from either category, American or foreigner, as long as their commitment to success is beyond reproach.

“I don't give a good God darn if the manager's foreign.  What I care is if a foreign manager comes to manage our national team, that he's all in. That he cares. That he all he wants to do is win and this is his singular focus.”

According to MARCA.

Carlo Ancelotti has reportedly reached an agreement with the Brazilian Football Federation to take over as head coach of the national team once he departs Real Madrid, according to MARCA. The Italian manager is expected to leave the Spanish giants at the end of the current season, ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup, which begins on June 14. If the report proves accurate, Ancelotti would see out the remainder of the campaign, allowing Real Madrid to avoid the disruption of appointing an interim coach.

Real Madrid is said to prefer that Ancelotti's successor be in place in time to lead the team at the Club World Cup, although a report from AS suggests that Solari could lead the club in that tournament. The club views the Club World Cup as an important international showcase and would like to ensure continuity and preparation heading into the summer.

Ancelotti's legacy at Real Madrid is among the most celebrated in the club's history. Across two spells with the team, he has won major trophies including three UEFA Champions League titles (2014, 2022 and 2025), two Copa del Rey trophies, and two La Liga titles in 2022 and 2024.

Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from the Italian Open in the middle of a three-match losing streak.

The move to pull out of the clay court tournament sparked concern about whether the 24-time Grand Slam winner will compete in the storied French Open, set to take place just two weeks after the Italian Open concludes.

Djokovich first played in the Rome-based tournament in 2007 and has yet to miss a match. He has the most career matches played at the Italian Open and the second-most titles, with six, right behind Rafael Nadal and his 10.

Djokovic's three consecutive defeats came in the Miami Open, the Monte-Carlo Masters, and most recently, losing the Madrid Open on Saturday.

The 37-year-old spoke on the defeat in Monte-Carlo and his disappointment in his performance.

"Just horrible. Horrible feeling to play this way. Just sorry for all the people who had to witness this," said Djokovic. "I don't know. I don't have it. I have it and I don't have it. I don't really care."

As for his goals for the rest of the clay court season, the tennis legend spoke succinctly

"Roland Garros," he said. "That's it."

After his most recent loss in Madrid, the Serbian admitted in a news conference that his "new reality" is to think less about how far he'll go in a tournament, and more on just winning the current match.

"It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournament."

The storied French Open tournament, which begins three days after Djokovic's 38th birthday, will mark so much more than a hopeful return to the usual dominance the tennis world is used to seeing, but could be a chance at extending a mark that the superstar already has a historic lead in.

The French Open would be the 25th Grand Slam in Djokovic's illustrious career, with the No. 2 spot belonging to Nadal's 22.

Djokovic is also looking for his 100th career title, which he is currently No. 3 in all time behind Roger Federer's 103 and Jimmy Connors' 109.

Can Indian Wells champion Jack Draper take his hard-court momentum onto clay? The young Brit has traditionally played his best on faster surfaces, but an encouraging start in Monte Carlo, where he narrowly lost a round-of-16 clash with former finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, set him in good stead for a successful Madrid campaign.Benefitting from a third-round walkover against No. 30 seed Matteo Berrettini, Draper is now on the brink of his first clay-court Masters 1000 quarterfinal. Standing in his way is American Tommy Paul, whom he's beaten three out of five times.Paul is a former Roland Garros junior champion, but has also played his best on hard courts and grass, beating Draper on the latter en route to his first ATP 500 title in Queen's Club last year. Peaking at No. 9 in the rankings earlier this year, the 27-year-old underperformed expectations through the Sunshine Swing, bowing out of Indian Wells and Miami in the fourth and third round, respectively.After a solid clay warm-up in Houston, Paul edged past Brazilian youngster Joao Fonseca and held off No. 24 seed Karen Khachanov in three sets to book a sixth meeting with Draper. What seems like a toss-up is also a big opportunity, with the winner to play either Frances Tiafoe or Matteo Arnaldi to reach the semifinals, but only one can advance.

One of the best matches of 2025 is getting a rematch at the Caja Magica with Iga Swiatek and Madison Keys reprising their Australian Open semifinal on clay.Keys scored only her second victory over the world No. 1 in three dramatic sets, going on to win her first major title over defending champion Aryna Sabalenka in Melbourne.

The former world No. 1 will head to this year's Roland Garros without a clay-court match win.ByTENNIS.comPublished Apr 29, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 29, 2025

Novak Djokovic won't compete in Rome, the Internazionali BNL d'Italia announced on Tuesday. A six-time champion in the Italian capital, Djokovic would have been searching for his first clay-court victory of the season—and to snap a rare three-match losing streak dating back to March.The former world No. 1 was unable to find his best level at the Rolex Monte Carlo Masters or Mutua Madrid Open, crucial tune-up events ahead of Roland Garros. In Monte Carlo, the No. 3 seed fell in straight sets to Alejandro Tabilo 6-3, 6-4 in his opening match. Seeded fourth in Madrid, Djokovic fell in the second round (after a bye) to Matteo Arnaldi, 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday.Read More: Novak Djokovic loses third consecutive match, to Matteo Arnaldi in Madrid“I was hoping I can play one more match than I played in Monte-Carlo,” Djokovic told press after his defeat to the Italian. “Kind of new reality for me, I have to say, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament.“It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.”

Djokovic, who lifted the Rome trophy in 2008, 2011, 2014-15, 2020 and 2022, holds the second-most titles in the tournament's 82 editions after Rafael Nadal's 10 titles. The Serbian's absence will also end his perfect attendance streak in Italy, having competed in the last 18 editions of the tournament.The 37-year-old is next scheduled to compete at Roland Garros, but he'll be facing a new challenge. It will be the first time since 2006 that he'll head to the clay-court Grand Slam without a strong result on the surface in his pocket: Djokovic has reached the quarterfinals or better at either Monte Carlo, Madrid or Rome every year since his debut.Earlier this year, Djokovic became the oldest Masters 1000 finalist in ATP history at the Miami Open, where he fell to 19-year-old Jakub Mensik in two tiebreak sets. He also reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, but was forced to retire after the first set against Alexander Zverev due to a hamstring injury.Currently ranked world No. 5, Djokovic is 12-7 on the year.

Tennis fans, get ready. One of the most anticipated matchups in the sport's new generation is about to unfold in Madrid.

When Coco Gauff steps onto the clay court to face Mirra Andreeva at the WTA Madrid Open, it won't just be another match; it will be a generation-defining battle between two of the brightest young stars in tennis today. Both players, despite their youth, have already captured global attention with their fearless style, maturity beyond their years, and rapidly growing fan bases.

Coco Gauff's story reads like a fairy tale. Bursting onto the scene at just 15 years old with a stunning upset over Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, Gauff has since established herself as a force on the WTA tour. Now 20, she's already a Grand Slam champion after claiming her first major title at the 2023 US Open and sits comfortably within the top 10 of the world rankings.

Her game is built on explosive athleticism, a rock-solid backhand, and a fighting spirit that's drawn comparisons to legends like Serena Williams. Her ability to turn defense into offense and her tactical IQ make her a formidable opponent on any surface, and the clay courts of Madrid are no exception.

Enter Mirra Andreeva — the 17-year-old Russian sensation who's quickly becoming one of the Tour's most talked-about players. Known for her calm demeanour and silky-smooth groundstrokes, the Russian first caught the world's eye at the same Madrid Open last year when, as a wildcard, she stormed into the fourth round as a 15-year-old.

Since then, Andreeva has steadily climbed the rankings and is now seen as one of the sport's most promising prospects. Her poise under pressure and ability to construct points with precision belie her age. Fans and pundits alike have tipped her for future Grand Slam glory, and her steady rise makes every match she plays must-watch tennis.

This clash is more than a battle for a quarterfinal spot — it's a glimpse into the future of women's tennis. Expect a contrast of styles: Gauff's raw athleticism, speed, and counterpunching prowess against Andreeva's smooth technique, court craft, and tactical nous.

Both players have a flair for the dramatic and a maturity in their shot selection that makes for compelling viewing. The Madrid clay favors players who can move well and construct points patiently–both boxes these two tick emphatically.

Given their shared youth, expect long, gruelling rallies, gutsy shot-making, and moments of audacious brilliance. While Gauff holds the edge in experience, especially at the Grand Slam level, Andreeva's hunger and the fact that Madrid has already been a happy hunting ground for her make this an even contest.

For the neutrals, it's a can't-miss showdown — a passing-of-the-torch kind of moment, or perhaps a reaffirmation of Gauff's standing as the present while Andreeva signals the future.

No matter who comes out on top, this match promises to be one for the highlights reel. And for tennis fans, it's a front-row seat to the blossoming of a rivalry that could define the WTA tour for years to come.

 Can someone please take Alexander Bublik back to the good old days? 

 The Kazakhstani delivered indirect praise of Jakub Mensik in typically humorous fashion on Tuesday during a conversation with chair umpire Mohamed Layani at the Mutua Madrid Open. During his fourth-round match against Mensik, which the #NextGenATP Czech ultimately won 6-3, 6-2, Bublik turned to Layani during a changeover. 

 

 “Mohamed, remember when tennis was easy? Like five years ago it was super easy to play tennis,” said the four-time ATP Tour champion Bublik. “A bunch of random people in the Top 50, barely moving. Now this guy is not even Top 5, not even Top 10. What is that?” 

 Tuesday's straight-sets victory at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid was the latest impressive performance in a breakout 2025 for Mensik. The 19-year-old defeated Novak Djokovic to lift his maiden tour-level title in March in Miami, and he is now up to No. 20 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. If you ask Bublik, he should already be in the Top 10 at the very least.

 Can someone please take Alexander Bublik back to the good old days? 

 The Kazakhstani delivered indirect praise of Jakub Mensik in typically humorous fashion on Tuesday during a conversation with chair umpire Mohamed Layani at the Mutua Madrid Open. During his fourth-round match against Mensik, which the #NextGenATP Czech ultimately won 6-3, 6-2, Bublik turned to Layani during a changeover. 

 

 “Mohamed, remember when tennis was easy? Like five years ago it was super easy to play tennis,” said the four-time ATP Tour champion Bublik. “A bunch of random people in the Top 50, barely moving. Now this guy is not even Top 5, not even Top 10. What is that?” 

 Tuesday's straight-sets victory at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid was the latest impressive performance in a breakout 2025 for Mensik. The 19-year-old defeated Novak Djokovic to lift his maiden tour-level title in March in Miami, and he is now up to No. 20 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. If you ask Bublik, he should already be in the Top 10 at the very least.

In one of the more bizarre scenes to unfold on the professional tennis circuit this year, ATP world No. 407 Svyatoslav Gulin was defaulted during his match against Alejo Sanchez Quilez at an ITF tournament, despite being comfortably ahead (7-5, 3-6, 4-0).

Gulin was leading 4-0 in the deciding third set when the shocking incident occurred. After winning a point — a moment that would typically boost a player's momentum — Gulin inexplicably turned his attention to the chair umpire. Instead of celebrating the point, Gulin pointed directly at the umpire and unleashed a series of obscene gestures, followed by a torrent of verbal abuse with vulgar words such as 'b{expletive} me'.

The chair umpire, adhering to the ITF's strict code of conduct, had little choice but to immediately default Gulin from the match. The decision handed the victory to Sanchez Quilez, leaving Sanchez, fans, and tournament officials stunned by Gulin's outburst.

It remains unclear what triggered Gulin's frustration, especially given that he was in complete control of the match. Incidents of default are rare at the professional level, and typically reserved for the most serious breaches of behavior. Gulin's default joins a short but infamous list of players who have been disqualified for on-court misconduct, highlighting the importance of maintaining composure no matter the circumstances.

The ITF is expected to review the incident and could hand down additional penalties, including possible fines or suspensions. Meanwhile, Gulin will be left to ponder over what could have been an easy third set and a subsequent victory as well as a few hard earned, precious points on the tour.

Roger Federer inspired millions during his time on the ATP Tour, winning 20 Grand Slam singles titles.

The Swiss phenom made his ATP debut in 1998 and won his first tour-level title in Milan just three years later.

Grand Slam success followed shortly after, as Federer won Wimbledon in 2003, taking down Mark Philippoussis in the final.

Before retiring from tennis in 2022, Federer added 19 more Major titles to his collection, more than any male player not named Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal.

With such a wealth of experience, it should come as no surprise that many of Federer's contemporaries dream of adding him to their coaching teams, as one top ten star now reveals his thoughts on the 43-year-old.

Appearing as a guest on the Iguales podcast, world number seven Alex de Minaur was asked to name anyone from the world of tennis he'd like to add to his coaching set-up.

“I think maybe Roger [Federer],” he said.

“He's one of the people I watched on TV when I was growing up. I always admired him, I've always loved the way he played. How easy he made tennis look.

“I had the opportunity to play against him in a final in Basel. He really schooled me, but even so, I enjoyed the moment a lot.”

Federer and De Minaur faced off in their only career meeting in the final of the Basel Open six years ago.

Winning his 103rd and final ATP title, Federer dropped just 18 games all tournament as he celebrated in front of his home fans one last time.

Federer retired from tennis three years later, upon the conclusion of the Laver Cup tournament.

Speaking in an interview after his retirement, the 20-time Major champion was asked whether he'd consider becoming a coach in the future.

“Coaching, I mean, never say never,” said Federer.

“Stefan Edberg said the same, he will never coach, until he got the phone call from me and I invited him over for practice and he said ‘ok, let me try for a year'.

“At the moment, with my four children going to school and everything going on, I don't see myself coaching at the moment. If a junior comes around and he needs some support or advice, I'm happy to do that.”

Federer likely won't be joining De Minaur's coaching team any time soon, but that shouldn't bother the Aussie too much as he continues to climb the rankings.

Coached by Adolfo Gutierrez full time, and both Peter Luczak and Lleyton Hewitt on a part-time basis, the 26-year-old has become well-established in the world's top ten.

In 2025, De Minaur has accumulated the fifth most points of any player on the ATP Tour, clearly outlining his top-five credentials.

He has already recorded some notably impressive performances this year, perhaps none more so than De Minaur's run to the Rotterdam Open final, where he narrowly came up short against Carlos Alcaraz.

Only time will tell if De Minaur's form will continue, and he can break through into the top five later this year.

De Minaur is scheduled to return to action in the third round of the Madrid Open against Denis Shapovalov on Tuesday, April 29.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — From friendly matches in the park to championship-level play,  pickleball has evolved into one of the most premier and popular sports for all ages. 

A recent USA Pickleball annual growth report notes, "Pickleball continued to dominate the headlines in 2024, maintaining its status as the fastest-growing sport in America for the fourth consecutive year."

So, it is no surprise that the sport often intermingles with another racket sport, bringing some of the largest names from tennis to a new court. 

Andre Agassi is a former world No. 1 tennis player and Grand Slam champion who's taking the leap to professional pickleball play. Agassi's name has recently become synonymous with not just tennis, but pickleball too, with appearances in the Pickleball Slam and an endorsement with popular pickler brand JOOLA.

Agassi will team up with teen pro Anna Leigh Waters, who, according to Tennis.com, is "highly regarded at being the greatest women's player of all time," to compete at the Minto U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, Fla.

Waters has 173 Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles matches, with 148 of those titles being gold. 



Agassi and Waters will debut in the mixed doubles category in the tournament running from April 26 to May 3 at East Naples Community Park. The tournament is expected to draw more than 50,000 spectators. 

“We've broken all records this year,” Ben Weinberger, U.S. Open tournament director, told a Cape Coral television station. “We have almost 3,500 competitors from all 50 states and 40 countries."

When announcing their partnership, Agassi had great praise for Waters' success in the sport. 



Waters is the defending women's doubles champion at the U.S. Open.

Their first match is on Wednesday at noon EST. The tournament is airing on CBS Sports Network.

Henry Patten was named Doubles Player of the Year at the prestigious LTA Tennis Awards, presented by Lexus, after claiming his first Grand Slam title on home turf at Wimbledon.

The 28-year-old was honoured at the tenth anniversary of the awards which were held at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton.

The Colchester-native partnered Finnish Harri Heliovaara to lift his first major title at his home Slam and won three ATP titles in the same year.

He took victories in Marrakech, Lyon and Stockholm, helping him to his first call-up for the Davis Cup where he claimed his first victory representing Great Britain against Canada.

"Last year was incredible. Especially winning Wimbledon with my partner, Harri Heliovaara, in front of a home crowd was like a dream,” Patten reflected.

"I was also honoured to represent my country in the Davis Cup - an experience I'll never forget.

"I'd like to thank my coach Calvin and my family for their endless support - without whom none of this would be possible.

“Lastly, thank you to all the fans who have supported me on my journey. I can't wait to play on home turf again this year - see you all in the summer."

The annual LTA Tennis Awards, presented by Lexus, highlight and celebrate the incredible achievements and contributions of people in tennis across Britain.

First launched in 2015 with the help of former LTA president Cathie Sabin OBE, they recognise the vital work of volunteers, coaches, officials, and players dedicating their precious time and energy to the continual development and growth of the sport.

Over the past ten years, the awards have illustrated the depth of service and talent within the tennis community and serve as an inspiration to others to get involved in the game.

The winners, selected from more than 2,000 nominations across 25 different categories, have all been acknowledged for their outstanding contribution to tennis in 2024.

The awards were graced by the presence of tennis royalty as Sue Barker was on hand to present some of the accolades.

“It's great, I've been to the awards before so I know how important they are. It's great that the clubs get so involved and that the LTA supports the clubs because they are getting tennis out to all parts of the country,” said Barker.

“It's lovely that they can come here, be appreciated and also be inspired to go back and continue it, and get rewarded for all the hard work that they've done.

“It was lovely to see so many incredible people and hearing stories of what they've done, how they've changed people's lives. It was a very inspiring evening.”

Nick Kyrgios provided a schedule update and it is an interesting one.

The Australian has not played since the Miami Open, where he lost to Karen Khachanov in his second match.

Kyrgios has struggled with injuries since returning to the tour this season, and they have limited him to just five matches so far.

But the former World number 13 has plans to step back on court soon, at a tournament that has not been a happy hunting ground for him in the past.

Nick Kyrgios has not played since March and each of his matches so far this season have come on hard courts.

But the 2022 Wimbledon finalist plans to compete on clay this season, a surface he has struggled on throughout his career.

On Tuesday Kyrgios took to Instagram to announce that he has plans to compete at the French Open for the first time since 2017.

“Hey guys, it's a couple days after my birthday,” he said. “I'm just getting into training, and getting ready to head to Paris in about three weeks.”

Kyrgios has never been beyond the third round at the clay court Grand Slam, but he has sights set on playing at Roland Garros for the first time in eight years.

Though has stated his desire to compete at the French Open, Kyrgios would need a wildcard to enter the tournament.

Due to his current ranking of 635, Kyrgios cannot enter the French Open main automatically, nor can he enter the qualifiers.

But there is no guarantee that the Grand Slam will give him a wildcard, and the tournament has been criticised in the past for not handing certain players the special direct entry.

For example, in 2024 Dominic Thiem had to enter the qualifiers after the French Open opted against giving him a wildcard, despite reaching successive finals in 2018 and 2019.

They received plenty of criticism for that move, not only for his record at the event but it was his last appearance as a player.

It remains to be seen if Kyrgios will suffer the same fate or if he will be granted the opportunity to step foot on the hallowed Parisian clay once again.

Alexander Zverev has been on the ATP Tour for the last decade.

During his career he has played some of the greatest players of all time and played on the world's biggest stages.

The German has developed a reputation for being one of the world's most consistent players and is one of the toughest players to beat on the ATP Tour.

Alexander Zverev has had varying degrees of success against his rivals, and there is one in particular that he has played more than anyone else.

Zverev has played against many different players throughout his tennis career.

He has faced the likes of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic on multiple occasions, and now battles against Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

But there are many he has faced more times than Daniil Medvedev, and the World number three named the Russian as his biggest rival on tour.

“I played Medvedev the most. I don't necessarily think we played the biggest matches [with] each other in our careers, not the most important matches,” Zverev told the ATP Tour website.

“I think the most important matches in my career [I] have played against Novak, Carlos, Jannik. But me and Medvedev, we played the most against each other.”

Zverev and Medvedev have played one another 19 times on the ATP Tour.

Medvedev has won 12 of those encounters, including six of their last seven matchups.

He was able to turn the rivalry around after losing five of the first six matches in their compelling rivalry.

Arguably their greatest match came at the 2024 Australian Open, which was the last time they faced one another.

Medvedev came from two sets down to reach the final at Melbourne Park, where he suffered the same fate.

Jannik Sinner recovered a two-set deficit to win the first of his two Australian Open titles, and this started this level of success in his career.

Jakub Mensik made headlines in Miami last month, etching his name into the record books as the fifth-youngest player to capture an ATP Masters 1000 title. Just four weeks later, the #NextGenATP Czech is showing that his breakthrough was no one-off, now riding a wave of confidence into the fourth round of the Mutua Madrid Open.

“Miami has given me a big boost of confidence for the tournaments and matches. I don't feel extra pressure with my matches but just have the confidence from it,” Mensik told ATPTour.com in Madrid. “I am still 19 and still learning a lot of things. It is my second year on the Tour and I am very young and the newcomer. Playing against the best players in the world is always what I wanted and now I can see I can compete against them, beat them consistently, it is something I like.”






The Czech teen stunned World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the Miami final, a result that rocketed him to No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings. In Madrid, he's continued his sharp form, ousting Americans Ethan Quinn and Ben Shelton to set a fourth-round clash with Alexander Bublik.
Mensik's rapid ascent may have taken some by surprise, but not the man himself, even though he admits his goals have been checked off faster than expected.
“I wouldn't say I'm surprised by the success,” Mensik said with a smile. “But before the season started, I set a goal to break into the Top 30 this year. It's April and I'm already No. 23 so I have achieved that aim. Last year I set my goals and once again I had reached them by February.”

It's been an impressive rise for the 19-year-old, who last year reached the Doha final, the third round at the US Open and the quarter-finals at the Masters 1000 event in Shanghai. But Miami marked a new level and expectations have raised.
With Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz no longer in the Madrid draw, Mensik could be considered a dark horse contender. Yet he's quick to downplay any suggestion that his Miami title gives him an edge.
“A lot of things have changed since Miami, like my ranking going up. But every week is so tough to win a tournament so now I have won one, I don't think it makes it easier to win another,” Mensik said. “There is still a long way to go in this tournament, so we will see. There is not much difference between title number one and title number two, there is still those similar feelings. When it is between title number one and title number 100, like Novak is trying to achieve, then there is a difference.”

Mensik's rise hasn't been fuelled by flash alone. His game is built on a rock-solid foundation, highlighted by a backhand that's become a calling card. Able to redirect with pace or finesse, it's a shot he's leaned on since his earliest days on court.
“I think a good backhand is a Czech school thing," Mensik said. "A lot of the men have had great backhands especially. Of course I have my favourite shots, and I am not saying I don't like my forehand, it is a good shot as well, but when there are pressure situations, say at 30/30, I trust some shots more and that is then more visible. I might hit that backhand down the line at 30/40. I have always been comfortable on my backhand from a very young age.”
Mensik will continue to impose his aggressive game on his opponents in Madrid, where Bublik is next in the firing line in the fourth round on Tuesday. However, the 19-year-old is keen to not put pressure on himself to deliver again in the Spanish capital.
“It's just the beginning,” Mensik said. “I know there's a lot more to come if I keep working the same way. If I keep giving 100 per cent.”

The Czech teen stunned World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the Miami final, a result that rocketed him to No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings. In Madrid, he's continued his sharp form, ousting Americans Ethan Quinn and Ben Shelton to set a fourth-round clash with Alexander Bublik.

Mensik's rapid ascent may have taken some by surprise, but not the man himself, even though he admits his goals have been checked off faster than expected.

“I wouldn't say I'm surprised by the success,” Mensik said with a smile. “But before the season started, I set a goal to break into the Top 30 this year. It's April and I'm already No. 23 so I have achieved that aim. Last year I set my goals and once again I had reached them by February.”

Former US Open champion Coco Gauff was preparing to shower in a dark locker room after play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended and then postponed because of a major power outage in Spain and Portugal.

Then Gauff realized that the water was off, too.

"So I just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself,: Gauff said on Monday, "and spray some perfume and call it a day."

Gauff managed to beat Belinda Bencic 6-4 6-2 shortly before the outage, which apparently cut off the sound as she was giving a post-match interview on the court.

Then the 2023 US Open champion posted an Instagram story showing only an emergency light working in an otherwise dark locker room.

The ATP Tour said that two singles matches and one doubles match were underway when power went out at 12:34 p.m. local time (1034 GMT).

"The cut is preventing the use of electronic line calling systems and also left a spider cam dangling over the court inside Manolo Santana Stadium," the ATP added.

Tournament organisers said they "had no choice but to suspend/cancel all sporting activity in order to guarantee the safety of the players, fans and personnel." They recommended all spectators leave the sports complex.

The event is scheduled to resume on Tuesday. There will be third-round matches in the top of the draw, and fourth-round matches in the bottom of the draw.

Grigor Dimitrov was leading Jacob Fearnley 6-4 5-4 inside the main stadium when play was stopped. Also, Matteo Arnaldi was leading Damir Dzumhur 6-3 3-2 when play was suspended. That match later continued — apparently with manual line calling — and Arnaldi won 6-3 6-4.

The doubles match was also completed and some players were practicing despite the outage. A a few people remained in the stands to watch.

The blackout brought much of Spain and Portugal to a standstill, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.

Spanish power distributor Red Eléctrica said restoring power to large parts of the country after the outage could take up to 10 hours.

The company declined to speculate on the causes of the blackout.

Gauff also posted a photo of candles being distributed.

"I don't think we're even going to be able to go back to the hotel because the traffic lights are out," Gauff said.

"It's just crazy how much we depend on electricity. It's really insane and puts it in perspective."

Another fourth-round women's match was also completed before the blackout: Mirra Andreeva beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-1 6-4.

Second-ranked Iga Swiatek "sat in the darkened players' lounge, talking with members of her team," ahead of her scheduled match against Diana Shnaider, the WTA Tour said.

Swiatek and Shnaider had been scheduled to play in the main stadium after the Dimitrov-Fearnley match.

Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka had been scheduled to play Peyton Stearns later.

Former Wimbledon doubles champion Max Purcell has been slapped with a suspension. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) have come down hard on the 2022 winner after violating the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme.

The Australian will find himself on the sidelines until at least mid-2026, after being handed an 18-month ban. His suspension has been backdated to last December when he was first pinged for a potential foul.

The ITIA revealed that in December 2023, Purcell crossed the line by undergoing intravenous infusions exceeding 500 millilitres, landing him in hot water. His sanction was reduced by 25 per cent due to his full cooperation with the ITIA. Post-admission, he opted into a voluntary provisional suspension on December 12, 2024, the same day he got wind of the possible breach.

Now he will also have to forfeit any winnings accumulated from December 16, 2023 – the date of his infringement – up to the day a drug test came back clean on February 3, 2024.

Purcell will be banned from playing in, coaching at, or attending any tennis event authorised or sanctioned by the members of the ITIA. These include the ATP, WTA and ITF as well as any national association.

Karen Moorhouse, chief executive of the ITIA, remarked: "This case does not involve a player testing positive for a prohibited substance but demonstrates that the anti-doping rules are broader than that.

"It also shows that the ITIA considers intelligence from a range of sources with the overriding aim to protect everyone covered by the tennis anti-doping rules, and ensure a level playing field for all."

Speaking out on his anti-doping suspension via Instagram, Purcell said: "This case has been going on for months, seriously affecting my quality of life.

"From being unable to sleep and eat properly, and refusing to be by myself, to developing nervous and anxious tics which I still currently battle day to day.

"I couldn't sit and enjoy anything without the thought of the case and the endless possibilities of what sanction I would receive. I was nothing but cooperative with the ITIA. I'm so glad this is finally over for me and I can move on with my life.

"The ITIA accepted that the infusion over the 100ml limit was not intentional. It's a case completely on exceeding the allowable limit of volume for an infusion.

"All substances in the infusion were WADA approved and beyond that, it provided me with zero performance-enhancing benefit. It was 11 days prior to my first match of the season and was also administered as a 24/7 medical facility, in a third world location after feeling unwell and fatigued from training."

Purcell claimed victory at Wimbledon in 2022 with partner Matthew Ebden and then secured last year's US Open title alongside fellow Australian Jordan Thompson.

Wondered Taylor Fritz on X, “Have they tried unplugging and plugging it back in?” The world No. 4 takes on two-time Roland Garros finalist Casper Ruud to close out Tuesday's night session.“I didn't mean this literally…...,” Peyton Stearns wrote on X two days after posting “What's done in the dark comes to the light.” The former NCAA champion meets Aryna Sabalenka ahead of the Fritz-Ruud clash.

Alex de Minaur, who notably revealed a low screen time usage when Tennis Channel asked players to share at this year's Miam Open, was naturally unfazed.“Don't mind this off the grid thing,” he began with three 😂. “On the third walk of the day and finally got some service to check on the rest of the world.”Fiancée Katie Boulter was less than impressed, however.“Imagine blaming a country blackout for not texting me back all day,” she replied to the Australian on X before declaring, “Elite 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 behavior”

Esteban Ocon has opened up on his experiences so far of working with new race engineer Laura Mueller at Haas, with the Frenchman praising her for the “very impressive” number of hours she puts in as they look to improve the performance of the car.

Ahead of Ocon's switch to the team following his departure from Alpine at the end of 2024, it was announced that Mueller had been promoted from her position as Performance Engineer at Haas to Race Engineer, making her the first full-time female to take the role in F1.

Team Principal Ayao Komatsu spoke at the time of Mueller's “determined character”, a factor that he felt would match well with Ocon's personality – and, during an appearance on the Beyond The Grid podcast, Ocon similarly hailed Mueller's work ethic as he discussed how they have been working together so far.

“It's been great to work with Laura,” said Ocon. “She's really a great engineer. She's been having a lot of experience in a lot of different categories. She's done DTM, I've done DTM, so we have that point in common. But she did a lot of different categories, and her trajectory is very impressive.

“She's awesome to work with. The amount of hours she puts in is very, very impressive. She doesn't count hours.”

Ocon went on to share an example of this that occurred during the Japanese Grand Prix, a weekend that proved to be a challenging one for the Haas driver.

“I remember in Suzuka, we had a difficult one, but we were still having meetings and debriefs because it was not the way we wanted to have the performance and she didn't stand up to take a sandwich or drink for probably the whole day,” Ocon explained.

“She was like, ‘Esteban, I will probably go and take a food now because it's 7.30 or 8 in the evening.' And I'm like, ‘You didn't eat yet?' And she's like, ‘No', because she didn't want to because she was flat-out with work.”

While his campaign so far has posed challenges like those faced at Suzuka, Ocon feels that he has been adapting well to his new environment at Haas following his five-year stint with Alpine.

Ocon has been impressed by Mueller's work ethic since they began working together

“First impression of the team is a big family,” the 28-year-old said. “This team really has welcomed me, in such a way that I just felt at home straight away. It's really a fresh start for me. I feel that I'm integrating super well with everyone and everyone is hungry and motivated to deliver.

“They are proud of everything that they do when they do it. That's great because if you're not proud of the job you do, then there's no point doing it. It's honestly fantastic to be part of such a team and to be able, hopefully, to progress further this year.

“As an atmosphere, the family kind of feel, it's very much like the Force India days, but it doesn't feel small. This team feels like a big team in a way of what they are achieving. When we need something, it comes quicker than what I've been experiencing in the past.

“Ayao could tell you a lot of things about where we could improve, but it doesn't feel like we are small because the quality of the job that's been done is very impressive. It doesn't feel like we lack people because everybody's trying to accommodate me in the best way possible.”

Zak Brown has predicted that Oscar Piastri is “only going to get stronger” as the new leader of the championship, with the McLaren CEO also looking forward to seeing the Australian engage in an “epic battle” on track with team mate Lando Norris in the near future.

After previously taking victories in China and Bahrain, Piastri continued his strong run of form by claiming a third win of the season in Saudi Arabia, a result that also put the 24 year old at the top of the Drivers' standings with a tally of 99 points – 10 clear of Norris in second, while Max Verstappen is 12 points behind Piastri in third.

This also means that Piastri is the first Australian to head the championship in 15 years, with the last to hold that position being his manager, Mark Webber.

Speaking to F1 TV following the race in Jeddah, Brown was quizzed on whether becoming the leader rather than the chaser may adjust Piastri's mindset at all, to which he responded: “I'm here to announce to everyone [that] I think he's only going to get stronger.”

Brown then faced questions on what this could mean for Norris, who put in a recovery drive in Saudi Arabia to cross the line in fourth after crashing out of Saturday's Qualifying session during Q3.

“We've got our two number ones,” Brown said of the drivers' shared status within the team. “I think they're equal, they race each other hard. I think we've yet to see them really have an epic battle – I think that day's coming, I'm looking forward to it.

“They race hard, they race clean, so I know everyone's waiting for that big moment. I think it's going to be a bit of a non-event for us internally.

“We know it's more of a when than an if. We have two great Grand Prix drivers racing hard, next to each other the majority of the time – something's going to happen, but that's racing, so I'm excited.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: One of the most famous streets in TV history is ready to welcome new residents. Wisteria Lane, a reimagining of the hit ABC mystery dramedy series Desperate Housewives, has been set up for development at Onyx Collective, Deadline has learned. It comes from Kerry Washington‘s Simpson Street and 20th Television where the company is based.


	Written by Natalie Chaidez (The Flight Attendant), Wisteria Lane is described as a fun, sexy, darkly comedic soap/mystery in the vein of Desperate Housewives, set among a group of five very different friends and sometimes frenemies who all live on a picture-perfect cul de sac called “Wisteria Lane.” On the surface, all the Wisteria neighbors are living the dream: beautiful homes, gorgeous families, shiny SUVs in the driveway. But behind those white-picket fences and smiling Insta posts are SECRETS.

	











Desperate Housewives starred Teri Hatcher, Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross and, for the first five seasons, Nicollette Sheridan as five women — mostly friends — living on Wisteria Lane, who begin uncovering dark secrets after their neighbor Mary Alice Young kills herself.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Chaidez executive produces Wisteria Lane alongside Washington and Pilar Savone via their Simpson Street as well as Stacey Sher (Into the Badlands) through her Shiny Penny. It is unclear whether Washington could potentially appear on the show. 20th TV, which recently absorbed Desperate Housewives studio ABC Studios' successor ABC Signature, is producing. 


Desperate Housewives creator/executive producer Marc Cherry was not part of the pitch but could be involved in the project in some capacity, sources said. 


	I hear Wisteria Lane was pitched to both Onyx, whose shows stream on Hulu, and Hulu Originals. Washington and Savone have an existing relationship at both Disney units. Simpson Street is behind Onyx's most successful series to date, Reasonable Doubt, which has been renewed for a third season, as well as Onyx's comedy series UnPrisoned, starring Washington and Delroy Lindo, which ran for two seasons. At Hulu proper, Simpson Street produced with Hello Sunshine the Emmy-nominated limited series Little Fires Everywhere, which also starred Washington.


	Hulu already has two other series reboots in the work from 20th TV, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Prison Break, both with pilot orders. 

	











Wisteria Lane‘s sale comes on the heels of Desperate Housewives‘ 20th anniversary last October, which brought on a new wave of nostalgia and reboot talk.


	In November, Cherry admitted that “about 70,000 people” have asked him about a reboot as fans' passion about the show and interest in revisiting it remains strong 13 years after it ended its eight-season run on ABC. The cast have been fielding endless inquiries too, with Longoria saying earlier this month that she “would be the first person” to sign up for a Desperate Housewives reboot. There are no current plans for characters from the original series to appear on Wisteria Lane.


	While speculation about a potential Desperate Housewives follow-up — revival, reboot, sequel, spinoff or other offshoot — has been rampant for more than a decade, this marks the first real stab at expanding the franchise.


	Keeping the original series' iconic setting makes sense — while most series' outdoor locations use a mix of exteriors from different places, Wisteria Lane is a real street built on the Universal backlot. While the outdoor set had existed for decades as Colonial Street, it was extensively modified for Desperate Housewives and has since taken on a life of its own. Kept virtually the same as in the show, it has remained a top tourist attraction and part of the Universal Studios Tour and has been used for numerous shows and commercials since.


	While Wisteria Lane is expected to keep its fictional street locale, it has not been determined whether the potential series will film in Los Angeles where the original series' outdoor set is.


	In November, Cherry spoke about Wisteria Lane's significance to the show. 


	“The character I miss writing the most is actually Wisteria Lane; that was the most fun playground anyone in the history of television has ever had,” he told People at the time, noting that he would be interested in revisiting the street and its housewives in a different decade, notably the 1960s, for a follow-up to his original series.


	Launching the same season as fellow hit ABC series Lost and Grey's Anatomy, Desperate Housewives was an instant smash, becoming a pop-culture obsession and introducing an addictive new genre that mixes comedy and drama, mystery and soapy storytelling. The series also scored with critics and earned seven Emmy Awards throughout its run, including Lead Actress In a Comedy Series for Huffman.


	Later this spring, Simpson Street will begin production on the Apple TV+ limited series Imperfect Women, starring Washington, Elisabeth Moss and Kate Mara. In May, the company will theatrically release the action-thriller feature Shadow Force for Lionsgate, starring Washington alongside Omar Sy. The company is repped by CAA, Washington Square Arts and attorney Gretchen Rush.


	Prior to serving as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside developer Steve Yockey on Season 2 of Max's The Flight Attendant, whose mix of dark comedy-drama and mystery-thriller is similar to Desperate Housewives‘, Chaidez was an executive producer and showrunner on USA Network's crime drama Queen of the South. Her series credits also include Hunters, which she developed; 12 Monkeys; In Plain Sight; Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles; and Heroes. She is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.


	In addition to the Buffy and Prison Break reboot pilots at Hulu, 20th TV has a Malcolm In the Middle four-part sequel at Disney+, with efforts to get a Scrubs reboot off the ground also underway.

Indian audiences indeed got to watch “Sinners” — just not the way the rest of the world did. And one scene especially irked moviegoers. 

This hallucinatory sequence takes place at the midpoint inside Club Juke, when Sammie's (Miles Caton) soul-stirring blues music becomes so transcendental that it conjures the spirits of the past and future. The guests rejoice, drinks in hand, while puffing on cigarettes. But in Indian cinemas, this immersive sequence gets interrupted — not by a vampire, but a certain disclaimer in an oversized font, stating, “Smoking and alcohol consumption are injurious to health.”

 










These health warnings are enforced by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board, due to a government mandate. The statutory film certification body, under the Indian government, has the authority to suggest cuts and edits to movies before clearing a film for release. On scrutinizing the CBFC certificate available in the public domain, observant cinephiles even noticed that the film's running time was almost two minutes longer than its original global version of 137 minutes in Indian theaters. And no, Indian audiences did not get to watch a director's cut.

Again, the extra time is due to government-mandated graphic anti-smoking ads that play before the film begins and during the intermission (yes, all Hollywood movies in Indian theaters face a forced intermission). What makes this concern even more puzzling is that “Sinners” already carries an “adult” certificate in India, directly implying that children aren't permitted. So, who exactly are the disclaimers targeting? Adults who could be influenced by Smoke and Stack's (Michael B. Jordan) vices, if it weren't for these jarring warnings?

Celebrated Indian filmmaker Anurag Kashyap (“Gangs of Wasseypur,” “Dev.D”) told IndieWire, “In a mood piece such as ‘Sinners,' these disclaimers on smoking and drinking yank the audience out of the immersive experience that the filmmaker had painstakingly created, killing the mood and build-up in the process.”

Recent releases such as “Drop,” “Black Bag,” “Novocaine,” and “Warfare” have received similar treatment in Indian theaters. Nitin Datar, president of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association, India (COEAI), said, “The guidelines, including the disclaimers, are mandated by the CBFC and are compulsory for the producers and directors to follow. Usually, it is the producers who insert such disclaimers, not exhibitors. These public service announcements (PSAs) are usually sourced from government agencies.”

 










Look at this! The advisory is almost 20% of the screen and bigger than the subtitles! Despite this, they blurred out bottle labels and muted all the cuss words out for what is clearly an A rated film. This is a joke. pic.twitter.com/KT9uy1vKnU

At a time when global filmmakers are luring cinema-goers back into the theaters, amid massive competition from streaming platforms, is there a need to disrupt their experience by altering a director's vision in the name of a government-regulated PSA?

Kashyap famously took India's Censor Board to court when it demanded that these very disclaimers be embedded in his film “Ugly.” “I argued that it was a fundamental threat to artistic expression. The case dragged on, and, eventually, we had to abandon the fight and release it after our film got pirated. A filmmaker uses visuals, music, and nuance to create something for the audience to immerse in. And before they could even enter that world, a jarring ad ruins the experience,” Kashyap said.

Acclaimed actress and director Konkona Sen Sharma echoed a similar frustration. “There is often misogyny, sexism, crime, and violence (including violence against women) shown in films, which are far more problematic. Yet, we don't see warnings that say, ‘Violence is injurious to health.' We are burdened with disclaimers in films that already carry an ‘adult' certification from the CBFC. Aren't adults, who are legally allowed to vote, not equipped to handle fictional portrayals of characters smoking, without warnings flashed on screen?”

 










Sen Sharma is no stranger to the demands of the Censor Board, either. Even her critically lauded film “A Death in the Gunj” was subjected to cuts by the CBFC despite receiving an “adult” certificate, including a scene where a child merely picks up a cigarette and smells it. “I had already self-censored the scene during the writing phase. Originally, the child was supposed to pretend to smoke without actually lighting the cigarette, but I changed the scene to evade potential cuts. Such restrictions take away artistic nuance and strip away creative freedom,” said Sen Sharma.

Filmmaker Krishna D.K. (one half of the famous Raj & DK duo, plus films “The Family Man,” “Citadel: Honey Bunny”) noted that when a smoking warning pops up in Indian theaters during a key scene, your attention shifts. “I have seen the warnings appear even before the cigarette is visible. Over time, Indian audiences have gotten accustomed to it,” Krishna D.K. said.

However, over time, resistance to this kind of disruption has steadily faded. Kashyap puts it bluntly, “We've fought for reform, but nothing changes. Most producers and policymakers don't care about aesthetics. Everyone, including the CBFC, is too scared of a potential outrage. What if someone takes offense, is a sentiment that lingers on.”

 










Sen Sharma, however, advocates for an age-based rating system rather than outright censorship, where the government gets to decide what the audience should and should not watch. She said, “If PSAs are crucial, a healthy compromise would be to show them at the beginning. List all the concerns (smoking, drinking, nudity) before the start of the film. After that, let the audience watch the movie without any distractions.” Mentioning how watching “Oppenheimer” with incessant “no smoking” disclaimers hindered his theatrical experience, Krishna D.K. echoes Sen Sharma's views, adding, “Already, Indians are reading subtitles while watching foreign films; they do not need more text on screen to process.”

Journalist Aroon Deep, who closely tracks CBFC certifications, gave more context. “The alcohol warnings, however, are relatively recent and also speculative because there is no legal requirement for them to be inserted. The CBFC proactively added on its own accord. Indians, therefore, have to endure two layers of interruptions — one for tobacco and another for alcohol. And Hollywood movies such as ‘Sinners,' ‘The Bikeriders,' and ‘The Brutalist' have had to face the wrath of it.” 

Woody Allen famously refused to release “Blue Jasmine” in India over these disclaimers. Instead of complying, he preferred to skip India's theatrical market entirely. Even the Oscar-winning “Anora” went straight to streaming. Krishna D.K. feels that skipping releases in a growing market such as India over such disclaimers may not make complete business sense, adding, “Every country has its share of cultural nuances, and filmmakers do make certain compromises. For example, a dubbed movie is not a direct representation of a director's original intent; yet we accept it.”

 










“Sinners” isn't the first film saddled with statutory warnings. Even the works of auteurs Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan have not been spared. In one of the world's largest movie markets, even an unlit cigarette lying harmlessly on a coffee table could trigger a warning, forcing viewers to wonder if they paid to watch a Ryan Coogler film or a health lecture with popcorn.

Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said.

In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen.

“I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. “No matter what happens with PK and I, he's always been my best friend, my husband, we're family. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.”

A post shared by PK (@paul_kemsley_pk)

In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began.

Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. But when he was invited to attend the reunion taping, he declined and sent a statement instead.

Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion.

“I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com.

“Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. “That statement is both heartbreaking and false. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.”

“Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. “Many have wanted to speak out, but I have asked them not to because the truth should never need a champion. I refused to stoke a fire I did not ignite. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. That woman embodied kindness, integrity, and grace. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.”

A post shared by Dorit Kemsley (@doritkemsley)

PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. Am I correct?” Dorit responded that she was wrong.

In a confessional, Kemsley explained, “There are times that I think PK's the greatest father in the world. But is he the most hands-on father? The truth is, no. He would disappear and be gone for weeks and weeks without even calling the kids. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.”

Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. She explained that her comment came as she was still reeling from a multi-page email her ex had sent her.

Speaking with Rollacoaster, Kemsley said she never wants to go  “toe to toe” with PK.

“I know his feelings about what I had said in the moment about him not being a great dad, I not only apologized to him, but I – in my confessional and in the after show – immediately took it back and explained that this is after a couple of months of not speaking, I was really worried about the kids,” she explained. “I felt very, very bad. It was in a weak, vulnerable moment after a seven-page vicious email. You can only take the high road for so long.”

While her marital problems are still being sorted out, Kemsley said she is looking forward to her next chapter. “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.

Andrew Karpen, the founder and CEO of indie distributor Bleecker Street, the former co-CEO of Focus Features, and an all-around icon as an indie film executive, has died. He was 59. 

Karpen died on Monday, April 28. In 2024, he had been diagnosed with a form of brain cancer called glioblastoma, detailing the extent and severity of his condition in a piece in Deadline. 

“Our industry has lost a giant” said Kent Sanderson, Bleecker Street's President and Andrew's longtime friend. “Andrew taught us all so much, foremost of which is the value of kindness, honesty, and family above all else. His leadership and courage will inspire all of us at Bleecker Street for the rest of our lives.”

Karpen founded Bleecker Street as a New York City-based independently financed studio in August 2014, having released more than 75 films including titles like “Logan Lucky,” “Leave No Trace,” “The Assistant,” “Rumours,” “Mass,” “The Starling Girl,” “Captain Fantastic,” “Trumbo,” “Hard Truths,” and many more. Karpen navigated Bleecker through the industry disruption of Covid and other immense changes from streaming after having previously served as the co-CEO of Focus Features. 

Karpen had joined Focus in 2002 as COO before being promoted to president in 2006. He was responsible for the company's finance, operations, and strategic planning and with his promotion added domestic marketing, publicity, and distribution, and he also handled the international sales and distribution arm for Focus. Prior to joining Focus, Karpen spent time at Oxygen Media as Senior Vice President, Finance & Planning and began his career in the industry at Miramax Films.

Karpen holds an MBA from New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Washington University's School of Business. He is a trustee for BAFTA New York and a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.

Andrew is survived by his wife Pam, his sons Josh and Zack, his daughter Sloan, and Josh's wife Kristen who is expecting their first child. Andrew was born on April 18, 1966 and recently celebrated his 59th birthday. The family would appreciate donations made in Karpen's name to the Lenox Hill Brain Tumor Center or Fairfield County Hospice House.

Ahead of a new planned universe, users will be able to begin linking their Epic and MyDisney accounts as the companies launch the 'Galactic Battle' season.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The Walt Disney Co. and Epic Games are deepening their partnership, as the companies continue to move along with plans to launch an entirely new playable world based on Disney IP.


	That will include letting players link their Epic Games accounts to their myDisney accounts, which will set players up for future experiences (users that link their accounts will also get a special stormtrooper skin). And in a first for both companies, Disney will debut the first two episodes from an upcoming Star Wars animated series inside Fortnite days before it is released on Disney+.

Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld debuts on Disney+ May 4, but will be available to view on a Star Wars Watch Party island inside Fortnite beginning May 2, the company says. Players on the island can also battle enemies while they watch.

Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld is an animated anthology series from Dave Filoni that focuses on the criminal underbelly of the Star Wars universe. You can watch a trailer below:


	But first, Epic will roll out an entirely new Star Wars themed season called Fortnite: Galactic Battle, beginning May 2.


	“For the first time, Disney+ is premiering a show inside a game, launching alongside our largest Star Wars collaboration with Fortnite to date – giving fans and players an exciting first look at the kinds of experiences they can expect as we shape a new future together,” says Sean Shoptaw, executive vp of Disney Games & Digital Entertainment. “We're building the next era of digital entertainment, where fans can play, watch, create and connect – and we're just beginning to tap into what's possible.”


	“Disney and Epic are pioneering the future of social entertainment together, and this expansive Star Wars collaboration offers a glimpse into the type of interactive experiences we envision,” added Epic Games president Adam Sussman. “We are reimagining what's possible with immersive storytelling in Fortnite with one of the world's most beloved franchises – stay tuned for a lot more to come.” 


	A little over a year ago, Disney announced a $1.5 billion investment in Epic, with plans to build its new in-game universe with Disney IP. While the specifics of that universe and when it will launch remain under wraps for now, Disney and Epic have partnered to bring IP like Star Wars and Marvel to Fortnite already.

	











	That includes playable characters in Fortnite, but also some exclusive video: In 2019, Fortnite players were able to watch an exclusive clip from The Rise of Skywalker.


	In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter last year, Disney experiences chairman Josh D'Amaro framed the Epic Games deal as being about the future of the company, comparing the push to Walt Disney's own sense of risk-taking.


	“We envision essentially a universe that we're going to build where all our stories can come to life,” D'Amaro said. “They can come to life in different forms, [like] games. They can come to life in ways that you can just interact with and play with the franchise in a way that's meaningful to you, a place where you can actually build,” he adds. “And we think that this is going to be a place where all fans can come and interact 365 days a year.”

Dexter: Resurrection takes place weeks after Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) takes a bullet to the chest from his own son, as he awakens from a coma to find Harrison (Jack Alcott) gone without a trace. Realizing the weight of what he put his son through, Dexter sets out for New York City, determined to find him and make things right. But closure won't come easily. When Miami Metro's Angel Batista (David Zayas) arrives with questions, Dexter realizes his past is catching up to him fast. As father and son navigate their darkness in the city that never sleeps, they soon find themselves deeper than they ever imagined—and that the only way out is together.

Neil Patrick Harris, Krysten Ritter, Eric Stonestreet, and David Dastmalchian will guest star as Lowell, Mia, Al, and Gareth, respectively. New Blood‘s David Magidoff will return to the role of Teddy Reed from the Iron Lake Police Department. In late March, we confirmed John Lithgow and Jimmy Smits would also return to the universe as The Trinity Killer, Arthur Mitchell, and Miguel Prado, respectively.


Dexter: Resurrection is executive produced by Clyde Phillips, who also returns to serve as showrunner, and produced by Showtime Studios and Counterpart Studios. Michael C. Hall also serves as executive producer along with Scott Reynolds, Tony Hernandez, and Lilly Burns, with Marcos Siega serving as producing director.

The Austin-based conference has new leadership in place.


													By
												

	Marc Schneider


Industry News Editor


Hugh Forrest is out at South By Southwest, four months after assuming leadership of the music, tech and film conference, following a decision by the SXSW board to select Penske Media Corporation executive Jenny Connelly to lead the festival, Billboard has learned.


	Connelly, a longtime executive vp of product and technology at PMC and a SXSW board member, has been appointed director in charge of the annual event in Austin. Consequently, Forrest was offered the opportunity to retain his titles as president and chief programming officer, reporting to Connelly in her new role, according to PMC. “When Hugh was told he wasn't going to get the CEO role at SXSW, and would be reporting to her, Hugh made the decision to leave SXSW,” said the spokesperson for PMC, which has had control of SXSW for two years and is also Billboard‘s parent company.


	Since joining PMC in late 2017, Connelly has overseen multiple teams responsible for engineering, data, IT, product and SEO, and also leads the subscriptions and email teams. Pre-PMC, Connelly was senior vp of product at Dreamworks NOVA, tasked with bringing that company's 3D imaging technology to other industries. Earlier, she spent seven-plus years at Live Nation Entertainment, rising to senior vp of digital at Live Nation Studios.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Connelly is based in Los Angeles but has begun traveling to Austin on a weekly basis, the company said.


	“I'm happy to announce that after 3+ years on the SXSW board of directors, I'm now working as Director in Charge of SXSW,” she said in a social post on Tuesday (April 29), adding she's “working with a killer group of dedicated, creative & skilled people who throw the world's most influential festival. We are dreaming up the evolution of this event, so that SXSW never stops helping creative people achieve their goals.”


	Several other key moves were announced Friday (April 25) during a company town hall as part of ongoing succession planning at the festival, the PMC rep said, along with additional promotions for festival veterans Peter Lewis, Greg Rosenbaum and Brian Hobbs. The organization said it has several open jobs to fill at SXSW.


	Forrest declined to comment on last week's chain of events when reached by Billboard but remarked in a statement over the weekend that “leaving South by Southwest was definitely not my decision,” adding, “I put my heart and soul into this event for more than 35 years, and I was looking forward to leading several more editions.”


	Forrest joined SXSW in 1989, when it was in its nascent stage, and spent the bulk of his tenure as chief programming officer. In 2022, he was promoted to co-president alongside then-chief brand officer Jann Baskett, succeeding the retiring CEO Roland Swenson. Forrest became the sole president late last year following Baskett's departure to start her own consultancy.


	As president, Forrest had been tasked with driving business growth and collaborating closely with the event's board of directors, which includes co-founder Swenson, Jay Penske (CEO of Penske Media and SXSW's largest shareholder) and Amy Webb (CEO of the Future Today Institute), among others.


	The company told Billboard that the 2025 edition achieved the highest sponsorship revenue in the event's history, while the SXSW EDU conference had its best turnout since its 2011 founding.


	The Austin Chronicle hinted at a wider staffing shakeup at SXSW, reporting on Saturday (April 26) that “another 10 or more staff members … have left the company, either through previously planned departures or unexpectedly.” One departure, James Minor, the vp and head of music at the conference, was one of those planned exits. Minor told the Austin American-Statesman on Sunday he “already had plans to leave SXSW in motion for the fall.”


	Founded in 1987 by Swenson, Nick Barbaro, Louis Black and Louis Jay Meyers, SXSW has grown into a globally influential event in Austin, which also now includes satellite events like the two-year-old SXSW Sydney and the upcoming debut of SXSW London, which launches in June. Swenson, who led SXSW for 36 years, transitioned to executive chairman in 2022.


	The leadership change follows a recent announcement that next year's conference will be on the shorter side, running from March 12-18, with interactive, film/TV and music programs happening concurrently. The reduction in days — and by extension, the number of showcasing music artists and shows — is due to the $1.6 billion redevelopment of the Austin Convention Center, which is underway. The new center, expected to open in 2029, will nearly double its size and focus on accessibility and sustainability. “A shorter SX gives attendees more of a chance to be here for the entire run,” a spokesperson told Billboard at the time.


Note: Billboard's parent company PMC is the largest shareholder of SXSW and its brands are official media partners of SXSW.

The Gotham Television Awards are recognizing the buzziest series of the year. IndieWire can announce the 2025 nominees, including “Adolescence,” “The Pitt,” and “The Studio.” The Gotham Television Awards ceremony will take place Monday, June 2 in New York City at Cipriani Wall Street.

“Building on the success of last year's inaugural ceremony, the Gotham Television Awards returns with new categories, expanded tributes, and a larger stage to celebrate the creators and artists making their mark on today's television landscape,” Jeffrey Sharp, Executive Director of The Gotham, said. “As the first awards show of the new television season, we are proud to bring together the industry's most exciting new voices, celebrate breakthrough achievements, and deepen our commitment to supporting the creative community.”

Kathy Bates, Sterling K. Brown, Ted Danson, Linda Lavin, Cristin Milioti, and Michelle Williams are among the actors recognized in the genderless categories. The second annual awards ceremony will also include the inaugural category of Outstanding Original Film, Broadcast or Streaming to honor original features that first aired during the eligibility period on television (network, basic cable, pay cable, pay television, pay-per-view, interactive cable, broadband) or digital distribution through streaming platforms. That includes the Peacock release of “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,” which, alas, was never in theaters stateside.

The Gotham TV Awards nominees were selected by committees of film and television critics, journalists, festival programmers, and film curators, including IndieWire's own Kate Erbland and Ben Travers. Separate juries of writers, directors, actors, producers, editors, and others directly involved in making television will determine the final Gotham Television Awards recipients. 

Tributes will be given to Amy Sherman Palladino, Daniel Palladino, Hwang Dong-hyuk, and more that will be announced in the coming weeks.

The Gotham TV Awards began in 2024, with “Baby Reindeer,” “Colin from Accounts,” “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” and “Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show” among the top winners. Mariska Hargitay, Peter Morgan, and Lulu Wang also received career tributes.

EXCLUSIVE: Jessica Alba (Trigger Warning) has signed on to lead action thriller The Mark, a spy flick set to begin production in Australia in July.


	In the film from director Justin Chadwick (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom), Alba plays Eden, an enigmatic spy on a covert and dangerous mission. When Eden pulls single father Ben Dawson into her world of high-stakes espionage, his life is turned upside down. Mistaken for the world's deadliest assassin, Ben becomes the perfect decoy for Eden. She uses the mix-up to expose a powerful network of corrupt politicians, placing Ben in the crosshairs of the CIA, Interpol, and ruthless crime syndicates. With enemies closing in from all sides, Eden must keep Ben alive long enough to complete her mission — while Ben must summon his inner action hero to stay alive and return to the person who matters most: his daughter.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	How do you follow the Avengers? Simple, according to Marvel. Just put together a ragtag bunch of antiheroes culled from past franchise entries and turn them into a not-ready-for-primetime fighting team forced to save America and — presto! — you have the Thunderbolts — though with a, uh, asterisk in the title, which cheekily means the Avengers we know and love and miss just weren't available for superheroics this time around.


	Actually, by putting that “*” in the title, Marvel lets us instantly know they are in on the joke, but in giving these supporting players from past movies like Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Falcon & The Winter Soldier and most notably Black Widow, they have high hopes to develop something seen as much more than just a 99 Cents Only Store version of the crown jewel of the Marvel Universe. As such, this origin story of how the Thunderbolts came to be manages to stand on its own as a more character-driven, humorous and psychological spin on the formula that has worked so well for Disney‘s money-printing subsidiary in the past.

	











	It all starts with Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), torn still with grappling with her past as the adoptive sister of Black Widow, jumping off the world's second-tallest building and living to tell the tale. She is recruited by CIA head and OXE Group's villainous Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to perform a simple assignment and go into the OXE vault to hunt down an adversary causing trouble. Turns out it is a set-up when disgraced John Walker (Wyatt Russell) of Falcon and the Winter Soldier fame, Ghost aka Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen) of Ant-Man, and Taskmaster aka Antonia (Olga Kurylenko), decked out in a new suit) also turn up for a pop-up superhero fight that is really a trap to get rid of them all. Into this mayhem comes a pajama-clad newcomer, the nerdy, seemingly clueless Bob aka Robert Reynolds (Lewis Pullman) who has somehow stumbled in from a mysterious medical procedure he has just endured and can't understand what he is doing with all these masked marvels. Do they all eventually get out of there? Of course, and the game is on.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Joining up will be good ol' Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), now a freshman congressman determined to fight the baddies (including Valentina) from the inside (but like Michael in The Godfather Part III he is pulled back in just when he thought he was out) and the wildcard Alexei (David Harbour), picking up some of the group in his Red Guardian car as they are chased by imposing tanks down a highway.

	











	Valentina, set on controlling the government her way, now has to deal with this damaged group of throwaway superhero wannabes, and may have her own secret weapon in the aforementioned Bob and that medical procedure, which has turned him into an imposing presence that is capable of more destruction and harm than all of these newly coined Thunderbolts combined. When Val introduces her “creation” complete with fancy superhero suit, he demonstrates on them just how lethal his newfound powers can be. However, like each of them, Bob, now dubbed Sentry, is every bit as troubled and still grateful for having been saved in the vault.


	We will stop there because this is all just an intriguing setup for the tight two-hour film's second half and the destruction of New York City among other things. Director Jack Schreier, who was imported from the Netflix limited series Beef, is more interested in the “human” elements here than a lot of fancy CGI trickery Marvel has been so fond of in the past, so there is much to uncover as this group of antiheroes, not seeing themselves as “heroes” at all, deal with issues of trust, betrayal and just who they really are. It is a smart and amusing script by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, an origin story inspired of course by the 1997 comic but quite different and one that could go to intriguing places in future installments and the already announced new editions of the Avengers franchise. The end credits promise a return of course, but by what name? Hmmmmm.


	Fortunately, in pure Hollywood fashion, these past supporting stars rise to the occasion and get their chance to shine. Chief among them is Pugh, bringing real gravitas to Yelena in a darker portrayal than what she did in Black Widow. Stan finds new ways into Bucky/Winter Soldier now on his 10th go-round with the character, Russell really gets much to do here in a comeback for John Walker, as do Kurylenko and John-Kamen. Harbour, as he did in Black Widow, is here mostly for comic relief, relishing in his over-the-top antics, and newcomer to the franchise Pullman makes the most of a nerd-turned-dangerous superhero, or antihero as all of them really are. He is a guy who is not quite comfortable in the suit. How he will fit in eventually is one of the most interesting aspects of this new-age Thunderbolts. Also new to Marvel is the character of Mel, Valentina's assistant who is working both sides, and nicely played by Geraldine Viswanathan.


	As for Louis-Dreyfus, there is just a touch of Veep‘s Selina Meyer in her sly portrayal of a woman with a thirst for power. The blonde streak in her hair also uncannily makes her look like Louis-Dreyfus has gone back to her SNL self to spoof current U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, though this was in the can long before Gabbard got the job, so this character touch seems pretty prescient especially in the scene where she is testifying to congress just as Gabbard recently did over Signalgate.


	The producer, of course, is Kevin Feige.

Benito Skinner is bringing the drama to Prime Video with his  semi-autobiographical comedy series “Overcompensating.” Skinner, AKA Benny Drama, makes his TV debut with the star-studded series that he  writes, executive produces, and acts in. The college-set show centers on former football player and homecoming king Benny (Skinner) whose journey as a closeted gay man leads to “horrible hookups, flavored vodka, and fake IDs,” as the logline teases. 

The official synopsis reads: “Benny becomes fast friends with Carmen (Wally Baram), a high school outsider on a mission to fit in at all costs. With guidance from Benny's older sister (Mary Beth Barone) and her campus-legend boyfriend (Adam DiMarco), Benny and Carmen juggle horrible hookups, flavored vodka, and fake IDs. Deeply funny and personal, the show explores the lengths to which we all overcompensate while on the path to finding out who we really are.”

“Overcompensating” also stars Connie Britton, Kyle MacLachlan, Corteon Moore, Owen Thiele, Nell Verlaque, Tomaso Sanelli, and Rish Shah. Guest stars include Megan Fox, Bowen Yang, Lukas Gage, Matt Rogers, James Van Der Beek, Didi Conn, Rachel Matthews, Danielle Perez, Boman Martinez Reid, and Yasmine Sahid. Previously announced guests are Andrea Martin, Kaia Gerber, Julia Shiplett, Tommy Do, Alexandra Beaton, Claire Qute, Elias Azimi, Maddie Phillips and Charli XCX, who also serves as the executive music producer and executive producer. 

“Overcompensating” is produced by A24, Strong Baby, and Amazon MGM Studios. Scott King serves as showrunner and executive producer. Jonah Hill, Matt Dines, and Ali Goodwin executive produce for Strong Baby. All eight episodes will debut May 15 on Prime Video.

Skinner previously starred in Chelsea Peretti's “First Time Female Director.” The multihyphenate told Vanity Fair that he created “Overcompensating” to reflect the modern coming out experience.

“I really wanted queer people to see their experience and the complicatedness of that experience,” Skinner, who teased at least a four season series arc, said. “Not that I don't think that exists, but I just feel like every time it was so much more complicated to come out than I've seen. […] I feel like the villain of the show in a lot of ways is this addiction to masculinity. I think that everyone feels that, not just queer people.”

 










“Overcompensating” premieres May 15 on Prime Video. Check out the trailer below.

Ben Affleck thinks “Armageddon” gave us the “best work” of his Oscar-winning career… just not in the way you might think. Affleck said while visiting the Criterion Closet in the below video that his commentary track for the infamous 1998 Michael Bay film is iconic in and of itself. 

Affleck infamously cited plot holes during the DVD commentary for the film and even quipped that director Bay didn't mind that the space-centric disaster film had a nonsensical plot. According to Affleck, Bay even told him to “shut the fuck up” for questioning the logic of the film.

 










Affleck has now revealed during his Criterion Closet visit that he is sometimes recognized by fans more for the commentary track than some of his actual acting work.

“I was surprised when I heard Criterion was doing ‘Armageddon.' I didn't think of it as that kind of movie when we did it,” he said of the re-release. “And in retrospect now, I feel like maybe my best work in my career is the commentary on this disc. People approach me to talk about the commentary on this disc as much as they do the movies I've been in. And it's because I didn't know any better than to be really honest. But I won't spoil it for any of you who are interested. It is an achievement that I am proud of, and didn't intend to be as good as I now think it is, at the time.”

He added, “Criterion, when is the 4K coming out?” 

This has been on his mind lately too. Affleck also recently told GQ that “Armageddon” must have been among the “top five all-time DVD commentaries.” The “Accountant 2” star added that there wasn't much media training in the '90s, leading to his unfiltered take.

“By the way, nobody said anything to me. I don't think any of the other people listened to it or gave a fuck until years later when it was played,” he said. “And I was kind of shocked and appalled that I went on there and started being like….I mean, that's all true. Everything I said was a hundred percent true, but that's the point. You're not supposed to go on there and tell all of the truth.” 

Affleck added, “I thought, I'm going to go do a big Hollywood action movie and I love it. And yes, during the movie, I was kind of surprised to find that sometimes they weren't all that interested in making sense. I remember Billy Bob [Thornton] was having a long conversation about a scene in the space mission control or whatever it was, and he was like, ‘No, that's OK, man. I can stop talking about it. I just kind of like to be in the kind of movies that make sense, you know what I mean? But fuck it, we don't have to do that. We're not doing that on this one. Fuck it.' And I was the only person who was kind of like, ‘Okay, I guess we don't operate by those other rules here.'” 

 










Affleck also told Entertainment Weekly in 2022 that even his kids “relentlessly mock” “Armageddon.” 

However, “Armageddon” wasn't the only film that Affleck starred in among his Criterion Closet picks: The actor/producer/director shared that he still uses Richard Linklater's directing techniques from “Dazed and Confused” on his own features. 

“It was a really wonderful experience for me. It really taught me in doing it that…Because Rick Linklater, the director, kind of invited us to be authors and participate and write and improvise. He made every actor in it a partner and, as a director myself, I've really latched on to that lesson and tried to continue with that,” Affleck said. “I remember he sent us a note that said, ‘If this movie is produced as written, it would be a massive underachievement.' I had never seen humility in that way, or that kind of approach.”

Darren Aronofsky had a big problem after the huge success of “The Whale“: He didn't know what to do next. While “The Whale” landed lead star Brendan Fraser the Best Actor Oscar in 2023, Aronofsky was weighed down by the intensity of the feature's plot about a man who essentially eats himself to death. Aronofsky wanted to work on a film that was lighter in tone.

“I was really upset that I couldn't figure out what was next,” he told Vanity Fair. “And I kind of had this urge to do something fun.” 

That led him to revisit Charlie Huston's script for “Caught Stealing,” which had been in the works for about 15 years. “I felt like there was just so much tension in our normal lives that I felt like the one thing that Hollywood has always done great is entertain. I looked at my projects and I said, ‘You know what? The most fun one I have is Charlie's script,'” Aronofsky said.

The book, which Huston adapted into a screenplay himself, is about a former baseball player who gets caught up in a world of underground crime in 1990s New York City. Austin Butler stars. “We sort of built a world around him,” Aronofsky recently said during a French Cinematheque masterclass of working with Butler. “It's just a crime caper that we tried to make really well — and that was a really fun activity. There's nothing wrong with taking a classic genre and just trying to make it better, and to do things with real craft.”

Yet Aronofsky will be returning to his trademark darker tones soon though: He is rumored to be later adapting Stephen King's “Cujo” for Netflix. The film will be an adaptation of Stephen King's 1981 horror novel about a friendly St. Bernard dog that turns into a killer and torments a small town. “Cujo” was first brought to the screen in 1983 with Lewis Teague's film. Aronofsky was also set to direct a biopic on Elon Musk for A24 based on a biography by Walter Isaacson, who also wrote the biography about Steve Jobs that Danny Boyle later turned into his 2015 film starring Michael Fassbender.

	In February, the Philadelphia Eagles became Super Bowl champions after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs with a score of 40 to 22. The city celebrated with chaos and parades and a few members of the team celebrated with a visit to the White House, where Donald Trump somehow managed to make their championship victory all about Taylor Swift. 


	“It was an incredible game. A little surprising, but right from the beginning of the first quarter of the big game, which I was there I watched in person,” Trumps said. “I was there along with Taylor Swift, how did that work out? How did that one work out?” Swift attended the game in support of Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs player she has been dating for nearly two years.


	Trump has a long history of taunting Swift, who used her platform to endorse Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024 after expressing regret about not endorsing a candidate in the 2016 presidential election. After the Super Bowl, he took to Truth Social to write: “The only one who had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving.”

	Trump had previously shown support for the Chiefs, which made his response to their loss even more bizarre. But more than that, it made him a hypocrite. Per Reuters, the crowd at Caesars Superdome greeted him with “a mix of cheers and boos” when he entered the stadium, becoming the first sitting president to do so, despite a complicated relationship with the National Football League. Swift herself received a version of the same mixture when she was shown on the Jumbotron. However, Trump attempted to skew perception of their respective reactions by sharing side-by-side videos that showed people cheering for him but booing Swift with no caption.

	Trump focusing on Swift as though she were on the field herself could be a deflection from a number of Eagles players who actually were in the game, skipping the White House visit. Last week, when star quarterback Jalen Hurts was asked whether he planned to attend, he offered the reporter an awkward “um,” followed by a prolonged silence and a swift exit. He ultimately didn't show up. Several other players missed the visit, too, citing scheduling conflicts, per the NFL.

	











	Trump previously said he would extend an invitation for the Chiefs to visit following the Eagles to make up for 2020, when they won the Super Bowl but were unable to visit due to Covid restrictions.

The increased demand amid heightened macroeconomic jitters shows listeners "stay with us even when things feel more uncertain," CEO Daniel Ek says.

Spotify's first quarter revenue rose 15% as its subscriber base increased by 12%, the company's highest first quarter subscriber gains since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported on Tuesday.


	The music and podcast streaming giant reported total revenue of 4.2 billion euros ($4.54 billion) in the quarter ending March 31, and total paying subscribers of 268 million, according to filings.


	The first of the large music companies to report earnings on Tuesday, Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek said the  results show healthy, high engagement and strong listener retention, despite global economic concerns that hurt equity markets in March. 


	Universal Music Group, French streaming platform Deezer and South Korea K-pop juggernaut HYBE also report quarterly earnings on Tuesday (April 29).

	“I don't see anything in our business right now that gives me any pause for concern. I'd be very surprised if long term we had any implications. That is my commentary around the macro environment,” Ek said on a call with analysts, adding later that Spotify's 5 million net new subscribers in the quarter was 2 million ahead of its target.


	The company's operating income, which measures gross profit minus operating costs, rose to 509 million euros ($579 million). Spotify's gross margin, the percentage of money it keeps on a sale after costs are taken out, improved 400 basis points from last year to 31.6%, a level executives said they expect to maintain this year.


	The company noted that this marked the highest gains for subscribers in the first quarter since 2020, when millions signed up for Spotify accounts at the start of the pandemic. Total monthly average users (MAUs) rose 10% to 678 million compared to this quarter a year ago, with premium subscriber MAUs rising 12% and ad-supported MAUs increasing by 9% compared to a year ago. Compared to the prior quarter, premium subscriber MAUs rose 2%, whereas ad-supported held flat. 


	The additional MAUs that came to Spotify in the quarter were primarily from countries outside of Latin America, Europe and North America. MAUs in Europe and North America edged 1% lower in the first quarter compared to the last quarter of 2024, which the company said was the result of later campaign timing for its 2024 Wrapped marketing event.  


	The Financial Times reported last week (April 25) that Spotify is preparing to raise the monthly price of its individual subscriptions across Europe and Latin America by about one euro as soon as this summer.


	Company executives declined to say if the company would raise prices in the near term and declined to give a timeline for when it might roll out a new premium offering for super fans. Rather, they said, the company is focused on fixing issues and rolling out service and technology improvements for users and advertisers faster. 


	“Spotify is now a quite sizable business but also a sizable platform,” Ek said. “We have gotten here with just the same freemium model that we launched and started working on 19 years ago.”


	Companies typically evolve over time to sell different tiers of their service that charge different rates, and Spotify is in the early stages of doing that, Ek said.


	“For the near term and midterm growth just you should expect … just working on our existing subscriptions and family plans is plenty enough. For the very very long term it is upside opportunity for Spotify. But … we are not dependent on that for growth.”


	Ek seemed to put the onus to advance Spotify's super premium offering on music rights holders, like the major music companies. 


	“We want to make it happen,” Ek said. “For the super fan, we do need the partners to come to the table and be part of this journey.”


	Spotify's stock price was down 2.4% at $580.73 per share in afternoon trading in New York, having pared intra-day losses earlier in the session that saw the stock dip by as 8%.


	Here are the company's first quarter highlights:

Fugazi have announced that, starting this month, they're releasing a selection of their archival concert recordings on Bandcamp and streaming services. The post-hardcore luminaries are releasing the first two installments, recordings of their first-ever show on September 3, 1987, and to-date final performance on November 4, 2002, this Friday (May 2). More live concert tapes will be uploaded each month on through the end of 2025.

While this makes listening to old Fugazi live shows easier for certain fans, it's not the first time the Washington, D.C., punks have released these recordings. The complete Fugazi Live Series archive—which includes over 800 concerts—has been and remains available online over at Dischord. The majority of those shows were recorded by Fugazi's sound engineers, and are available to download for a small price alongside old flyers, gig photos, and general show info.

Back in 2023, a 90-minute-long collection of “crowd-sourced, fan-recorded live shows and rare archival footage” called We Are Fugazi From Washington, DC screened in a few movie theaters to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band's last public show. Some of the footage in that film was shot by filmmaker Lance Bangs, and tickets were, fittingly, only $5.

Fugazi went on indefinite hiatus at the end of 2002. Ian MacKaye, Joe Lally, and Brendan Canty started various side-projects over the years, including the Evens, the Messthetics, and Coriky. Meanwhile, Guy Picciotto has produced albums for Blonde Redhead, the Blood Brothers, Gossip, and many others. Fugazi have denied rumors of a reunion time and time again, but they do still play music together in private just for fun.

Julia Garner is caught in Zach Cregger‘s twisted trap of a horror film, “Weapons.” The “Fantastic Four: First Steps” actress plays an elementary school teacher whose entire class, sans one student, is missing under eerie circumstances. While the kids appear to have run away on their own volition, there might be a possessed force at play…

Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan co-star in “Barbarian” director Cregger's latest horror/thriller. The logline reads: “'Weapons' is a horror film that follows an entire classroom of children who get out of their beds and disappear one night without a trace. When all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, a community is left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance.”

New Line Cinema chief Richard Brenner has described the film as being “batshit insane.” Cregger echoed to Entertainment Weekly that “Weapons” is “weirder, twistier, and bigger” than his directorial debut “Barbarian.” 

“I have way more actors to fit into this thing,” he said, citing that ensemble film “Magnolia” was an inspiration. “The set pieces are definitely bigger. It's just a bigger, weirder movie than ‘Barbarian' is. I promise you, when you watch it, you will agree with me. It is.”

Cregger's feature debut “Barbarian” was an indie hit grossing $45 million worldwide. He later landed a deal with studio New Line Cinema, and will be rebooting the “Resident Evil” franchise. Cregger previously revealed that A24 and Neon both passed on “Barbarian” before he connected with BoulderLight to produce; New Regency, Vertigo, and Disney later boarded the horror thriller. “Weapons” is said to exist within the same universe as “Barbarian.”

Cregger told Entertainment Weekly that “Weapons” is “an incredibly personal story” as well, saying,  “There's certain chapters of this that are legitimately autobiographical that I feel like I lived.” 

“Weapons” premieres August 8 in theaters. Check out the trailer below.

Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Lewis Pullman and Julia Louis-Dreyfus also star in Jake Schreier's account of dysfunctional outsiders teaming up to tap into their heroic potential.

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Much to the chagrin of Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, the name hastily cooked up by another member of the rough-edged new superhero crew in Thunderbolts* is borrowed from the Pee Wee Soccer team of her childhood, which never won a game. That implicit underdog tag is in keeping with a group that's continually underestimated, dismissed as a bunch of “antisocial losers” by the villain who wants them out of the way. But the asterisk tacked onto the title of this enjoyable Marvel offshoot indicates that the name and its history will not define them.

	











	While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast but also to the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.

Thunderbolts* by no means reinvents the superhero movie and its pacing isn't as consistent as it could be. But at a time when Marvel fatigue has taken a bite out of more than one fizzled blockbuster, it's a relief to watch a comic-book movie in which the smug wisecracking is dialed way down and the characters are given interior dimensions beyond their powers, including a certain emotional fragility. That doesn't mean there's any less physical action or threatened destruction, but there's a kind of back-to-basics innocence here that makes the stakes feel more real.


	Yelena is the center of the group and Pugh the movie's MVP in a performance that expands on the character traits that made her so captivating in Black Widow — the deadpan insouciance but, more notably, the depth of bruised feelings she attempts to hide behind her tactical skills as a trained assassin. If that 2021 film hinged on the repair of frayed surrogate family ties and the contentious but binding hold of sisterhood, Thunderbolts* shows Yelena brooding on the emptiness of her life in the wake of her adoptive sister's death.

	











	She's questioning whether the void is just boredom or something bigger as she undertakes a cleanup assignment in a Malaysian lab, eliminating both material and human evidence that can be tied back to CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) through the scientific research company OXE. Yelena feels adrift, prompting her to request that Valentina reassign her to a “more public-facing” position.


	The transparently shifty CIA director agrees on the condition that Yelena first destroy one last OXE facility, embedded in a mountain. Valentina's involvement in experimental injections of super serums into human guinea pigs has made her the target of an impeachment hearing conducted by Congressman Gary (Wendell Pierce). She has her sharp assistant Mel (Geraldine Viswanathan) working overtime to clean up the evidence.


	Freshman Congressman Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), whose Winter Soldier life will be hard to put behind him, is working behind the scenes to help expose Valentina's malfeasance; he spots a potential asset in Mel.


	The familiar team-up element of the MCU formula happens when Yelena finds herself in conflict in an underground vault at the remaining OXE site with John Walker (Wyatt Russell), whom she dubs “the dime-store Captain America”; Ava Starr, aka Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen); and, in a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance, Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko).


	Realizing that Valentina has set them up in a death trap as more potential damage to be removed, the group bands together, taking a dazed and confused lab patient named Bob (Lewis Pullman) along with them as they bust out.

	











	The father figure whose every word prompts an eye-roll from Yelena, Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), turns up to get them out of there in the “Red Guardian” vehicle that he operates as a limo service (“Protecting You From Boring Evening,” reads the slogan painted on the door). But when a convoy of tanks threatens to end them as they speed across the desert (Utah serves as a panoramic location), it's Bucky's intervention on a motorcycle that saves their asses. Or so it seems.


	Marvel Comics obsessives will likely guess the revelations about Bob and the reasons he is separated from the group. But for audiences without that encyclopedic knowledge, developments around the character, and his affinity with Yelena, will be a rewarding part of the story. Beautifully played by Pullman as a sweet-natured, broken man struggling to outrun his troubled past, Bob is a complex figure through which the movie explores mental instability and the fight between light and darkness.


	The screenplay's introduction of “interconnected shame rooms,” where characters get stuck in painful memories from their past — Yelena's lingering trauma from her training as a childhood assassin; John's sorrowful separation from his wife and child — dips perhaps a little heavy-handedly into textbook psychology. But having them confront their emotional debris gives them satisfying depths that enrich the experience of the movie.


	The destructive forces unleashed on New York allow the Thunderbolts to shake off their disillusionment and rediscover the joy of heroism, something of which Harbour's Russian super soldier, Red Guardian, says, “There is no higher calling.” Leaning into the goofball aspects of the character — and the amusingly chewy accent — Harbour gets many of the funniest lines, at one point telling Yelena: “The light inside you is dim, even by Eastern European standards.”

	











	The ways in which mayhem is visited upon the city and thwarted almost feel like a throwback to vintage Superman and Batman films, before mass CG destruction pretty much pummeled any visceral excitement out of the superhero genre. Just watching characters block falling slabs of concrete or hurtling cars, whisking New Yorkers out of the way to safety in the nick of time, is refreshing after so many movies with actors stuck in front of greenscreens battling annihilation beams from space.


	The change of aesthetic clearly is the result of a creative team not plucked from the usual MCU stable, including talented cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo, who brought such distinctive visuals to the David Lowery films A Ghost Story and The Green Knight. Instead of the usual bland plastic sheen, he gives us a movie with grit and texture, echoed in the details of Grace Yun's sets. And the score by experimental group Son Lux is a welcome shift away from orchestral bombast into more nuanced territory.


	Pugh proves herself more than capable of leading a Marvel joint and this is very much her movie, though the entire ensemble play crucial parts, in keeping with the story's ethos. The banter among the Thunderbolts is droll without ever trying too hard, and snippy without ever putting the team's unity in doubt. That carries through to the requisite post-credits sequence, which lays groundwork for the next installment, just as the coda on Black Widow suggested a core element of this one.

	











	Stan, Russell, John-Kamen and Harbour all get to find new colors in roles they have played in previous MCU installments. Louis-Dreyfus, while never quite escaping the shameless persona of Selina Meyer (maybe it's just seeing her back in Washington), clearly relishes power-hungry Valentina's ruthless villainy and her political opportunism, without sacrificing the humor. Viswanathan, one of few saving graces in Ethan Coen's painful Drive-Away Dolls, is a very likeable presence with potential for future developments. And as the most significant addition, Pullman is wonderful.


	Whether Thunderbolts* can rescue the MCU from its doldrums remains to be seen when audiences weigh in. But it at least seems a step in the direction of creative renewal.

It's not the first time the President has taken a swipe at the pop star. 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Donald Trump hosted the 2025 Super Bowl LIX champs the Philadelphia Eagles at the White House on Monday (April 28), where he took the opportunity to once again lash out at Taylor Swift. The President took his latest swipe at the pop star during the visit when he lauded the Eagles for their commanding 40-22 win in February over the Kansas City Chiefs.


	“It was an incredible game. A little surprising, but right from the beginning of the first quarter of the big game, which I was there I watched in person,” said Trump before adding a diss aimed at the billionaire pop superstar who is, of course, dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. “I was there along with Taylor Swift, how did that work out? How did that one work out?”

	











	Trump, the first sitting President to attend the NFL championship game, has made a habit of lashing out at world-beating pop star, including on the night of the Super Bowl, when he wrote, “The only one who had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	While Swift was met with some audible boos from the crowd when she was shown on the jumbotron that night, Trump's latest comments come on the eve of the 100-day mark of his second term in office at a time when, according to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll 45% of those polled gave him an “F” for how he's handled things so far, compared to just 23% giving him an “A.”  


	Trump's overall approval rating is 42%, which stands as the second-worst approval rating for any president at the 100-day mark in the past 80 years, bested only by the 41% lodged by Trump during his first term; in a different Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll, his approval rating was a historically low 39%. And while Trump promised to fix the economy on day one and lower the nation's debt by slashing government agencies, his erratic, across-the-board tariffs and DOGE-led mass firings have resulted in a 39% approval rating to date on his handling of the economy, a new low for Trump.


	As is his wont, Trump lashed out in all-caps at the dismal poll numbers, decrying them as “FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS” and saying that they should be “investigated for ELECTION FRAUD!”


	The White House visit is a tradition for some championship teams, but a number of prominent players skipped Monday's event, including QB Jalen Hurts, as well as star players A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, Jalen Carter, Jordan Davis, Brandon Graham and six others; the Eagles turned down a visit to the White House after winning their first Super Bowl in 2018 during Trump's first term.

The sequel series, coming this summer, sees Michael C. Hall return in his serial killer role.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	Break out the old kill room, because Dexter Morgan is very not dead.


Dexter: Resurrection, the sequel series to flagship Dexter, has set a release date and has dropped a teaser trailer saying as much as it reintroduces Michael C. Hall as titular serial killer Dexter Morgan.




Dexter: Resurrection will debut with two episodes on Friday, July 11 on streaming and on demand for Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers, before its on-air debut Sunday, July 13 at 8:00 p.m. Remaining episodes will roll out weekly.

					'Dexter: Resurrection': First Look at Michael C. Hall, Uma Thurman and Peter Dinklage		
			









Dexter: Resurrection, from showrunner and executive producer Clyde Phillips, is a continuation of Dexter: New Blood and picks up immediately after that 2021 limited series left off, where Dexter Morgan is revived after being shot by his son, Harrison (Jack Alcott). Dexter's resuscitation was revealed in a flash-forward in Dexter: Original Sin, the prequel series that wrapped its first run in February (and has since been renewed). Phillips also headed up Original Sin.

	











	Here's the logline: “Weeks after Dexter Morgan (Hall) takes a bullet to the chest from his own son, he awakens from a coma to find Harrison (Jack Alcott) gone without a trace. Realizing the weight of what he put his son through, Dexter sets out for New York City, determined to find him and make things right. But closure won't come easy. When Miami Metro's Angel Batista (David Zayas) arrives with questions, Dexter realizes his past is catching up to him fast. As father and son navigate their own darkness in the city that never sleeps, they soon find themselves deeper than they ever imagined — and that the only way out is together.”


	In addition to Hall, Alcott and Zayas Dexter: Resurrection stars Uma Thurman as Charley, Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine as Blessing Kamara, Kadia Saraf as Detective Claudette Wallace, Dominic Fumusa as Detective Melvin Oliva and Emilia Suárez as Elsa Rivera, with James Remar as Dexter's father Harry Morgan and Peter Dinklage as Leon Prater. (See first look photos of the cast.)


	Neil Patrick Harris, Krysten Ritter, Eric Stonestreet and David Dastmalchian will also guest star as Lowell, Mia, Al and Gareth, respectively. Production is ongoing in New York. 


Dexter: Resurrection is produced by Showtime Studios and Counterpart Studios. Hall also executive produces along with Scott Reynolds, Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns and Marcos Siega. Monica Raymund directs four episodes, with Marcos Siega directing six episodes. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.

Beyoncé kicked off her Cowboy Carter Tour in characteristically stylish, choreography-dense fashion at SoFi Stadium, in Inglewood, California, last night. Dressed in a white, fringed leather ensemble with a cowboy hat, she launched into a set including numerous live debuts for Cowboy Carter tracks, cameos from Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter, and a cover of “Before I Let Go” by the Maze and the late Frankie Beverly. Check out the full setlist below.

Before Beyoncé took the star-shaped stage with a troupe of red-robed dancers, an electronic screen lit up with an American flag beside a speaker tower emblazoned with the letters “KNTRY,” Cowboy Carter's fictional radio station. Merchandise designs included a depiction of Beyoncé riding a mechanical horse above the slogan, “Never ask permission for something that already belongs to you.”

After opening with “Ameriican Requiem” and “Blackbiird”—paying homage to the Black women pioneers of rock, folk, and country—she pivoted into a twisted rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” modeled after Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock classic. During “Freedom,” video showed Beyoncé in dreadlocks smoking a cigar, with a sash reading “the reclamation of America.” Blue Ivy stepped up for the “Formation” choreography and stuck around to perform with her mother on numerous songs, including a performance of “America Has a Problem” preceded by an interlude that seemingly sampled Death Grips' “You Might Think He Loves You….” Rumi later joined for “Protector,” apparently going off-brief to wave excitedly during the dance routine, prompting Beyoncé to break character and laugh while giving her a hug.

Despite plenty of Renaissance cuts and a handful of staples from her catalog—as well as a playful riff on the viral “she ain't no diva” TikTok—Cowboy Carter dominated the show, in the composition of both the setlist and the themes. A mechanical bull spotted backstage transpired to slot into a wider narrative presenting Beyoncé as a Wild West outlaw overcoming alienation and outsiderdom to assert her claim on the territory. The third act climaxed with video of a shootout in which she took up arms against an older, white cowboy whose bullets pinged right off her body. Beyoncé sang final encore closer “Amen” in front of a Statue of Liberty with braided hair.

Beyoncé released Cowboy Carter, the follow-up to 2022's Renaissance, last March as the second part of a planned trilogy. The album went on to become the pop icon's eighth No. 1 and made her the first Black woman ever to debut at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart. It also earned her three trophies at the 2025 Grammy Awards, where she claimed her first victory for Album of the Year, as well as for Best Country Album and Best Country Duo/Group Performance. Last December, Beyoncé performed in her Houston hometown for the halftime show during one of the NFL's first Christmas games to stream live on Netflix.

The Cowboy Carter Tour is Beyoncé's seventh headline tour, following 2023's massive Renaissance World Tour. The latter, which spanned 56 dates across the globe and featured guest appearances from Kendrick Lamar and Megan Thee Stallion, was captured in the box office–topping documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé.

The Cowboy Carter Tour continues on Thursday, May 1, with a second night in Inglewood; the rest of the itinerary will take her to New Jersey, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., before European stops including London and Paris.

	House Republicans are moving to block Democrats from being able to force votes on whether to demand information from President Donald Trump's administration for the next six months. 


	The House Rules Committee, which Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) controls, quietly advanced a measure Monday that would halt the legislative body from voting on any “resolutions of inquiry,” one of the exceedingly few ways that the minority party — Democrats — can force Congress to conduct oversight of Trump's shockingly lawless, careless, and increasingly authoritarian administration.


	The move comes as Democrats push resolutions demanding answers about the Trump administration's “Signalgate” leak scandal. One of the measures from Democrats, in the House Armed Services Committee, would demand that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supply information about America's attacks on the Youthis in Yemen, as well as information about rules governing how classified or sensitive information is handled at the Pentagon. 

	











	According to texts published by The Atlantic, Hegseth shared detailed information about plans to attack the Houthis in a Signal chat with several top Trump administration officials, as well as journalist Jeffrey Goldberg. Subsequent reporting indicates Hegseth also shared Yemen attack plans in a separate Signal chat with his wife and brother.


	In the GOP-led House of Representatives, resolutions of inquiry are one of the few ways that Democrats can currently influence what goes on. The resolutions specifically allow them to demand answers from the administration. The resolutions are privileged, and have a deadline of 14 legislative days. If a majority party on a committee fails to report a resolution of inquiry to the House within that time, the resolution can be called to the floor without the speaker's permission.


	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who sits on the Armed Services committee, has criticized the Trump administration over Signalgate and called on Hegseth to be fired.

	Fresh off a two-week recess, House Republicans returned to Washington and advanced a measure in the Rules Committee Monday that would pause resolutions of inquiry until Sept. 30. This would effectively shut down efforts by Democrats to ask the Trump administration to share documents about Signalgate — or anything else for that matter.

	











	The proposed rule change was tucked into a package of resolutions designed to repeal several Biden-era environmental policies, including those allowing California to set more stringent vehicle pollution rules. 


	Polling from Exiled Policy, a libertarian policy consulting shop, finds that among the registered voters who have seen news about Signalgate, 77 percent say that Congress should investigate the U.S. government's group chat leak about its military operations in Yemen.


	“The survey speaks for itself,” says Jason Pye, who runs Exiled Policy and was previously the vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a now defunct conservative and libertarian advocacy group. “More than three-quarters of voters believe Congress should investigate Signalgate. This includes 76 percent of independent voters and 60 percent of Republicans. That's a clear mandate for Congress to live up to one of its most basic responsibilities: oversight of the Executive Branch. Unfortunately, House Republican leadership is once again robbing voters of the oversight they're demanding by using a procedural tactic to stop a resolution of inquiry. The only reason House Republican leadership would do this is because they feared it may pass.”

	Former Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Va.), who served as an intelligence officer and on a national security subcommittee in Congress, says that “Signalgate deserves an investigation, to say the least.


	“Not stepping up is one thing, but procedurally shutting down the chance to even vote on it or any other inquiry is a frightening abdication of duty,” says Riggleman. “For years, Republicans talked about constitutional conservatism and the separations of powers. That has been cast aside out of a blind loyalty to Trump. It's shameful.”

Check out what Queen B performed on opening night in Inglewood, Calif.

	“Five Nights of Beyoncé!” That was the tagline trumpeted across television and radio throughout Los Angeles ahead of the Monday night (April 28) kick-off for the 35-time Grammy winner's highly anticipated Cowboy Carter Tour at SoFi Stadium in neighboring Inglewood, Calif.


	The 32-market stadium tour — across nine cities in the U.S. and Europe — borrows its name from Beyoncé's eighth studio album. Released in March 2024, the country-themed project is the second act in a three-album arc that launched with Act 1: Renaissance in 2022. Featuring a mix of R&B, folk, blues and Americana, Cowboy Carter presented guest turns and cameos by country legends Dolly Parton, Linda Martell and Willie Nelson, contemporary stars Miley Cyrus and Post Malone, and emerging Black country artists such as Shaboozey, Tanner Adell and Brittney Spencer. (Not to mention a cast of stellar musicians from Stevie Wonder and Nile Rodgers to Jon Batiste, Gary Clark Jr. and Rhiannon Giddens.)


	Powered by hits and fan faves like “Texas Hold ‘Em” (her ninth Billboard Hot 100 No. 1), covers of Parton's “Jolene” and the Beatles' “Blackbird” plus “Levii's Jeans (with Malone) and “Ya Ya,” Cowboy Carter garnered a leading 11 nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards. The album ultimately won three gold gramophones: best country duo/group performance for “II Most Wanted” (with Cyrus), best country album (the first Black artist to claim that honor) and album of the year — an honor that had long eluded Beyoncé, making her the first Black female to win that marquee category since Ms. Lauryn Hill in 1999.


	Beyoncé last visited SoFi Stadium when she brought her Renaissance World Tour to the venue. She played three sold-out nights at the venue in September 2023, highlights of which included a surprise appearance by Diana Ross who led the audience in singing “Happy Birthday” to Beyoncé.


	On Christmas Day last year, Beyoncé gave fans a glimpse of what might be in store for the Cowboy Carter Tour when she performed several tracks with special guests like Post Malone, Shaboozey and daughter Blue Ivy for the halftime show during the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans football game at Houston's NRG Stadium.


	Here's a look at Beyoncé's opening night setlist for the Cowboy Carter Tour.

EXCLUSIVE: Smile producer Temple Hill Entertainment is partnering with Protagonist Pictures on The Rule of Three, which is being set up as the first installment in a new horror trilogy adapted from thriller author Sam Ripley's novel of the same name.


	Protagonist is launching sales at the upcoming Cannes market with Thomasin McKenzie (JoJo Rabbit) and Katie Douglas (Clown in a Cornfield) aboard to star. James Roday Rodriguez (Gravy) directs, adapted from a screenplay by Todd Harthan (Hulu's High Potential) and Rodriguez.


	The synopsis reads: “Beware, Beware, The Rule of Three, It's coming for you, like it came for me… Are Amy (Douglas) and her family plagued by a deadly curse? Every three years, death strikes under mysterious circumstances, horrifically killing family members. It's almost three years to the day since Amy's parents' death, and Amy realises the curse must strike her next. With the help of her best friend Lizzy (McKenzie), the two friends try to cheat Amy's death and find a way to reverse the curse. But is Amy's fate already sealed? Bad things always happen in threes, so they say…”

	Marty Bowen, Wyck Godfrey and Isaac Klausner will produce for Twilight and Smile outfit Temple Hill, with Hal Sadoff and George Berman executive-producing. Dave Bishop, James Pugh and George Hamilton serve as executive producers for Protagonist, in collaboration with Rodriguez and Harthan's new shingle, Taft Tennis.


The Rule of Three marks Temple Hill and Protagonist Pictures' fourth collaboration, which began with Clown in a Cornfield, scheduled for a wide U.S. theatrical release on May 9. The companies also joined forces on the horror Monitor, currently in production, and Simon Curtis' Encore.


	“The Rule of Three is the kind of gripping horror that gets under your skin and stays there,” said Bishop. “It's a bold, elevated horror with an unsettling psychological edge that taps into something universal – and terrifying…a truly wild ride. With Temple Hill's expertise in the genre paired with a chillingly sharp concept, this is a must see for horror fans and audiences worldwide.”


	Temple Hill's Marty Bowen added: “We were immediately hooked by James' vision for a fresh and terrifying curse movie revolving around the notorious lore behind the number 3. Centred on a ride-or-die friendship between two young women, set against the nostalgic backdrop of the 90's, and underpinned by James' trademark wit, we know that audiences will find The Rule of Three scary and hilarious in equal measure. And with this being the first in the franchise, there are many jaw-dropping twists and turns to come.”

	











	“This is any director's dream — supportive and mustached producers, an incredible cast and material that defies the ways we try to define ‘genre' filmmaking. Come for the terror, stay for the storytelling,” said Rodriguez.


	McKenzie's upcoming projects include Bleecker Street's comedy Fackham Hall from comedian Jimmy Carr, and Anna Lee from Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet, writers and director of the Oscar winner, The Brutalist.


	Douglas will next lead the horror feature Clown in a Cornfield, which made its debut at SXSW 2025 and will release in theaters in the US on May 9, 2025. Previous credits include Lifetime's The Girl Who Escaped: The Kara Robinson Story, Lifetime's Believe Me: The Abduction of Lisa McVey and Vertical's The Walk.


	McKenzie is repped by UTA, Untitled Entertainment, Gail Cowan Management and Johnson Shapiro; and Douglas is repped by Play Management, and Skrzyniarz & Mallean. Roday Rodriguez is repped by CAA, Principal Entertainment and Peikoff Mahan Law Office; Harthan is repped by UTA, Circle Management+Production, and Barnes, Morris. Sam Ripley is repped by CAA on behalf of James Wills at Watson, Little.

Terrence Howard admitted that he passed on playing Marvin Gaye because if he had to kiss a male costar he would “cut my lips off.” 


	During a recent appearance on the Club Random podcast, Howard told host Bill Maher about the “biggest mistake” he ever made in his career. The actor recounted how he was invited to dinner by Smokey Robinson because “he wanted me to play his life” in a movie. Unfortunately Howard had to turn Robinson down because he was in a conversation with Lee Daniels about playing Marvin Gaye in another biopic. 


	Maher responded, “You would've been perfect as Marvin Gaye, and that is a story that needs to be told.” However, Howard confirmed he ended up in neither project. He ended up turning down the role of Gaye once he learned how the singer's sexuality would be explored in the film. 


	“I was over at Quincy Jones' house and I'm asking Quincy, ‘I'm hearing rumors that Marvin was gay' and I'm like, ‘Was he gay?,'” Howard recalled. “And Quincy's like, ‘Yes.'” Ultimately, Howard decided he “could not” play the singer. 

	











	“They would've wanted to do that, and I wouldn't have been able to do that,” Howard told Maher of portraying a gay relationship. He explained that he couldn't kiss a man onscreen because “I don't fake it.” 


	He continued, “That would fuck me. I would cut my lips off. If I kissed some man, I would cut my lips off.” 


	Howard explained that “it does not make me homophobic to not want to kiss a man.” He added that it's about being able to represent something accurately onscreen. “I can't play that character 100 percent,” Howard said. “I can't surrender myself to a place that I don't understand.”

	Howard most recently appeared in Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist, a Peacock miniseries that aired last year. He is best known for portraying Lucious Lyon on Empire, which was co-created by Daniels, and for his Oscar-nominated role in Hustle & Flow. The actor shared similar sentiments on the PBD Podcast, saying he had turned down gay roles because he didn't want to lose his “man card.”


	“I've lost businesses because I don't bend over in that way,” he said. “I don't compromise. I don't play gay roles. I don't kiss a man. I don't do that shit because the man card means everything.”

Kidman will be the 10th recipient of the Kering honor joining a roster that includes Donna Langley, Jane Fonda, Patty Jenkins, Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Viola Davis, Michelle Yeoh and Salma Hayek Pinault. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Nicole Kidman will soon be in motion heading back to Cannes.


	The Oscar winning actress — coming off a dizzying 2024 that included screen outings in Babygirl, Holland, Lioness, The Perfect Couple, A Family Affair and Expats — has been confirmed to receive the next Women in Motion Award. The honor, presented during the Cannes Film Festival from the fest itself and longtime partner Kering, will be doled out May 18 during a glamorous gala, which is typically attended by the Cannes jury, A-list stars, auteurs and industry insiders.

	Kidman will be the milestone 10th Women in Motion recipient, joining a roster of honorees that includes NBCUniversal chief Donna Langley, Jane Fonda, Isabelle Huppert, Patty Jenkins, Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Viola Davis, Michelle Yeoh, Gong Li and Salma Hayek Pinault. The award is designed to honor “female artists who, through their career and commitment, advance the place of women in cinema and in society. 


	Kidman has done just that, particularly in recent years following a 2017 pledge to work with a female director every 18 months. She went above and beyond that goal and has collaborated with nearly 20 since then. It was that same year, 2017, when Kidman was last in Cannes to receive the Cannes Film Festival's 70th anniversary prize in conjunction with the world premiere of Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled. Of course, her Cannes history dates back much further and includes such festival selections as the debut Far and Away followed by To Die For, Moulin Rouge, Dogville, Hemingway & Gellhorn, Paperboy, Grace of Monaco, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, Top of the Lake: China Girl and How to Talk to Girls at Parties. 


	“For this anniversary edition of Women In Motion, Nicole Kidman, who fully embodies the spirit of the program, was an obvious choice,” explained Kering chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault. “Through her artistic standards, her committed choices and her concrete action to change representations in cinema, she is a powerful illustration of what Women In Motion has been defending for a decade.” 


	In a statement, Kidman called it a “true honor” to receive the honor from Francois and festival leaders Thierry Fremaux and Iris Knobloch. “I am proud to join this list of extraordinary women who've received this honor before me — artists and trailblazers I deeply admire. The Cannes Film Festival has been a part of my life for over 30 years and I am thrilled to add this incredible recognition to the many memories I've made here.”

	











	Said Fremaux: “Nicole Kidman is an immensely talented actress. Her rich filmography, of which she is the patient author, and her masterful, unsettling performances have left their mark on the history of contemporary cinema. She has worked with the most emblematic directors, lending them her versatility and infinite sensitivity. Role after role, and with the nuances, strengths, and flaws specific to each character, she has portrayed women who break free from their shackles.” 


	Added Knobloch: “When a great actress works with nearly twenty female directors in the space of a few years, she shows the world just how vibrant and alive the talent of women in cinema really is. Through all these projects, and of course through her production company, Nicole Kidman has given those who write, direct, and tell stories all the visibility they deserve.”


	The Blossom Films founder next stars in a new season of Nine Perfect Strangers on Hulu, a series that she executive produces. Other upcoming projects include Margo's Got Money Troubles opposite Elle Fanning and Scarpetta opposite Jamie Lee Curtis.

The Paramount mogul is stuck in the middle of an impossible choice. Fight Donald Trump and blow up her $8 billion Skydance deal, or cave to the president and torch the most valuable news property in her media empire. Tick, tick, tick …


							By 

	Benjamin Svetkey



	That ticking noise that begins every 60 Minutes segment? Turns out that's not a stopwatch. It's a time bomb.


	At least that's how it's sounding lately, like the illustrious citadel of American broadcast journalism is on the brink of blowing up. Last night, in the latest shudder suggesting an imminent explosion, correspondent Scott Pelley ended the show with a “Last Minute” segment that all but declared open rebellion against 60 Minutes' corporate overlords at Paramount and raised a fist in solidarity with longtime executive producer Bill Owens, who just days earlier had bolted CBS in protest over what he called editorial meddling by management.

	“No one here is happy about it,” Pelley informed viewers, perched on a stool before a backdrop of the program's iconic ticking timepiece. “But in resigning, Bill proved one thing — he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.”

	What's got everyone so worked up, of course, is the $20 billion lawsuit — that's billion with a “b” — President Trump lobbed onto the 60 Minutes‘ set last year, claiming that the show had perpetrated “election interference” by editing a videotaped interview with Kamala Harris from its original 45 minutes to a more broadcast-friendly 21 minutes. You know, the same way 60 Minutes had, without complaint, edited Trump's interview from 45 to 20 minutes during the 2020 campaign. The way, in fact, TV news has been editing interviews since Edward R. Murrow was cutting them on kinescope.


	Nobody is taking Trump's lawsuit seriously — probably not even Trump. It has next to no chance of prevailing in court. But what is being taken seriously — especially by Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements and controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, which owns CBS, which produces 60 Minutes — is the fact that Redstone is trying to sell her company for $8 billion to Skydance Media. That deal requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which has the authority to review transfers of broadcast licenses, a necessary step for Skydance and Paramount to complete their transaction. And, of course, the FCC is now run by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, who has not-so-subtly hinted that certain complaints against 60 Minutes are “likely to arise” and that if Redstone wants the deal to go smoothly she should probably settle the $20 billion suit with the guy in the Oval Office.

	











	In other words, nice little merger you've got here. Shame if anything happened to it.


	The stakes involved are obviously incredibly high — not just for 60 Minutes but for all of news broadcasting and the whole notion of a free press. This isn't, after all, the first time Trump has strong-armed a major media outlet, not even in the past six months. Last December, he got ABC to pay him $15 million to settle an only slightly less flimsy defamation suit (this one against George Stephanopoulos, who supposedly slandered the president by referring to what Trump did to E. Jean Carroll as “rape” when technically the court had deemed it “sexual abuse”). That corporate capitulation was troubling enough. But if Redstone were now to settle the even-easier-to-beat 60 Minutes suit, it would shred the show's long tradition of editorial integrity and send a deep, muzzling chill through all of journalism, not to mention torch Redstone's own reputation.


	But, alas, it's starting to look like that's precisely what she's about to do.


	One of the reasons Owens' departure was so shocking was that it seemed to signal Redstone was on the verge of caving. In truth, the reasons for Owens' exit may have been more nuanced, possibly having something to do with the return of former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky, who assumed an oversight role after 60 Minutes took heat for a segment on Israel's war in Gaza. Still, the snowballing narrative is that Owens sacrificed himself in a desperate warning to Redstone not to sink 60 Minutes over her Skydance deal. That's more or less how Pelley presented it at the end of 60 Minutes last night. And it was certainly how a slew of headlines played it, as well (“Woman Who Destroyed CBS News,” “60 Minutes Sacrificed for Sale” and “Redstone Greed Ending Legacy,” among them). It was also Jake Tapper's take during a seven-minute Redstone rant on CNN just hours after Owens announced he was quitting.

	











	“It seems as if Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle,” Tapper said with an angry frown. “Hope the money's worth it, Shari!”


	Of course, Tapper's right, the money isn't worth it. Sure, the Skydance merger would conceivably add hundreds of millions of dollars to Redstone's personal fortune, but she's already likely worth half a billion, if not more. There isn't a whole lot on planet Earth that she can't already afford. Still, Redstone's own bank account isn't the whole point; she's also trying to protect the media empire her father built and that she took over just before her father Sumner Redstone died at 97 in 2020. And after years of cable-TV declines, missed streaming opportunities and less-than-blockbuster feature releases, a cash-infusing merger, particularly with another family-run firm that's promised to keep Paramount intact, may well be the company's best, if not only, hope for a future.


	Most of the other suitors circling Redstone a few years ago — Warner Bros., Sony, Barry Diller and Byron Allen, to name a few — wanted to carve up Paramount, keep what they liked and sell the rest for scrap. Skydance, though, run by billionaire Larry Ellison's son David, was reportedly the only one to assure Redstone that Paramount would be kept whole. Whether Skydance keeps its word about that is TBD — as far as anyone knows, there isn't anything in writing — but at least, as kin themselves, the Ellisons can theoretically appreciate Redstone's impulse to safeguard her father's legacy (unless, that is, they decide they can make even more money by breaking their word).

	











	The point here is this: Redstone is trapped in a lose-lose situation. If she fights Trump on the 60 Minutes suit, it could blow up the Skydance deal, leaving her company bleeding on the floor. If she caves to Trump and settles, it could blow up 60 Minutes — the crown jewel of Paramount's news division and one its few truly trusted global brands — leaving the company bleeding on the floor.


	Come to think of it, that ticking sound may not be a stopwatch or a bomb. It could be something worse: Donald Trump counting down the seconds until the free press runs out of time.

Atletico Madrid star Marcos Llorente and his wife have taken to social media to give their controversial take on the blackouts in Spain that affected their travel plans on Monday. 

Spain, Portugal and parts of France experienced a massive power outage for several hours on Monday. 

Llorente had spent the weekend in Marbella with his wife, Patricia Noarbe, and their daughter, Amor, and the trio were on their way back to Madrid when their train became trapped in a tunnel near Cordoba due to the blackouts.

They subsequently got off the train and walked with their luggage alongside the tracks, and Llorente posted their alternative journey on Instagram alongside the message: 'Life happens and "conspiracies" become reality.'

His post did not go down too well with some fans on Instagram, but Llorente doubled down as he followed up writing: 'In a world of madmen, it's the sane man who's called mad.'

Llorente's wife also appeared curious as to the cause of the blackouts as she uploaded her own controversial message on Instagram.

She appeared to strongly suggest to her followers that geoengineering - the emerging technology that can manipulate the environment to manage the effects of climate change - was behind the power outage.

Alongside an image of the sky with contrails - the thin, white lines left behind by aircrafts - Noarbe wrote: 'And how many flights do you hear today...'

She added: 'If you continue to think that this is condensation from commercial aircraft instead of geoengineering, it is because you do not want to look at the sky, or the BOE/AEMET or the WMO...'

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has not given the reason for the blackouts yet, but admitted 'this can never happen again'.

However, Spanish authorities have ruled out the possibility that a cyberattack led to the power outage.

The blackouts led to the tennis at the Madrid Open being brought to a premature end on Monday.

However, play resumed as normal on Tuesday after power returned across Spain.

There has always been some sort of fascination with the paranormal.  There have been so many movies made on the subject, there have been so many reality and non-reality shows, haunted houses, ghost hunters, etc.  For some reason, maybe because we can't decide if it's real or not, we have a strange curiosity.

This might be one of the cooler ways to deal with the subject of the paranormal.  And it actually sounds kind of fun.  But also weird at the same time, and definitely isn't for everyone.  I don't really like being scared, but if it's done correctly, could be intriguing.

This time, the paranormal is coming in the form of a Cirque du Soleil show.

One question: why wouldn't this be done closer to Halloween?  I mean, it doesn't matter, but it does seem to go more hand in hand.  Anyway, this show will be set up outside of the Crossroads Mall under a few tents.

There have been a couple of other Cirque shows that have come to Crossroads over the years.  There was a water show, and now this Paranormal show, which apparently was done before, but I don't remember that one.  Probably because it does freak me out... a little.

Paranormal Cirque will be in St. Cloud at the Crossroads Center Mall later in May.  The 23rd through the 26th, which is Memorial Day weekend.  Tickets are on sale now.  There are several showings to choose from, too.

An episode of "Ghost Adventures" will center on the historic Glen Tavern Inn in Santa Paula, which many people have claimed is haunted.

The episode will air at 10 p.m. April 30 on the Discovery Channel.

“There's a presence at the Glen Tavern that is undeniable,” said Monica De La Torre, whose family owns the hotel and purchased it in the early 2000s. “It's not malicious, but you can feel it.” 

Through the years, visitors have reported paranormal experiences at the inn, which was built at 134 N. Mill St. in 1911. Viewers of the show will see evidence and firsthand accounts of supernatural encounters, according to a news release from the inn.

Host Zak Bagans will lead the group and use investigative techniques to uncover the inn's mysteries, according to the release. Jonathan Davis, lead singer of the nu metal band Korn, will be a guest investigator for the episode.

In the 20 years that her family has owned the hotel, De La Torre said she has experienced dozens of unexplained ghost encounters.

One of her first experiences with the paranormal was in 2004 when she was putting away supplies in the inn, De La Torre said. She thought one of the housekeepers had walked into the room but instead saw a “solid human being” dressed in vintage clothes who looked at De La Torre, turned and disappeared into the wall.

“I froze,” she said, adding she has not witnessed anything as traumatic since.

A recent photo of three women shot at the hotel shows a shadowy figure lurking in the background, she said.

De La Torre, who is a director of events and runs the inn's gift shop, said this was the second time “Ghost Adventures” featured the hotel. The first time was in 2013.

“The first time it aired, we definitely saw an increase in bookings and a lot of phone calls, a lot of traffic to our website, a lot of curiosity,” she said. “We're excited to see what the second episode reveals.”

In 2022, television personality Sharon Osbourne was hospitalized with an injury at the inn. It occurred during a filming of “Jack Osbourne's Night of Terror.” She was taken to Santa Paula Hospital and later discharged, according to her son, but no additional details were provided about her medical circumstances.

“My mom (owner Rosanna Jennett) was just in shock. We've never had anyone have a physical reaction to whatever is here ever,” said De La Torre, adding it is unclear what exactly happened.

De La Torre said they are grateful Osbourne has recovered and hope she returns.

Wild conspiracy theories have flooded the internet following a widespread power cut that rocked Spain and Portugal on Monday.

Internet sleuths have floated bizarre theories from alien attacks to US EMP strikes, as information on what triggered the nationwide blackouts remains scarce. 

The massive outage left thousands of people stranded in trains and elevators, while millions saw phone and internet coverage die. 

Lights began to flicker back to life late last night, with authorities confirming this morning that more than 90% of power had been restored in the Iberian Peninsula.

No concrete cause for the blackout has yet emerged, but Eduardo Prieto, the head of services for Spain's national electricity grid said on Tuesday morning a 'cybersecurity incident' had been ruled out. 

He also added that there was nothing to suggest that 'there was any kind of intrusion' into the operator's control system, adding that it was quite possible that the affected generation was solar, but it was to early to say for sure.

Meanwhile, Spain's top criminal court said on Tuesday it was investigating whether the huge blackout that paralysed the Iberian Peninsula was 'an act of computer sabotage on critical infrastructure'.

While Spaniards wait for the government to come forward with a full explanation for the outage, wild rumours and conspiracy theories have started to circle online over what could be behind the rare blackout. 

Some unconfirmed reports yesterday appeared to suggest that the outage could have been caused by a meteorological or atmospheric phenomena. 

Online sleuths were quick to add to this suggestion, arguing that the change in atmospheric vibrations had been caused by aliens.   

'Who in their right mind would believe such a BS reason for the power going out? (The blackout was attributed to a rare atmospheric phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration.') I say, Aliens', one user said on social platform X. 

'Definitely aliens are more believable than 'oh, oops the grid overheated',' another added.

A third online conspiracy theorist suggested that aliens were behind the deactivation of weapons being tested for a possible third world war, noting that the extraterrestrials are 'going to give you a hint as to what really happened in [today's] blackout/power outage'. 

Other keyboard warriors have taken to social media platforms to suggest Spain and Portugal had been attacked by electromagnetic pulse weapons, also known as EMPs. 

These are devices that create pulses of energy to disable electrical systems. 

One user on TikTok who said they were based in the Spanish city of Valencia believed that they had been struck by EMPs, saying that 'when it happened it sounded so weird and it went out. No phone service, no power, it was apocalyptic'.

Another agreed, commenting: 'I [have] been saying EMP from the jump'.

On X, one account suggested that the proposed theory of atmospheric oscillations being the cause for the blackout pointed to EMPs.

'I hate being correct sometimes… Frequency Weapons 101: Advanced militaries and black-budget programs have long explored and experimented with electromagnetic (EM) and directed-energy weapons that manipulate frequencies to disrupt infrastructure….', the online sleuth wrote. 

'High-voltage lines are susceptible to frequency interference. A weaponized frequency pulse could induce harmonic oscillations, overloading transformers and triggering a domino-effect blackout—EXACTLY what Iberia saw', the account added.

Other vocal conspiracy theorists have insisted that chemtrails that are often seen in the sky were part of a coordinated attempt to manipulate Spain and Portugal's power systems.

Chemtrails are a visible trail left in the sky by airplanes, but some people believe that they are chemical agents released as part as a covert operation. 

Following Tuesday's massive blackout, one X user wrote that there were 'dark entities' trying to 'push back against an energetic shift that's been building momentum across Europe especially.'

The online conspiracy theorist went on to say that the chemtrails were 'part of a physical layer of energetic dampening introduced by a dark force. 

Spanish authorities were quick to confirm that there was no reason to believe that a cyberattack caused the widespread power-cut, but others insisted that they still believed this to be the case. 

On TikTok, conspiracies suggested that the Iberian grid system had been hacked by the US. 

'The truth is that the power grid systems of these countries have been hacked. There us only one country in the world with this ability, and that its the United States, which has deployed the Prism program', one TikTok commenter said, adding: 'This is a warning'. 

Others believed the outage was the result of a cyberattack orchestrated by Russia's Vladimir Putin to  'practice before declaring a war on the West,' according to one X account. 

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that the government's priorities were twofold: restoring Spain's electrical system and finding the causes of the blackout so that a similar event 'never takes place again.'

By 7 a.m. today more than 99% of energy demand in Spain had been restored, the country's electricity operator Red Eléctrica said. 

Portuguese grid operator REN said all 89 power substations were back online and power had been restored to all 6.4 million customers. 

As life began to return to normal — with schools and offices reopening, traffic easing and public transport restarting — the authorities in Spain have yet to provide further explanations for what caused one of the most serious blackouts to ever take place in Europe. 

By 11 a.m. Tuesday, service on Madrid's metro system was fully restored. In Barcelona, the system was operating normally, but commuter trains were suspended due to 'electrical instability,' the company that runs the service, Rodalies Catalunya, said on X.

In some parts of the country, commuter and mid-distance services were still suspended or running at reduced capacity.

Emergency workers in Spain said they had rescued some 35,000 passengers on Monday stranded along railways and underground, with the blackout turning sports centers, train stations and airports into makeshift overnight refuges.

Lou Sanders is a stand-up comic who has appeared on 8 out of 10 Cats, QI and Radio 4's The Unbelievable Truth. She won the eighth series of the comedy game show Taskmaster and most recently has tried to keep a straight face on LOL: Last One Laughing UK. She is a vegan and shares her Margate home with two cats, which she nurtures with the help of a pet psychic and a spiritual healer and describes as “the loves of my life”.

Baby and Bobert are ragdoll cats. They are brothers, three years old in July. They're bloody gorgeous and I love them, but if I had my time again I would get bin cats [rescues]. I say that because you're saving a cat if you adopt … and maybe they're just a bit more grateful? Mine are little princes.

I had a cat called Crunchie, because he was orange like the middle of a Crunchie bar. When we moved to France for a year we had to rehome him with a lady. When he was with her he phoned America. He sat on the phone and it got through to America and he was in the local paper. Then I had one called Etoile. That means star in French. I named her. How pretentious is that? I was 13, and I was terrible. We never really bonded.

Yeah, I'm excited to come home to them. I can't wait to see them when I come back off tour. I actually get giddy as I get to the door, I'm like, oh my God, I'm going to see my boys. They are the loves of my life, but I think about this quite a lot and it's like, if you've got slight commitment issues is it the safest version of [a relationship]? Because they can't answer back and you tell them what to do and when they eat? Maybe I'm like a horrible controlling man? 

Really they're just happy with “finger under the blanket”. It sounds rude but it's not, it's just, you know, putting your finger under the blanket and waggling it. Because I've moved [from London to Margate] and I've got a big garden now, and Bobert can't believe his luck.

• Bill Bailey on life with his two dogs and four cockatoos

Bob has three legs. His leg was broken when he escaped from the house in London and got run over. I tried everything I could to save it. [As well as the vet] I had three healers, homeopathy, you name it. The thing that he really needed was cage rest, but when I put him in the cage he'd go mental, knocking from one side to the other. We went through three different cages and he'd just bash around and it just wasn't healing. So we had to lop it off. He was depressed and hid in the cupboard for three weeks, but now he's absolutely fine and loving life. I think animals process things in a different way. They grieve and then they're back in the moment.

Oh God, yeah. They didn't sleep in my bed last night and then I'm like, boys, what's wrong with you? Let's talk about it. But I think it's because they saw my suitcase. I'm off on tour for another six nights. I said to them, who do you think affords the garden? You don't get this garden if Mother doesn't go to work, you know.

Baby can jump through hoops. Bob will just sit there thinking, well, you are going to give me a treat anyway, so I'll just stay here thanks.

I would take a guess at ten grand a year, including food. With vet's bills, the year Bobert had his leg lopped off, we were looking at £20k. That's including the pet psychic.

She is called Petra and she's lovely. She said to me Bobert loves the garden and Baby loves the velvet sofa. And Bobert knows you worry about him going out in the garden, but he said he's fine.

I've also got a guy called Christophe, who's a healer/energy worker, and he can tap into their field as well. I mean, I sound mad, don't I? But here we are. Actually I phoned Christophe the other day because I do get worried about Bobert going out with his three paws at night, in case a fox gets him. I was coming back late at night. My neighbour had popped round and she called him and he didn't come in. He'd been out for ten hours, so I thought he was dead. I texted Christophe and he said, oh no, he's absolutely fine. And when I got home Bobert was on my bed. So Christophe knows.

I was going to say the dress-up thing, but actually if they don't mind it, it's OK. I put a bonnet on mine once — I won't be doing that again. I don't love when a dog licks the mouth of the owner. That goes on a lot. God, there was that actor [Justin Theroux] who shared spaghetti with their dog and they were just chowing down on the same bowl. And I thought, Jesus Christ [makes disgusted noise]. It's gross.

The house in Margate? I did move, not for them completely, but I did move so they would have a safe garden, because I thought in London they've just got this little bit of concrete.

I do think on a fundamental level they can understand us. Not words, but what you mean. Bobert used to piss on the bed sometimes. And I sat him down for a chat and said, you know, when you do this, I've got to go to the laundry, you know, it's 20 quid each time. It's a lot of admin. I understand you're upset. I've made some jokes about you, and I apologise for that. I do feel like we cleared the air. And then he never did it again for about eight months.

Bobert's got a friend, a black cat from two doors down and they go about together on adventures. Sometimes the black cat comes to the back door and calls for him.

Before we moved, when we were in London, I put a pet TV channel on — it's like birds and squirrels, and they'd lose their minds. The squirrels would come on and Bobert would be pawing at the screen, and would check out behind the TV. And then, when we moved, we got the garden and Bobert saw a real squirrel and he couldn't believe his eyes. It was so lovely to witness. I did put the TV on the other day for them, and they were like, nah, we'll have the real thing.

I've always wanted a pet monkey, or a big cat. If it's a fantasy where it isn't dangerous, I think a lion, with a monkey on the side.

Spoiler alert: The following article contains details about the series finale for You.


You showrunners Michael Foley and Justin Lo always knew Penn Badgley‘s murderous and manipulative Joe Goldberg would have to face the music at the conclusion of the Netflix thriller series — but in one alternate supernatural ending, it wouldn't be on the mortal realm.


	In a new interview with the New York Post, the co-executive producers devised a “very early iteration” of the denouement that would feature Joe finding out he's a ghost after he's been shot by this season's new love interest, Madeline Brewer's Bronte.

	“We went through many different options, one of which being that he did die at the hands of Bronte,” Lo explained. “I was even remembering a version where he was shot. And [the audience] didn't realize that he [got] shot until the very last episode, and then he realizes he's a ghost.”

	Ultimately, Season 5 sees Joe behind bars and with his nether regions blown off by gunshot, with the majority of his remaining victims having survived his glass box, predatory cloying and delusional self-aggrandizement. In the finale's last moments, the show's signature voiceover alludes heavily to the fact that Joe still views himself as the victim of an unjust society, rather than a menacing serial killer.


	“We liked putting him in a veritable cage [in prison]. We liked him not knowing the touch of a lover,” Foley explained, adding that “it was late in the season” when the writers' room “finally locked that down.” 


	“Throughout the series, there was a shared belief among the writers and the creators that Joe wouldn't get away with his crimes,” he said, adding that death would be “too easy” of an ending for the character. “We came into the season knowing that we didn't want to redeem him, that he would get his comeuppance, that he was going to face some of those whose lives he ruined. And most importantly, we knew he was going to be made to face himself.” 


	It's a sentiment echoed by star Badgley, who told Deadline recently that “the right choice” was made in terms of how the abuser is brought to justice: “What is best, not just for Joe, but the person who then has to do it? If somebody was to kill him — and it would be a woman, right — well then actually now what you've burdened her with is having committed murder, like that's not just, I don't think. Torture? Uh OK, same thing. Prison? Eh, feels a bit not enough. So what do you do? Take. His. Balls.”

Misha Collins shared a look at what went down during #SPNMINN when he left his phone in the green room - and Jensen Ackles found it.

Over this past weekend, we had a chance to pass along some of what went down when Supernatural and The Boys co-stars Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins made their way to Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Minneapolis" – including insights into Ackles' upcoming Prime Video series, Countdown, and Padalecki's experience filming the final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's Prime Video series. Earlier today, Collins also offered a behind-the-scenes look at the shenanigans that go on behind the scenes. Specifically, what happens when Collins leaves his phone in the green room during the fan event and Ackles gets his hands on it…

"Jensen got into my phone again in the green room. Do I never learn? (The last image is an 8X10 photo that was sitting on the table. He doctored it with a red Sharpie. )," Collins wrote as the caption to his social media posts, including the evidence of Ackles' mischief:

Taking the stage during the Jus In Bello (JIB 15) convention in Italy earlier this month, Padalecki thanked the crowd before noting that Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins made their way out for the event after filming The Boys on Thursday. Before continuing, Ackles interjected to add jokingly, "For Season 16 of 'Supernatural…," with Padalecki adding, "If only." From there, Collins shared that the three of them reunited with The Boys and Supernatural director/EP Philip Sgriccia (who is directing them this season) – before the three of them were asked to preemptively apologize to everyone on the set, getting a good laugh from the crowd. "It didn't take long for them to realize why," Ackles added. Padalecki explained that because they've known each other for so long, they have a way of communicating with each other during filming that might surprise some folks at first. Here's a look at a clip from the event – and huge thanks once again to Fangasm for getting the word out there:
