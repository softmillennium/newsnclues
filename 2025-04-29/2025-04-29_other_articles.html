                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atletico Madrid star Marcos Llorente and his wife have taken to social media to give their controversial take on the blackouts in Spain that affected their travel plans on Monday. Spain, Portugal and parts of France experienced a massive power outage for several hours on Monday. Llorente had spent the weekend in Marbella with his wife, Patricia Noarbe, and their daughter, Amor, and the trio were on their way back to Madrid when their train became trapped in a tunnel near Cordoba due to the blackouts. They subsequently got off the train and walked with their luggage alongside the tracks, and Llorente posted their alternative journey on Instagram alongside the message: 'Life happens and "conspiracies" become reality.' His post did not go down too well with some fans on Instagram, but Llorente doubled down as he followed up writing: 'In a world of madmen, it's the sane man who's called mad.' Llorente's wife also appeared curious as to the cause of the blackouts as she uploaded her own controversial message on Instagram. Alongside an image of the sky with contrails - the thin, white lines left behind by aircrafts - Noarbe wrote: 'And how many flights do you hear today...' She added: 'If you continue to think that this is condensation from commercial aircraft instead of geoengineering, it is because you do not want to look at the sky, or the BOE/AEMET or the WMO...' Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has not given the reason for the blackouts yet, but admitted 'this can never happen again'. However, play resumed as normal on Tuesday after power returned across Spain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There has always been some sort of fascination with the paranormal. There have been so many movies made on the subject, there have been so many reality and non-reality shows, haunted houses, ghost hunters, etc. For some reason, maybe because we can't decide if it's real or not, we have a strange curiosity. And it actually sounds kind of fun. But also weird at the same time, and definitely isn't for everyone. I don't really like being scared, but if it's done correctly, could be intriguing. One question: why wouldn't this be done closer to Halloween? Anyway, this show will be set up outside of the Crossroads Mall under a few tents. There was a water show, and now this Paranormal show, which apparently was done before, but I don't remember that one. Probably because it does freak me out... a little. Cloud at the Crossroads Center Mall later in May. There are several showings to choose from, too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An episode of "Ghost Adventures" will center on the historic Glen Tavern Inn in Santa Paula, which many people have claimed is haunted. Viewers of the show will see evidence and firsthand accounts of supernatural encounters, according to a news release from the inn. Jonathan Davis, lead singer of the nu metal band Korn, will be a guest investigator for the episode. In the 20 years that her family has owned the hotel, De La Torre said she has experienced dozens of unexplained ghost encounters. One of her first experiences with the paranormal was in 2004 when she was putting away supplies in the inn, De La Torre said. She thought one of the housekeepers had walked into the room but instead saw a “solid human being” dressed in vintage clothes who looked at De La Torre, turned and disappeared into the wall. A recent photo of three women shot at the hotel shows a shadowy figure lurking in the background, she said. “The first time it aired, we definitely saw an increase in bookings and a lot of phone calls, a lot of traffic to our website, a lot of curiosity,” she said. “We're excited to see what the second episode reveals.” In 2022, television personality Sharon Osbourne was hospitalized with an injury at the inn. It occurred during a filming of “Jack Osbourne's Night of Terror.” She was taken to Santa Paula Hospital and later discharged, according to her son, but no additional details were provided about her medical circumstances. “My mom (owner Rosanna Jennett) was just in shock. We've never had anyone have a physical reaction to whatever is here ever,” said De La Torre, adding it is unclear what exactly happened. De La Torre said they are grateful Osbourne has recovered and hope she returns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wild conspiracy theories have flooded the internet following a widespread power cut that rocked Spain and Portugal on Monday. Internet sleuths have floated bizarre theories from alien attacks to US EMP strikes, as information on what triggered the nationwide blackouts remains scarce. Lights began to flicker back to life late last night, with authorities confirming this morning that more than 90% of power had been restored in the Iberian Peninsula. No concrete cause for the blackout has yet emerged, but Eduardo Prieto, the head of services for Spain's national electricity grid said on Tuesday morning a 'cybersecurity incident' had been ruled out. Meanwhile, Spain's top criminal court said on Tuesday it was investigating whether the huge blackout that paralysed the Iberian Peninsula was 'an act of computer sabotage on critical infrastructure'. While Spaniards wait for the government to come forward with a full explanation for the outage, wild rumours and conspiracy theories have started to circle online over what could be behind the rare blackout. Some unconfirmed reports yesterday appeared to suggest that the outage could have been caused by a meteorological or atmospheric phenomena. Online sleuths were quick to add to this suggestion, arguing that the change in atmospheric vibrations had been caused by aliens. 'Who in their right mind would believe such a BS reason for the power going out? I say, Aliens', one user said on social platform X. 'Definitely aliens are more believable than 'oh, oops the grid overheated',' another added. A third online conspiracy theorist suggested that aliens were behind the deactivation of weapons being tested for a possible third world war, noting that the extraterrestrials are 'going to give you a hint as to what really happened in [today's] blackout/power outage'. Other keyboard warriors have taken to social media platforms to suggest Spain and Portugal had been attacked by electromagnetic pulse weapons, also known as EMPs. These are devices that create pulses of energy to disable electrical systems. One user on TikTok who said they were based in the Spanish city of Valencia believed that they had been struck by EMPs, saying that 'when it happened it sounded so weird and it went out. Another agreed, commenting: 'I [have] been saying EMP from the jump'. Other vocal conspiracy theorists have insisted that chemtrails that are often seen in the sky were part of a coordinated attempt to manipulate Spain and Portugal's power systems. Chemtrails are a visible trail left in the sky by airplanes, but some people believe that they are chemical agents released as part as a covert operation. Following Tuesday's massive blackout, one X user wrote that there were 'dark entities' trying to 'push back against an energetic shift that's been building momentum across Europe especially.' The online conspiracy theorist went on to say that the chemtrails were 'part of a physical layer of energetic dampening introduced by a dark force. 'The truth is that the power grid systems of these countries have been hacked. By 7 a.m. today more than 99% of energy demand in Spain had been restored, the country's electricity operator Red Eléctrica said. By 11 a.m. Tuesday, service on Madrid's metro system was fully restored. In some parts of the country, commuter and mid-distance services were still suspended or running at reduced capacity. Emergency workers in Spain said they had rescued some 35,000 passengers on Monday stranded along railways and underground, with the blackout turning sports centers, train stations and airports into makeshift overnight refuges.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lou Sanders is a stand-up comic who has appeared on 8 out of 10 Cats, QI and Radio 4's The Unbelievable Truth. She won the eighth series of the comedy game show Taskmaster and most recently has tried to keep a straight face on LOL: Last One Laughing UK. She is a vegan and shares her Margate home with two cats, which she nurtures with the help of a pet psychic and a spiritual healer and describes as “the loves of my life”. Baby and Bobert are ragdoll cats. They are brothers, three years old in July. I say that because you're saving a cat if you adopt … and maybe they're just a bit more grateful? I had a cat called Crunchie, because he was orange like the middle of a Crunchie bar. When we moved to France for a year we had to rehome him with a lady. He sat on the phone and it got through to America and he was in the local paper. Then I had one called Etoile. They are the loves of my life, but I think about this quite a lot and it's like, if you've got slight commitment issues is it the safest version of [a relationship]? Because they can't answer back and you tell them what to do and when they eat? Maybe I'm like a horrible controlling man? Really they're just happy with “finger under the blanket”. Because I've moved [from London to Margate] and I've got a big garden now, and Bobert can't believe his luck. • Bill Bailey on life with his two dogs and four cockatoos His leg was broken when he escaped from the house in London and got run over. [As well as the vet] I had three healers, homeopathy, you name it. The thing that he really needed was cage rest, but when I put him in the cage he'd go mental, knocking from one side to the other. We went through three different cages and he'd just bash around and it just wasn't healing. So we had to lop it off. He was depressed and hid in the cupboard for three weeks, but now he's absolutely fine and loving life. I think animals process things in a different way. They didn't sleep in my bed last night and then I'm like, boys, what's wrong with you? But I think it's because they saw my suitcase. I'm off on tour for another six nights. I said to them, who do you think affords the garden? You don't get this garden if Mother doesn't go to work, you know. Bob will just sit there thinking, well, you are going to give me a treat anyway, so I'll just stay here thanks. With vet's bills, the year Bobert had his leg lopped off, we were looking at £20k. She said to me Bobert loves the garden and Baby loves the velvet sofa. And Bobert knows you worry about him going out in the garden, but he said he's fine. I've also got a guy called Christophe, who's a healer/energy worker, and he can tap into their field as well. Actually I phoned Christophe the other day because I do get worried about Bobert going out with his three paws at night, in case a fox gets him. I was coming back late at night. My neighbour had popped round and she called him and he didn't come in. And when I got home Bobert was on my bed. I was going to say the dress-up thing, but actually if they don't mind it, it's OK. I put a bonnet on mine once — I won't be doing that again. God, there was that actor [Justin Theroux] who shared spaghetti with their dog and they were just chowing down on the same bowl. And I thought, Jesus Christ [makes disgusted noise]. I did move, not for them completely, but I did move so they would have a safe garden, because I thought in London they've just got this little bit of concrete. I do think on a fundamental level they can understand us. Not words, but what you mean. Bobert used to piss on the bed sometimes. And I sat him down for a chat and said, you know, when you do this, I've got to go to the laundry, you know, it's 20 quid each time. I do feel like we cleared the air. And then he never did it again for about eight months. Bobert's got a friend, a black cat from two doors down and they go about together on adventures. Sometimes the black cat comes to the back door and calls for him. Before we moved, when we were in London, I put a pet TV channel on — it's like birds and squirrels, and they'd lose their minds. The squirrels would come on and Bobert would be pawing at the screen, and would check out behind the TV. And then, when we moved, we got the garden and Bobert saw a real squirrel and he couldn't believe his eyes. It was so lovely to witness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You showrunners Michael Foley and Justin Lo always knew Penn Badgley‘s murderous and manipulative Joe Goldberg would have to face the music at the conclusion of the Netflix thriller series — but in one alternate supernatural ending, it wouldn't be on the mortal realm. In a new interview with the New York Post, the co-executive producers devised a “very early iteration” of the denouement that would feature Joe finding out he's a ghost after he's been shot by this season's new love interest, Madeline Brewer's Bronte. Netflix Developing Drama 'The 99'ers' On 1999 U.S. Women's National Soccer Team; 'Watchmen's Nicole Kassell To Direct “We went through many different options, one of which being that he did die at the hands of Bronte,” Lo explained. Ultimately, Season 5 sees Joe behind bars and with his nether regions blown off by gunshot, with the majority of his remaining victims having survived his glass box, predatory cloying and delusional self-aggrandizement. We liked him not knowing the touch of a lover,” Foley explained, adding that “it was late in the season” when the writers' room “finally locked that down.” “We came into the season knowing that we didn't want to redeem him, that he would get his comeuppance, that he was going to face some of those whose lives he ruined. It's a sentiment echoed by star Badgley, who told Deadline recently that “the right choice” was made in terms of how the abuser is brought to justice: “What is best, not just for Joe, but the person who then has to do it? If somebody was to kill him — and it would be a woman, right — well then actually now what you've burdened her with is having committed murder, like that's not just, I don't think.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, CW, TV | Tagged: Supernatural, the boys Misha Collins shared a look at what went down during #SPNMINN when he left his phone in the green room - and Jensen Ackles found it. Over this past weekend, we had a chance to pass along some of what went down when Supernatural and The Boys co-stars Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins made their way to Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Minneapolis" – including insights into Ackles' upcoming Prime Video series, Countdown, and Padalecki's experience filming the final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's Prime Video series. Specifically, what happens when Collins leaves his phone in the green room during the fan event and Ackles gets his hands on it… "Jensen got into my phone again in the green room. He doctored it with a red Sharpie. Jensen got into my phone again in the green room. Before continuing, Ackles interjected to add jokingly, "For Season 16 of 'Supernatural…," with Padalecki adding, "If only." "It didn't take long for them to realize why," Ackles added. Padalecki explained that because they've known each other for so long, they have a way of communicating with each other during filming that might surprise some folks at first. Here's a look at a clip from the event – and huge thanks once again to Fangasm for getting the word out there:</p>
