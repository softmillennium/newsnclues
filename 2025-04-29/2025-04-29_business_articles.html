                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected earnings and another quarter of same-store sales declines, but the coffee giant said its turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success. "Our financial results don't yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan," CEO Brian Niccol said in a video posted on the company's website. Shares of the company were roughly flat in extended trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Starbucks reported fiscal second-quarter net income attributable to the company of $384.2 million, or 34 cents per share, halved from $772.4 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Labor costs rose as it staffed its U.S. cafes with more baristas. Excluding restructuring costs, the company earned 41 cents per share. The company's sales have slumped as consumers in the U.S. and China, its two largest markets, seek cheaper coffee options. Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting "back to Starbucks" and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience. While the early stages of the turnaround have not yielded improvements in its financial results, Niccol said the company's new marketing is resonating with customers, and service speeds are improving. One of his goals for the company is to complete every order in four minutes or less. In Starbucks' home market, the traffic decline was even steeper. U.S. locations saw transactions fall 4%, dragging its same-store sales down 2%. China's same-store sales were flat for the quarter, as a lower average ticket offset transaction growth. In October, the company suspended its forecast for fiscal 2025 as it unveiled the early stages of its turnaround strategy. The plan has included layoffs for its white-collar workers. In late February, Starbucks announced it would cut 1,100 corporate positions, plus several hundred unfilled roles, as part of the turnaround plan. The company also plans to overhaul its innovation process and improve the customer experience by fixing staffing levels, standards and the algorithm that tells baristas what drinks to make.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday teased that the Trump administration has reached its first trade deal, but said it was not fully finalized and declined to name the country involved. Lutnick did say that he was not dealing directly with China. He said those negotiations were in the "portfolio" of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Lutnick's comments come nearly a full month after "liberation day," when President Donald Trump rolled out widespread tariff hikes on most of the world. Many of those levies have since been paused for 90 days, but the tariffs on China have been hiked to more than 100%. The Trump administration has said that dozens of countries have reached out about making a deal in recent weeks, but no agreement has been officially announced. Japan, South Korea and India have been seen as some of the most likely candidates for deals. When asked about Lutnick's comments on Fox Business later Tuesday, Bessent declined to say if a deal had been reached with any country. "I'm not going to get ahead of the president. Nothing's done until President Trump announces it. So we should wait to hear from President Trump over the next couple of days," Bessent said. The uncertainty around tariffs has sparked volatility in the stock market and declining confidence among business leaders and consumers, according to multiple surveys. Wall Street saw steep downturns after the initial tariff rollout, but stocks have rebounded over the past week. Lutnick's interview with CNBC's "The Exchange" took place in Arizona at the construction site of a semiconductor factory. Increased U.S. manufacturing is one of Lutnick's stated goals for the Trump administration's tariff policies. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

UPS reports that small companies can't afford to stock up and are at the back of the line for supply alternatives.

Chinese manufacturers aren't slowing production. They're selling those wares to countries other than the US.

President Donald Trump took aim at China with his cannon shot of 145% tariffs and ended up with a direct hit on US small businesses. That's the takeaway from United Parcel Service Inc.'s earnings conference call, which gave a glimpse of the damage already taking hold across the US economy.

Many small businesses rely on China as their sole source for imported goods and are now scrambling along with larger ones for alternatives. Phone calls from large companies seeking to move production outside of China, to places such as Vietnam or Thailand, are taken first, leaving the small importers hanging, UPS Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON — Britain on Tuesday published draft legislation for the cryptocurrency industry, touting greater collaboration with the U.S. as it looks to regulate the wild world of digital assets. Speaking at a fintech event Tuesday, U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced plans for a "comprehensive regulatory regime for crypto assets," adding that the proposals would aim to make the country a "world leader in digital assets." The rules will bring crypto exchanges, dealers and agents into the regulatory fold, "cracking down on bad actors while supporting legitimate innovation," the U.K.'s Treasury department said in a statement released following Reeves' remarks. "Crypto firms with UK customers will also have to meet clear standards on transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience — just like firms in traditional finance," the Treasury's statement added. Reeves said that the U.K. planned to deepen regulatory cooperation with the U.S. to boost "responsible" adoption of digital assets. "For the U.K. to be a world leader in digital assets, international cooperation is vital," she told attendees at fintech industry group Innovate Finance's annual summit. The U.K. finance minister met with her U.S. counterpart Scott Bessent last week to discuss a trade deal. She had previously said that improving business ties with the European Union was "arguably even more important." "Regulation must support business, not hold it back," Reeves said Thursday. Crypto industry insiders say the Financial Conduct Authority — which is the U.K.'s financial services watchdog — has been too restrictive when it comes to approving registrations from digital asset firms.

US President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump is finally getting on the road to promote his agenda, after spending much of his first 100 days in office ensconced in the White House or his private clubs.

Trump on Tuesday is traveling to suburban Detroit to make a speech touting his second-term record. In May, he'll deliver two commencement addresses and travel to the Middle East. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have released their plan to overhaul the country's student loan and financial aid system, calling for limits on student borrowing and a reduction to the repayment options for borrowers. The GOP measure, known as the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, is aimed at helping Republicans pass President Donald Trump's tax cuts. "For decades Congress has responded to the student loan crisis by throwing more and more taxpayer dollars at the problem — never addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs," committee Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said in a statement. More from Personal Finance:Is college still worth it? It is for most, but not allHow to maximize your college financial aid offerWhat student loan forgiveness opportunities remain under Trump "The committee's current proposal would severely restrict college access by slashing financial aid programs, eliminating basic consumer protections and making it harder to repay student loan debt," said Sameer Gadkaree, president and CEO of The Institute for College Access & Success. Under the proposal, undergraduate students would face a borrowing cap of $50,000 in federal student loans starting July 1, 2026, while graduate students couldn't take out more than $100,000. Current limits vary by factors including student status and year of schooling, but for many people, the caps will mean they can borrow less. Those limits "will shift some borrowing to private student loans," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. That's a concern for Kantrowitz and other consumer advocates, who point out that private student loans come with far fewer borrower protections than federal student loans. IDR plans aim to make monthly payments affordable for borrowers by capping the bills at a portion of their discretionary income. More than 12 million people were enrolled in IDR plans as of September 2024, according to Kantrowitz. It would also eliminate the unemployment deferment and economic hardship deferment for federal student loan borrowers, on debt taken out during or after July 2025. Full eligibility for Pell Grants would also require students to be enrolled at a minimum of 30 hours each academic year, up from the current requirement of 12 hours per semester. The federal Pell Grant program, signed into law in 1965, is one of the largest sources of financial aid available to college students. Meanwhile, the grants would be expanded for short-term workforce training programs. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The move would have affected items sold on Haul, Amazon's answer to Chinese discount retailer Temu, which offers apparel, home goods and other items priced at $20 or less. Haul, which Amazon launched last year, is separate from its main storefront. "The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products," Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. "This was never approved and is not going to happen." Amazon weighed adding a separate line item to products on Haul in response to Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole, according to a source familiar with the matter. The consideration was not related to Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China, they added. Punchbowl News reported earlier on Tuesday that Amazon would "soon" begin displaying the cost of tariffs alongside the price of each product, citing a source familiar with the company's plans. After Amazon clarified its statement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in an X post called it a "good move." Bezos, Amazon's founder and top shareholder, has tried to establish a friendly rapport with President Donald Trump in the lead up to and during Trump's second term in office. Bezos dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and stood alongside top tech executives at Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Amazon, for its part, donated to Trump's inaugural fund, and spent a reported $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Amazon and other retailers are digesting the impact of Trump's new tariffs. Earlier this month, Amazon began reaching out to its vast network of third-party sellers to gauge how the tariffs are impacting their logistics, product sourcing and operations. Some sellers have already raised prices and cut back on advertising spend as they confront higher import costs. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC sellers would likely "need to pass that cost" of tariffs on to consumers. — NBC News' Garrett Haake contributed reporting to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"This is a hostile and political act by Amazon," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. She added, "This is another reason why Americans should buy American." Shares of the online retail giant founded by Jeff Bezos dropped more than 2% in premarket trading immediately following the remarks. By noon, the stock had recovered its losses. Less than two hours after the press briefing, an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that the company was only ever considering listing tariff charges on some products for Amazon Haul, its budget-focused shopping section. "The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered listing import charges on certain products," the spokesperson said. But in a follow-up statement an hour after that one, the spokesperson clarified that the plan to show tariff surcharges was "never approved" and is "not going to happen." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in an X post called Amazon's statement a "good move." The Trump administration's aggression stemmed from Punchbowl News' report earlier Tuesday that Amazon will soon show consumers how much of an item's cost comes from tariffs. A journalist in Tuesday's press briefing asked Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if they agreed that the reported move was a "crystal-clear demonstration that it's the American consumer, and not China, who is going to have to pay for these policies." Leavitt also said the company's decision was "not a surprise," saying Reuters "recently" wrote that Amazon has "partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm." She held up a print-out of a Reuters report from December 2021 that Amazon complied with an edict from Beijing's government that it remove customer reviews and ratings from a book of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speeches and writings. Amazon is not the first retailer to put a spotlight on how new tariffs are changing its prices. China-based fast fashion giants Shein and Temu have both added massive surcharges in recent days. Temu now includes a line on its checkout tally showing an "import charge" that adds around 145% for each item. Leavitt's response could signal an emerging rift between Trump and Bezos, who has joined other billionaires and tech leaders in cozying up to the Republican president since he won the 2024 election. After frequently catching Trump's ire in years past, Bezos in December expressed optimism about the Republican's second term, saying he believes Trump has grown calmer and more confident. The same month, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Bezos drew further accusations of seeking to court Trump when he forced the Washington Post, which he owns, to restrict its opinion section to publishing only pieces in defense of "personal liberties and free markets." But Amazon's business has come under strain in the face of Trump's sweeping tariffs plans — especially his 145% duty on China, where up to 70% of Amazon goods are sourced, according to Wedbush Securities. Leavitt, after delivering her statement on Amazon, was asked if Bezos is "still a Trump supporter." "Look, I will not speak to the president's relationships with Jeff Bezos, but I will tell you that this is certainly a hostile and political action by Amazon," she said. — CNBC's Annie Palmer and NBC News' Garrett Haake contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPS plans to slash 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting drive amid the shifting global trade landscape triggered by President Donald Trump's tariffs. The move comes as the shipping giant grapples with soft demand, especially from its largest customers. UPS said it would also look to close 73 facilities by the end of June. "With our action, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS," the company's CEO, Carol Tomé, said in a statement on Tuesday. Tomé said that the transformation would help UPS adapt to "a changing trade environment" and better position it for long-term growth. UPS made the announcement alongside its first-quarter 2025 earnings report, which showed a slight revenue dip to $21.5 billion — down 0.7% from the same period last year — while its adjusted operating profit inched up 0.9% to $1.7 billion. Its supply chain business suffered the most last quarter, with revenue plunging nearly 15%, primarily due to the divestiture of Coyote Logistics. The cost-cutting drive comes after UPS told investors earlier this year it would reduce its Amazon business by 50% by mid-2026, citing profitability reasons. "This was not their ask," Tomé said on an investor call in January. This was UPS taking control of our destiny."</p>
