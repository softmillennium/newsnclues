Chris Coons, a top ally of former President Biden, was pressed by CNN anchor John Berman over whether he regretting defending the former president's fitness for office in 2024, even as fellow Democrats raised concerns at the time. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., was pressed Tuesday on whether he regretted criticizing fellow Democrats over their reservations about former President Joe Biden following his disastrous 2024 debate performance. CNN anchor John Berman cited authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' reporting in their book about the presidential campaign that Coons knew Biden's debate performance was bad, but still chose to accuse his Democratic colleagues of "bed-wetting" as they expressed concerns over the former president. "Now, there are some people who've written on this, including Jim Geraghty in the National Review, who say, if you felt that way, maybe you shouldn't have criticized Democrats for their reservations about President Biden at the time. "Obviously, if I had any idea that President Biden was going to perform as poorly as he did at that debate, I would have been advising him differently and advocating differently. That debate performance was the first time I saw anything like that out of President Biden," Coons responded. Sen. Chris Coons spoke to CNN on Tuesday about whether he would have dealt with the fallout of former President Biden's disastrous debate differently. I was genuinely surprised by that performance that evening and was wrestling with what it meant for our path forward," he told Berman. Allen and Parnes wrote that Coons received several texts from his colleagues that pointed out the performance by Biden was "terrible," and that he was expected to answer for the president. An excerpt from the book read: "Now, jet-lagged, he found himself thrust into the unusual position of protecting Biden from Democratic senators. If he did, it would only feed the frenzy. He shot back texts accusing his colleagues of bed-wetting, telling them to put their big-kid pants on and asking what was wrong with them that they would so easily go faithless on the president." Delaware Sen. Chris Coons speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. In an interview on Fox News' "The Story" prior to the debate in early June, Coons dismissed reporting from The Wall Street Journal that cited lawmakers who felt the former president was showing signs of decline. "I think they got this wrong because they didn't use quotes from those of us who serve with President Biden, who know him, who have had the opportunity up-close-and-personal in meetings in the White House or in events publicly or privately, to give affirmation that he is sharp, he is engaged, and he is commanding," he said. After the debate – as Democrats and several media voices, including The New York Times editorial board, called on Biden to drop out of the race – Coons spoke to CNN on July 1 and demanded anyone who believed calling on Biden to drop out was the best way forward needed to "refocus."

Employees of a shop have their lunch, during a major power outage in Barcelona, Spain, Monday, April 28, 2025. BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The blackout that engulfed the Iberian Peninsula on Monday was chaotic and stressful for many. But it had a silver lining: People were forced away from their screens and into the “real” world, connecting with the present and one another. Some Spaniards and Portuguese embraced their day without power. In Barcelona's Gracia neighborhood, squares were packed with sunbathers and people reading books or playing chess. In Madrid, young and old gathered on sidewalks to listen to radios that, once obsolete, were suddenly lifelines. People in Sevilla clapped and tapped their feet to flamenco. Some neighbors spoke to each other for the first time. Staff at a non-profit foundation in Madrid's Embajadores neighborhood pulled tables onto sidewalks and challenged passersby to a friendly game of trivia. Others played UNO on public benches. Long lines formed for free ice cream that store owners decided to give away. On railway tracks in the middle of nowhere, stranded passengers practiced viral dance moves as they waited for rescue. Lisbon locals joined tourists at scenic viewpoints and partied under the stars. People across the peninsula sang a cappella or played their instruments in the dark. The world ceased its whirring and time stood still. There was boredom but also mindfulness. When lampposts finally lit up, crowds celebrated, shouting and waving their hands in the air as if their soccer team had scored.</p>

Cory Booker stumped for the Equality Act with Democrats on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of targeting transgender people. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused President Donald Trump's administration of targeting the transgender community on Tuesday, urging Congress to pass the Democrat-backed Equality Act. Booker made the emotional speech during an appearance on Capitol Hill alongside prominent Democrats from both the House and Senate. His speech, which lasted several minutes, borrowed heavily from the language of Martin Luther King, Jr. And so here we are again, introducing this bill. But it is not a normal time that we introduce this bill. We introduced it in the backdrop of a president that in his very campaign, singled out an opportunistic bigotry. We stand here in the backdrop of a time that LGBTQ Americans are being targeted and singled out for more injustice," Booker said. "I want you to know, we reintroduce this bill with attitude. We entered the bill Tuesday's bill with confidence, because there are a lot of people who are hearing our voice right now that don't understand that they are implicated. Sen. Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump's administration of "targeting" transgender people. "I remind those Americans, that even the truth, when crushed to the ground, after lie, after lie, after lie, that the truth will still rise again, that this is still one nation under God. That we still swear an oath of liberty and justice for all, and that we will not stop until freedom rings from every coast in this country. That freedom rings for every American, no matter who you are. "That we declare that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it doesn't bend automatically." "We declare today and every day until justice is established in this land, until the Equality Act passes, we declare that we, the people, will grab hold of that arc and pull and bend it until we live up to our promise in a country and truly are free at last, free at last," he finished. Rep. Nancy Pelosi greets Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer as Rep. Sarah McBride looks on, during a news conference to reintroduce the Equality Act, outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. The Equality Act would prohibit discrimination based on "sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity." Booker was joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., among other lawmakers. The legislative push comes as Trump's administration has pushed to end unpopular diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout the federal government. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. President Donald Trump has pushed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government. As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria's Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs. Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency's "Scientific Integrity Policy" implemented during the last few weeks of President Biden's term, to peel back any DEI requirements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish tennis legend Rafael Nadal exclusively told CNN Sports he completely trusts that world No. 1 Jannik Sinner is innocent, as the Italian prepares to return from a doping suspension. Sinner is approaching the end of a three-month ban having twice tested positive for banned substance Clostebol, an anabolic steroid, in March last year. Related article Jannik Sinner doesn't ‘deserve any of the hate' as he nears return from doping ban, says Jack Draper However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) subsequently lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), leading to Sinner accepting a suspension from February 9 to May 4. In a February statement, Sinner said that he has “always accepted that I am responsible for my team” but has always denied knowingly taking a banned substance. “I don't have a clear opinion, first of all, because I don't have the whole information,” Nadal told CNN after being honored with the Sporting Icon Award at this year's Laureus World Sports Awards. I don't think at all that Jannik wanted to do something that is not allowed, so I 100% believe in Jannik.” Sinner, for example, won't miss any grand slam events during his ban. Recently, Serena Williams said she would have been banned for “20 years” and “gotten grand slams taken away” if the same thing had happened to her. She did, though, describe Sinner as a “fantastic personality” and “great for the sport.” Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic said that the whole case was “not a good image for our sport.” But Nadal, who retired from tennis last year following a historic career, said he has full trust in the current anti-doping system. “From my point of view, I really don't believe that Jannik, because he's the No. 1 in the world, received different treatment than another person, from my perspective and from my understanding,” the 22-time grand slam singles champion said. Nadal, who won a record 14 Coupes des Mousquetaires at Roland Garros, said he hopes a potential Sinner win won't be tarnished by questions around his eligibility to play. Not only are both from Spain, but both are formidable on clay with Alcaraz winning his first French Open title last year. “I don't think for Carlos it's a big deal holding that pressure. Nadal said he occasionally messages Alcaraz but would always be on hand to provide some advice – not that he thinks the youngster needs it. However, Nadal has so far resisted following the likes of Andy Murray, who has gone into coaching after retiring from a playing career. “I mean in this life you can never say never,” he said, adding he was enjoying spending more time with family without all the travel that comes with being on tour. And, even in retirement, Nadal has not stopped picking up trophies. In addition to being given the aforementioned Laureus Sporting Icon Award, the Spaniard will also be honored in a ceremony at this year's French Open. “Trying to respect every single moment, for me that's the most important thing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protesters gather outside federal court during a hearing with lawyers for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey who was detained by immigration authorities, Thursday, April 3, 2025 in Boston. A federal appeals court has paused a judge's order to bring a Turkish Tufts University student from a Louisiana immigration detention center back to New England this week so it can consider an emergency motion filed by the government. The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York, ruled Monday that a three-judge panel would hear arguments on May 6 in the case of Rumeysa Ozturk. She's been detained for five weeks as of Tuesday. A district court judge in Vermont had earlier ordered that the 30-year-old doctoral student be brought to the state by Thursday for hearings to determine whether she was illegally detained. The U.S. Justice Department, which is appealing that ruling, said that an immigration court in Louisiana has jurisdiction over her case. Congress limited federal-court jurisdiction over immigration matters, government lawyers wrote. Yet the Vermont judge's order “defies those limits at every turn in a way that irreparably harms the government.” Immigration officials surrounded Ozturk as she walked along a street in a Boston suburb March 25 and drove her to New Hampshire and Vermont before putting her on a plane to a detention center in Basile, Louisiana. Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch now:Tim Alberta, Ashley Parker, Tom Nichols, and Anne Applebaum join Jeffrey Goldberg for a conversation about Trump's first 100 days. And many people with the condition are cared for at home. Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. “Everybody has somebody in their family” with dementia, Gladys Maestre, a neuroepidemiologist who studies aging at the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley, told me. He asked her, his eldest daughter, never to put him in a nursing home. “We take care of our own,” she told me. As Tomas's dementia progressed, the former pastor held to his routines. Two of Tomas's 10 siblings had it; Jessica wondered whether more might have, if they'd lived longer. Seven months after her dad's death, she began working as a nurse practitioner at the county's first private Alzheimer's-specific research site, El Faro Health and Therapeutics. “Patients will come in and say, ‘So have you figured it out? “I don't know what it is that's causing all of this.” As with many cancers, it can emerge from a lifetime of accumulated strain—from genetics, environment, and behavior. Researchers have identified a dozen risk factors that, if mitigated, could theoretically delay or prevent roughly 40 percent of cases worldwide: traumatic brain injury; conditions including high blood pressure, hearing loss, diabetes, and depression; habits such as smoking, inactivity, and heavy drinking; environmental and social forces including air pollution, social isolation, and limited education.These “risk factors usually do not come [as] one; they come in clusters,” Maestre said—and in Starr County, an almost entirely Hispanic community, they quickly stack up. Chronic conditions are widespread—especially diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease—while access to care is limited: There's just one primary-care physician for every 3,000 to 4,000 people, and few dementia specialists. Low education, language barriers, poor air quality, and extreme heat all compound the threat. These accumulate in cycles of grief and stress: The people I spoke with talked about deaths in the family followed by strokes that cascade into cognitive decline. Still, many in Starr County struggle to make sense of it. In the Rio Grande Valley, people are also outliving their odds. The area's high dementia rate, Maestre has come to believe, may reflect not just risk but endurance: people living longer with the condition. In general, research shows that Hispanic people tend to live longer than non-Hispanic white people, despite facing higher rates of chronic disease and steeper socioeconomic disadvantages—a pattern sometimes called the “Hispanic paradox.” And in the Rio Grande Valley, part of what might sustain people through dementia, Maestre suspects, is the culture: Dementia is seen less as a medical emergency and more as a natural, if difficult, phase of life. In Starr County, many older adults remain at home, surrounded by family who offer familiarity and stimulation. The care is physical, intimate—not clinical, but constant—and backed by research showing that familiar environments and home-based care can enhance both quality of life and cognitive function for people with dementia.“He was never, never—since the day I brought him to my home—he was never one day alone,” says Juan “Manny” Saenz of his father, Francisco “Pancho,” who died at home last month at age 94. Before Manny's mom, Amaro, died, she made him promise not to put his father in a nursing home. He ate his meals on ceramic dishes, and relished his coffee-and-cookie merienda snack break—or breaks, on days he'd forget the previous ones. Manny, who lives in Rio Grande City, told me exactly what Jessica Cantú had: “We take care of our own.” Monica Saenz Silva made a similar decision for her mother, Ramona—a bookkeeper at heart, the kind of person who kept every receipt for taxes and reminded her adult children to change their tires. She kept a running calendar of birthdays, not just for family and friends, but also for acquaintances, so she could wish them well. By 2019, a few years after her dementia symptoms appeared, “that was out the door,” Monica told me.Today, Ramona will approach a taco or hamburger quizzically; she's forgotten how to bite into them. “You want to keep them home, so they're in a familiar surrounding,” she said. “It's not all the time that she doesn't know she's home.”The response of many families here to dementia is shaped, partly, by limited treatment options: Alzheimer's and related dementias have no cure, and available medicines can be expensive, be limited in their benefits, and come with potentially life-threatening side effects. In Starr County, some caregivers eschew pharmaceuticals for aromatic teas, herbal compresses, and prayers to soothe loved ones, Maestre said. Theirs is an ethic of endurance: If dementia is here, families ask, why not build a life, tenderly, around it?Still, many don't speak of it openly. “It's okay to just be forgetful at the age of 70. It's okay because Grandma and Grandpa were forgetful at the age of 70,” she said. Still, some caregivers live with a sense of dread: In many cases, the disease does have a genetic component, and the structural forces that compounded their loved ones' risk haven't disappeared. And they don't necessarily want for themselves what they did for their parents: If his time comes, Manny Saenz wants to go to a nursing facility. Hispanic Americans face a significantly higher risk of dementia than white Americans, and are also one of the country's fastest-aging groups. And yet, for decades, scientific understanding of dementia has drawn from data from mostly white, urban, and affluent populations; Hispanics make up fewer than 5 percent of participants in Alzheimer's clinical trials. And the more they look, the less dementia seems like a single disease with a uniform pattern, and the more it appears to be a spectrum of diseases—each unfolding with its own course of symptoms, progression, and brain damage. In some studies, researchers have detected amyloid plaques—the sticky protein clumps long considered hallmarks of Alzheimer's—more frequently in the brains of white participants with dementia or mild cognitive impairment than in their Black, Asian, or Hispanic counterparts. In several studies that measured tau proteins, another key Alzheimer's biomarker, Black adults with—or without—symptoms of dementia had lower levels than white participants. The genetic variant most strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease is less common—and possibly less potent—among people with certain Hispanic backgrounds than among white people.In 2021, the National Institute on Aging designated a new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in South Texas, co-directed by Maestre and Sudha Seshadri, a neurologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Their goal is to understand the Rio Grande Valley's dementia cluster—and what can be done about it—in part by examining the effects of environmental hardship and linguistic isolation, and by investigating protective factors such as bilingualism and family networks. Eventually, Maestre hopes that urban design (such as shaded walkways, gardens, and spaces for intergenerational interaction) could help reduce the region's risks. “You cannot do that on your own.”And yet, resources remain scarce. Texas is home to about 460,000 people living with Alzheimer's disease, but compared with other large states such as Florida and New York, it spends much less on dementia-related programs. For now, families like Jessica Cantú's are left to do what they can. In the final weeks of his life, he was still going to church and chatting with people at the H-E-B grocery store. But then Tomas lost his appetite and grew frail. One night, Jessica kept vigil at his bedside, afraid he'd fall trying to get up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre lost his seat in parliament, in addition to losing his bid to become prime minister, after a brutal showing for party leaders in Monday's election. Poilievre lost his seat in Ontario's Carleton riding to Liberal candidate Bruce Fanjoy after having held the district since 2004. Fanjoy won 50.6% of the vote compared to Poilievre's 46.1%. The Liberals have been in control of parliament since 2015, though they've had to form coalitions and minority governments since then. The Conservative leader conceded national defeat to supporters on election night before his riding was called. In that speech, he promised to remain leader. “It will be an honor to continue to fight for you and be a champion for your cause as we go forward,” Poilievre said early Tuesday morning. It's unclear if he'll maintain that goal now that he has lost his seat in the House of Commons. Poilievre faced opposition from the Longest Ballot Committee, which worked to register dozens of candidates to run in his riding. On Election Day, Carleton voters chose between 90 candidates, which could've contributed to his struggles. For Singh, the loss comes with a disastrous result for the party, which will likely see it lose its official party status as it appears it will fall short of the 12-seat minimum. Singh called the losses “disappointing” but said he is not disappointed “in our movement.” Tonight they chose a new member of parliament, and tonight I wish them well as they continue to work hard for this community,” Singh said. The Conservative Party and Liberal Party are expected to gain seats overall, as the smaller parties lose several seats in parliament.</p>

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., making the case for tariffs decades ago. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., described Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., during her 2022 campaign as unrepresentative of American voters, but campaign finance reports revealed she collected at least $31,000 from the former House speaker and her political action committees during her three years in Congress. "I want to make my position clear that I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House," Perez told The Columbian in 2022. Despite the moderate Democrat rejecting Pelosi's leadership on the campaign trail, campaign finance reports show that since she took office in 2022, Gluesenkamp Perez and her Super PAC, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez Campaign Defense Fund, have accepted at least $31,000 from Pelosi and her affiliated Super PACs, including PAC to the Future and Nancy Pelosi for Congress. According to U.S. Census data, the $31,000 represents more than one third of the median household income for residents in Washington's third congressional district, which includes Clark County and Vancouver, Washington, the district's largest city. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, left, previously described Rep. Nancy Pelosi as out of touch with American voters. We need more people that work in the trades," Gluesenkamp Perez told Politico in 2023, as she described a Democratic Party out of touch with middle-class Americans. "Just like her pal Nancy Pelosi, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will say and do anything to get elected," Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC dedicated to maintaining the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair, told Fox News Digital. "That's not a quality Washington State families want in their congresswoman." The Washington congresswoman is considered one of the most vulnerable House Democrats in 2026, just as she was in 2024 after winning her 2022 race by less than two points. While Republicans slam Gluesenkamp Perez for flip-flopping on Pelosi, she is also facing the fury of her own party as hundreds of Democratic constituents protested at her town hall on Thursday. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez voted in favor of the SAVE Act on noncitizen voting. According to local reporting, including KGW News, protesters held up signs that read, "Shame on you," and chanted, "Vote her out," as Gluesenkamp Perez explained why she voted in support of the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. The SAVE Act, which passed in the House earlier this month, requires voters to obtain proof of citizenship in-person before they register for a federal election and will remove noncitizens from voter rolls. "I do not support noncitizens voting in American elections – and that's common sense to folks in Southwest Washington. Voting in our nation's elections is a sacred right belonging only to American citizens, and my vote for the SAVE Act reflects that principle," Gluesenkamp Perez said after voting in support of the SAVE ACT, despite facing vocal opposition from constituents on Thursday for doing so. Rep. Al Green was censured for protesting President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress earlier this year. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez bucked her party and voted to censure him. Gluesenkamp Perez also faced disapproval from Washington state Democrats for voting to censure Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, after he shouted and shook his cane during President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress earlier this year. Gluesenkamp Perez's campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by deadline. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Delivering the longest inaugural address in history in January, newly inaugurated President Donald Trump made clear he had little time to waste. “From this moment on, America's decline is over,” he said, before adding: “All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.” One hundred days later, Trump has found mixed success fulfilling the pledges in his speech to return “faith, wealth, democracy and freedom” to a beleaguered nation. Americans have grown increasingly skeptical, and his 41% approval rating in CNN's latest poll is the worst for any president at his 100-day mark – including himself, in 2017. Yet few would argue he hasn't met his promise of speed. Despite only signing one piece of legislation in a ceremony at the White House, Trump has ushered in the most dramatic change of any president in decades, transforming the nation's economy, foreign policy, federal workforce and immigration enforcement in ways that left his opponents gasping. Working at breakneck pace and awake to lessons from his first term, he has pursued almost all of his agenda through executive actions. But in some areas, including deporting undocumented migrants and striking foreign deals, Trump has privately fumed his team isn't working fast enough, according to people familiar with the conversations. And in the weeks ahead of his 100-day anniversary, two issues came to frustrate the president and stymie his ambitions for quick deals: the ongoing war in Ukraine and stalemated trade talks with China. In the early weeks of his second term, and even in the weeks leading up to it, his team privately acknowledged Trump needed to ram through his core policy priorities in his first two years in office, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Work on major legislation is expected to ramp up in the coming weeks as Republicans rush to pass new tax cuts. He has regretted not working more quickly, people familiar with the matter say, lamenting some cautious former aides who told him to operate with more calculation. This time, there is no waiting for the right moment; everything has come all at once. Trump and his team once hoped to avoid getting bogged down by the strident leaks and infighting that consumed his first administration. Screaming matches, staffing purges and scrambles to be the last adviser in Trump's ear have all returned, applying a fresh layer of disorder to a presidency that has rocked the federal bureaucracy, the stock market and foreign capitals. Powerful advisers, like deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, operate with wide remit to push through sweeping change, much of it challenged in court. Elon Musk, the billionaire campaign donor assigned to revamp government, has infuriated some Cabinet members with his cuts to their agencies – though ahead of his expected departure as a special government employee next month, the budget reductions have fallen well short of his initial $1 trillion promise. But her influence has not always served to restrain a president now mostly unencumbered by the so-called “guardrails” much discussed during his first term. Empowered to conduct US foreign policy is Steve Witkoff, the president's longtime friend and fellow real estate developer who is now attempting high-wire negotiations with Russia and Iran. Somewhat less so is national security adviser Mike Waltz, whom Trump argued made a “mistake” by inadvertently adding a journalist, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, to a private Signal chain in which top Cabinet and administration officials discussed sensitive plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. Waltz was later forced to fire members of his staff after a far-right activist told the president they were disloyal. Revelations of another Signal chat deepened scrutiny over Trump's controversial Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, although Trump has declined to part ways with either of them. He has traveled infrequently, mostly for weekends at his properties in Florida and New Jersey, though he'll visit Michigan on Tuesday to formally mark his first 100 days. He has found time to oversee major White House renovations, including plans to pave the Rose Garden, erect two 100-foot flagpoles on the North and South Lawns and redo the Oval Office in gold. On both trade and the Ukraine war, Trump has privately told advisers that reaching a deal is proving harder than he initially expected. China is dug in, apparently willing to wait Trump out as the pain of his trade war becomes felt among American consumers. And Russia's President Vladimir Putin seems to be similarly playing for time, in no rush to end his bombardment, despite Trump's growing irritation. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along,” Trump complained about Putin on Saturday after meeting Ukraine's president inside St. Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral. The week of his 100-day mark in office will prove critical for the Ukraine war, as Trump and his advisers determine whether their efforts to end the war are bearing fruit or wasting their time. Trump's inner circle never took seriously his campaign promise to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza on the first day of his presidency (Trump himself told TIME last week “it was said in jest”). Trump had originally selected Saudi Arabia for his first stop abroad of his new term, and will visit there next month. But when Pope Francis died those plans changed, and instead Trump made his first foreign stop in Europe, a continent he's railed against frequently. “They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize,” Trump bemoaned in February during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office. As part of that push, Trump has hosted a series of foreign leaders, from Jordan's King Abdullah II to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. “Media polls have always consistently underestimated President Trump's support. We will not get bogged down by polls and we will continue to focus on everything the President is doing to deliver on his campaign promises,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN. It's one of the reasons he flirts publicly with running for a constitutionally prohibited third term.</p>

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won the federal election, capping a stunning turnaround in fortunes fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's annexation threats and trade war. Carney's rival, populist Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, was voted out of his seat in Parliament, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projected Tuesday. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney smiles on stage at his campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the Canadian election in Ottawa, Ontario, Tuesday, April 29, 2025. The loss of his seat representing his Ottawa district in Monday's election capped a swift decline in fortunes for the firebrand Poilievre, who a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada's next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade. Poilievre, a career politician, campaigned with Trump-like bravado, taking a page from the “America First” president by adopting the slogan “Canada First.” But his similarities to Trump may have ultimately cost him and his party. It wasn't immediately clear if they would win an outright majority — at least 172 — or would need to rely on a smaller party to pass legislation and remain in power. Elections Canada said it has decided to pause counting of special ballots — cast by voters who are away from their districts during the election — until later Tuesday morning. The decision means Canadians won't know until later in the day whether Carney's Liberals have won a minority or majority mandate. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives on stage at his campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the Canadian election in Ottawa on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed.” Poilievre hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose. In a concession speech before the race call on his own seat, Poilievre vowed to keep fighting for Canadians. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, center, dances to Canadian band Down With Webster as they play live at campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the Canadian election in Ottawa on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. Even with Canadians grappling with the fallout from a deadly weekend attack at a Vancouver street festival, Trump was trolling them on election day, suggesting again on social media that Canada should become the 51st state and saying he was on their ballot. Trump's truculence has infuriated Canadians, leading many to cancel U.S. vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast ballots before election day. Reid Warren, a Toronto resident, said he voted Liberal because Poilievre “sounds like mini-Trump to me.” He said Trump's tariffs are a worry. “Canadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it's definitely created some turmoil, that's for sure,” he said. Historian Robert Bothwell said Poilievre appealed to the “same sense of grievance” as Trump, but that it ultimately worked against him. “Trump talking is not good for the Conservatives.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks to supporters on stage at his campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the Canadian election in Ottawa, Ontario, Tuesday, April 29, 2025. Carney and the Liberals secured a new term, but they have daunting challenges ahead. If they don't win a majority in Parliament, the Liberals might need rely on one of the smaller parties. The Bloc Québécois, which looked set to finish third, is a separatist party from French-speaking Quebec that seeks independence. Trudeau's Liberals relied on the New Democrats to remain in power for four years, but the progressive party fared poorly on Monday and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, said he was stepping down after eight years in charge. “This is a dramatic comeback, but if the Liberals cannot win a majority of seats, political uncertainty in a new minority Parliament could complicate things for them,” said McGill University political science professor Daniel Béland. Foreign policy hasn't dominated a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States was the prevailing issue. And more than 75% of its exports go to the U.S., so Trump's tariffs threat and his desire to get North American automakers to move Canada's production south could severely damage the Canadian economy. While campaigning, Carney vowed that every dollar the government collects from counter-tariffs on U.S. goods will go toward Canadian workers who are adversely affected by the trade war. He also said he plans to keep dental care in place, offer a middle-class tax cut, return immigration to sustainable levels and increase funding to Canada's public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“President Biden's decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said. He added, “We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows. I say this because acknowledging errors builds trust, and being defensive about them further erodes it. At this point, only a minority of political journalists would dissent from these points. Yet they don't satisfy all the critics of how Biden was covered. This includes the current White House press secretary under President Donald Trump, Karoline Leavitt. Leavitt said she did “agree with that assessment from Alex Thompson,” whom she went on to characterize as having “won an award for writing a story months and perhaps years after the American people already knew that story to be true.” “We watched our country be run into the ground as a result, and nobody in the media wanted to write about that or talk about it.” As far back as 2022, before the midterm elections, that pollster concluded 94% of Democrats under 30 wanted their party to nominate someone else for president in the next election. “Though polls of the presidential election have moved toward former President Donald Trump, answers to specific questions about Biden's age haven't changed much.” Many, though not all, reporters who covered Biden daily and saw him regularly were slower to grasp the significance of his aging than voters catching occasional glimpses of him on television or social media. A significant number of stories treated Biden age concerns as right-wing mis- or disinformation, amplifying his team's talking points on the issue, in some cases just days before the fateful Biden-Trump debate. But Biden came into the presidency as someone who had been on television for half a century. It was much easier to assess independently how he looked and sounded than it was to get to the bottom of COVID origins, and it did not require taking selectively edited videos or Alzheimer's diagnoses by cable news pundits at face value. Coverage of the 2020 and 2024 campaigns involving Biden was also colored by media regrets over how the 2016 election, which Trump won in an upset, was covered. Some reporters thought Trump benefited from how their industry had handled his first campaign and did not want to repeat those alleged mistakes or make Biden's age the equivalent of Hillary Clinton's emails, which liberals thought got excessive attention even outside the conservative press. Sometimes, more than one factor was in play at once. Yet it is difficult to escape the conclusion that a desire to avoid playing into Trump's hands with coverage that sounded too much like Republican messaging made it difficult for some in the media to believe their own eyes and ears.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs. GOP senators had kept his seat on the Supreme Court vacant for more than a year, in order to ensure that it would be filled by a Republican. And President Donald Trump's top legal aides were weighing who he should appoint. Trump had not yet converted his party into a cult of personality centered on his expansive use of power, and the lawyers who dominated his judicial selection process remained committed to a weaker executive branch. Among other things, Gorsuch argued that the Supreme Court should overrule Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984), a seminal decision instructing courts to defer to policy judgments made by federal agencies. He also advocated for reviving an out-of-fashion legal concept called the nondelegation doctrine, which gives judges broad discretion to strike down laws delegating power to the executive. Gorsuch's narrow view of executive power, as journalist David Kaplan reported in a 2018 book, “proved decisive in clinching” the Trump White House's decision to place Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. And no judge had done more to align himself with this broader agenda than Neil Gorsuch. And, while these same justices haven't yet brought back nondelegation, they invented something known as the “major questions doctrine,” which does more or less the same thing. The Supreme Court used this newly created doctrine often to strike down Biden administration policies, even policies that were explicitly authorized by a federal statute. Now, however, Democrats may decide that Gorsuch was right in his anti-executive crusade. Trump's first few months back in office — with its trade wars, questionable deportations, and attempts to flout the Constitution — have been an advertisement for the idea that the United States should have less state capacity, that it is too easy for presidents to shift policy in surprising and avulsive ways, and that we'd all be better off if some wise elders in black robes step in to restore order. That sense is only likely to grow if, in the coming months, the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs and ensures that no one else is deported without due process. Gorsuch, and other judges who believe in a weak executive, now have an opportunity to be the heroes who save America from a chaotic leader who doesn't seem to hold the law in high regard. All they have to do is reject partisan politics and hew to the values that got them their jobs in the first place. Proponents of this doctrine often summarize it with a quote from a 2014 opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia: “We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance. There are many reasons to doubt that Court's Republicans have applied this doctrine in good faith. The major questions doctrine is brand-new, and has never been used against any president who isn't named “Joe Biden.” The Republican justices used it to strike down Biden administration policies that were unambiguously authorized by federal law. They've never produced a majority opinion which bothers to explain where this doctrine comes from. Some individual justices have attempted to do so, but their explanations are often risible. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, for example, once claimed that the major questions doctrine can be derived from a parable involving a babysitter. Realistically, however, if you are a small business owner on the cusp of bankruptcy, because your entire livelihood depends on importing components that have more than doubled in price thanks to Trump's tariffs, you are unlikely to care whether Barrett's Parable of the Babysitter is persuasive to lawyers. The tariffs have already thrown the stock market into turmoil, and expert analysis of their likely impact ranges from severe to catastrophic. The justices, in other words, don't need to invent a new weapon if they want to destroy the tariffs — they already have one that is tailor-made for this case. The current Court's approach to executive power often has a split personality. Even so, there are two reasons to think that the Court may ultimately strike down Trump's tariffs. One is that a wide array of Republican legal elites are lining up against the tariffs. The first lawsuit challenging them was filed by a right-wing legal shop that has historically aligned itself with many of Trump's goals. They include the co-chair of the Federalist Society's board, and three former Republican senators — one of whom is John Danforth, an early mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas. The other reason is that, because justices do not have to stand for reelection, their views do not always change as their political party evolves. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, chose his justices because he was confident that they would uphold New Deal programs that were a high priority for him. He did not care much at all about race, the issue that would consume liberalism a decade after Roosevelt left office, and so many of them were widely out of step with the liberal consensus by the 1950s. Similarly, President George W. Bush chose Chief Justice John Roberts in large part because Roberts took an expansive view of Bush's power to incarcerate suspected terrorists in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. A few years after Bush left office, Republicans united behind a lawsuit seeking to repeal Obamacare, and many of them were upset when Roberts voted only to weaken the law and not repeal it altogether. But Bush could not have known, in 2005 when he chose Roberts, that five years later Bush's successor would sign a health care law that Republicans would hate. So his White House did not vet Roberts to ensure that he was a reliable vote against expanding access to health care. Roberts remains a strong proponent of expansive presidential power on questions involving national security. That might help Trump label people “terrorists” and disappear them to a foreign prison in El Salvador. But on topics related to domestic and economic policy, It is entirely possible, in other words, that at least some of the Republican justices will decide that they care more about traditional conservative free trade principles — and the view of executive power they held when they ascended to the highest court — than they will about backing a Republican president's signature policy initiative. And, if that's the case, they have a ready-made, long sought-after tool they can use to simultaneously eliminate those tariffs and cement the judiciary's control over the executive branch for a generation or more. Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools. ﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike seven years ago, the Philadelphia Eagles celebrated their Super Bowl victory at the White House with President Donald Trump on Monday. But absent from the traveling party was star quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts who had a “scheduling conflict,” according to a White House spokesperson. Trump praised Hurts at the White House on Monday, calling him a “terrific guy and terrific player” while calling the Eagles an “incredible team, an incredible group.” According to reports, several other key members of the Eagles team were also not present at the White House, including wide receivers AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith, linebacker Zack Baun, defensive ends Brandon Graham and Josh Sweat and defensive tackle Jalen Carter. During their time in Washington, the Eagles also visited Arlington National Cemetery where they paid their “respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,” team owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement. One player who was in attendance was Eagles running back Saquon Barkley who on Sunday had been seen spending time with Trump. Barkley and Trump were seen getting off Marine One in New Jersey before playing golf at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. “Lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT,” he said on X. “Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. “Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day.” Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. The infamous play has become polarizing across the NFL, but teams will vote on whether it will remain a permitted play in the future after a motion was tabled to ban it. And Trump said he's in support of the league keeping it around. “I hope they keep that play, Coach (Nick Sirianni). They're talking about getting rid of that play, I understand. They should keep it,” Trump said on Monday. After Trump spoke, Eagles head coach Sirianni said, “Thank you, Mr. President, for having us here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party and Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party are holding events in the capital city of Ottawa tonight. The Liberal Party had secured 21 seats and was leading in 57 additional districts just before 10 p.m. Eastern time. The Conservatives had won eight seats already and were leading in 48. On its own, it's only a minor shift, but Conservatives are hoping that it is a sign of a broader trend of right-leaning voters under-reporting their intentions in the polls — the oft-asserted “shy Tory” phenomenon. Liberals are hoping to establish a more fortified position early in the night. Liberal candidates are considered strongest on the Atlantic coast and in Ontario. Western Canada is a geographically large but underpopulated Conservative stronghold. As poll closings move from the Atlantic provinces and toward British Columbia, the Conservatives are expected to find more consistent victories. The next round of polls is scheduled to close at 9:30 p.m. Eastern. The final polls in British Columbia will be shut down at 10 p.m. If they do not win an outright majority, they will need to form a coalition with other parties to establish their government. Trump, whose shadow looms over the country as the premier economic threat, wished “good luck” to the “great people of Canada” and took a moment to weigh in on who they should vote for. “Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,” Trump said on Truth Social.</p>
