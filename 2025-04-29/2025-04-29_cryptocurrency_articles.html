                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price goes on a near-parabolic rally everytime these two events happen. Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals. Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price. Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors' inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. Significant Bitcoin rallies occur when US Federal Reserve policy expectations ease, crypto market leverage is low, and strong retail data supports bullish momentum. Comparable gains were recorded in early 2023, when the same three drivers aligned, propelling Bitcoin from $16,700 to $25,100 over seven weeks. Other factors impacting the price reversal was US retail sales data for December 2023, released on Jan. 17, 2024, exceeded expectations, rising 0.6% month-over-month compared to the 0.4% forecast and US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jan. 31, 2024 press conference that, signaled a tighter monetary stance, with no immediate interest rate cuts in sight. Prior to this rally, Bitcoin had consolidated below $18,000 for two months, resulting in minimal demand for leveraged long positions, as reflected by a near-zero perpetual futures funding rate. This coincided with stronger-than-expected retail sales data for January 2023, which rose 3% month-over-month, outpacing the 1.9% consensus. Notably, Fed Chair Powell also suggested a tighter monetary policy to combat inflation during his speech at Sveriges Riksbank on Jan. 10, 2023. Bitcoin's price had dropped from $40,000 to below $30,000 over the preceding month, dampening market sentiment. Suddenly, the annualized Bitcoin funding rate jumped from 0% to 37% in two weeks, while US retail sales data for June 2021 surprised economists by increasing 0.6%, even though consensus had predicted a 0.4% decline. During this period, Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Aug. 27, 2021, indicated a potential reduction in central bank asset purchases, which was a move aimed at curbing inflation. Related: Ray Dalio says global monetary order ‘on the brink' of breakdown The common thread linking these significant rallies is a reduction in expectations for expansionary Federal Reserve policy and initially low leverage demand from Bitcoin bulls. When these factors coincide with robust retail data, they create ideal conditions for a Bitcoin bull run, as traders tend to remain cautious ahead of possible economic downturns. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Powell is set to speak on June 18 following the central bank's interest rate decision.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nike is being hit with a class action lawsuit demanding over $5 million in damages after shutting down its Web3 NFT platform  RTFKT in January. It adds that the court doesn't need to weigh in on the legal status of NFTs to address the complaint.Whether or not NFTs are in fact securities is a hotly debated issue in a murky, unregulated environment. A US court has yet to rule on the matter, but in 2023, the SEC entered into a settlement with media company Impact Theory, finding that the firm's NFTs were securities—and as a result, determining that Impact Theory had engaged in an unregistered security offering. OpenSea Faces SEC Action Over Unregistered Securities Allegations New Online Platform for Environmental Digital Art Strives to Drive Climate Action and Reduce CO2 Emissions Last year, Dapper Labs, the makers of the NBA Top Shot NFTs, settled a case with investors who alleged that Dapper's NFTs were unregistered securities, for $4 million. In that case, a Southern District of New York judge determined that NFTs could be considered as securities under the “Howey test,” a legal framework established by the Supreme Court to classify securities. However, Dapper settled before a final determination was made by the court.One of the largest NFT marketplaces, OpenSea, wrote a letter to the SEC on April 9 demanding it to remove NFTs from federal securities law arguing that they don't meet the legal status of a security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC closed yesterday at $95,630—its highest daily close yet—but still below the $95,000 resistance level that has acted as a ceiling since early April. While OBV and RSI remain constructive, daily Volume continues to decline, falling under the yellow moving average at $2.1B. These haven't been confirmed by a TBO Close Long yet, but they are early signs of trend fatigue. A decisive close above $95K is still the main trigger to extend momentum toward $100K. The crypto market might be setting up for a divergence between BTC and OTHERS. However, if BTC corrects while stablecoin dominance rises, it could suppress altcoin gains even with strong reversal signals. OTHERS continues to flirt with long-term overhead resistance and has now pierced it five days in a row without closing above. OBV continues rising, but daily RSI is struggling to post higher highs. BVOL7D is slowly falling again toward its Bounce Zone, signaling low volatility—a pattern last seen before the big Q4 2024 rally. Ethereum continues to build a base inside the TBO Cloud with slightly improving RSI and OBV, but volume remains unimpressive. XRP is approaching the top of its Cloud, while BNB holds just above resistance but with no strong follow-through. SOL has flashed TBO Close Longs on the 4-hour chart, which could signal a short-term pullback before resuming higher. LINK remains in a confused state with rising OBV but lower highs on RSI and resistance just overhead. SUI, which recently surged, is now showing TBT Bearish Divergence on the 4-hour. HYPE, XMR, ONDO, and MNT are all in various phases of recovery, with some now printing TBO Open Longs. Further down the list, coins like POL, ALGO, XDC, and IOTA are printing strong continuation signals with clean follow-through, while FLOKI, KAVA, WIF, RUNE, CORE, and GIGA are joining the growing list of coins showing real upside potential. BTC remains the dominant force, but short-term weakness near $95K could spark a sharp pullback. If that happens, the Multiple Factor Effect could hit altcoins harder than BTC. However, dominance is slowly shifting, and reversal signals are stacking up across the altcoin sector. Traders should remain flexible—take partial profits and manage exposure—but also watch for confirmation of rotation from BTC into altcoins as the next big move.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Trump, VP of the Trump Organization, has confirmed that crypto assets will be accepted for real estate transactions at the company's newly announced luxury development in Dubai. This $1 billion project is under development in collaboration with the London-listed Dar Global. It marks a significant move into the Middle East for the Trump brand and an institutional embrace of crypto asset payments in high-end real estate. It is located at the entrance of Downtown Dubai on Sheikh Zayed Road. Eric Trump's statement reflects the company's recognition of evolving buyer preferences. By accepting crypto, the Trump Organization is catering to a growing class of crypto-native investors and high-net-worth individuals seeking to diversify their holdings into hard assets like premium real estate. Moreover, accepting crypto in this real estate venture further deepens the Trump family's ties with technology. Initially a vocal critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, President Donald Trump has since shifted his stance to become one of the most prominent advocates for crypto. Meanwhile, the latest announcement aligns with Dubai's positioning as a hub for real estate and crypto innovation. In 2023, The Crypto Basic reported that Bahrain-based real estate developer Bin Faqeeh began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for property purchases via Binance Pay. This move reflects growing crypto adoption in the real estate sector, following similar actions by companies like Condos.com and Pacaso. Earlier this month, Lomond School in Scotland became the first UK educational institution to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments. This further highlights the growing trend of crypto payments in traditional sectors. DisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of these investors bought into Ethereum (ETH) during its initial coin offering (ICO) at 31 cents. This investor has always believed that blockchain technology would change industries. Regardless of Ethereum's ups and downs, this investor continues to reap massive returns. However, now there is another rising altcoin in focus: Rexas Finance (RXS). Ethereum faces increasing competition from new platforms and Layer-2 solutions, which is directly impacting its trajectory. Ethereum does retain its long-term value proposition, especially when compared to projects like Rexas Finance, which seeks attention for innovative strategies focusing on real-world asset tokenization. The peak Ethereum price of $4,864 in 2021 and the current 2025 position of above $2,700 show Ethereum strengthening its position as a crypto powerhouse, enabling dApps and providing support for decentralized finance (DeFi). The emergence of competitors such as Solana and Polkadot began to chip away at Ethereum's dominance. These networks provide quicker transaction times, lower fees, and better scalability. Other layer two solutions like Polygon also started gaining traction and are pulling users from the Ethereum network due to gas fee problems and concerns regarding scalability. While Ethereum has put energy into building the decentralized infrastructure for DeFi and smart contracts, Rexas Finance is concentrating on tokenizing real-world assets. By enabling investment in real-world assets through blockchain technology, Rexas Finance stands out with its innovative approach to crypto. The tokenization of assets, from real estate to art and private equity, can potentially revolutionize entire industries. They are currently in the presale stage, with 91.76% of their tokens sold. Rexas Finance intends to list on one of the major exchanges on June 19, 2025, while also planning to sell at $0.25, which means early investors are looking at a possible 25% increase in value. Unlike Ethereum, which faces stiff competition in the DeFi marketplace, Rexas Finance's focus on tokenizing real-world assets offers much more value. In that case, they will be able to capture a significant market share in the coming years, making this an attractive option for early investors looking to invest during the presale. Tokenized real estate is one example that has the potential to become a market leader, considering the total worth of real estate globally exceeds $280 trillion. Rexas Finance is determined to lead the emerging space of real estate ownership using blockchain technology, which allows the splitting of assets into smaller, more accessible units. Ethereum's lack of scalability and high fees have hampered its growth, while it remains a frontrunner in the crypto arena. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is working on capturing the growth potential in a rapidly tokenized assets market, which could provide better mid-term returns. Rexas Finance is positioned as a promising new investment for those searching for the “next big thing” in crypto while its token continues to grow in popularity. In Ethereum's case, early investors were evidently able to reap the benefits. With a focus on tokenizing real-world assets, a low presale price, and an outlined plan of action, Rexas Finance is targeted for massive growth in 2025 and beyond. For those seeking more significant returns, Rexas Finance is certainly worth following. You are responsible for conducting your own research (DYOR) before making any investments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that altcoins are primed for a bull run following an extended bear winter. Van de Poppe tells his 784,800 followers on the social media platform X that three tailwinds are pushing crypto prices higher. At the top of his list is that financial conditions are starting to ease across the world, which he says is highly favorable for risk-on assets such as altcoins and Bitcoin (BTC). Next up, Van de Poppe thinks that investors who benefited from gold's strong rally over the past few months will start to move their capital into crypto after the precious metal printed a local top at $3,500 per ounce. That means a 12-18 month window of risk-on assets to do well as the correlation between a strong gold price and falling altcoins has provided strong data. Gold has extended massively upwards as the RSI (relative strength index) data has gone into levels not seen since 1980, while ETH has gone so deep that it's on the lowest point ever against Bitcoin on the weekly and monthly data.” Now, Van de Poppe believes that CNH/USD has bottomed out following the “tariff madness,” putting Ethereum and altcoins in a position to finally witness a true bull run. At time of writing, the ETH/BTC pair is trading for 0.01894 BTC worth $1,798. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — A group of legal veterans with ties to President Donald Trump‘s past litigation have launched a firm located just steps from the White House to capitalize on the growing demand for influence in Washington's fast-expanding cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors. NexusOne Consulting, a lobbying firm founded by attorney Jeff Ifrah and former Trump lawyer Jim Trusty, opened its doors this week with the goal of helping emerging tech companies navigate, and shape, a fast-evolving regulatory landscape. Companies such as Kraken, Uniswap, Jump Trading, and Riot Platforms are recruiting former administration officials and Capitol Hill staffers to secure influence in a favorable regulatory environment, according to Bloomberg. “Technology is outpacing policy, and that creates both opportunity and risk,” Ifrah, who has long represented tech clients through his law firm, Ifrah PLLC, said. “There's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the future of tech policy. “We have a team of folks that we sort of lean into for Hill lobbying, but that's not what we're going to primarily be focused on at NexusOne,” Ifrah said, emphasizing the firm's focus on the executive branch. The firm's leadership team also includes Ross Branson, a former senior Commerce Department official during Trump's first term. Its advisory board draws from prominent conservative and Trump-aligned figures, including former Republican Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, former Reagan-era Education Secretary William Bennett, and Wall Street financier Andrew Graves, a major fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital through Curetivity. Ifrah outlined to the Washington Examiner some of NexusOne's near-term policy targets, many of which fall in line with Trump's already-stated goals in both Big Tech sectors. On the crypto side, NexusOne plans to advocate creating a federal strategic digital asset reserve, building on efforts already underway in states like Texas. “There's an interest in establishing the strategic reserve and looking at stablecoin — how this would work and who the players would be,” Ifrah said, adding that developments in these areas could happen by year's end. “It's very much the data privacy angle,” Ifrah said, adding, “I think that type of legislation is probably short-term. One of the most ambitious tech initiatives announced under Trump's second term is the Stargate project, a sweeping $500 billion private-sector effort aimed at securing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. Trump has framed the project as a national security imperative, warning that American leadership in AI is critical to preventing China from overtaking the United States in technological and military innovation.</p>

However, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have surged in recent months, Ethereum has failed to keep up. On X, legendary trader Peter Brandt highlighted a downtrend that could signal deeper weakness for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The chart showed Ethereum continually losing ground to Bitcoin as it failed to keep pace with Bitcoin's momentum in recent months. For now, Brandt's chart adds to the warning that Ethereum may face further downside against Bitcoin unless a significant trend reversal occurs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the top altcoins in the crypto market, Ethereum, XRP and Sui are gaining attention due to strong investor confidence, growing interest from institutions, and recent technological advancements. As a result, these three altcoins are expected to stay in focus for investors in the short to medium term. Ethereum has been showing positive signs recently, both in on-chain data and technical indicators. Blockchain data revealed that large addresses holding more than 0.1% of the circulating supply have been increasing their ETH holdings. This suggests that big investors are taking advantage of Ethereum's lower prices to buy. These developments indicate that investor confidence in Ethereum is starting to rise again. Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stanczak were appointed as co-executive directors, a move seen as a key step for the foundation's long-term vision. From a technical perspective, data shows that selling pressure on Ethereum is beginning to shift towards buying. This price level marks the upper limit of the bearish channel that started in December and has been followed throughout this year. Analyzing the chart, it is clear that ETH has attempted to break this downward channel four times, but has failed each time. Now, it is attempting to break through this trend for the fifth time. This area aligns with Fib 0.236 and the 3-month EMA, forming a strong resistance. If it fails to break through, the upside potential may remain limited. Increased selling pressure at this point may lead to a retest of the $1,800 level. However, if $1,800 holds as support, it could trigger a stronger uptrend in the second phase. If this level is not broken, a pullback towards the $1,450-$1,500 range could occur, which would indicate that ETH is still moving within a bearish channel. XRP has gained attention again due to developments on the regulatory front. Ripple's resolution of its legal dispute with the SEC marked a turning point for XRP, boosting its price and attracting institutional investor interest. With this clarity, XRP has been relisted on major exchanges, making it more accessible to individual investors. Additionally, ETF applications from major financial institutions like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have raised expectations for a potential $8 billion inflow to XRP. The launch of XRP futures by CME Group is expected to further expand its use in financial markets. As a result of these positive developments, XRP followed the general altcoin market trend in April. It initially fell to a support level tested in November 2024 but began to gain attention with a steady rise afterward. A clear daily close above this resistance could push XRP to $2.5 and $2.71. The Sui network has experienced significant growth recently, especially in total locked assets (TVL) and on-chain user data. Last week, TVL increased by 38% to reach $1.73 billion, while stable crypto reserves hit $879 million, indicating strong confidence in the DeFi ecosystem. The integration of smart contracts and zk-proof technologies into donation systems has also been a significant development, further strengthening SUI's technical capabilities. With the impact of all these positive developments, SUI has shown a positive divergence from the overall market in a short period of time. Despite flat and low volumes in early April, it saw a significant price increase last week. If profit-taking increases, the $3.2 and $2.7 levels can act as support. Especially if $3.2 holds as support, there may be potential for a rise towards $4.5 in the next phase. Otherwise, a horizontal consolidation in the range of $2.7-$3.6 might begin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump's embrace of crypto — from regulation reforms to personal ventures — is reshaping America's digital future. Once a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, President Trump's views have undergone a dramatic transformation, mirroring broader trends in the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and the increasing role of digital assets in shaping economic fortune across nations. Today, Trump's name is not only linked to crypto regulation and federal policy initiatives but also to personal ventures that have captured the attention of both supporters and critics. From advocating for the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to launching his meme coin associated with Truth Social, Trump's influence on the cryptocurrency industry has become impossible to ignore. Agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission have found themselves under pressure to modernize oversight frameworks, ensuring that innovation is not stifled while safeguarding financial integrity. Initially a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, he expressed serious concerns about Bitcoin's volatility and its potential use for illicit activities, such as money laundering, aligning his early views with broader skepticism within the federal government and among federal agencies. Trump recognized the shifting tides of finance and technology, recalibrating his position to appeal to tech-savvy voters and investors seeking fortune in new markets. His public endorsement of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry was seen as both a political promise and a strategic push to cement America's leadership in digital innovation. Following his return to office, one of Trump's most ambitious crypto ventures was the proposal to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — a digital asset stockpile designed to bolster the U.S. dollar and provide economic resilience against future crises. This move reflected a new philosophy: blockchain regulation should be permissive enough to encourage growth, while still ensuring security, enforcing clear rules, and protecting against financial abuses. Trump's ability to read the evolving market sentiment placed him at the forefront of a growing movement to integrate cryptocurrency directly into national economic strategies. In contrast to the Biden administration's more cautious regulatory stance, Trump framed digital assets, including emerging forms of tokens, as critical tools for maintaining American financial dominance in an increasingly competitive and decentralized global landscape. The working group, now populated with crypto-friendly voices and supported by leaders like David Sacks, played a crucial role in coordinating with Congress and the Treasury Department to implement wide-reaching reforms. Trump's administration emphasized that a permissive regulatory environment was essential not only for innovation but also for attracting companies that might otherwise move operations overseas. Moreover, by advocating for flexible blockchain regulation, Trump encouraged companies across various sectors to adopt decentralized technologies, ensuring that the U.S. would remain a leader in the digital economy. His government aimed to establish the United States as the preferred jurisdiction for emerging crypto ventures, from startup exchanges to large-scale tokenized asset platforms. Trump's proactive stance has also intensified international competition, with nations like China, the United Arab Emirates, and members of the European Union accelerating their own blockchain initiatives in response. As global governments move to implement their digital strategies, the U.S. faces both opportunities and challenges in maintaining its leadership position. The alignment of federal agencies under a unified vision for clear rules around tokens, securities classification, and money laundering prevention has become a defining feature of Trump's policy legacy. At the same time, critics warn that a permissive environment could expose markets to greater volatility and regulatory arbitrage. Nevertheless, President Trump's emphasis on fostering domestic crypto companies and encouraging innovation at the intersection of finance and technology has sparked a wave of entrepreneurship. Many blockchain startups and established financial institutions now view the U.S. as the most promising jurisdiction for growth, setting the stage for an era where digital assets could become as central to economic power as traditional currencies. Beyond government-level reforms, President Trump's ventures into the crypto industry have been equally headline-grabbing. The launch of Trump's meme coin in March 2025, heavily promoted through his media outlets, became an example of how a political figure could directly participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While critics raised concerns about conflicts of interest, the initiative's success demonstrated the growing appetite among Trump's supporters to invest in projects aligned with their political and financial values. Furthermore, Trump's embrace of crypto ventures served as a rallying cry for broader adoption among conservative circles, who had previously viewed digital assets with suspicion. His messaging framed blockchain technology not only as a tool for economic freedom but also as a means to challenge centralized control by traditional institutions. In partnership with Congress and agencies like the Treasury, Trump pushed for aggressive legislation to ensure that American companies would lead the world in these sectors. As the Senate continues to debate future crypto-related bills, many of which were initiated during Trump's renewed tenure, it's clear that the president's push for deregulation and innovation will leave a lasting mark. His willingness to intertwine political branding with crypto ventures sets a powerful — and controversial — example of leadership in the emerging digital economy.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. I was there early enough to look at my old rig and wonder if it was worth setting up to see if it could score a few coins over the course of a month or so. I've known a few people who did things like acccidentally throw away drives full of BTC. I even knew people who got in early and cashed out fast, otherwise known as 'bastards'. Since its early days, crypto has been, to put it politely, an absolute shitshow of cryptoglogical proportions. Even when it was somewhat viable to put your rig to work it'd still be a long haul of wait and see before you might eventually unearth yourself a coin here and there. And of course your old GPU has been worked into dust and your power bill has skyrocketed for the trouble. For those reasons it's been a long time since I considered mining Bitcoin as a viable investment, and it looks like the landscape is finally shifting to meet my preconceptions. Even specialists such as CoinShares (via Overclockers) are starting to doubt this business investment, despite it recently reaching an all time high price. BTC is currently only valued at $94,703 USD, which seems to be a problem in the math department. These costs can even get worse depending on the country you're doing your mining. It costs around $200,000 USD to mine a single coin there. So why would anyone be mining BTC in this day and age? Well the main reason, other than perhaps dim hopes that they'll strike it rich, is about technology. Currently optimising farms to mine faster on lower power has been the goal. This makes it an attractive option for larger companies who may look to lease their mining operations for other computations when they're unable to make money from mining. Then they can swap back if and when the market picks up once again. With huge centres being setup in key positions you just won't be able to beat out the larger companies acting here. Any new coin that comes up they can point their rigs to it and begin the process all over again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Liberty Financial has eviscerated the boundary between private enterprise and government policy in ways without precedent in modern American history. The pitch from “ZMoney” arrived on the encrypted messaging app Signal just days before Donald J. Trump's presidential inauguration. “ZMoney” was Zachary Folkman, an entrepreneur who once ran a company called Date Hotter Girls and was now representing World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency firm that Mr. Trump and his sons had recently unveiled. Mr. Folkman was writing to a crypto startup in the Cayman Islands, offering a “partnership” in which the firms would buy each other's digital coins, a deal that would bolster the startup's public profile. But there was a catch, The New York Times found. “Everything we do gets a lot of exposure and credibility,” Mr. Folkman wrote, asserting that other business partners had committed between $10 million and $30 million to World Liberty. The Cayman startup rejected the offer, as did several other firms that received a similar pitch from World Liberty, executives said. World Liberty's executives, who have maintained that they did nothing improper, were undeterred. They successfully pitched similar deals to other firms while also marketing their coin to buyers around the world, reaping more than $550 million in sales, with a large cut earmarked for the president's family.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FTX Estate Sues NFT Marketplace and AI Gaming Platform Over Token Agreements FTX Trading and the FTX Recovery Trust filed lawsuits Monday against token issuers NFT Stars and Kurosemi, which does business as Delysium, alleging the companies failed to deliver tokens promised under investment agreements with Alameda Research's venture arm, Alameda Ventures. The complaints, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, seek to compel the companies to turn over tokens that FTX claims were purchased through Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs. Once one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX filed for bankruptcy after revelations surfaced that around $8 billion in customer funds had been misused by executives to cover risky bets made by FTX's affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research. The collapse shook the broader cryptocurrency industry, triggering regulatory scrutiny and resulting in billions of dollars in losses for customers and investors. The company began its restructuring plan earlier this year, through which it plans to repay creditors. FTX is seeking the immediate return of the assets, damages for breach of contract, and sanctions for alleged violations of bankruptcy protections, including those related to the automatic stay under U.S. bankruptcy law. According to the Delysium complaint, Alameda Ventures, now known as Maclaurin Investment, paid $1 million in January 2022 for the right to receive 75 million $AGI tokens. The tokens launched in April 2023 and were subject to a vesting schedule, with 20% unlocking after a 12-month cliff period and additional tokens unlocking quarterly thereafter. In the case against marketplace NFT Stars, FTX claims it paid $325,000 in November 2021 for rights to 1.35 million SENATE tokens and 135 million SIDUS tokens. While NFT Stars initially delivered some of the tokens, it allegedly failed to complete further transfers following FTX's bankruptcy filing. FTX says NFT Stars now owes more than 831,000 SENATE tokens and 83 million SIDUS tokens, citing breaches of contract and violation of the automatic stay.
