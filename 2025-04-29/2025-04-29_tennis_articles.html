More news: American Tennis Star Dedicates First Career Grand Slam Win to Hometown Ravaged by LA Wildfires Just sorry for all the people who had to witness this," said Djokovic. After his most recent loss in Madrid, the Serbian admitted in a news conference that his "new reality" is to think less about how far he'll go in a tournament, and more on just winning the current match. "It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournament." The storied French Open tournament, which begins three days after Djokovic's 38th birthday, will mark so much more than a hopeful return to the usual dominance the tennis world is used to seeing, but could be a chance at extending a mark that the superstar already has a historic lead in. 3 in all time behind Roger Federer's 103 and Jimmy Connors' 109.

The young Brit has traditionally played his best on faster surfaces, but an encouraging start in Monte Carlo, where he narrowly lost a round-of-16 clash with former finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, set him in good stead for a successful Madrid campaign.Benefitting from a third-round walkover against No. 30 seed Matteo Berrettini, Draper is now on the brink of his first clay-court Masters 1000 quarterfinal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Coco Gauff steps onto the clay court to face Mirra Andreeva at the WTA Madrid Open, it won't just be another match; it will be a generation-defining battle between two of the brightest young stars in tennis today. Coco Gauff's story reads like a fairy tale. Bursting onto the scene at just 15 years old with a stunning upset over Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, Gauff has since established herself as a force on the WTA tour. Her game is built on explosive athleticism, a rock-solid backhand, and a fighting spirit that's drawn comparisons to legends like Serena Williams. Since then, Andreeva has steadily climbed the rankings and is now seen as one of the sport's most promising prospects. Fans and pundits alike have tipped her for future Grand Slam glory, and her steady rise makes every match she plays must-watch tennis. Expect a contrast of styles: Gauff's raw athleticism, speed, and counterpunching prowess against Andreeva's smooth technique, court craft, and tactical nous. Both players have a flair for the dramatic and a maturity in their shot selection that makes for compelling viewing. The Madrid clay favors players who can move well and construct points patiently‚Äìboth boxes these two tick emphatically. Given their shared youth, expect long, gruelling rallies, gutsy shot-making, and moments of audacious brilliance. While Gauff holds the edge in experience, especially at the Grand Slam level, Andreeva's hunger and the fact that Madrid has already been a happy hunting ground for her make this an even contest. No matter who comes out on top, this match promises to be one for the highlights reel. And for tennis fans, it's a front-row seat to the blossoming of a rivalry that could define the WTA tour for years to come. The ATP Madrid 1000 Masters 2025 edition has already had its share of drama and we have four more days to go. It's a blockbuster in the 2025 WTA Mutua Madrid Open quarterfinals as Coco Gauff will take on Mirra Andreeva. The Round of 16 of the WTA Madrid Open was supposed to have been played on April 28th, but a massive blackout in Spain and</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can someone please take Alexander Bublik back to the good old days? The Kazakhstani delivered indirect praise of Jakub Mensik in typically humorous fashion on Tuesday during a conversation with chair umpire Mohamed Layani at the Mutua Madrid Open. During his fourth-round match against Mensik, which the #NextGenATP Czech ultimately won 6-3, 6-2, Bublik turned to Layani during a changeover. Like five years ago it was super easy to play tennis,‚Äù said the four-time ATP Tour champion Bublik. ‚ÄúA bunch of random people in the Top 50, barely moving. Tuesday's straight-sets victory at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid was the latest impressive performance in a breakout 2025 for Mensik. The 19-year-old defeated Novak Djokovic to lift his maiden tour-level title in March in Miami, and he is now up to No. If you ask Bublik, he should already be in the Top 10 at the very least.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In one of the more bizarre scenes to unfold on the professional tennis circuit this year, ATP world No. 407 Svyatoslav Gulin was defaulted during his match against Alejo Sanchez Quilez at an ITF tournament, despite being comfortably ahead (7-5, 3-6, 4-0). Instead of celebrating the point, Gulin pointed directly at the umpire and unleashed a series of obscene gestures, followed by a torrent of verbal abuse with vulgar words such as 'b{expletive} me'. The chair umpire, adhering to the ITF's strict code of conduct, had little choice but to immediately default Gulin from the match. The decision handed the victory to Sanchez Quilez, leaving Sanchez, fans, and tournament officials stunned by Gulin's outburst. It remains unclear what triggered Gulin's frustration, especially given that he was in complete control of the match. Incidents of default are rare at the professional level, and typically reserved for the most serious breaches of behavior. Gulin's default joins a short but infamous list of players who have been disqualified for on-court misconduct, highlighting the importance of maintaining composure no matter the circumstances. The ITF is expected to review the incident and could hand down additional penalties, including possible fines or suspensions. Meanwhile, Gulin will be left to ponder over what could have been an easy third set and a subsequent victory as well as a few hard earned, precious points on the tour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roger Federer inspired millions during his time on the ATP Tour, winning 20 Grand Slam singles titles. Before retiring from tennis in 2022, Federer added 19 more Major titles to his collection, more than any male player not named Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal. With such a wealth of experience, it should come as no surprise that many of Federer's contemporaries dream of adding him to their coaching teams, as one top ten star now reveals his thoughts on the 43-year-old. He really schooled me, but even so, I enjoyed the moment a lot.‚Äù Federer and De Minaur faced off in their only career meeting in the final of the Basel Open six years ago. Winning his 103rd and final ATP title, Federer dropped just 18 games all tournament as he celebrated in front of his home fans one last time. ‚ÄúStefan Edberg said the same, he will never coach, until he got the phone call from me and I invited him over for practice and he said ‚Äòok, let me try for a year'. ‚ÄúAt the moment, with my four children going to school and everything going on, I don't see myself coaching at the moment. If a junior comes around and he needs some support or advice, I'm happy to do that.‚Äù Federer likely won't be joining De Minaur's coaching team any time soon, but that shouldn't bother the Aussie too much as he continues to climb the rankings. Coached by Adolfo Gutierrez full time, and both Peter Luczak and Lleyton Hewitt on a part-time basis, the 26-year-old has become well-established in the world's top ten. He has already recorded some notably impressive performances this year, perhaps none more so than De Minaur's run to the Rotterdam Open final, where he narrowly came up short against Carlos Alcaraz. Only time will tell if De Minaur's form will continue, and he can break through into the top five later this year. De Minaur is scheduled to return to action in the third round of the Madrid Open against Denis Shapovalov on Tuesday, April 29.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What began as one of the most anticipated days of the tournament came to an abrupt stop Monday at the Mutua Madrid Open, as a widespread power outage across parts of Spain, Portugal and southern France forced the suspension of six Round of 16 matches. Only two were completed -- Coco Gauff defeated Belinda Bencic in straight sets, while Mirra Andreeva held off Yuliia Starodubtseva. The remaining matches are set to resume Tuesday, and we'll keep you updated as the results come in. Gauff has now reached the quarterfinals at every current WTA 1000 event except her home tournament in Miami. Watch: Gauff reaches first career Madrid quarterfinal With Monday's victory, the Madrid Open became the first tournament where Andreeva has recorded 10 career wins at a single WTA event. Swiatek has now reached 17 consecutive clay-court quarterfinals, a streak that dates back to her third-round loss to Ashleigh Barty at Madrid four years ago. Watch: Swiatek battles past Shnaider in three sets to reach Madrid quarters Keys became the second American player to achieve 25-plus WTA-1000 match-wins on clay, along with Serena Williams (44). Watch: Keys overwhelms Vekic into second straight Madrid quarterfinal Before this season, Svitolina had never won consecutive matches at the Madrid Open in nine previous appearances. Watch: Svitolina beats Sakkari for eighth straight win, first Madrid quarterfinal Uchijima has made more WTA quarterfinal appearances in the past two weeks (Rouen and Madrid) than in her entire career before this run (Monastir in 2022). Watch: Uchijima upsets Alexandrova in Madrid, reaches first WTA 1000 quarterfinal Head-to-head: 1-0, Sabalenka, but it was 6-7(2), 6-2, 7-6 (6) in last year's second round at Indian Wells. Head-to-head: 2-1, Potapova, though they have never played on clay.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former US Open champion Coco Gauff was preparing to shower in a dark locker room after play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended and then postponed because of a major power outage in Spain and Portugal. Then Gauff realized that the water was off, too. Gauff managed to beat Belinda Bencic 6-4 6-2 shortly before the outage, which apparently cut off the sound as she was giving a post-match interview on the court. The ATP Tour said that two singles matches and one doubles match were underway when power went out at 12:34 p.m. local time (1034 GMT). Tournament organisers said they "had no choice but to suspend/cancel all sporting activity in order to guarantee the safety of the players, fans and personnel." They recommended all spectators leave the sports complex. The event is scheduled to resume on Tuesday. That match later continued ‚Äî apparently with manual line calling ‚Äî and Arnaldi won 6-3 6-4. The blackout brought much of Spain and Portugal to a standstill, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines. Spanish power distributor Red El√©ctrica said restoring power to large parts of the country after the outage could take up to 10 hours. Gauff also posted a photo of candles being distributed. "I don't think we're even going to be able to go back to the hotel because the traffic lights are out," Gauff said. "It's just crazy how much we depend on electricity. Another fourth-round women's match was also completed before the blackout: Mirra Andreeva beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-1 6-4. Second-ranked Iga Swiatek "sat in the darkened players' lounge, talking with members of her team," ahead of her scheduled match against Diana Shnaider, the WTA Tour said. Swiatek and Shnaider had been scheduled to play in the main stadium after the Dimitrov-Fearnley match. Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka had been scheduled to play Peyton Stearns later.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Wimbledon doubles champion Max Purcell has been slapped with a suspension. His suspension has been backdated to last December when he was first pinged for a potential foul. The ITIA revealed that in December 2023, Purcell crossed the line by undergoing intravenous infusions exceeding 500 millilitres, landing him in hot water. Post-admission, he opted into a voluntary provisional suspension on December 12, 2024, the same day he got wind of the possible breach. Now he will also have to forfeit any winnings accumulated from December 16, 2023 ‚Äì the date of his infringement ‚Äì up to the day a drug test came back clean on February 3, 2024. Purcell will be banned from playing in, coaching at, or attending any tennis event authorised or sanctioned by the members of the ITIA. Karen Moorhouse, chief executive of the ITIA, remarked: "This case does not involve a player testing positive for a prohibited substance but demonstrates that the anti-doping rules are broader than that. "It also shows that the ITIA considers intelligence from a range of sources with the overriding aim to protect everyone covered by the tennis anti-doping rules, and ensure a level playing field for all." Speaking out on his anti-doping suspension via Instagram, Purcell said: "This case has been going on for months, seriously affecting my quality of life. I was nothing but cooperative with the ITIA. I'm so glad this is finally over for me and I can move on with my life. It's a case completely on exceeding the allowable limit of volume for an infusion. "All substances in the infusion were WADA approved and beyond that, it provided me with zero performance-enhancing benefit. It was 11 days prior to my first match of the season and was also administered as a 24/7 medical facility, in a third world location after feeling unwell and fatigued from training." Purcell claimed victory at Wimbledon in 2022 with partner Matthew Ebden and then secured last year's US Open title alongside fellow Australian Jordan Thompson.
