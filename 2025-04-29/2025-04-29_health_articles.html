                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most common malignancies and the second most frequent urogenital tract tumor. Cell and gene therapy, which offer many advantages in treating BLCA, are urgently needed. However, there is an important limitation of the currently reported single chain antibody used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting domain. Humanized, small size, strong affinity single domain antibodies (variable domain of heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody [VHH]) derived from camelids are promising alternatives. Second-generation Nectin4-targeted VHH-CAR-T cells were constructed and the specific killing efficacy was determined against BLCA cells in vitro. VHH Nectin4-CAR lentivirus was transduced into human T cells and CAR-T cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell killing efficacy was assessed using Nectin4-positive BLCA cells (SW780 and RT4) and Nectin4-negative U87-MG cells as controls using the xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analysis system. Cytokine secretion expression (IFN-Î³ and IL-2) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, VHHNectin4-CAR-T had no effect on Nectin4- U87-MG cell growth. Novel CAR-T Cells Specifically Targeting Nectin4 Exhibit Effective Anti-Tumor Efficacy in Bladder Cancer Cell Lines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. While scientists believe that gut microbiota play an important role in both the onset and progression of CRC, emerging evidence points to the significance of intratumoral microbiota-microbiota inside tumors-in CRC progression. Nevertheless, little research has been done on the impact of genetics on intratumoral microbiota in CRC patients. Now, a recent study by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with Sun Yat-sen University and the University of Hong Kong, has focused on this relationship and its effect on CRC. The study shows that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2355016-a tiny DNA change that some people carry-affects how intratumoral microbiota adhere to tumor cells, promoting CRC progression. These findings were published in Cell Host & Microbe. For this study, the researchers conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the connection between host genetics and intratumoral microbiota in 748 CRC patients. Host genetics were analyzed using the Asian Screening Array, while intratumoral microbiota were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing. Genome-wide association study analyses assessed the relationships between SNPs and intratumoral microbiota. The results indicated that SNP rs2355016, which is located in the intronic region of the KCNJ11 gene (ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 11), was significantly correlated with levels of F. nucleatum-an anaerobic bacterium that mainly lives in the human mouth and gut-in CRC tissues. These findings enhance our understanding of CRC progression and may inform the development of effective treatments aimed at curbing tumor growth driven by intratumoral microbiota. Furthermore, this study broadens our understanding of the complex dynamics between host and microbiota interactions, shedding light on the role of intratumoral microbiota in other types of cancer. This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao Science and Technology Project (Category C project), among others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients suffering from depression, anxiety and trauma-related disorders experienced significant relief from their symptoms after a new treatment that uses sound waves to modulate deep brain activity, according to new research from Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. The study, published this month in Molecular Psychiatry, demonstrates that low-intensity focused ultrasound technology can safely and effectively target the amygdala - a brain region known to be hyperactive in mood and anxiety disorders - without surgery or invasive procedures. What makes this approach revolutionary is that it's the first time we've been able to directly modulate deep brain activity without invasive procedures or medications." Gregory Fonzo, Ph.D., senior author of the study and assistant professor, Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at Dell Med In the double-blind study, 29 patients with various mood and anxiety disorders received MRI-guided focused ultrasound to the left amygdala. The results showed both immediate reductions in amygdala activity, and after three weeks of daily sessions, patients experienced clinically significant improvements in negative affect and symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. "For decades, the amygdala has been a target of interest, but access has required either brain surgery or indirect approaches through cortical stimulation," said Fonzo. "This technology opens a new frontier in psychiatric treatment, potentially offering relief to patients who haven't responded to traditional therapies." The treatment was well tolerated with no serious adverse events, suggesting a promising safety profile as researchers move toward larger clinical trials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How your body weight influences the interaction of plant compounds with your gut: New research reveals that rutin and genistein elicit distinct gut metabolite changes, depending on BMI, paving the way for personalized nutrition strategies. Their findings reveal substantial differences in metabolic diversity based on the human volunteers' body mass index (BMI), with individuals having a lower BMI demonstrating significantly more diverse metabolic responses. Importantly, the study utilized pooled fecal samples from volunteers, which means that individual-level variability was not assessed; therefore, the findings should be considered exploratory. The researchers also observed that butyrate levels increased in the high BMI group following rutin treatment, while ethanolamine levels also rose, a change considered potentially detrimental to gut barrier integrity in obesity. These findings offer novel insights into the interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiota metabolomes, informing future research on obesity and metabolic health. However, the authors emphasize that larger studies and dietary interventions are needed to validate these preliminary results. Obesity, a condition characterized by unwanted and unhealthy body fat accumulation, is a public health concern, with more than 1 billion adults estimated to live with the disease. It is closely associated with several metabolic and physiological diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), inflammatory disorders, hypertension, and even certain cancers, highlighting the need for research and policy implementations aimed at curbing its population-wide prevalence. Studies on the gut microbiome have confirmed that individuals with obesity exhibit significantly altered gut microbial diversity compared to their counterparts with a standard body mass index (BMI), potentially promoting inflammation, appetite dysregulation, enhanced fat storage, and increased insulin resistance. Parallel research has highlighted the importance of dietary interventions in reversing microbiome dysbiosis and promoting gut health, which in turn benefits obesity outcomes. Studies on polyphenols have shown that these plant-derived bioactives, which often escape digestion, are regularly metabolized by gut microbiota, exerting anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and microbiome diversity-altering effects. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of polyphenols' action on host physiology remain partially understood, with insufficient knowledge on their interactions with bacterial metabolic pathways and circulating metabolites. The present study aims to address these knowledge gaps and contribute to furthering medical understanding of microbiome- and obesity-driven processes by exploring the impacts of rutin and genistein, two polyphenols with known obesity-associated benefits, on postbiotic effects. Study samples (human fecal samples) were obtained from two volunteer cohorts: one with a low BMI (18.5â25 kg/mÂ²; n = 7) and one with a high BMI (>40 kg/mÂ²; n = 7). Samples were pooled within each BMI group to mask individual variability, and these samples were incubated for 48 hours under controlled conditions (10% Hâ, 10% COâ, and 80% Nâ; temperature = 37Â°C) with high-purity (â¥98%) rutin and genistein (Cayman Chemical, Estonia) in triplicate. Following incubation, an adapter-based SIMPLEX protocol was used to extract both hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites for characterization and subsequent downstream analyses. Characterization was achieved using a direct injection Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (DI-FT-ICR-MS) and tandem high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Resultant chromatograms were analyzed using the MetaboScape (2021b) platform, with subsequent annotation leveraging the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB 5.0) annotation database. The HMDB database was also used to elucidate metabolite grouping and pathway enrichment. The study identified 361 metabolites (35 groups) that were significantly regulated (i.e., concentrations higher or lower than corresponding controls) by rutin and genistein. 16S rRNA gene metagenomics confirmed these findings by revealing a higher Î±-diversity in lower BMI fecal matter than in higher BMI fecal matter post-incubation. It is known that there is a decrease in gut microbial diversity in the context of obesity, as was first described by Turnbaugh et al. Nicholson et al. postulated that the state or condition of the intestinal microbiome is reflected in human biofluids such as serum and can be determined by metabolomics.â Notably, several identified regulated metabolites have been implicated in prior research on chronic diseases, highlighting the complex interplay between dietary polyphenols, microbial diversity, and host health. Furthermore, while some metabolites demonstrated beneficial regulation (e.g., increased butyrate levels and reduced lactate levels in high BMI samples following rutin treatment), others (e.g., increased ethanolamine levels in the high BMI group) were found to be detrimental in the context of obesity. Therefore, results of the explorative study would require validation with a larger sample size, biological replicates, and/or an intervention study.â It demonstrates that these interactions are not unidirectional but rather bidirectionalâBMI can alter gut microbial profiles, thereby altering polyphenol metabolism, which, in turn, impacts BMI. Moreover, specific BMI-dependent differences were noted, such as beneficial changes (e.g., higher butyrate and glycine) and potentially adverse ones (e.g., higher ethanolamine), highlighting the complexity of host-microbe-polyphenol interactions. It also provides a methodological approach for future research to investigate the impacts of plant compounds, dietary components, and drugs on gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. However, the authors caution that, due to the small sample size, pooling of samples, and exploratory design, these results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed in larger, well-controlled human studies.

It is expected that the new model will be used as an indicator to determine if surgery is a good option for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment. These substances can be proteins, genes, molecules, or other biological compounds that are produced by cancer cells or by the body in response to cancer. Doctors normally evaluate tumor marker levels using standardized reference ranges or by measuring percentage changes in their levels during treatment. However, traditional tumor markers used to decide on treatment options are unreliable indicators on their own because they differ significantly between patients. Genetic variants of specific genes affect how tumor markers are produced in an individual's body. This means that two patients with identical cancer severity might show very different tumor marker readings simply because they have different genetic profiles. The new "Tumor Marker Gene Model" (TMGM) addresses this limitation by including genetic information when making a prognosis. The model assesses the patient's genotype-the complete set of genetic information or DNA sequences that an organism inherits from its parents-to determine what should be considered normal or elevated tumor marker levels for individual patients. Researchers analyzed DNA from pancreatic cancer patients and found that FUT2 and FUT3 genotypes significantly impacted patients' survival outcomes. These genes influence what are considered normal tumor marker levels when no cancer is present. They affect an individual's ability to synthesize tumor markers and how these markers appear in blood tests when cancer is present. The new model incorporates these two genotypes with tumor marker levels. Results showed more accurate survival prediction rates for patients with tumors initially classified as inoperable (before receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment). This suggests that current tumor marker evaluations are inadequate for these genetic profiles. Tumors classified as inoperable are usually too risky to remove through surgery, however, treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be used to shrink these tumors and make surgery feasible. The difficulty is determining which patients would benefit from surgery. By assessing genetic information alongside tumor marker changes, doctors could more accurately identify which patients with tumors initially classified as inoperable would likely benefit from surgery after treatment. Importantly, the researchers found that tumor marker levels were more closely linked to a patient's genetic makeup than to how advanced their cancer was. This suggests that genetic information is crucial for accurately interpreting what changes in tumor markers mean for individual patients. This finding is significant because doctors rely on tumor markers to assess cancer severity and treatment response. Therefore, interpreting these markers without considering genetics could lead to incorrect conclusions about a patient's condition or treatment effectiveness. We found that the TMGM could more accurately identify which patients would really benefit from surgery. This could prevent some from undergoing unnecessary procedures and offer surgical opportunities to others who might have been overlooked."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly published study involving researchers from Karolinska Institutet indicates that prostate cancer can be diagnosed at an early stage through a simple urine sample. In this present study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), Imperial College London (UK) and Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing (China), have identified new, precise biomarkers. The models were analyzed with AI to find proteins that can be used as biomarkers. These biomarkers were then analysed in the blood, prostate tissue and urine of almost 2,000 patients. The researchers identified a set of biomarkers in urine that were able to indicate the presence and severity of prostate cancer with a high degree of precision. According to their calculations, they surpass PSA, which is the blood biomarker in current clinical use. There are many advantages to measuring biomarkers in urine. The sample can then be analyzed using routine methods in clinical labs." Mikael Benson, principal investigator, senior researcher at the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet One such is being discussed with Professor Rakesh Heer of Imperial College London, co-author of the study and head of TRANSFORM, the UK's national prostate cancer study, which offers a platform for expediting the testing of promising biomarkers. "New, more precise biomarkers than PSA can lead to earlier diagnosis and better prognoses for men with prostate cancer," says Dr Benson. "Moreover, it can reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies in healthy men." Mikael Benson is the scientific founder of Mavatar, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their study also shows that an already approved drug could help strengthen immune defensesâthough its effect in humans remains to be confirmed. The protein, referred to as AGO2, is involved in what is known as RNA interference, a mechanism that regulates gene activity. This primarily concerns type I interferons - signaling substances used by infected cells to warn their neighbors and strengthen the body's defenses. Aishe Sarshad, associate professor of cellular and molecular biology at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, is one of the study's senior authors: "Most surprising was that the virus manages to hijack such a fundamental and well-regulated system as RNA interference - even using it inside the nucleus, where it isn't normally found," says Aishe Sarshad. To this end, they used arsenic trioxide (ATO), a drug approved for treating a type of blood cancer. This discovery indicates that it may be possible to influence the body's own RNAi system to slow viral infections - and not just influenza, but perhaps even other RNA viruses. Now, we want to continue our investigations to see whether the same mechanism is found in other types of infections. This paves the way for a completely new type of antiviral treatment, where we target not only the virus, but also how it uses our own cells." Nuclear AGO2 supports influenza A virus replication through type-I interferon regulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with grade 2 meningiomas and to identify factors influencing tumor control and survival. In this retrospective study, seventy patients underwent GKRS for grade 2 meningioma between 2007 and 2016. Tumor recurrence was categorized as local, marginal, or distant. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, while the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model were employed to analyze potential risk factors. Multiple lesions and multiple prior recurrences were identified as negative predictors of marginal control and progression-free survival. Similarly, multiple lesions and marginal doses â¤13 Gy were associated with poor local control. Serious complications related to gamma knife use occurred in 4% of patients. Our results support the use of GKRS as a reasonable treatment option in the management of grade 2 meningiomas. A higher margin dose should be considered to achieve better local control. Outfield progression (marginal and/or distant recurrence) was common, particularly in patients with multiple prior recurrences and/or multiple lesions. More aggressive treatment strategies should be explored for patients with these risk factors.
