                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: One of the most famous streets in TV history is ready to welcome new residents. Wisteria Lane, a reimagining of the hit ABC mystery dramedy series Desperate Housewives, has been set up for development at Onyx Collective, Deadline has learned. It comes from Kerry Washington‘s Simpson Street and 20th Television where the company is based. But behind those white-picket fences and smiling Insta posts are SECRETS. Desperate Housewives starred Teri Hatcher, Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross and, for the first five seasons, Nicollette Sheridan as five women — mostly friends — living on Wisteria Lane, who begin uncovering dark secrets after their neighbor Mary Alice Young kills herself. Chaidez executive produces Wisteria Lane alongside Washington and Pilar Savone via their Simpson Street as well as Stacey Sher (Into the Badlands) through her Shiny Penny. It is unclear whether Washington could potentially appear on the show. Desperate Housewives creator/executive producer Marc Cherry was not part of the pitch but could be involved in the project in some capacity, sources said. Washington and Savone have an existing relationship at both Disney units. Simpson Street is behind Onyx's most successful series to date, Reasonable Doubt, which has been renewed for a third season, as well as Onyx's comedy series UnPrisoned, starring Washington and Delroy Lindo, which ran for two seasons. At Hulu proper, Simpson Street produced with Hello Sunshine the Emmy-nominated limited series Little Fires Everywhere, which also starred Washington. Hulu already has two other series reboots in the work from 20th TV, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Prison Break, both with pilot orders. Wisteria Lane‘s sale comes on the heels of Desperate Housewives‘ 20th anniversary last October, which brought on a new wave of nostalgia and reboot talk. The cast have been fielding endless inquiries too, with Longoria saying earlier this month that she “would be the first person” to sign up for a Desperate Housewives reboot. There are no current plans for characters from the original series to appear on Wisteria Lane. While speculation about a potential Desperate Housewives follow-up — revival, reboot, sequel, spinoff or other offshoot — has been rampant for more than a decade, this marks the first real stab at expanding the franchise. Keeping the original series' iconic setting makes sense — while most series' outdoor locations use a mix of exteriors from different places, Wisteria Lane is a real street built on the Universal backlot. While the outdoor set had existed for decades as Colonial Street, it was extensively modified for Desperate Housewives and has since taken on a life of its own. While Wisteria Lane is expected to keep its fictional street locale, it has not been determined whether the potential series will film in Los Angeles where the original series' outdoor set is. In November, Cherry spoke about Wisteria Lane's significance to the show. The series also scored with critics and earned seven Emmy Awards throughout its run, including Lead Actress In a Comedy Series for Huffman. Later this spring, Simpson Street will begin production on the Apple TV+ limited series Imperfect Women, starring Washington, Elisabeth Moss and Kate Mara. The company is repped by CAA, Washington Square Arts and attorney Gretchen Rush. Prior to serving as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside developer Steve Yockey on Season 2 of Max's The Flight Attendant, whose mix of dark comedy-drama and mystery-thriller is similar to Desperate Housewives‘, Chaidez was an executive producer and showrunner on USA Network's crime drama Queen of the South. Her series credits also include Hunters, which she developed; 12 Monkeys; In Plain Sight; Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles; and Heroes. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The guests rejoice, drinks in hand, while puffing on cigarettes. But in Indian cinemas, this immersive sequence gets interrupted — not by a vampire, but a certain disclaimer in an oversized font, stating, “Smoking and alcohol consumption are injurious to health.” These health warnings are enforced by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board, due to a government mandate. On scrutinizing the CBFC certificate available in the public domain, observant cinephiles even noticed that the film's running time was almost two minutes longer than its original global version of 137 minutes in Indian theaters. And no, Indian audiences did not get to watch a director's cut. Related Stories ‘Brokeback Mountain' to Be Re-Released in Theaters for 20th Anniversary Natasha Lyonne Teams with Brit Marling and Futurist Jaron Lanier on Hybrid AI and Live-Action Feature What makes this concern even more puzzling is that “Sinners” already carries an “adult” certificate in India, directly implying that children aren't permitted. Adults who could be influenced by Smoke and Stack's (Michael B. Jordan) vices, if it weren't for these jarring warnings? Recent releases such as “Drop,” “Black Bag,” “Novocaine,” and “Warfare” have received similar treatment in Indian theaters. Usually, it is the producers who insert such disclaimers, not exhibitors. These public service announcements (PSAs) are usually sourced from government agencies.” Despite this, they blurred out bottle labels and muted all the cuss words out for what is clearly an A rated film. Kashyap famously took India's Censor Board to court when it demanded that these very disclaimers be embedded in his film “Ugly.” “I argued that it was a fundamental threat to artistic expression. And before they could even enter that world, a jarring ad ruins the experience,” Kashyap said. Acclaimed actress and director Konkona Sen Sharma echoed a similar frustration. Yet, we don't see warnings that say, ‘Violence is injurious to health.' We are burdened with disclaimers in films that already carry an ‘adult' certification from the CBFC. Aren't adults, who are legally allowed to vote, not equipped to handle fictional portrayals of characters smoking, without warnings flashed on screen?” (one half of the famous Raj & DK duo, plus films “The Family Man,” “Citadel: Honey Bunny”) noted that when a smoking warning pops up in Indian theaters during a key scene, your attention shifts. Over time, Indian audiences have gotten accustomed to it,” Krishna D.K. However, over time, resistance to this kind of disruption has steadily faded. Kashyap puts it bluntly, “We've fought for reform, but nothing changes. Most producers and policymakers don't care about aesthetics. Everyone, including the CBFC, is too scared of a potential outrage. What if someone takes offense, is a sentiment that lingers on.” Sen Sharma, however, advocates for an age-based rating system rather than outright censorship, where the government gets to decide what the audience should and should not watch. She said, “If PSAs are crucial, a healthy compromise would be to show them at the beginning. After that, let the audience watch the movie without any distractions.” Mentioning how watching “Oppenheimer” with incessant “no smoking” disclaimers hindered his theatrical experience, Krishna D.K. echoes Sen Sharma's views, adding, “Already, Indians are reading subtitles while watching foreign films; they do not need more text on screen to process.” Journalist Aroon Deep, who closely tracks CBFC certifications, gave more context. “The alcohol warnings, however, are relatively recent and also speculative because there is no legal requirement for them to be inserted. Woody Allen famously refused to release “Blue Jasmine” in India over these disclaimers. Instead of complying, he preferred to skip India's theatrical market entirely. feels that skipping releases in a growing market such as India over such disclaimers may not make complete business sense, adding, “Every country has its share of cultural nuances, and filmmakers do make certain compromises. “Sinners” isn't the first film saddled with statutory warnings. Even the works of auteurs Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan have not been spared. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said. In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen. “I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.” In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began. Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion. “I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com. “Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.” “Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.” PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.” Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. You can only take the high road for so long.” “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.</p>

And in a first for both companies, Disney will debut the first two episodes from an upcoming Star Wars animated series inside Fortnite days before it is released on Disney+. Bruce Logan, VFX Pioneer on 'Star Wars' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' Dies at 78 Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld debuts on Disney+ May 4, but will be available to view on a Star Wars Watch Party island inside Fortnite beginning May 2, the company says. Players on the island can also battle enemies while they watch. But first, Epic will roll out an entirely new Star Wars themed season called Fortnite: Galactic Battle, beginning May 2. “For the first time, Disney+ is premiering a show inside a game, launching alongside our largest Star Wars collaboration with Fortnite to date – giving fans and players an exciting first look at the kinds of experiences they can expect as we shape a new future together,” says Sean Shoptaw, executive vp of Disney Games & Digital Entertainment. “Disney and Epic are pioneering the future of social entertainment together, and this expansive Star Wars collaboration offers a glimpse into the type of interactive experiences we envision,” added Epic Games president Adam Sussman. “We are reimagining what's possible with immersive storytelling in Fortnite with one of the world's most beloved franchises – stay tuned for a lot more to come.” That includes playable characters in Fortnite, but also some exclusive video: In 2019, Fortnite players were able to watch an exclusive clip from The Rise of Skywalker.

Pre-PMC, Connelly was senior vp of product at Dreamworks NOVA, tasked with bringing that company's 3D imaging technology to other industries. Connelly is based in Los Angeles but has begun traveling to Austin on a weekly basis, the company said. “I'm happy to announce that after 3+ years on the SXSW board of directors, I'm now working as Director in Charge of SXSW,” she said in a social post on Tuesday (April 29), adding she's “working with a killer group of dedicated, creative & skilled people who throw the world's most influential festival. We are dreaming up the evolution of this event, so that SXSW never stops helping creative people achieve their goals.” Several other key moves were announced Friday (April 25) during a company town hall as part of ongoing succession planning at the festival, the PMC rep said, along with additional promotions for festival veterans Peter Lewis, Greg Rosenbaum and Brian Hobbs. The organization said it has several open jobs to fill at SXSW. Forrest declined to comment on last week's chain of events when reached by Billboard but remarked in a statement over the weekend that “leaving South by Southwest was definitely not my decision,” adding, “I put my heart and soul into this event for more than 35 years, and I was looking forward to leading several more editions.” In 2022, he was promoted to co-president alongside then-chief brand officer Jann Baskett, succeeding the retiring CEO Roland Swenson. Forrest became the sole president late last year following Baskett's departure to start her own consultancy. As president, Forrest had been tasked with driving business growth and collaborating closely with the event's board of directors, which includes co-founder Swenson, Jay Penske (CEO of Penske Media and SXSW's largest shareholder) and Amy Webb (CEO of the Future Today Institute), among others. The Austin Chronicle hinted at a wider staffing shakeup at SXSW, reporting on Saturday (April 26) that “another 10 or more staff members … have left the company, either through previously planned departures or unexpectedly.” One departure, James Minor, the vp and head of music at the conference, was one of those planned exits. Founded in 1987 by Swenson, Nick Barbaro, Louis Black and Louis Jay Meyers, SXSW has grown into a globally influential event in Austin, which also now includes satellite events like the two-year-old SXSW Sydney and the upcoming debut of SXSW London, which launches in June. Swenson, who led SXSW for 36 years, transitioned to executive chairman in 2022. The leadership change follows a recent announcement that next year's conference will be on the shorter side, running from March 12-18, with interactive, film/TV and music programs happening concurrently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In February, the Philadelphia Eagles became Super Bowl champions after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs with a score of 40 to 22. The city celebrated with chaos and parades and a few members of the team celebrated with a visit to the White House, where Donald Trump somehow managed to make their championship victory all about Taylor Swift. “I was there along with Taylor Swift, how did that work out? How did that one work out?” Swift attended the game in support of Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs player she has been dating for nearly two years. Trump has a long history of taunting Swift, who used her platform to endorse Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024 after expressing regret about not endorsing a candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Trump had previously shown support for the Chiefs, which made his response to their loss even more bizarre. But more than that, it made him a hypocrite. However, Trump attempted to skew perception of their respective reactions by sharing side-by-side videos that showed people cheering for him but booing Swift with no caption.

Trump focusing on Swift as though she were on the field herself could be a deflection from a number of Eagles players who actually were in the game, skipping the White House visit. Last week, when star quarterback Jalen Hurts was asked whether he planned to attend, he offered the reporter an awkward “um,” followed by a prolonged silence and a swift exit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The increased demand amid heightened macroeconomic jitters shows listeners "stay with us even when things feel more uncertain," CEO Daniel Ek says. The music and podcast streaming giant reported total revenue of 4.2 billion euros ($4.54 billion) in the quarter ending March 31, and total paying subscribers of 268 million, according to filings. The first of the large music companies to report earnings on Tuesday, Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek said the  results show healthy, high engagement and strong listener retention, despite global economic concerns that hurt equity markets in March. Universal Music Group, French streaming platform Deezer and South Korea K-pop juggernaut HYBE also report quarterly earnings on Tuesday (April 29). “I don't see anything in our business right now that gives me any pause for concern. I'd be very surprised if long term we had any implications. That is my commentary around the macro environment,” Ek said on a call with analysts, adding later that Spotify's 5 million net new subscribers in the quarter was 2 million ahead of its target. Spotify's gross margin, the percentage of money it keeps on a sale after costs are taken out, improved 400 basis points from last year to 31.6%, a level executives said they expect to maintain this year. Total monthly average users (MAUs) rose 10% to 678 million compared to this quarter a year ago, with premium subscriber MAUs rising 12% and ad-supported MAUs increasing by 9% compared to a year ago. Compared to the prior quarter, premium subscriber MAUs rose 2%, whereas ad-supported held flat. The additional MAUs that came to Spotify in the quarter were primarily from countries outside of Latin America, Europe and North America. The Financial Times reported last week (April 25) that Spotify is preparing to raise the monthly price of its individual subscriptions across Europe and Latin America by about one euro as soon as this summer. Company executives declined to say if the company would raise prices in the near term and declined to give a timeline for when it might roll out a new premium offering for super fans. Companies typically evolve over time to sell different tiers of their service that charge different rates, and Spotify is in the early stages of doing that, Ek said. “For the near term and midterm growth just you should expect … just working on our existing subscriptions and family plans is plenty enough. But … we are not dependent on that for growth.” Ek seemed to put the onus to advance Spotify's super premium offering on music rights holders, like the major music companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fugazi have announced that, starting this month, they're releasing a selection of their archival concert recordings on Bandcamp and streaming services. The post-hardcore luminaries are releasing the first two installments, recordings of their first-ever show on September 3, 1987, and to-date final performance on November 4, 2002, this Friday (May 2). More live concert tapes will be uploaded each month on through the end of 2025. While this makes listening to old Fugazi live shows easier for certain fans, it's not the first time the Washington, D.C., punks have released these recordings. The majority of those shows were recorded by Fugazi's sound engineers, and are available to download for a small price alongside old flyers, gig photos, and general show info. Back in 2023, a 90-minute-long collection of “crowd-sourced, fan-recorded live shows and rare archival footage” called We Are Fugazi From Washington, DC screened in a few movie theaters to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band's last public show. Some of the footage in that film was shot by filmmaker Lance Bangs, and tickets were, fittingly, only $5. Meanwhile, Guy Picciotto has produced albums for Blonde Redhead, the Blood Brothers, Gossip, and many others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Lewis Pullman and Julia Louis-Dreyfus also star in Jake Schreier's account of dysfunctional outsiders teaming up to tap into their heroic potential. That implicit underdog tag is in keeping with a group that's continually underestimated, dismissed as a bunch of “antisocial losers” by the villain who wants them out of the way. While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast but also to the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre. Novel enough to feel like a bolt from the blue. Release date: Friday, May 2Cast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-DreyfusDirector: Jake SchreierScreenwriters: Eric Pearson, Joanna Calo That doesn't mean there's any less physical action or threatened destruction, but there's a kind of back-to-basics innocence here that makes the stakes feel more real. She's questioning whether the void is just boredom or something bigger as she undertakes a cleanup assignment in a Malaysian lab, eliminating both material and human evidence that can be tied back to CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) through the scientific research company OXE. Valentina's involvement in experimental injections of super serums into human guinea pigs has made her the target of an impeachment hearing conducted by Congressman Gary (Wendell Pierce). She has her sharp assistant Mel (Geraldine Viswanathan) working overtime to clean up the evidence. Freshman Congressman Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), whose Winter Soldier life will be hard to put behind him, is working behind the scenes to help expose Valentina's malfeasance; he spots a potential asset in Mel. The familiar team-up element of the MCU formula happens when Yelena finds herself in conflict in an underground vault at the remaining OXE site with John Walker (Wyatt Russell), whom she dubs “the dime-store Captain America”; Ava Starr, aka Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen); and, in a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance, Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko). Realizing that Valentina has set them up in a death trap as more potential damage to be removed, the group bands together, taking a dazed and confused lab patient named Bob (Lewis Pullman) along with them as they bust out. But for audiences without that encyclopedic knowledge, developments around the character, and his affinity with Yelena, will be a rewarding part of the story. Beautifully played by Pullman as a sweet-natured, broken man struggling to outrun his troubled past, Bob is a complex figure through which the movie explores mental instability and the fight between light and darkness. The screenplay's introduction of “interconnected shame rooms,” where characters get stuck in painful memories from their past — Yelena's lingering trauma from her training as a childhood assassin; John's sorrowful separation from his wife and child — dips perhaps a little heavy-handedly into textbook psychology. The ways in which mayhem is visited upon the city and thwarted almost feel like a throwback to vintage Superman and Batman films, before mass CG destruction pretty much pummeled any visceral excitement out of the superhero genre. Instead of the usual bland plastic sheen, he gives us a movie with grit and texture, echoed in the details of Grace Yun's sets. And the score by experimental group Son Lux is a welcome shift away from orchestral bombast into more nuanced territory. Pugh proves herself more than capable of leading a Marvel joint and this is very much her movie, though the entire ensemble play crucial parts, in keeping with the story's ethos. Louis-Dreyfus, while never quite escaping the shameless persona of Selina Meyer (maybe it's just seeing her back in Washington), clearly relishes power-hungry Valentina's ruthless villainy and her political opportunism, without sacrificing the humor. Viswanathan, one of few saving graces in Ethan Coen's painful Drive-Away Dolls, is a very likeable presence with potential for future developments. And as the most significant addition, Pullman is wonderful. Whether Thunderbolts* can rescue the MCU from its doldrums remains to be seen when audiences weigh in. But it at least seems a step in the direction of creative renewal. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dressed in a white, fringed leather ensemble with a cowboy hat, she launched into a set including numerous live debuts for Cowboy Carter tracks, cameos from Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter, and a cover of “Before I Let Go” by the Maze and the late Frankie Beverly. Before Beyoncé took the star-shaped stage with a troupe of red-robed dancers, an electronic screen lit up with an American flag beside a speaker tower emblazoned with the letters “KNTRY,” Cowboy Carter's fictional radio station. Merchandise designs included a depiction of Beyoncé riding a mechanical horse above the slogan, “Never ask permission for something that already belongs to you.” After opening with “Ameriican Requiem” and “Blackbiird”—paying homage to the Black women pioneers of rock, folk, and country—she pivoted into a twisted rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” modeled after Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock classic. During “Freedom,” video showed Beyoncé in dreadlocks smoking a cigar, with a sash reading “the reclamation of America.” Blue Ivy stepped up for the “Formation” choreography and stuck around to perform with her mother on numerous songs, including a performance of “America Has a Problem” preceded by an interlude that seemingly sampled Death Grips' “You Might Think He Loves You….” Rumi later joined for “Protector,” apparently going off-brief to wave excitedly during the dance routine, prompting Beyoncé to break character and laugh while giving her a hug. The third act climaxed with video of a shootout in which she took up arms against an older, white cowboy whose bullets pinged right off her body. 1 and made her the first Black woman ever to debut at No. It also earned her three trophies at the 2025 Grammy Awards, where she claimed her first victory for Album of the Year, as well as for Best Country Album and Best Country Duo/Group Performance. Last December, Beyoncé performed in her Houston hometown for the halftime show during one of the NFL's first Christmas games to stream live on Netflix. The latter, which spanned 56 dates across the globe and featured guest appearances from Kendrick Lamar and Megan Thee Stallion, was captured in the box office–topping documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. The Cowboy Carter Tour continues on Thursday, May 1, with a second night in Inglewood; the rest of the itinerary will take her to New Jersey, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., before European stops including London and Paris.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>controls, quietly advanced a measure Monday that would halt the legislative body from voting on any “resolutions of inquiry,” one of the exceedingly few ways that the minority party — Democrats — can force Congress to conduct oversight of Trump's shockingly lawless, careless, and increasingly authoritarian administration. According to texts published by The Atlantic, Hegseth shared detailed information about plans to attack the Houthis in a Signal chat with several top Trump administration officials, as well as journalist Jeffrey Goldberg. Subsequent reporting indicates Hegseth also shared Yemen attack plans in a separate Signal chat with his wife and brother. The resolutions are privileged, and have a deadline of 14 legislative days. Fresh off a two-week recess, House Republicans returned to Washington and advanced a measure in the Rules Committee Monday that would pause resolutions of inquiry until Sept. 30. This would effectively shut down efforts by Democrats to ask the Trump administration to share documents about Signalgate — or anything else for that matter. The proposed rule change was tucked into a package of resolutions designed to repeal several Biden-era environmental policies, including those allowing California to set more stringent vehicle pollution rules. Polling from Exiled Policy, a libertarian policy consulting shop, finds that among the registered voters who have seen news about Signalgate, 77 percent say that Congress should investigate the U.S. government's group chat leak about its military operations in Yemen. “The survey speaks for itself,” says Jason Pye, who runs Exiled Policy and was previously the vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a now defunct conservative and libertarian advocacy group. “More than three-quarters of voters believe Congress should investigate Signalgate. Unfortunately, House Republican leadership is once again robbing voters of the oversight they're demanding by using a procedural tactic to stop a resolution of inquiry. The only reason House Republican leadership would do this is because they feared it may pass.” Watch Beyoncé Enlist Rumi, Blue Ivy for ‘Protector' on ‘Cowboy Carter' Tour Beyoncé Delivers Powerful Statement on Country at Stunning ‘Cowboy Carter' Tour Opener Sammy Hagar to Alex Van Halen: ‘Just Leave Me Alone. Former Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Va.), who served as an intelligence officer and on a national security subcommittee in Congress, says that “Signalgate deserves an investigation, to say the least. “Not stepping up is one thing, but procedurally shutting down the chance to even vote on it or any other inquiry is a frightening abdication of duty,” says Riggleman. “For years, Republicans talked about constitutional conservatism and the separations of powers. That has been cast aside out of a blind loyalty to Trump.</p>
