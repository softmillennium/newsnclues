                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It will need a lot more chips and power to do so. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Huawei's next-generation HiSilicon Ascend 910D AI processor is expected to offer better performance than Nvidia's H100, reports Reuters. The new processor will be slower on a chip vs chip basis compared to Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Blackwell Ultra B300 GPUs, never mind the next-generation Rubin GPUs slated to launch next year. However, Huawei's approach of building pods with hundreds of processors should allow the Ascend 910D to compete against pods based on Nvidia's current Blackwell and upcoming Rubin GPUs. Huawei is preparing to start tests of its most advanced artificial intelligence processor, the Ascend 910D, with the performance goal of surpassing Nvidia's H100 and offering a domestic alternative amid U.S. export restrictions. Separately, Huawei plans to start large-scale shipments of its dual-chiplet Ascend 910C AI processors to Chinese customers (and probably full systems based on the chips) as early as next month. It remains to be seen whether the Ascend 910D will be made by China-based SMIC, or whether — nearly five years after the U.S. government restricted Huawei's access to leading-edge semiconductor production capabilities — Huawei will once again find a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions. Reaching Nvidia H100 performance levels won't be easy for Huawei. This year, the company introduced its CloudMatrix 384 system with 384 Ascend 910C processors. It can reportedly beat Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 in certain workloads, but at the cost of significantly higher power consumption due to dramatically lower performance-per-watt. Nvidia is on-track to introduce its codenamed Rubin GPUs for AI and HPC in 2026. Rubin GPUs are set to be made on TSMC's N3 (or a more advanced) fabrication process, and they should offer even higher performance-per-watt than the current-generation Blackwell GPUs. Huawei's Ascend 910D and next-generation CloudMatrix systems with 384 of such processors could theoretically offer competitive AI performance on the rack level. Also, it should be noted that Nvidia will barely be able to sell its high-performance Rubin GPUs in China, so for that market Huawei won't really have a direct competitor. Regardless of performance or efficiency, Huawei's Ascend 910D processors will likely become China's workhorses when it comes to AI training in the coming years. The main limiting factor for China will be its ability to produce enough processors — either domestically, or overseas using proxy companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So far, the impact of Donald Trump's trade war with China has mostly only been felt in the markets. The worst is yet to come for consumers, according to Pegatron, a Taiwanese company that plays a key role in the supply chain of Apple and other electronics companies like Dell. An executive from the company, speaking to Reuters, warned that Trump's on-again, off-again, add another 25% for retaliation approach to tariffs will likely lead to shortages as we head toward summer. “Within two months, shelves in the United States … might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing,” Pegatron chairman T.H. Obviously, the extremely high 145% tariff that the US placed on China plays a major role in the potential shortfall of devices—that's a pretty major tax for companies to pay and likely pass onto consumers. But the bigger issue may simply be the uncertainty around what exactly the Trump administration is going to do next, which makes it difficult for any company to plan more than a few months ahead. “We won't immediately adjust our long-term plans just because of two or three months of tariff changes. Manufacturing bases require long-term planning,” Tung said. You can see this play out pretty clearly with Apple. When Trump first announced his “reciprocal” tariffs earlier this month, which initially included a 34% tax on imports from China, Apple started scrambling to move its current stock and manufacturing supply chain around in a way that would minimize the pain. Even India could see an additional 26% added by July if no deal is struck. About two weeks into the trade war, Trump announced his administration would exempt devices like smartphones and computers from the current tariff regime, which provided a reprieve to companies like Apple and their suppliers…for exactly one day, before Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said actually that is only temporary and new sector-specific tariffs will go into effect in a month or two. Will it ever actually come to fruition? Obviously, that is not exactly how these companies with massive, international supply chains like to operate. That means supply is likely to thin out in the meantime. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And while Trump's goons put on a brave face, it was clear they're in panic mode. But when a reporter asked about a report from Punchbowl on Tuesday that Amazon would be listing tariff costs when consumers check out, Leavitt flipped her lid. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” said Leavitt. Amazon probably didn't add an “inflation” surcharge during the Biden years because that's not a real thing that any normal person thinks of doing. In the case of Trump's 145% tariff on goods from China, it's going to be 145%. Leavitt went on to hold up a printout of a Reuters article from 2021 titled “Amazon Partnered With China Propaganda Arm.” The article notes that Amazon was marketing a collection of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speeches and writings on its online store in China about two years earlier. Leavitt didn't really provide any context for why she was talking about this story from years earlier, but clearly intended for the headline to be damning in its insinuations about collaboration with the Chinese government. But it looks like that report about Amazon listing tariffs wasn't true. Reached for comment on Tuesday after the White House press conference, Amazon told Gizmodo that it won't actually be adding a tariff line item to purchases. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. CNN reports that Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after the Punchbowl news story landed Tuesday morning. Well, that part seems obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of economics. White House advisor Stephen Miller was asked about the Amazon pricing controversy on Fox News and tried to play it off like as no big deal. “I'll just take Amazon's statement at face value, which is that they said this is an idea that had been discussed, was not being actioned, and now we can take heart in knowing that they formally rejected the idea,” Miller said. Miller was then asked about whether Trump had indeed called Bezos and the White House advisor laughed it off, insisting that things worked out just fine in the end. STEPHEN MILLER: I have no news to add on it. All I can say is things worked out exactly as they should. Bessent was asked Tuesday about supply chains that are expected to break down in the coming weeks, as ships from China have basically stopped leaving for U.S. ports. But the Treasury Secretary insisted that everything would be fine since he imagined businesses have already planned ahead for any disruptions. “And I think retailers that have managed their inventory in front of this. I speak to dozens of companies sometimes daily, but definitely weekly, and they know that President Trump is committed to fair trade and have planned accordingly.” He asserts that there won't actually be supply chain shocks because every business knew this was coming and should've planned appropriately. Adidas warned Tuesday it would soon be raising prices on goods for Americans. And some companies are already doing layoffs over the economic situation, with shipping company UPS announcing Tuesday it was cutting 20,000 jobs from its 490,000-person workforce. The company said in a regulatory filing that it was “in connection with our anticipation of lower volumes” from Amazon, the company's largest customer. Trump has claimed that he's signing new trade deals with every country, given the fact that even America's closest allies have been hit with a 10% tariff. But there's scant evidence that any trade deal is anywhere close to being completed. Bessent keeps teasing the idea that deals are almost done with Japan and India, but the timing on when those could be done isn't clear at all. Trump has also said he's negotiating with China, but that doesn't seem to be true either. “Let me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday, according to CNBC. Fox News, Trump's favorite TV channel, has done its best to sell the idea that these tariffs are good, but even there, we're starting to see some dissent. Dana Perino, a host on the network and former press secretary for the White House under George W. Bush, said on Tuesday that she doesn't like tariffs and is worried about how small businesses are going to do under them. There's understandably been a fixation on tariffs this week, as Americans are starting to learn about how they will soon pay more for just about everything. But Trump is also working hard to make the United States an unlivable hellhole in other ways. And the president signed an executive order on Monday that experts warn will further militarize American police. A recent poll from PRRI shows that 52% of Americans agree with the statement that Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” The president's approval rating is in the toilet, and Trump's right-hand oligarch, Elon Musk, is getting similar marks, with just 35% of Americans approving of his obliteration of the government with DOGE. But at least everything's going to be much more expensive soon. America truly shot itself in the foot by electing Trump again. And with Trump promising to stay in office illegally after 2028, there's no telling when the madness may end. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The end-to-end encrypted communication app WhatsApp, used by roughly 3 billion people around the world, will roll out cloud-based AI capabilities in the coming weeks that are designed to preserve WhatsApp's defining security and privacy guarantees while offering users access to message summarization and composition tools. And WhatsApp already incorporates a light blue circle that gives users access to the Meta AI assistant. But many users have balked at this addition, given that interactions with the AI assistant aren't shielded from Meta the way end-to-end encrtyped WhatsApp chats are. The new feature, dubbed Private Processing, is meant to address these concerns with what the company says is a carefully architected and purpose-built platform devoted to processing data for AI tasks without the information being accessible to Meta, WhatsApp, or any other party. While initial reviews by researchers of the scheme's integrity have been positive, some note that the move toward AI features could ultimately put WhatsApp on a slippery slope. That means internally it has a well understood threat model,” says Meta security engineering director Chris Rohlf. “There's also an existing set of privacy expectations from users, so this wasn't just about managing the expansion of that threat model and making sure the expectations for privacy and security were met—it was about careful consideration of the user experience and making this opt-in.” The service provider, in this case WhatsApp and its parent company Meta, is boxed out by design and can't access users' messages or calls. This setup is incompatible with typical generative AI platforms that run large language models on cloud servers and need access to users' requests and data for processing. The goal of Private Processing is to create an alternate framework through which the privacy and security guarantees of end-to-end encrypted communication can be upheld while incorporating AI. Users opt into using WhatsApp's AI features, and they can also prevent people they're chatting with from using the AI features in shared communications by turning on a new WhatsApp control known as “Advanced Chat Privacy.” “When the setting is on, you can block others from exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features,” WhatsApp wrote in a blog post last week. Like disappearing messages, anyone in a chat can turn Advanced Chat Privacy on and off—which is recorded for all to see—so participants just need to be mindful of any adjustments. Meta also says that, ultimately, it plans to make the components of Private Processing open source, both for expanded verification of its security and privacy guarantees and to make it easier for others to build similar services. Private Processing, on the other hand, was purpose-built for WhatsApp and doesn't underpin Meta's AI features more broadly. Apple Intelligence is also designed to do as much AI processing as possible on-device and only send requests to the Private Cloud Compute infrastructure when necessary. Since such “on device” or “local” processing requires powerful hardware, Apple only designed Apple Intelligence to run at all on its recent generations of mobile hardware. Rohlf and Colin Clemmons, one of the Private Processing lead engineers, say that it wasn't feasible to design AI features for WhatsApp that could run locally on the spectrum of devices WhatsApp serves. The whole effort raises a more basic question, though, about why a secure communication platform like WhatsApp needs to offer AI features at all. You're sending data to a computer in a data center, and that machine sees your private texts,” says Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptographer who previewed some of the privacy guarantees of Private Processing, but hasn't audited the complete system. More private data will go off device, and the machines that process this data will be a target for hackers and nation state adversaries.” WhatsApp says, too, that beyond basic AI features like text summarization and writing suggestions, Private Processing will hopefully create a foundation for expanding into more complicated and involved AI features in the future that involve processing, and potentially storing, more data. As Green puts it, “Given all the crazy things people use secure messengers for, any and all of this will make the Private Processing computers into a very big target.” Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But as the bill heads to President Trump, who already voiced his intentions to sign it, digital rights advocates warn that a combination of vague language and lack of safeguards makes it ripe for misuse. Ted Cruz and Amy Klobuchar in 2024, the Take It Down Act criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) which includes “revenge porn” and AI deepfakes. The bill has garnered bipartisan support, including from Trump's own family as his wife, Melania, hosted a White House roundtable about it in March. He added, “I'm going to use that bill for myself too if you don't mind because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.” In February, the bill unanimously passed the Senate, and it cleared the House with a 409-2 vote, which Cruz celebrated as a “historic win.” In a statement, Cruz said, “By requiring social media companies to take down this abusive content quickly, we are sparing victims from repeated trauma and holding predators accountable.” “These images can ruin lives and reputations,” Klobuchar said in the same statement. “Victims will now be able to have this material removed from social media platforms and law enforcement can hold perpetrators accountable.” On its surface, the Take It Down Act should be celebrated as a major advancement. But on Monday, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which focuses on combating nonconsensual images, outlined numerous issues, including that the takedown provision is “highly susceptible to misuse and will likely be counter-productive for victims.” For example, there aren't any safeguards against fake complaints, so it can easily be misappropriated to remove other content. While some argue that the legislation is sound and cannot be misused by bad-faith individuals, including government officials, there are examples to look to. Between June 2019 and January 2020, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act received over thirty thousand false notices, which may be attempts to censor online speech or protect the reputation of public officials. YouTube famously has a takedown first, ask questions later copyright policy. With the Take It Down Act expected to become law soon, other pending legislation like the DEFIANCE Act, which allows deepfake victims to sue those who create, share, and receive them, could build on its protections. But in a statement, Public Knowledge's Senior Policy Counsel, Nick Garcia, said, “This was a chance to get it right, but unfortunately, Congress only got it half right—and half right laws can do real damage.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Google notes that one of the most frustrating parts of learning a new language is when you find yourself in a situation where you need a specific phrase that you haven't learned yet. With the new “Tiny Lesson” experiment, you can describe a situation, such as “finding a lost passport,” to receive vocabulary and grammar tips tailored to the context. Google says that when you learn a new language, you often learn to speak formally, which is why it's experimenting with a way to teach people to speak more colloquially, and with local slang. With this feature, you can generate a realistic conversation between native speakers and see how the dialogue unfolds one message a time. Google says that the experiment occasionally misuses certain slang and sometimes makes up words, so users need to cross-reference them with reliable sources. The third experiment, “Word Cam,” lets you snap a photo of your surroundings, after which Gemini will detect objects and label them in the language you're learning. The company notes that the idea behind these experiments is to see how AI can be used to make independent learning more dynamic and personalized. The new experiments support the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan), English (Australia, U.K., U.S.), French (Canada, France), German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), and Turkish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gov press sec says Amazon is partnered with a 'Chinese propaganda arm.' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A significant rift appears to be opening between the Trump Administration and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, sparking an explosive press briefing earlier today. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described Amazon's purported plans to display the costs of tariffs next to product listings as a "hostile and political act" and accused Amazon / Bezos of partnering with a "Chinese propaganda arm." Tariffs were already hotly debated, and then the Punchbowl News report asserting that Amazon is preparing to "display tariff costs" up-front in its product listings was highlighted. According to CNBC, the question about Amazon's purported plans was rather pointed. An unnamed reporter asked if the government representatives agreed that Amazon's move was a "crystal clear demonstration that it's the American consumer, and not China, who is going to have to pay for these policies." Leavitt didn't hold back in her criticism of this notion. "This is a hostile and political act by Amazon," asserted Leavitt, before adding, "This is another reason why Americans should buy American." If this 'tariff transparency' initiative happens, it will mark a sharp change in Amazon's recent Trump appeasement plans. Bezos warmly congratulated Trump on his election victory and donated $1 million to the new President's inauguration fund. Amazon might have thought it was smartly dodging the ire of its customers by shifting the blame for impending price rises to tariffs. Now, instead, it is facing fire from the White House.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American nuclear is in 25-year-old Isaiah Taylor's blood: his great-grandfather worked on the Manhattan Project. It's currently developing a small test reactor, named after Taylor's great-grandfather. In early April, Valar Atomics, in addition to another nuclear startup, Deep Fission, as well as the states of Florida, Louisiana, and Arizona's state legislature, signed onto a lawsuit against the NRC. The lawsuit, originally filed in December by Texas, Utah, and nuclear company Last Energy, blames the NRC for “so restrictively regulat[ing] new nuclear reactor construction that it rarely happens at all.” Some nuclear advocates say that the US's regulation system, which imposes cumbersome requirements and ultra-long timelines on projects, is largely to blame for this delay—especially when it comes to developing new designs for smaller reactors—and that some reactors should be taken from the NRC's purview altogether. But others have concerns about potential attempts to bypass the country's nuclear regulations for specific designs. The NRC has long been criticized for its ultra-slow permitting times, inefficient processes, and contentious back-and-forth with nuclear companies. In other countries, like France and China, the regulators are more cooperative.” The lawsuit takes these criticisms one step further, claiming that by regulating smaller reactors, the NRC is misreading a crucial piece of nuclear legislation. That law mandated regulations for nuclear facilities that used nuclear material “in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security” or that use it “in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public.” “The NRC will address the litigation, as necessary, in its court filings,” agency spokesperson Scott Burnell told WIRED in an email. While we generally think of nuclear reactors as huge power plants, reactors can be made much smaller: Models known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, usually produce a third of the energy of a larger reactor, while even smaller reactors known as microreactors are designed small enough to be hauled by semitruck. There's simply not enough power in an SMR for a Three Mile Island–style meltdown. The lawsuit argues that by mandating a cumbersome licensing process for all types of reactors—including those that are safer because of their size—the NRC is both violating the Atomic Energy Act and stifling progress. A company called NuScale, the only SMR company to get NRC approval for its model, spent $500 million and 2 million hours of labor over several years just to get its design approved. The lawsuit comes at a unique time for nuclear power. Public sentiment around nuclear energy is the highest it's been in 15 years. Dozens of new nuclear startups have cropped up in recent years, each promising to revolutionize the American nuclear industry—and serve power-hungry industries like data centers and oil and gas. Deep Fission, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, seeks to generate electricity using small modular reactors placed a mile underground—a model its CEO, Liz Muller, says is both safer and cheaper than traditional construction. The lawsuit posits that individual states “are more than capable of regulating” smaller reactors. Taylor believes allowing states to compete on regulation would help boost safety within the field of small modular reactors. He says that while some states, like Texas, may have the resources and the knowledge to create their own effective regulatory body, other states may struggle. “Some states are less consistent in applying safety standards than others,” he says. “But I think there's also an opportunity for states to move forward and then for other states to piggyback on what has been developed by the earlier adopter.” Stein also foresees a possibility for continued red tape, as even with state-level regulation, the NRC would still be forced to review individual reactor designs to see if they were safe enough to pass off for state review. The only deadly nuclear accident on US soil occurred at a tiny reactor in Idaho, which killed its three operators in the early 1960s. Designs for small reactors have made leaps and bounds in safety since then—a development Touran says is thanks in part to regulations from the federal government. “I believe a well-designed small reactor, subject to reasonable nuclear design standards based on years of lessons learned, would be very safe,” says Touran. “I do not believe that this means anyone should be able to go out and build a small reactor with minimal oversight.” There have been efforts in recent years to speed up the NRC's permitting process. In 2019, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act; among its many reforms, it mandated that the NRC shift around key licensing processes and create a new process for licensing smaller, more technologically varied reactors. Last year, President Joe Biden signed the ADVANCE Act, which made even more changes to the NRC process; both of these pieces of legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Nuclear energy might be overregulated, but it is also expensive to build, even for smaller reactors, requiring big up-front investments and a large amount of labor. NuScale did lose valuable time and money on a cumbersome regulatory process—but its energy was also competing in price against gas and renewables, which are, on average, cheaper than nuclear power from plants that have been running for decades. When compared to the massive health toll from fossil fuels, which research shows are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths around the world, nuclear power is exorbitantly safe. When Valar announced it would join the lawsuit, Taylor published a blog post on the company's website that claimed that the company's reactor was so safe that someone could hold the spent fuel in their hands for five minutes and get as much radiation exposure as a CAT scan. Another nuclear engineer ran his own calculation using these inputs, finding that holding fuel under the conditions provided by Valar would give a “lethal dose” of radiation in 85 milliseconds. (Taylor told WIRED that Valar is working on a “thorough analysis” in response that will be public in a few weeks and that the initial claims around the spent fuel were simply “a thought experiment we did for our own internal illustration purposes” and not part of the lawsuit materials.) “We've operated reactors so well for so long that a whole new breed of advocates and even founders mistakenly believe that they're fail-safe by default,” says Touran.

Save $210 on your ticket and get 50% off a second when you register by May 4 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Kaplan will take TC Sessions: AI attendees behind the scenes on hybrid reasoning models — which balance quick responses to simple queries with deeper processing for complex problems — and share insights into Anthropic‘s risk-governance framework for mitigating potential AI risks. Before co-founding Anthropic, he spent 15 years as a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, exploring quantum gravity, field theory, and cosmology. In fact, before Anthropic, Kaplan played a role in developing GPT-3 and Codex at OpenAI; meanwhile, at Anthropic, Kaplan helped develop Claude, the company's family of AI assistants. Anthropic's remarkable growth has been fueled by several major developments in just recent months alone, including its launch of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in late February, which the company described as its “most intelligent model yet” and the first hybrid reasoning model that can handle both simple and complex queries with appropriate processing time for each. The company more recently introduced an autonomous research capability and Google Workspace integration, transforming Claude into what Anthropic has characterized as a “true virtual collaborator” for enterprise users. (Anthropic is reportedly developing a voice assistant feature for Claude to compete with similar offerings from other AI companies.) In March, Anthropic announced that it had completed a new fundraising deal that valued the company at $61.5 billion, up from about $16 billion roughly a year earlier. But beyond the theoretical and technical aspects, Kaplan will offer tactical takeaways for teams of all sizes that are looking to implement AI and maximize its impact.

Musk has a launch capability and then satellite internet; now Bezos is getting a launch capability and so will want satellite internet. They are getting engineering and telecom services far cheaper than they can provide in their own country, and the cost to provide terrestrial in their own (OP's stated alternative) would be phenomenal. Even though this may seem backwards, it is buy low sell high.

It doesn't matter so much that the nominal price is low, only that it is cheaper to buy bandwith from the satellite provider than their alternatives. If the local populace can't afford it as an individual subscription an internet cafe will buy it, and as the economy develops it slowly disperses into individual subscriptions rather than by the town internet cafe.If you wait until everyone in developing nation has individual subscriptions you've already lost the game to someone else. Ground zero isn't selling internet to a goat farmer who can't afford it, it's selling one subscription to 100 goat farmers and one to the rich corrupt policeman and then capturing additional subscriptions as their wealth increases as their nation develops. Ground zero isn't selling internet to a goat farmer who can't afford it, it's selling one subscription to 100 goat farmers and one to the rich corrupt policeman and then capturing additional subscriptions as their wealth increases as their nation develops. Regarding this, I am dumbfounded why they keep calling it Project Kuiper.The branding does not sound like something serious. Zuck has one website that's been a has-been enshittified hellscape for going on almost 10 years now, another he very well might be forced to sell, and a pivot to a "metaverse" that's nothing but one big bonfire of cash. Meta may be R&Ding the shit out of VR/AR, but there's no guarantee they're going to be able to cash in. Mega constellations are a new focus, obviously inspired by Starlink, but it's entirely rational given the context of Bezos already owning a rocket company. At this point, any rocket company that doesn't have similar plans in the works is asking to be out of business. The "Kessler syndrome" worst case scenario - I'm just recalling stuff from Scott Manley videos here - I think is a 'really bad decade' where a cascade of collisions makes launching in to LEO impossible until everything settles down in 10ish years. Bad, yeah, terrible even, but possibly worth it in some sense? Space junk is not in the top 5 reasons, and with better tracking and using low altitudes (like Starlink does, where debris deorbits very quickly), we can probably fit a factor of 100 times more satellites in LEO safely. (People underestimate how much of a difference better tracking makes to this issue. Space is huge, and the real isn't actual conjunctions, but the fact that the uncertainty range for objects is so large that you end up getting hundreds of times more false alarms and probably-unneeded avoidance maneuvers than you'd have if you had much better tracking.)

Space is huge, and the real isn't actual conjunctions, but the fact that the uncertainty range for objects is so large that you end up getting hundreds of times more false alarms and probably-unneeded avoidance maneuvers than you'd have if you had much better tracking.) The US Government should nationalize Starlink and provide all Americans with internet service. This is a repeated trope and more ridiculous each time I hear it. Starlink is a private company that is in the business of selling the US Government as well as consumers its services. You can't just "nationalize" it on a whim; after all, the US isn't Cuba.GPS was always owned and operated by the US military so it's an apples and oranges comparison at best. it is not just communist countries that nationalised things. I suspect you're about to have your eyes opened to just how the american right feels about pre-neoliberal europe and asia. Launching the constellation costs X, control activities cost Y per month. Basically allowing GPS to be used by civilians didn't cost them any extra on top of what they were already paying to keep it operational for the military. There user stations have a two way connection with the satelites. The system have very real limits on how many users it can serve. And every new user cost something to the provider. Because of this the government would need to manage who can have access and how much they can use the constellation. There user stations have a two way connection with the satelites.

SpaceX's strategy here is quite brilliant: they induce demand for launches and prove Falon 9 reuse while deploying satellites at relatively low cost (because of the reuse) at a price level absolutely nobody can compete with. Blue Origin simply doesn't have the orbital launch capability that SpaceX does and certainly not anywhere near the price point. SpaceX did too to be fair but that's in the past (ignoring Starship).Starlink is a relatively simple design: it's surface-to-surface through a single hop. I think satellite Internet is likely already a saturated market given you're competing with 4G/5G wireless and fixed line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now newly uncovered security flaws in AirPlay mean that those same wireless connections could allow hackers to move within a network just as easily, spreading malicious code from one infected device to another. Apple products are known for regularly receiving fixes, but given how rarely some smart-home devices are patched, it's likely that these wirelessly enabled footholds for malware, across many of the hundreds of models of AirPlay-enabled devices, will persist for years to come. On Tuesday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm Oligo revealed what they're calling AirBorne, a collection of vulnerabilities affecting AirPlay, Apple's proprietary radio-based protocol for local wireless communication. Bugs in Apple's AirPlay software development kit (SDK) for third-party devices would allow hackers to hijack gadgets like speakers, receivers, set-top boxes, or smart TVs if they're on the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker's machine. Another set of AirBorne vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to exploit AirPlay-enabled Apple devices too, Apple told Oligo, though these bugs have been patched in updates over the last several months, and Apple tells WIRED that those bugs could have only been exploited when users changed default AirPlay settings. Those Apple devices aside, Oligo's chief technology officer and cofounder, Gal Elbaz, estimates that potentially vulnerable third-party AirPlay-enabled devices number in the tens of millions. “Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch—or they will never be patched,” Elbaz says. Despite Oligo working with Apple for months to patch the AirBorne bugs in all affected devices, the Tel-Aviv-based security firm warns that the AirBorne vulnerabilities in many third-party gadgets are likely to remain hackable unless users act to update them. If a hacker can get onto the same Wi-Fi network as those vulnerable devices—whether by hacking into another computer on a home or corporate network or by simply connecting to the same coffeeshop or airport Wi-Fi—they can surreptitiously take over these gadgets. Oligo says it warned Apple about its AirBorne findings in the late fall and winter of last year, and Apple responded in the months since then by pushing out security updates. Below is a video of the Oligo researchers demonstrating their AirBorne hacking technique to take over an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker to show their company's logo for AirBorne. (The researchers say they didn't intend to single out Bose, but just happened to have one of the company's speakers on hand for testing.) Bose did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. Oligo warns that this means hackers could hijack a car's automotive computer, known as its head unit, in any of more than 800 CarPlay-enabled car and truck models. The AirPlay SDK flaws in home media devices, by contrast, may present a more practical vulnerability for hackers seeking to hide on a network, whether to install ransomware or carry out stealthy espionage, all while hiding on devices that are often forgotten by both consumers and corporate or government network defenders. The researchers originally started thinking about this property of AirPlay, and ultimately discovered the AirBorne vulnerabilities, while working on a different project analyzing vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access internal services running on a target's local network from a malicious website. In that earlier research, Oligo's hackers found they could defeat the fundamental protections baked into every web browser that are meant to prevent websites from having this type of invasive access on other people's internal networks. “When third-party manufacturers integrate Apple technologies like AirPlay via an SDK, obviously Apple no longer has direct control over the hardware or the patching process,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “As a result, when vulnerabilities arise and third-party vendors fail to update their products promptly—or at all—it not only puts users at risk but could also erode trust in the broader Apple ecosystem."

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just confirmed that the company's Project Kuiper has begun deploying satellites in low-earth orbit. “Important moment for @ProjectKuiper as we just confirmed our first 27 production satellites are operating as expected in low Earth orbit,” Jassy said on his status on X (formerly Twitter). “While this is the first step in a much longer journey to launch the rest of our low Earth orbit constellation, it represents an incredible amount of invention and hard work. While this is the first step in a much longer journey to launch the rest of our low Earth orbit constellation, it represents an incredible… pic.twitter.com/sb2eO6n6ImApril 29, 2025 It took six years for Amazon to go from applying for permits from the FCC to launching its satellites, and it will probably take a few more years before it can fully launch the rest of its planned constellation. We will also likely have to wait a few more months before Amazon starts offering satellite internet services to its customers — after all, it took Starlink about one year and five months after the initial launch of its satellites before it could offer subscriptions. However, Musk started earlier than Bezos, with SpaceX launching satellites for Starlink just as Project Kuiper was getting permits from the FCC in 2019. It also has a much larger constellation, with over 7,000 satellites already in low-earth orbit at the time of writing (and plans for 35,000 more). Furthermore, it offers coverage aboard vessels, with United Airlines offering in-flight internet through the company. Still, Amazon's offering of a competing satellite internet service is crucial for consumers, as this will allow for competition and give customers the option to pick a service that fits their needs better. Another company is also trying to enter the satellite internet space — China-based SpaceSail already has 648 satellites in low-earth orbit and has agreements in place with Kazakhstan and Brazil, with plans to expand to 15,000 satellites by 2030. These new entrants in the low-earth orbit satellite internet industry will pressure Starlink to offer cheaper and better services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI. Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. But while they can be theoretically useful—Simular AI's S2 agent, for example, intelligently switches between models depending on what it's been told to do—they could also be weaponized to execute cyberattacks. Elsewhere, OpenAI is reported to be throwing its hat into the social media arena, and AI models are getting more adept at making music. Oh, and if the results of the first half-marathon pitting humans against humanoid robots are anything to go by, we won't have to worry about the robot uprising any time soon. The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers. What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works. The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veterans of the European startup scene, who've launched multiple consumer apps in the past, are partly coming out of stealth Tuesday with a new app. Grouphug is led by Felix Petersen, one of the most experienced and seasoned B2C founders in Europe, who built the Amen and Plazes apps. Right now, all users can do on Grouphug is export the text from a group WhatsApp chat and generate funny images from the content. However, this is just a taster of things to come. Underlying this simple exercise to acquire beta users is an app still in stealth mode. For now, Grouphug will create jokes based on what happened in the group. But then we have other plans for it,” he told TechCrunch. But everything that's in WhatsApp groups is not part of the public internet. The startup has already raised a €1.5 million ($1.7 million) pre-seed round led by Berlin-based Blueyard VC, alongside Tiny VC, Charles Songhurst (a Meta board member), Atlantic Labs, and others. Petersen is joined by Joseph Djenandji, who recently exited his well-known multi-channel travel brand LostIn. He has written for UK national newspapers and magazines and been named one of the most influential people in European technology by Wired UK. He has spoken at the World Economic Forum, Web Summit, and DLD. He has interviewed Tony Blair, Dmitry Medvedev, Kevin Spacey, Lily Cole, Pavel Durov, Jimmy Wales, and many other tech leaders and celebrities. He has also advised UK Prime Ministers and the Mayor of London on tech startup policy, as well as being a judge on The Apprentice UK.
