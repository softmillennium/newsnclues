                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon owner Jeff Bezos has made several moves in the past year to gain favor with Donald Trump. Online retail behemoth Amazon pushed back against reporting from Punchbowl News on Tuesday that the company was planning to list tariff costs next to the total price of products on its website. The Trump administration's tariffs against dozens of countries (including a whopping 145 percent tariff on all goods from China) will undoubtedly lead to higher prices for consumers, a point that several major retailers made known during the 2024 presidential campaign. Bezos has also scaled back corporate promises to protect the rights of Black and LGBTQ people, falling in line with the White House's campaign to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion practices in both the public and private sectors. Victoria Brownworth, a Philadelphia-based investigative journalist, lauded the supposed plan to disclose tariff costs. “Amazon showing shoppers exactly how much Trump's tariffs are costing them isn't political — it's transparency,” he wrote on X. This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” Leavitt claimed. She then accused the company of hypocrisy because it didn't list price increases due to inflation following the pandemic, baselessly claiming that Amazon's plan to disclose tariff costs was “not really a surprise” because it was supposedly partnering “with a Chinese propaganda arm.” After the Punchbowl report was published, Trump called Bezos on Tuesday morning to express his anger that tariff costs could be included in the price breakdowns of Amazon purchases. Amazon later claimed that the reporting from Punchbowl was false, with a spokesperson for the company saying that Amazon Haul, a “budget friendly” part of the shopping website, had “considered listing import charges on certain products.” “This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties,” the spokesperson added. But Diego Areas Munhoz, Punchbowl News's tech reporter, partially disputed Amazon's claim. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An embargo in support of Palestinian rights wins out over continuing to send weapons by a 50-point margin. Democratic voters overwhelmingly say that the U.S. should restrict military assistance to Israel until it stops its assault on civilians in Gaza and respects the rights of Palestinians, new polling finds. By contrast, only 21 percent of voters said that the U.S. should continue sending military aid to Israel, supporting Israel's supposed “right to defend itself” while also pushing for a reduction of civilian harm — with a 50-point margin between the two ideas. Further, numerous polls released during President Joe Biden's term found that ending military aid to Israel would be a boon to Democrats' popularity — at a time when support for Democrats is cratering, and in some polls, reaching record lows. And yet, Democrats have not come out strong against the U.S.'s support of Israel, even as President Donald Trump has proposed a genocidal and unpopular plan for Gaza to be totally emptied of Palestinians through forced displacement, starvation or mass killing. In fact, a Senate vote to block a $9 billion weapons transfer to Israel forced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) this month failed with only 15 votes in favor — even less support from Democrats than similar resolutions brought by Sanders last year, despite Trump being behind the latest sale. Meanwhile, establishment Democrats have stayed largely silent as the Trump administration has been abducting and imprisoning pro-Palestine student protesters; in fact, as these disappearances were happening in recent weeks, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) was trying to embark on a tour promoting a book demonizing the same people being targeted by Trump, even as advocates warned that the disappearances represent a major erosion of free speech rights. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Accusation from UN agency comes as Red Crescent medic held since deadly Israeli attack on ambulances is freed The embattled UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has accused Israel of abusing dozens of its staff in military detention and using some as human shields. “They have been treated in the most shocking & inhumane way. They reported being beaten + used as human shields,” Lazzarini wrote on X. Those detained had been subjected to “sleep deprivation, humiliation, threats of harm to them & their families + attacks by dogs … [and] forced confessions”. The Israeli military has not responded directly to Lazzarini's accusation, but has previously denied allegations of widespread abuse in its detention facilities and by its troops. It has, however, launched investigations into abuse by individual soldiers during the war, and into the use of detainees as human shields, bringing charges against service personnel in some cases. Relations between Israel and Unrwa have plunged since the beginning of the war, which was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas militants in southern Israel in October 2023 during which they killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage. Israel banned all cooperation with Unrwa's activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank earlier this year, and claims the agency has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested. The international court of justice, the UN's highest court, is hearing statements from dozens of countries and organisations before delivering a legal opinion on Israel's humanitarian obligations to Palestinians. “It is not Israel that should be on trial. The UN has become a rotten, anti-Israel and antisemitic body.” The hearings come amid an intensifying bombardment of Gaza, which had killed at least 27 Palestinians in the past 36 hours, according to local health officials on Monday. The Israeli military said airstrikes had killed three militant commanders and that all targets were “subject to relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.” Palestinian health officials in the territory say 2,151 people, including 732 children, have been killed since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March that had been in place since mid-January. Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza almost two months ago, stopping all food, fuel, medicines and other items from entering. Humanitarian workers say supplies are running desperately low, with most people eating one meal or less a day. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. There are fears that poor conditions and continuing fighting could lead to many being destroyed or soon becoming unidentifiable. “After everything we went through on that day and since, it cannot be that my father's body will also disappear from the face of the Earth,” said Bar Godard, whose parents were killed during the 2023 Hamas raid and whose father's body was taken to Gaza. Negotiations for a fresh ceasefire appear to have stalled, with conflicting reports about progress in ongoing talks. Few observers expect a breakthrough in the near future, though analysts say Donald Trump's scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in May could lead to renewed US pressure on Israel that might secure a deal. Israeli forces have killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, since it launched its offensive on Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TD Securities is parting ways with its co-head of global markets, Chris Vogel, marking another significant change to its senior ranks this year. Mr. Vogel, who is based in New York City, co-ran the global markets group alongside Dan Charney. Global markets oversees all trading activity, including, equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. In January, Jason Cope, former global head of fixed-income trading who had been with the bank for 15 years, left to run fixed-income at Polar Asset Management. Mr. Vogel joined TD in 2017 from BlackRock as head of global foreign exchange and took on increasingly senior roles. In 2021, he was named co-head of global markets alongside Tim Wiggan. However, he was moved back to TD Securities as its leader in the fall of 2024, after only 10 month, because the group's former head, Riaz Ahmed, retired. Around this time, TD announced significant changes to its leadership, including a new chief executive officer, Ray Chun. TD also revamped its board of directors after the bank pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in the United States. Mr. Vogel will remain with TD as a special adviser until October.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mar-a-Lago-ified room more closely resembles a king's chamber than command post of modern democracy When Donald Trump made his inaugural speech at the US Capitol, he began by proclaiming to the audience of former presidents and tech giants: “The golden age of America begins right now.” While the statement was largely seen as a metaphor heralding a new era of US prosperity, Mr Trump was referring to at least one part of his presidency literally. Since returning to power, the Republican leader has drenched every nook and cranny of the Oval Office in glimmering gold. Mr Trump's office looks more like a king's chamber than the command post of modern democracy. Mr Trump, 78, whose affinity for extravagant interiors has been apparent since he covered his Trump Tower triplex in Manhattan in 24 carat gold in the 1980s, appears to have transformed the office into an extension of his Mar-a-Lago estate. While other presidents hosted world leaders in several rooms in the White House, Mr Trump conducts almost all of his entertaining, including press conferences, in the Oval Office, which he sees as his gilded stage. Gone are the tufts of Swedish ivy – grown from cuttings given to John F Kennedy by the Irish ambassador – and sturdy, plain side tables favoured by Joe Biden. Instead, the fireplace is adorned with gold ornaments and marble consoles held up by gilded eagles. Kate Andersen Brower, who has written several books on the White House, said Mr Trump's renovations are "definitely in keeping with his New York real estate tycoon image". It's very on-brand for him… I think he associates gold with power and prestige. "He's said gold also symbolises luck and angels, but I tend to think it's also about more is more." Ms Andersen Brower said she cannot think of a president who has made "such big changes" to the decorations in the Oval Office, but all presidents leave their mark on the White House. Mr Trump has added golden accents across the whole room. He told Fox News: "They say angels bring good luck." They were grown from cuttings given to John F Kennedy by the Irish ambassador to the US, Thomas J Kiernan. Instead, he has filled the space with seven gold ornaments, some of which appear to be trophies or candle holders. 3 Mr Trump has packed almost every inch of wall space in the oval office with portraits in gold frames, almost doubling the number favoured by Mr Biden, mimicking his style at Mar-a-Lago. Mr Trump has hung close to 20 paintings in the Oval Office all of predecessors or statesmen he is inspired by: John Adams: Founding Father and second US president. Bottom row, left to right On the extreme left and right are grand, gold stucco mirrors which Mr Trump has had added to many walls and doors. Martin Van Buren: Eighth US president and founder of the Democratic Party. Mr Trump's decision to hang a portrait of James Polk, a president from the 1800s who oversaw the largest territorial expansion in American history, fits with his expansionist ambitions in Panama, Canada and Greenland. Mr Trump has returned a painting of Andrew Jackson, a populist with whom the president frequently identifies and who also faced censure during his presidency, after Mr Biden removed it during his time in office. It was removed by Barack Obama in 2009, which Boris Johnson called a "snub to Britain". 8 The cream chairs in front of the fireplace have been replaced with light yellow versions, covered with a champagne-coloured flocked fabric. 9 Gold coasters have been added to the coffee table. 10 A scale model of Air Force One, the presidential plane that Mr Trump designed during his last term, sits on the coffee table. It was removed by Barack Obama in 2009, which Boris Johnson called a "snub to Britain". 8 The cream chairs in front of the fireplace have been replaced with light yellow versions, covered with a champagne-coloured flocked fabric. 9 Gold coasters have been added to the coffee table. 10 A scale model of Air Force One, the presidential plane that Mr Trump designed during his last term, sits on the coffee table. Every angle of the office now shimmers after Mr Trump enlisted the help of John Icart, who some of his advisers are said to refer to as his "gold guy", to redecorate the room. Mr Trump is said to often return from his weekend sojourns to Mar-a-Lago with a new piece of decor for the Oval Office. There are gilded Rococo mirrors, gold cherubs shipped in from his Florida estate and a heavy, gold paperweight embossed with "Trump" on the coffee table. Behind the Resolute Desk sit pictures of Mr Trump and his wife and children, along with a glinting gold model of the Fifa World Cup. 1 Mr Trump opted to keep the Resolute Desk, which has been used by every US president since Jimmy Carter, other than George H W Bush. Presidents can choose one of seven desks to use in the Oval Office. 2 The famous red button Mr Trump uses to summon a Diet Coke has returned to his desk, which he said people sometimes mistake for the nuclear button. One framed picture shows his eldest three children in formal evening wear, another shows him with his daughter Ivanka and there is a picture of Mr Trump and his wife Melania, holding their son Barron when he was a baby. 5 A bust of César Chávez, the Mexican-American labour leader who fought for the rights of farm workers, has been removed. It has been replaced with an equestrian sculpture of Andrew Jackson; an artist's miniature of a statue located in Washington's Lafayette Park. 7 The paintings of former statesmen Mr Trump has hung near his desk also point to the priorities of his second term. A large portrait of Ronald Reagan hangs immediately to the right of his desk, showing his admiration for the Republican leader. Above it sits a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the country's first treasury secretary. James Monroe, the fifth US president, is displayed in a golden frame to Hamilton's right. A second portrait of Andrew Jackson hangs further to its right 8 Sitting under the painting of Mr Reagan is a sculpture called "The Bronco Buster" by Frederic Remington, which also graced Trump's first Oval Office. Mr Trump instead opted for the cream-coloured carpet he used during his first term. The pastel tones of Mr Trump's rug, which was also used by Ronald Reagan, are more in keeping with the gold and cream colour palette the president favours across Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower. A copy of the Declaration of Independence has been installed behind blue curtains to protect it from the light. Ms Andersen Brower said the addition of extra paintings in the Oval Office is “about power and [Mr Trump] cementing his own legacy as being as great, or, in his mind better, than his predecessors”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mankind's achievements over the millennia have been bountiful. Until now that is, as 100 days into his presidency US President Donald Trump seems determined to throw this painful learning to the wind, risking a world forced into reverse. Whatever one's view of the policies themselves, Trump's total upending of the global status quo has sewn fear and uncertainty among America's friends, exacerbated market volatility and normalized economic aggression. It is Ukraine that should give in to Russia, which “has all the cards,” Trump says. Russian President Vladimir Putin's “pretty big concession,” his US counterpart adds, is not “taking the whole country.” Yet despite three years of “meat-grinding” war, Putin's aim remains as contrary to international law as it was when he launched his unprovoked, full-scale invasion. It is clear then why Trump struggles to do what all his allies find easy: to blame Putin for defying the rules-based world order in a brutal campaign to swallow his smaller neighbor. The US president often even blames Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky for the war in which at least 42,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed or injured, according to the United Nations, saying “he should never have started it.” “Old assumptions can no longer be taken for granted, the world as we knew it is gone,” he said. The president's world view was nurtured by his property-developing, landlord father Fred Trump. The parallels are not hard to spot: the world's most powerful man still relies on bravado and bullying to get what he wants. America has been “taken advantage of by virtually every country in the world,” Trump inaccurately claims, “we're no longer going to be the country that's ripped off by every country in the world.” Such is Trump's braggadocio, no one he trusts appears brave enough to challenge him. Only when global markets soured, and his Petri dish economic experiment turned putrid, did he backslide on the threat to impose immediate tariffs on both friends and foes of the US, and even then, it may not be enough to avoid economic pain. China seems ready to wait out his trade-defying tariffs, having been preparing for this moment since Trump's first term. Now, it seems, he must learn a costly lesson for himself that economic evolution had already taught the experts. And while Trump's defiant pose after the July 2024 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, was enough to convince Putin that he was “a courageous man,” the US president is already backing down on some of his tariff bravado, chastened by his loyalists who found their voices as bond markets tanked. Trump has since criticized Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader is interested in peace and suggesting “he's just tapping me along.” In the aftermath of great empires, regional warlords allied, feuded and fought each other for centuries before nations emerged, and largely did the same. He famously said, “when France sneezes, the rest of Europe catches cold.” The Manhattan real estate developer has said he is going to “get” Greenland “for national security reasons.” Greenland and its Danish patron, a NATO ally that is no match militarily for the USA, say no. Canada's prime minister says the same about Trump's plans to make his northern neighbor the USA's 51st state, insisting “it will never happen.” Mark Carney, a former central banker already battling Trump's aggressive trade tariffs, knows the threat is real, telling voters ahead of Monday's election in which his Liberal Party won a stunning fourth consecutive victory “the Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country.” Trump's world view is clear: he speaks as though he can reach out and take these things, and clearly believes he is working from an island of power, isolated from the negative consequences of his assumed conquests. But no man, nor nation, is an Island. Trump's weakness is not just that he might buy Putin's lie that he can conquer all Ukraine, or be outfoxed by Xi on tariffs, but that the rest of the world increasingly sees through his mantle of self-belief. The costs of this muscle-power politics will be revealed more slowly than the near-instantaneous economic market pain to his trade tariffs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Chinese man fighting for the Russian Army claims his superiors locked him in a dark steel-barred pit, with barely enough room to stand, for 21 days. Michael, not his real name, said he joined Russia's fight against Ukraine to “have a taste for military life abroad” but after a brutal year on the frontlines is now convinced enlisting in Vladimir Putin's army was “a mistake.” His experience in the pit, where the 29-year-old said he could barely lift his head, killed his desire to fight for Moscow and he wants to send a message home to other Chinese nationals contemplating joining Russia's fight. “I have to speak out some truths and warn those irrational Chinese – don't come over here,” he said. Speaking to CNN by phone, Michael said he was currently recovering from injuries sustained on the battlefield. “The world's number two military is a sheer joke,” Michael said, listing subpar equipment, inadequate logistics, mistreatment and “severe corruption” as issues within the military, complaints that have been widely documented since the war began. Both Ukraine and Russia have used foreign fighters to bolster their forces. But the issue of Chinese mercenaries fighting for Russia was thrust into the global spotlight when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed two Chinese fighters had been captured by Ukraine in early April and claimed there were “many more” in Russia's ranks. Zelensky demanded answers from Beijing which, in turn, denied any involvement and repeated previous calls for Chinese citizens to “refrain from participating in military actions of any party.” Russia's deputy foreign minister called the claims Chinese citizens were fighting in Ukraine a “complete untruth,” according to TASS, a Russian state media agency. Kyiv said it had information that 155 other Chinese nationals were fighting for Russia. But the true number is likely higher, according to Zelensky. A handful of Chinese people have been fighting on the Ukrainian side too. CNN has confirmed their presence with one battalion, but Ukraine's Land Forces could not provide a total number as each unit recruits directly. The posts and accompanying videos seen by CNN typically promise good pay and to boost the manhood of those who sign up. The videos are all in Russian but come with Chinese translations. One carried Chinese subtitles saying: “Aren't you a man? Be a real man!” It is not clear who made the translations. Once enlisted, he started posting regular social media videos of his time in Moscow's ranks. Michael told CNN he had been a soldier in China's People's Liberation Army, but left in 2018, and said seeing the ads and videos from other Chinese fighters on the frontlines rekindled his “aspiration for the army.” Michael told CNN that his contract offered 200,000 rubles ($2,400) per month and in a previous social media video said there were also bonuses when they captured territory from Ukraine – an extra 50,000 rubles ($598) for every kilometer they pushed eastward. According to Michael, most of his Chinese comrades-in-arms are in it for the cash. As one self-proclaimed Chinese mercenary put it in a comment on Douyin: “no money, no honor.” CNN tracked the IP address of the post to a location in Russia. Michael offered a reason the money mattered; describing himself and many Chinese fighters on Russia's frontline as being “from the bottom of the heap” in his homeland's hyper-competitive society and where economic growth is slowing. The man, 37, who CNN has chosen not to name, said he spent a year in Russia's army from July 2023. He said it was hard for him to pinpoint exactly why he signed up, but didn't think money was a major factor for him. He said he previously served as a prison guard and, like Michael, claimed fighting for Russia was not a political choice. Maria Repnikova, an expert on Chinese and Russian politics at Georgia State University, said state media coverage in China leans towards a pro-Russia stance. Some Chinese fighters have adopted language commonly deployed by the Kremlin, expressing their desire to “go against Nazi fascism” and referring to the war as a “special military operation” in public posts on Douyin, seen by CNN. While they may not have caught the world's attention until now, seeing Chinese fighters with buzz cuts sharing daily experiences from the frontlines and engaging in live chats with fellow fighters was commonplace on Chinese short video platforms. But shortly after Zelensky raised the issue of Chinese fighters on the Russian frontlines with Beijing last week, many of those social media accounts were blocked. The Russian recruitment ads, however, are still widely available on China's tightly-controlled internet. Michael was one of those Chinese fighters regularly sharing his experiences on Chinese social media, but he said was restricted from posting before the latest round of censorship. He suspects the travel ban is connected to his previous service in Russia. There have been Chinese fighting on both sides of this war but those who chose to fight for Ukraine – who largely see themselves as motivated by ideology rather than finances – seem to have one thing in common: they spent time out of China. Jason, who was born in China, moved to the United States during his high school years. CNN has seen his Chinese passport and enlistment contract. After spending four months dodging shells in trenches and foxholes, the then infantryman said he sought to be even more active in combat. He applied to transfer to an assault company, but said he was turned down because the Ukrainian commander was suspicious about his nationality. Reflecting, a year after returning to the US, he said that was a “pity,” but he understood the suspicion because “China and Russia are pretty close.” “I think most of the Chinese people are being brainwashed for a long time,” he said. She told CNN she “used to be pretty indifferent to politics” but her thinking changed during a year of studying in Europe, away from the confines of China's Great Firewall and its pervasive online surveillance. She said she was inspired to sign up for service in Ukraine after seeing a video about the only known Chinese national killed while fighting for Ukraine. Sophie told CNN many of her friends back home in China hold pro-Russian views of the war and said she too was once “brainwashed” by “one-sided information from Russia.” Ukrainian security personnel watched over the men as they spoke, likely under duress, and the fact the two men were put in front of media at all is likely a violation of international humanitarian law. Related article Ukraine parades Chinese nationals captured fighting for Russia. Following the capture, Zelensky has publicly said Ukraine is investigating whether the Chinese state has had a hand in encouraging its nationals to fight for Russia. “I don't have an answer to this question yet. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding: “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.” “These claims are groundless,” said Lin Jian, spokesperson for China's Foreign ministry, after being asked about Zelensky's statement “many more” Chinese citizens were fighting for Russia. “Ukraine should acknowledge China's efforts and constructive role in seeking a political solution to the crisis,” said Lin in a news conference on April 9. “It's incredibly brutal, far beyond what anyone can imagine,” said Michael.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President had said order relaxing some of his 25% tariffs on cars and car parts will be ‘short-term' help We just wanted to help [automakers] enjoy this little transition, short-term. If they can't get parts, you know, it has to do with a very small percentage. The president will sign an executive order later today to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts, a significant climbdown as the duties threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers. The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, White House officials said. They also said that parts made in Canada and Mexico that follow North America free trade rules would not face tariffs, an exemption previously described as temporary. Emhoff, who is Jewish and spoke passionately against the rising tide of antisemitism during his time as the Second Gentleman, said he was informed on Tuesday that he had been removed from the museum's council. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve,” he said. The New York Times reported that the Trump administration also fired Ron Klain, Biden's first chief of staff, Susan Rice, national security adviser to Barack Obama and Biden's top domestic policy adviser, and Tom Perez, the former labor secretary who was a senior advisor to the former president. Emhoff's law firm recently struck a deal with the Trump administration to avert an executive order targeting its practice, a decision the former Second Gentleman is reported to have voiced his disagreement with. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has abruptly banished the Pentagon's Women, Peace and Security program as part of his crusade against diversity and equity – dismissing it as “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative” despite it being a signature Donald Trump achievement from his first term. In a post on X, Hegseth wrote: “This morning, I proudly ENDED the ‘Women, Peace & Security' (WPS) program inside the [Department of Defense]. The defense secretary added the program was “pushed by feminists and left-wing activists”, claiming “Politicians fawn over it; troops HATE it.” The Trump campaign even courted women voters by citing the initiative as one of its top accomplishments for women on its website. “Biden ruined EVERYTHING, including ‘Women, Peace & Security,'” he insisted. He is a longtime contributor to Republican candidates, including Trump, having donated millions of dollars to support his campaigns and 2025 inauguration fund. I think we've got the big beautiful deal that's moving along, and I think we're going to have it taken care of.” A very important element that we're working on now, more important than anything with the border in good shape, is the fact that we want to get, and very importantly, the big beautiful new deal. If the Democrats blocked it, you'd have a 60% tax increase. that would be the biggest bill in the history of our country in terms of tax cuts and regulation cuts, and other things. We just wanted to help [automakers] enjoy this little transition, short-term. If they can't get parts, you know, it has to do with a very small percentage. The president will sign an executive order later today to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts, a significant climbdown as the duties threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers. The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, White House officials said. They also said that parts made in Canada and Mexico that follow North America free trade rules would not face tariffs, an exemption previously described as temporary. Donald Trump said Jeff Bezos “was very nice, he was terrific” during their call earlier and “he solved the problem very quickly”. “He's a good guy,” Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One. The Trump administration has reached one trade deal already and is waiting for approvals from that country before announcing it, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC. Key GOP moderate Don Bacon has privately told the White House he won't accept more than $500bn in cuts to Medicaid, two people with direct knowledge of the matter have told Politico. Moderates like Bacon are wary of cutting deep into social safety net programs like Medicaid, while GOP fiscal hawks are pressing for more drastic cuts to federal spending. With the party's slim majorities in both chambers, House speaker Mike Johnson – despite his optimistic tone this morning – can't afford to lose more than three Republicans on a party-line vote. Current and former officials describe a culture of intimidation where the “sense of dread is palpable” among employees, with one former FBI field office head saying: Donald Trump called Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos on Tuesday morning to complain about a report that the company planned to display prices that show the impact of tariffs, CNN reports. CNN notes that an administration official described Trump as “pissed” after learning of the news. The spokesperson later sent CNN a revised statement, adding: “This was never approved and not going to happen.” For US foreign policy, Donald Trump's first 100 days in office were the weeks when decades happened. The tariffs Trump has unleashed will, if effected, disrupt global trade and lead to supply chain shocks in the United States, with China's Xi Jinping seeking to recruit US trade allies in the region. Operating mainly through executive action, the Trump administration has affected nearly all facets of US foreign policy: from military might to soft power, from trade to immigration, reimagining the US's place in the world according to an isolationist America First program. It's upended 80-some years of American foreign policy,” said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former ambassador to Nato. As we reported earlier, Donald Trump will sign an executive order later today giving automakers building vehicles in the US relief from part of his new 25% vehicle tariffs to allow them time to bring parts supply chains back to the US, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said. This would help domestic carmakers move their supply chains to the US, he said. The relief would be phased in over three years, he added. All cars that are finished in the US that have 85% domestic content will have no tariff applied, Lutnick said, adding that the auto tariff will apply to foreign carmakers building cars in the US. “This is ‘finish your cars in America and you win',” he said. Autos and parts subject to the 25% section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs would no longer be subject to other tariffs imposed by Trump, including 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican goods, as well as 10% duties applied to most other countries, Reuters reports. Reuters reports that Lutnick said the adjustments to auto tariffs were aimed at allowing domestic carmakers time to grow their US plants and employment. He said it hadn't been clear until conversations with automakers that even a small tariff would hold them back from hiring and investment. Two years was the agreed time to give manufacturers sufficient time to build up their supply chains, Lutnick said, adding there would be no third year of relief. A majority of the Senate has backed one-time senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, a position the former business executive assumes amid a deep strategic rivalry and blistering trade war between the two countries. Reuters reports the tally was 67 to 29 in favor of confirming Donald Trump's nominee Perdue, who was a Republican senator from Georgia from 2015 to 2021. Perdue has long been an ally of Trump and has fiercely repeated the president's lies about voter fraud in the 2020 election. He's also the former chief executive of Dollar General.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. U.S. President Donald Trump said he believes he is "saving" Ukraine, though he dodged a question about supplying weapons to the war-torn country in an interview with the Atlantic published April 28. Trump on April 24 sat down with Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg — who in March revealed that top U.S. defense officials disclosed war plans in a Signal chat — for a conversation about his first 100 days in office. One of Trump's goals for his first 100 days was to end Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. In recent days, however, the Trump administration has threatened to walk away from the peace negotiations altogether. "I think that nation will be crushed very shortly. When told that Ukrainians do not necessarily share that perspective, Trump insisted again that the full-scale invasion would not have happened if he had won the 2020 U.S. election — a claim Trump makes repeatedly when pressed on his Ukraine-Russia policy, often in lieu of discussing current or future assistance to Kyiv. "We'll have to see what happens over the next period of pretty much a week. We're down to final strokes," he said. "And again, this is (former U.S. President Joe) Biden's war. I'm not gonna get saddled — I don't wanna be saddled with it. Trump claimed he was "on Ukraine's side" but drew a distinction between supporting Ukraine and supporting President Volodymyr Zelensky. "I've had a hard time with Zelensky," Trump said, bringing up the leaders' infamous Oval Office argument in February. Afterwards, Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing to attack Ukrainian cities. When asked by Goldberg if continued escalation from Moscow would lead to the U.S. shipping weapons to Kyiv, Trump did not give a direct answer, suggesting other forms of pressure on Russia. "Doesn't have to be weapons," he said. "There are many forms of weapons. Doesn't have to be weapons with bullets. It can be many other weapons." Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tougher sanctions against Russia, but has not followed through on those threats.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SARAH KREPS is John L. Wetherill Professor and Director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution. In the spring of 1943, Hans Bethe, a theoretical physicist and professor at Cornell University, left Ithaca, New York, for a classified government site in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Bethe was just one of dozens of academics pulled from elite American research universities into wartime service, applying their intellectual training to solve critical national security challenges. But during World War II, the government turbocharged its funding for research and development and boosted it again during the Cold War. The government extended grants to a kaleidoscopic variety of academic efforts that included conducting basic physics experiments, developing materials to enable hypersonic flight, and inventing artificial intelligence algorithms. This funding often constituted the only reliable support for long-term high-risk projects that private industry, focused on near-term profits, typically neglects. Now, President Donald Trump's administration is moving to sever the link between academia and government by freezing billions of dollars in federal grants to top research institutions. This act may score political points among those accustomed to understanding academia as a left-leaning “ivory tower” insulated from ordinary Americans and private enterprise. Research universities have long undergirded, in particular, the country's national security through defense research, and they continue to train the pipeline of talent that powers both government and industry. Before the war, most American scientific research was funded by foundations, university endowments, and private donations. In 1945, Vannevar Bush—the Raytheon founder who became vice president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then directed the government's Office of Scientific Research and Development, which sponsored wartime military R & D—prepared a report called Science, the Endless Frontier. Bush, who had overseen much of the United States' wartime scientific mobilization, argued that the United States must not stop boosting universities' funding. Because modern war required “the use of the most advanced scientific techniques,” he wrote, “colleges, universities, and research institutes” would have to “meet the rapidly increasing demands of industry and government for new scientific knowledge,” and so “their basic research should be strengthened by use of public funds.” Institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the California Institute of Technology, and Stanford University quickly secured new federal grants and transformed themselves into hubs of scientific innovation, many with a direct connection to defense. This model—in which universities received federal funding for defense-oriented research—quickly spread, and by 1949 such grants made up 96 percent of all the public funding for university research in the physical sciences. The experiment in federally funding university research proved so successful that it became a permanent feature of U.S. government strategy. One early ARPA project, a collaboration with Stanford and UCLA, led to the development of ARPANET, the direct precursor to today's internet. Universities, for their part, converted U.S. taxpayers' dollars into innovations that made the country prosper. Nowhere was this more evident than at Stanford, where federal defense contracts and research funding supported a culture of innovation that helped create Silicon Valley. Faculty members such as Frederick Terman, who aggressively expanded the university's statistics and engineering departments to win more Defense Department grants, encouraged students to commercialize their research, enabling the founding of companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Fairchild Semiconductor that would become cornerstones of the computing revolution. While many other countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, continued to direct government funding for scientific research mainly toward government labs, the United States built a decentralized research system anchored in its universities. This decentralized system not only accelerated technological progress but also helped defense-related innovations flow into private commerce, giving U.S. industry a clear edge that the Soviet Union struggled to match, despite its extensive investments in technical education. Although private companies such as OpenAI and Google are popularizing new AI models, the core technologies that power these systems were developed by researchers trained in university labs sustained by decades of publicly funded research. Without substantial U.S. government investment into universities, there would be no AI revolution to commercialize. Indeed, academic research rarely stays confined to university labs. The flow of knowledge and expertise from academia into industry is what transforms abstract scientific insights into deployable technologies with strategic and economic value. Many universities have so-called technology transfer offices that work to patent inventions, license new technologies, and support startups. Through these initiatives, discoveries made on campuses migrate into the commercial sector and startup ecosystem, preserving the United States' dominance in advanced technology. Today's driverless vehicles, for instance, rely on a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system that originated from federally funded missile-tracking research at MIT. American graduate programs in engineering, applied physics, and computer science are among the most respected in the world, attracting top-tier talent and serving as engines of innovation. For example, Jensen Huang came to the United States to study electrical engineering at Oregon State University and earned his master's in engineering at Stanford. Students trained in federally supported labs often move fluidly between academia, national laboratories, and private industry. Rivals have studied the U.S. model closely and are moving aggressively to replicate it. China, in particular, is racing to close the gap by pouring state investment into its universities. The People's Liberation Army now collaborates with leading Chinese technical institutes to accelerate the development of dual-use technologies, particularly in AI, space systems, and cyberwarfare. But there is one advantage China cannot easily replicate: the openness of U.S. universities. Authoritarian states can flood labs with money, but they cannot manufacture the academic freedom and economic dynamism that make the U.S. university system a magnet for global talent. The Trump administration's recent moves are stripping university labs of their funding by freezing Defense Department research grants to institutions it deems ideologically noncompliant—effectively targeting the very research pipelines that sustain national security innovation. Weakening the university-defense research partnership is a strategic miscalculation with far-reaching consequences. Universities are the channels through which scientific discoveries yield real-world applications and talented youth become world-changing entrepreneurs and innovative defenders of national security. The Trump administration might argue that it is willing to continue funding if universities align with its ideological demands. But ceding independence in exchange for scientific funding would undermine the very rigor and openness that has given the U.S. university system its edge for decades. If the government allows ideological discomfort to disrupt its alliance with research universities, it will sacrifice its advantage in innovation and competitiveness. Some talent will drift toward private firms, where pressure to generate short-term profit often precludes a focus on projects that align with long-term national security priorities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Ukraine is not on track to defeat Russia on the battlefield, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on April 28 while defending the Trump administration's efforts to negotiate a peace deal. While U.S. President Donald Trump's vows to end the war within his first 100 days of office was not fulfilled, Washington continues to press both sides to reach a ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on April 27 that the next week will determine whether the U.S. remains involved in the peace process or withdraws as a mediator altogether. "I can't say with 100 percent certainty, Charlie, that we're going to be able to do it," he said. Vance did not discuss the details of the proposed peace agreements, but did say he believes Ukraine will not be able to defeat Russia militarily and take back its occupied territories by force. Vance said that if the war drags on, Russia and Ukraine would both face societal collapse, millions more lives could be lost, and the risk of nucelar war would escalate. The U.S. proposal for peace in Ukraine reportedly involves significant concessions from Kyiv, including formal recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea. Ukrainian and European officials have put forth an alternative plan that involves U.S. security guarantees and no promises of territorial concessions until after a full ceasefire is implemented. The Kremlin, meanwhile, continues to insist on maximalist demands in ceasefire negotiations, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a three-day truce in honor of Victory Day. Moscow requires international recognition of its illegal annexation of Crimea, as well as the entirety of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as a condition for peace talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 28. Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire and has repeatedly urged Russia to implement an unconditional truce. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he reiterated this aim in his face-to-face meeting with Trump at the Vatican on April 26.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liberal Leader Mark Carney gestures as he leaves a polling station after casting his ballot in the federal election in Ottawa on Monday.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press Mark Carney is expected to name a new cabinet within two weeks of his election victory and recall Parliament soon after. A senior Liberal official told The Globe and Mail that by Canada Day, the new government plans to bring in a new budget that includes a promised middle class tax cut and legislation to remove federal impediments to interprovincial trade. Mr. Carney has promised to initiate immediate new trade and security negotiations with the administration in the United States as Canada braces for tariffs on auto parts that are expected to take effect on May 3. He also intends to put a new face on the cabinet that will stand out from that of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, the official said. Mr. Carney unveiled a 24-member cabinet when he became Prime Minister on March 14. Some of the potential new MPs the Prime Minister is expected to bring into cabinet are former Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitao, ex-Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson, former Delta Chamber of Commerce executive director Jill McKnight in B.C., climate change activist Shannon Miedema in Halifax and gun control advocate Nathalie Provost in Quebec. The official said Mr. Carney is determined to have a gender-parity cabinet that also ensures regional representation. No serious discussions have taken place about what cabinet role would be assigned to new MPs and whether senior ministers such as Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc would keep their current high-profile posts. The budget will also mark a formal end to the consumer carbon levy, an issue that had divided Canadians for years. In March, when Mr. Carney met the premiers and territorial leaders, he promised to move quickly to eliminate trade barriers and discussed finding ways to efficiently move energy and critical minerals across the country. He has not ruled out a pipeline from oil-rich Alberta to Eastern Canada. Quebec has previously opposed an east-west pipeline, but Premier François Legault now says opinions are changing because of the U.S. economic threats. He said his government would also remove labour mobility restrictions in federally regulated professions. He has announced 25-per-cent levies on foreign-made vehicles, including those from Canada. Mr. Carney and his government will also be focusing on the G7 summit with the U.S, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan on June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Alta. It's expected to be a fraught meeting, with allies annoyed at Mr. Trump for his trade war and at odds with him over what appears to be a favourable attitude toward Russia in its war with Ukraine. Mr. Carney has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the G7 summit in a sign of solidarity as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year.

BEIJING, April 29. /TASS/. Mutual support between Russia and China remains unwavering despite the ongoing changes in the world, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Rio de Janeiro.

"In recent times, there have been many changes in the international environment. Change is the norm of our era, yet the mutual trust and support between China and Russia remain unchanged," he emphasized.

The diplomat pointed out that the strategic leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been the guarantee for maintaining Sino-Russian relations at a high level. Wang Yi also noted the importance of joint efforts by Beijing and Moscow to ensure that the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries is put into practice and "embodied in the results of cooperation in all areas.".</p>
