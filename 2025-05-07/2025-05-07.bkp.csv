Live Updates


• On brink of wider conflict: India launched strikes on both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Wednesday local time. Pakistan's prime minister described the attack as “an act of war” and Islamabad has pledged to retaliate, marking a major escalation between the two countries.
    


• Deadly attacks: A Pakistani military official told CNN that at least 26 civilians were killed in what India has dubbed “Operation Sindoor,” which New Delhi said targeted “terrorist infrastructure.”  Pakistan has claimed it shot down five Indian Air Force jets. According to a senior Indian defense source, shelling by the Pakistani military killed at least 12 people on the Indian side of the the de facto border that divides Kashmir.
    


• Tourist massacre: It comes after gunmen killed more than two dozen civilians, mostly tourists, in Indian-controlled Kashmir last month. India accused Pakistan of being involved, which it denied.
    


• Kashmir dispute: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full and have fought three wars over the territory.
    


            Pakistan's president and prime minister attended the funeral of the seven-year-old son of an army colonel who was killed in Indian strikes on Pakistan, the country's armed forces said in a statement Wednesday.
    


            President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif joined other senior government and army officials attending the funeral ceremony of the son of Lt. Col. Zaheer Abbas Turi, who was killed in Dawarandi, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
    


            Following funeral prayers in Islamabad, the Pakistani prime minister condemned India's “deliberate targeting of civilians” as a “reprehensible act of cowardice,” the statement from Pakistan's armed forces said.
    


            The Indian military said that it targeted “terrorist infrastructure” across nine sites in Pakistan's densely populated Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It claims that no military sites were targeted in its strikes and that there had been no reports of civilian casualties.
    


            “The President & the Prime Minister affirmed that the valiant Armed Forces of Pakistan are resolutely confronting Indian forces across all fronts, delivering a strong and uncompromising response,” the statement said.
    


            The leaders said the deadly attacks, which killed at least 26 people in Pakistan, will be met with “decisive action,” the statement added.
    


            A high-ranking French intelligence official told CNN today that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan, in what would mark the first time that one of the sophisticated French-made warplanes has been lost in combat.
    


            Pakistan claimed earlier today to have shot down five Indian Air Force jets in retaliation for Indian strikes, including three Rafales. Indian officials are yet to respond to the claim.
    


            The French official told CNN that French authorities were looking into whether more than one Rafale jets were shot down by Pakistan overnight.
    


            Pictures taken of parts of an aircraft that crashed in Indian-administered Kashmir show the label of a French manufacturer, but experts said it was not possible to say whether the part came from a Rafale aircraft.
    


            Dassault Aviation, the French manufacturer of the jet, has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.
    


Some background: The Rafale is a 10-ton, twin-engine multirole fighter, equipped with a 30mm cannon for air combat and ground support, along with air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs, and cruise missiles.
    


            Before this latest escalation, India had 36 Rafale jets in its Air Force, purchased from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation.
    


            The French military has not officially commented on the incident.
    


            Pakistan's defense minister has warned that India's latest assault marked an “invitation to expand the conflict” between the two neighbors — but cautioned that Islamabad is “trying to avoid” a full-fledged war.
    


            New Delhi's deadly barrage on Punjab and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Wednesday was a “clear-cut violation,” according to Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif.
    


                    “(India) crossed an international boundary,” Asif told CNN's Becky Anderson on Connect the World. “This is a clear-cut violation, and an invitation to expand the conflict and maybe convert it into something much more wider and much more dangerous for the region.”
                





            He insisted that Pakistan's military was braced “for an all-out war,” after India raised the “stakes” this week — following decades of tensions in one of the most militarized places in the world.
    


            “What happens next is we are prepared for an all-out war. There is absolutely no doubt, because India is increasing the intensity, the stakes of this conflict,” added Asif. “So… we can't be caught with our guards down.”
    


Claims of downed jets: Pakistan's armed forces fired missiles and struck down five Indian fighter jets “in a dogfight,” according to the country's defense chief, who described the military's actions as a “befitting lesson” for New Delhi.
    


            When pressed for evidence, Asif cited social media video.
    


            “(India has) already admitted that three planes were downed,” Asif told CNN. “These planes were downed in a dogfight. Missiles were fired by our planes, and they were shot down. Very simple.”
    


            Contrary to Asif's claims, India has not said that any of its planes have been shot down.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from Pakistan's defense minister.



            Israel's ambassador to India said in a social media post, following India's strikes on Pakistan, that his country “supports India's right for self defense.”
    


            “Terrorists should know there's no place to hide from their heinous crimes against the innocent,” Reuven Azar wrote, adding “#OperationSindoor,” the Indian military's codename for their strikes on Pakistani targets.
    


            Unlike most international statements as India and Pakistan teeter on the edge of a wider conflict, the ambassador's post does not include a call for restraint or de-escalation.
    


Some context: The two countries share deep military ties. India imports more weaponry from Israel than any other country, accounting for over a third of all Israeli arms exports, according to recent figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
    


            In India's capital, New Delhi, civilians who spoke with CNN had mixed feelings about the government's decision to carry out a series of overnight strikes on Pakistan.
    


            The Indian government said the strikes were carried out in response to an April terror attack in India-administered Kashmir that killed at least 25 Indian citizens.
    


            Charu Murgai, 38, a makeup artist in Delhi, said she felt “that war might make the things more terrible, for the economy, for the civilians, for the people who are going to fight for on behalf of us,” while another said she didn't support the decision by the government to strike Pakistan.
    


                    “I want everybody to make peace. The war has started, but I want it to end soon, because it's important for all of us,” said Muskan Maurya, a 21-year-old graduate student.
                





            But some supported the government's actions, with 45-year-old Monika Lakra, an educator, telling CNN she was “very happy” that the government had taken action, giving “kudos to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”
    


            Maurya said she doesn't “hate the normal people of Pakistan. I would love to meet them. I would love to hang out with them, but the government of Pakistan I really hate,” she told CNN.
    


            “It's a very big word to say hate, but I do hate the Government of Pakistan because they have known that these terrorists can have a very big impact on the normal likes of people in Kashmir, and they still allow them to stay there.”
    


            Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded his country's air force following a claim by military sources that it shot down five Indian fighter jets.
    


            Sharif praised the Pakistani military's readiness “to deal with the enemy's planes,” as he addressed the country's parliament in capital Islamabad for the first time since India's attack early on Wednesday local time.
    


            The prime minister also told lawmakers that India used dozens of warplanes in its attack. India's assault killed at least 26 people, including a 3-year-old girl, and wounded at least 46 other people. according to a Pakistani military official. 



            Sharif did not elaborate on how Pakistan might respond to India's attack, after he earlier described it as an “act of war.” His office said the country's military had been “authorized to undertake corresponding actions in this regard,” according to an earlier statement.
    


            “A few days ago, India was proudly showing off its purchase of Rafale jets. But one shouldn't be too proud,” Sharif told lawmakers. “These jets flew from there in combat form, but our air force was also prepared.”
    


                    “We are a nuclear power and a conventional warfare power. There is no higher respect and honor than this,” he added.
                





            Lawmakers filled the country's parliament building with calls of “Pakistan Zindabad,” which translates to “Long Live Pakistan.”
    


            Earlier on Wednesday, Pakistani military sources said they brought down five Indian fighter jets and one drone in an act of “self-defense” — including three Rafale aircraft, which are highly sophisticated multi-role jets manufactured in France. CNN cannot independently verify the claim and has reached out to the Indian government for a response.
    


            The number of casualties from overnight shelling by the Pakistani military on the Indian side of the Line of Control in Kashmir has risen, with 12 civilians killed and 57 injured, a senior Indian defense source told CNN.
    


            India and Pakistan have had near daily exchanges of fire across the Line of Control since the April 22 tourist massacre that sent relations between the two sides plummeting.
    


            Pakistan's military previously confirmed it shelled Indian positions in Indian-administered Kashmir overnight in response to India's airstrikes on its territory. India accused the Pakistanis of unprovoked firing over the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir.
    


            Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani spoke to top officials from both India and Pakistan today, holding a phone call with the Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and a separate call with Pakistan's Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, the Qatari foreign ministry said in two statements.
    


                    According to the statements, which were nearly identical, Al-Thani “expressed Qatar's deep concern” over the situation and affirmed the country's “full support for all regional and international efforts aimed at resolving outstanding issues between the two countries through dialogue and peaceful means.”
                





For context: Doha has successfully acted as a mediator recently. Qatar was one of the actors mediating talks between Israel and Hamas that led to a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, played a role in discussions that led to the return of deported Ukrainian children from Russia, and facilitated the freeing of an American citizen who spent more than two years in detention in Afghanistan.
    


            India's military operation inside Pakistan comes despite major global players urging restraint in the days leading up to the strikes.
    


Here's how major global players have responded:



            Authorities across India are conducting civil defense security drills on Wednesday, hours after the country launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan.
    


            The drills had been planned before the strikes. In an order from the home ministry not seen in decades, the Indian government had ordered them to be carried out in all states and union territories.
    


            According to official statements posted on X, 244 locations will be included in the drills that will include the sounding of emergency sirens, evacuation procedures and blackouts.
    


            Several Gulf carriers have suspended flights to Pakistan, including Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways, with airport closures in northern India also affecting many flight routes.
    


Emirates has canceled flights from Dubai to Sialkot, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar on Wednesday. “Customers on cancelled flights must not proceed to the airport,” it said on its website.
    


            Flights to and from Karachi are not impacted and will be operating as per schedule, the airline said.
    


Etihad said it had canceled flights to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad on Wednesday.
    


            “Additionally, some other services may be rerouted to avoid the affected airspace, potentially resulting in extended flight times,” Etihad Airways said in a statement.
    


Qatar Airways said it had “temporarily suspended flights” to Pakistan, citing Pakistani airspace closure.
    


            “The airline is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to prioritise the safety of its passengers and crew,” it said.
    


            Meanwhile, Indian carriers including SpiceJet and IndiGo have issued travel advisories regarding cancelations to and from destinations in northern India.
    


                    “Due to the ongoing situation, airports in parts of northern India, including Dharamshala (DHM), Leh (IXL), Jammu (IXJ), Srinagar (SXR), and Amritsar (ATQ), are closed until further notice. Departures, arrivals, and consequential flights may be impacted. Passengers are advised to plan their journey accordingly and check flight status,” SpiceJet said Wednesday morning.
                





            Multiple major airlines said Wednesday they were re-routing or canceling planes to and from Europe due to the escalation between India and Pakistan, with more than two dozen international flights diverted to avoid Pakistan airspace, according to FlightRadar24 data.
    


Keep in mind: Many airlines had already begun to avoid flying over Pakistan prior to India's strikes early Wednesday morning.
    


            Access to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, has been restored in Pakistan as conflict breaks out with India.
    


            Internet watchdog Netblocks confirmed access to the social media site was restored on Wednesday in an email to CNN.
    


            It had been banned in the country since February 2024, around the time of the Pakistan elections, according to Amnesty International.
    


            As the conflict escalates between India and Pakistan, these pictures show the reality on the ground in Kashmir and both countries.
    


            Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has tasked his country's military to enact “self-defense” with “corresponding actions,” hours after India launched a barrage of deadly strikes early Wednesday, according to his office.
    


            Sharif called on Pakistan's Armed Forces to “avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives,” after an emergency National Security Commitee (NSC) meeting on Wednesday.
    


            India's military had struck sites in both Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, killing at least 26 people – including a 3-year-old girl – and wounding at least 46 other people.
    


                    “Pakistan reserves the right to respond, in self-defence, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty,” the readout from the NSC meeting said.
                





            “The Armed Forces of Pakistan have duly been authorized to undertake corresponding actions in this regard,” the statement added.
    


            “The nation stands galvanized and resolute in the face of any further aggression.”
    


            New Delhi said it launched the attack in response to a deadly massacre in Indian-controlled Kashmir on April 22. Militant gunmen killed more than two dozen people, mostly tourists, in the restive region of Jammu and Kashmir. Islamabad repeatedly denied involvement in the attack.
    


            Since then, both parties have leveled warring rhetoric, rupturing already fractious relations between the two neighbors and escalating fears of all-out fighting.
    


            A Pakistani militant chief targeted in India's overnight strikes said 10 of his relatives, including five children, had been killed by the attack.
    


            Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) – one of two militant factions that India's military said it targeted overnight – said his older sister, his brother-in-law, his nephew and niece were among those who died.
    


            “The coward Modi targeted innocent children, unmarried women and the elderly,” Azhar said in a statement on Wednesday. “The grief and shock are so much that they cannot be described.”
    


            The Indian military said it targeted “terrorist infrastructure” across nine sites in Pakistan's densely populated Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India claimed that no military sites were targeted in its strikes and that there had been no reports of civilian casualties.
    


            Pakistan, however, said Wednesday's strikes had harmed civilians and targeted mosques across six locations in its territory. Jaish-e-Mohammed, which translates to the Army of the Prophet Mohammed, is a Pakistan-based group that operates across Kashmir, and seeks to unite the Indian-controlled area of the disputed state with Pakistan.
    


            While the US and the UN Security Council listed JeM as a terrorist organization in 2001, an effort to include its leader, Masood Azhar, as an “internationally designated terrorist” was vetoed by China.
    


            Videos shared to social media show the moment of impact as Indian airstrikes land inside Pakistan.
    


            CNN's Kristie Lu Stout breaks down what we know:
    


            India launched early-morning strikes on both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Wednesday, and Islamabad claimed it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets in “self-defense,” a major escalation between the rivaling neighbors.
    


            The strikes came more than two weeks after a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor — which Islamabad denied.
    


Here's what we know: 



            Syed Asim Munir, a former spy chief who was appointed as Pakistan's army chief in 2022, will play a key role in determining how far conflict may escalate following India's strikes on Wednesday, analysts told CNN.
    


            Seen as a hardliner on India by critics, Munir is expected to face pressure at home after India's missile attack, which it said had struck “terrorist infrastructure,” and Islamabad said had killed at least eight people, including children.
    


            Munir's appointment came amid intense debate around the military's influence on public life.
    


            Pakistan's powerful military is often accused of meddling in the politics of a country that has experienced numerous coups and been ruled by generals for extended periods since it gained independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            “I think that for Pakistan not to retaliate somehow would undermine his (Munir's) credibility and his influence,” said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
    


                    “For domestic political reasons and for… bureaucratic and organizational politics within the Pakistani military, I think that he will probably play a key role in deciding how Pakistan responds.”
                





            CNN Military Analyst Cedric Leighton said Munir joined “a long line of military leaders who have basically called the shots in Pakistani politics for a very long time.”
    


            He said Munir has viewed Pakistan's conflict with India through the lens of religion and treated the tensions as a national issue.
    


            “He believes that he is defending the honor of his country,” Leighton said.
    


            Against the backdrop of him is the Indian government's nationalist sentiment which adds to the “recipe for potential conflict,” the retired colonel said.
    


                    “He is… running against a very strong Indian leadership that is seeing it from the opposite side, very much in the Hindu nationalist, Hindu nationalist point.”
                





            Indian shelling hit an intake structure on the Noseri Dam on the Neelum river in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, a Pakistani security source told CNN.
    


            The Noseri Dam was targeted by Indian shelling last night around 2 a.m. local time, damaging the intake gates, according to the source.
    


            CNN has contacted India's foreign and water ministries for comment.
    


            The Neelum is part of the sprawling Indus river system, a vital resource supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India.
    


            Following the massacre of 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir last month that India blamed on Pakistan, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, a treaty which governs the sharing of water from the Indus River system.
    


            The Indus originates in Tibet and flows through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan.
    


            Islamabad has called any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan an act of war.
    


            India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chaired a high-level meeting with senior ministers from his cabinet.
    


            In video released by his office, Modi can be seen sitting alongside senior government figures including Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, Minister of Defense Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.
    


            Modi has not spoken publicly since India launched strikes on neighboring Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday.
    


            A United Nations team has arrived at a site in Pakistan-administered Kashmir that Islamabad says was hit by India's strikes, a CNN stringer said.
    


            The CNN stringer at the site reported seeing two white UN vehicles in the city of Muzaffarabad, where Pakistan said a mosque was struck early Wednesday.
    


            India claimed that no military sites were targeted in its strikes and that there had been no reports of civilian casualties.
    


            Pakistan, however, said Wednesday's strikes had harmed civilians and targeted mosques across six locations in its territory.
    


            India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has postponed a trip to visit to Croatia, The Netherlands and Norway, a senior government official told CNN.
    


            No official reason has been given for the delay, but the announcement comes hours after New Delhi launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
    


            Modi has not publicly spoken about the military action on India's neighbor.
    


            Residents of Pakistan-administered Kashmir say they were forced to flee their homes and take shelter after India launched missile strikes on its neighbor.
    


                    “All of a sudden, the electricity went out. I thought a transformer [had] burst, but later came to know that Indian troops started shelling and firing at us,” Raja Shahid Bashir, a resident of Shawai in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, told CNN.
                





            “Shells landed close to our home and we came out and took our livestock and belongings and took shelter,” said Bashir.
    


            Another resident, Shakeel Butt, told CNN she had to flee when shells started falling on the village. “A shell landed at a house close to the mosque in which two people were injured. Shells also hit other houses in our area and we fled from our area to a safer place,” she said.
    


            India's military said it had struck nine “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. At least 26 civilians were killed due to Indian army action, a Pakistan military spokesperson said, according to the Reuters news agency. Pakistan said it retaliated by shooting down five Indian Air Force jets and a drone. India has not confirmed the fighter jet losses.
    


            Zeeshan Akram, a resident of Muridke in Pakistan's Punjab province, told Reuters that drones appeared in the early hours of Wednesday and struck a mosque in the city, destroying it.
    


                    “They hit the mosque directly—destroyed its courtyard, the minister's office in front of the mosque, and the roof. Everything was crushed. There was one person sitting on the roof, on duty, he was martyred,” Akram told Reuters.
                





            “Fear and terror spread in people. People had gone out into the fields, in the open, just like that,” Waqas Ahmed, another resident of Muridke, told Reuters.
    


            Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned the Indian chargé d'affaires in Islamabad – the head of India's diplomatic mission in the country – to formally protest India's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Wednesday.
    


            “It was conveyed that India's blatant act of aggression constitutes a clear violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. Such actions are in contravention of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms governing inter-state relations,” the ministry said.
    


                    “Pakistan firmly rejected India's baseless justifications for its hostile conduct.”
                





            It called the strikes “unprovoked,” saying they had killed several civilians including women and children, and warned that India's military action posed a “serious threat” to peace in the region.
    


            The leader of India's diplomatic mission in Pakistan used to be the high commissioner – but clashes in 2019 between the two countries prompted them to downgrade diplomatic ties with each other and remove the high commissioner, leaving the chargé d'affaires in place instead.
    


            Overnight shelling by the Pakistani military has killed at least eight people on the Indian side of the Line of Control in Kashmir, a senior Indian defense source told CNN.
    


            India and Pakistan have had near daily exchanges of fire across the Line of Control since the April 22 tourist massacre that sent relations between the two sides plummeting.
    


            Pakistan's military has previously confirmed it shelled Indian positions in Indian-administered Kashmir overnight in response to India's airstrikes on its territory. India accused the Pakistanis of unprovoked firing over the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides Kashmir.
    


This post has been updated with the latest on the shelling.



            India said its military strikes on Pakistan targeted Lashkar-e-Tayyiba “terrorist infrastructure” sites after Pakistan failed to act against the groups based in its territory behind a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.
    


            The operation – dubbed “Operation Sindoor” – lasted for 25 minutes from 1.05 a.m.-1.30 a.m. local time, Col. Sofiya Qureshi said in a press conference on Wednesday.
    


            None of the three Indian officials who spoke at the briefing responded to a claim from Pakistan that it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets during India's attack. CNN has been unable to verify the claim.
    


            The briefing started with a video montage of the aftermath of attacks on India through the years that New Delhi has blamed on its neighbor Pakistan – and which Pakistan has long denied.
    


            The officials also showed footage of what they said were strikes on the targets in Pakistan.
    


            The officials showed a map marking locations of what they said were several Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed training camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and inside Pakistan's Punjab province.
    


            Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri again blamed Pakistan for the April attack on civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir and accused Islamabad of supporting “terrorism” in the disputed region.
    


                    “Despite a fortnight having passed since the attacks, there has been no demonstrable step from Pakistan to take action against the terrorist infrastructure on its territory or on territory under its control.”
                





            The targets were selected based on “intelligence,” Misri said.
    


            Qureshi said no military installation was targeted in the operation and there had been no reports of civilian casualties in Pakistan.
    


            A Pakistan military spokesperson said at least 26 civilians were killed due to Indian army action, according to Reuters.
    


            At least 26 civilians were killed and 46 injured due to Indian army action, a Pakistan military spokesperson said, according to Reuters.
    


            Heavily nationalist rhetoric has colored the coverage from many Indian news channels since New Delhi's strikes against Pakistan.
    


            “How India crushed the enemy,” flashed a headline on one news channel. “India strikes Pakistan hard,” read another.
    


            One news organization carried an image depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding a Captain America-esque shield with the colors of the Indian national flag.
    


            On some channels, animations of military jets and explosions could be seen across screens as anchors covered “Operation Sindoor,” the official name of India's military attack on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
    


            Such jingoism is not uncommon for India's often loud and boisterous media, which has been accused of toeing the government line.
    


            Modi aims to govern a proud, nationalistic nation that believes in its ability to handle difficult situations. Following the tourist massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir, many media outlets immediately called for blood.
    


            Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have ordered the evacuation of citizens from areas they deemed dangerous, as the conflict between New Delhi and Islamabad escalates.
    


            The Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Manoj Sinha, has directed districts to move villagers from “vulnerable areas to safer locations.”
    


            Accommodation, food and medicines will be provided for evacuated citizens, the Lieutenant Governor's office said on X.
    


            The orders come hours after India launched a series of strikes on what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, pushing the rival neighbors to the brink of full-scale war.
    


            Pakistan said the attack killed at least eight people, including children. The Indian Army said three civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir were killed in cross-border shelling by Pakistani troops.
    


            A key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is “proud of our armed forces” following the country's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
    


            “#OperationSindoor is Bharat's response to the brutal killing of our innocent brothers in Pahalgam,” Home Minister Amit Shah wrote on X, using the Hindi name for India. Shah has been beside Modi's side for decades and is often referred to as the second most powerful person in India.
    


            Wednesday's strikes come more than two weeks after militants killed 26 civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir. New Delhi pinned the massacre on Pakistan, though Islamabad denied involvement.
    


                    “The Modi government is resolved to give a befitting response to any attack on India and its people. Bharat remains firmly committed to eradicating terrorism from its roots,” Shah added in his X post.
                





            China has expressed regret over India's military action against Pakistan and said it's concerned about the current developments.
    


                    “India and Pakistan are neighbors that cannot be moved, and both are also China's neighbors,” a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said.
                





            As the conflict between Pakistan and India escalates, China has found itself in a diplomatic tight spot.
    


            For weeks, Beijing has been closely watching the tit-for-tat responses between its longtime “ironclad friend,” Islamabad, and New Delhi, a regional rival with which it has a long-running border dispute.
    


            The flare-up comes as China has been trying to improve relations with India as part of a broader diplomatic push to shore up ties with neighbors and trade partners alike to counter pressure from the Trump administration.
    


            Pakistan, meanwhile, is one of China's closest partners and a key supporter of its Belt and Road Initiative. China is Pakistan's main arms supplier, with Chinese arms making up 81 per cent of Pakistan's weapons imports in the past five years, according to data from Swedish think tank the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
    


            On April 27 in a phone call with his counterpart, China's foreign minister Wang Yi expressed support for Pakistan and said China is closely following developments between the countries.
    


                    “As Pakistan's ironclad friend and all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistan's legitimate security concerns and supports Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty and security interests,” Wang said.
                





            India launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called “terrorist infrastructure” on Wednesday. The attack comes more than two weeks after militants massacred tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi blamed on its neighbor — and Islamabad denied.
    


            Pakistan said eight people were killed by India's attack in what the country's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described as “an act of war.” Pakistan also said it shot down five Indian Air Force jets and a drone.
    


            Pictures taken of parts of an aircraft that crashed in Indian-administered Kashmir show the label of a French manufacturer.
    


            The label shows an aircraft part from French filtration company Le Bozec et Gautier. Le Bozec is a French-based subsidiary of Minnesota's Donaldson Company.
    


            A press release from Donaldson in 2005, when it acquired Le Bozec, says the French company “designs, manufactures and sells filtration equipment for the management of air, fuel, hydraulic fluid and air pressure on aircraft and helicopters.”
    


            Pakistan claims to have shot down three of India's top-of-the-line French-made Rafale fighter jets, but experts said it was not possible to say whether the part came from that aircraft, nor Pakistan's claims of shooting down the aircraft.
    


            Peter Layton, a senior fellow at Griffith Asia Institute and former Australian air force officer, said the part looked like it could be from a fuel tank, possibly an external drop tank.
    


            The Pakistan Air force also has French-made Mirage III and V jets, Layton added.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            Residents of Indian-administered Kashmir woke to the sounds of explosions and shelling after India launched cross-border strikes against its neighbor, with some hiding in fear and others cheering the strikes as long-overdue revenge.
    


                    “We have been tense and anxious and glued to the television channels,” a 30-year-old civilian who lives near the city of Kupwara told CNN. “This is the first time I've heard shelling this intense over my village.”
                





            “I woke up around 2:30 a.m. and heard sounds of explosions and firing across the border. This went on until 5:30 a.m.,” said the resident, who requested not to be named.
    


            India's strikes – on what it called “terrorist infrastructure” – come more than two weeks after militants killed 26 civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir. New Delhi pinned the massacre on Pakistan, though Islamabad denied those claims.
    


            Pakistan said it shot down five Indian Air Force jets in response. India has not confirmed the fighter jet losses and CNN is unable to verify the claim.
    


            “We spent a sleepless night because of the heavy shelling,” said one resident living in the village of Uroosa, close to the Line of Control that divides Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir.
    


            “There were cries of children, women and it was a desperate situation,” said the resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
    


            A 21-year-old student living in the village of Uroosa told CNN that “shelling was happening all night. Everyone is scared, there is damage in the area too. People are scared and are planning to leave.”
    


                    “We are fifteen members in the family holed up in two rooms,” the student said. “We are sitting in the back rooms of the home so we can escape shelling.”
                





            Elsewhere in India-administered Kashmir, residents cheered news of India's attack, according to video footage by ANI.
    


                    “This is a very good move and we were waiting for India to give a befitting reply to Pakistan and India has given a commendable reply to them and we are happy that this happened,” Rishi, a resident of Poonch, told ANI.
                





            Another resident told the outlet that “there was much anger among the people” following last month's massacre. “Hence, this was indeed needed.”
    


            An unidentified aircraft has crashed in Indian-administered Kashmir, according to an eyewitness and a local government official.
    


            The aircraft came down in the village of Wuyan, which lies 19 kilometers to the southeast of Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


                    “We heard the sound of a flying plane and then there was a big explosion. We rushed out of our homes in panic and saw it was on fire. Luckily no one was injured,” local resident Abdul Rashid told CNN.
                





            A duty officer at the fire service headquarters in Srinagar told CNN that a fighter aircraft had crashed on a school building in Wuyan.
    


            “Our personnel are still at the site and details are awaited,” the officer, who requested anonymity, said.
    


            Photos published by AFP news agency showed aircraft wreckage lying in a field next to a red brick building in Wuyan, which CNN has also geolocated.
    


            It was not immediately clear from the pictures of the wreckage who the aircraft belonged to.
    


            Locals in Srinagar heard a loud explosion earlier on Wednesday around the time when India said it was conducting airstrikes against Pakistan.
    


            The name India chose for its military operation against Pakistan appears laden with religious symbolism.
    


            “Operation Sindoor” is a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage.
    


April's massacre on civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir left several women widowed.
    


            In the days following the attack, an image of a woman lying next to the lifeless body of her husband went viral, becoming a symbol of the pain and heartbreak endured by victims of the assault.
    


            India's defense and foreign ministers have both posted an image on X of the name of the operation, which depicts the red powder.
    


            “The world must show zero tolerance for terrorism,” India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar wrote on X.
    


            “Victory to India,” Defense Minister Rajnath Singh wrote in Hindi.
    


            Following India's strikes on what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said “the world must show zero tolerance for terrorism” in a post on X.
    


            The strikes Wednesday came more than two weeks after a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor.
    


            It's now morning in India and Pakistan and the region is on edge after New Delhi launched a military attack on its neighbor in the early hours of Wednesday. Pakistan claimed it shot down five Indian Air Force jets in response, in a major escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals.
    


Here's what we know:



Correction: This post has been updated with the correct death toll from the tourist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir



            Commercial airlines are keeping almost entirely clear of Pakistani airspace, Flightradar24.com shows, after India launched strikes inside Pakistan in a major escalation between the two neighbors.
    


            Pakistani security sources claim three of the five Indian planes it downed were Rafale fighter jets — prized assets of the Indian Air Force that were only acquired several years ago as New Delhi looked to beef up its military.
    


            CNN has not independently confirmed Pakistan's claims and has reached out to the Indian government and military for response.
    


            Before this latest escalation, India had 36 Rafale jets in its Air Force, purchased from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation.
    


            The fighter jets were first ordered in 2016 and began arriving in 2020. At the time, India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, claimed the new jets were “among the best in the world,” and would make the Indian Air Force “much stronger to deter any threat that may be posed on our country.”
    


            In late April, India signed a $7.4 billion deal to buy 26 more Rafale jets from France, with delivery expected from 2030.
    


What to know about these jets: The jets come in one-seat or two-seat versions and can be armed with air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as a 30mm cannon, according to the manufacturer. Dassault Aviation also touts the Rafale's Flight Control System, which includes the ability for it to fly on autopilot in a terrain-following mode in all weather conditions.
    


            The Rafale is not a stealth jet, but it is promoted as having a low profile that is not easy to detect on radar. It also has one distinct advantage — combat experience.
    


            Flown by French forces, the Rafale has been used in operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria, according to Dassault Aviation's website.
    


            India and Pakistan, two neighbors with a long history of conflict, are in dangerous territory, analysts warn, with Islamabad vowing to retaliate against New Delhi's strikes and the risk of tit-for-tat responses spiraling into an all out war.
    


            Wednesday's operation inside Pakistan is the deepest India has struck inside its neighbor since the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971, the biggest war between the two countries.
    


                    The situation is now “obviously serious and fluid,” according to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University. “Retaliation to India's actions will likely now be inevitable.”
                





            India's decision to strike comes more than two weeks after 26 people, mostly Indian civilians, were massacred in an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the assault, a claim Pakistan denies.
    


            Pakistan said eight people were killed during India's Wednesday strikes, including children, in what the country's prime minister described as “an act of war.” Islamabad also claimed it shot down five Indian Air Force planes and a drone during the attack.
    


            New Delhi has not publicly confirmed Pakistan's claim and CNN cannot independently it.
    


            While India's decision to strike Pakistan isn't unsurprising – analysts had been saying it was a matter of when, and not if – analysts fear we could see further escalations between the two nuclear-armed nations in the coming hours and days.
    


                    “If the war escalates, even if not to the nuclear threshold, it is very likely to hold grave consequences for Indians and Pakistanis alike, as well as the broader region and the world,” said Derek J. Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank.
                





            India's strikes against Pakistan come more than two weeks of mounting pressure on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to forcefully retaliate against its neighbor after a tourist massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


            Last month militants stormed the mountainous and picturesque district of Pahalgam and killed 25 Indian tourists in the worst assault on Indian civilians in recent years. The massacre immediately cratered already hostile relations between New Delhi and Islamabad, with New Delhi swift to blame its neighbor.
    


            Modi – a strongman Hindu-nationalist leader who has positioned himself as the protector of the nation and last year won a rare third term in power – immediately vowed to pursue the attackers “to the ends of the earth.”
    


            He governs a proud, nationalistic nation that believes in its ability to handle difficult situations.
    


            Following the massacre, India's loud and often jingoistic media immediately called for blood.
    


            “We want revenge” read a headline on one channel. “Bharat is battle ready,” read another, referring to India by its Sanskrit title.
    


            Analysts say it was only a matter of time before Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) responded with force.
    


            “Modi and his government believe it is imperative to respond to Pahalgam,” said Derek J. Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank.
    


            “Indians are very likely to support New Delhi's response – regardless of what it is, perhaps except for a nuclear response – because they believe Pakistan must be deterred in the future.”
    


            The chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab province has asked hospitals in the region to remain on alert and ordered schools to remain closed on Wednesday.
    


            According to Pakistan's military, six of the eight people killed in the strikes died in attacks on Ahmadpur East and Muridke in the Punjab province. CNN cannot independently verify the claim.
    


            Maryam Nawaz Sharif, Punjab's chief minister, announced she had issued emergency response orders for Punjab, in a post on X Tuesday.
    


            The chief minister called on rescue teams, district administration and hospitals to remain on alert. She also said educational institutions in the province will remain closed on Wednesday.
    


            Sharif said Pakistan wanted peace but would become “a legion” if war was imposed.
    


            “India started it, we'll finish it,” she wrote on X, adding that the whole nation stands with the Pakistani military.
    


            Three civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir were killed in shelling by Pakistani troops from across the border, according to the Indian Army.
    


            The Pakistan Army “resorted to arbitrary firing and artillery shelling” from posts across the Line of Control that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir, the Indian Army said in a statement.
    


            “Indian Army are responding in proportionate manner,” the statement said.
    


            Schools, colleges and educational institutions will be closed today across Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Rajouri and Poonch “in view of the prevailing situation,” according to Divisional Commissioner Jammu.
    


            These are areas in the Indian territory.
    


            Five Indian Air Force jets and one drone were shot down by Pakistan during India's attack, according to Pakistani security sources.
    


            In a statement released to reporters, the security sources said three French-made Rafale jets, one MiG-29 and one SU-30 fighter jets were downed “in self-defense.” An Indian Heron drone was also shot down, they added.
    


            A second senior Pakistani government official confirmed the same list of downed aircraft.
    


            The briefing did not say precisely where the jets were downed or how.
    


            Pakistani officials had earlier briefed that they shot down three aircraft and a drone.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify the claims and has reached out to the Indian government for a response.
    


            The United Arab Emirates is asking for India and Pakistan “to exercise restraint, de-escalate tensions, and avoid further escalation that could threaten regional and international peace,” according to a statement from UAE Deputy Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
    


                    “His Highness reaffirmed that diplomacy and dialogue remain the most effective means of peacefully resolving crises, and achieving the shared aspirations of nations for peace, stability, and prosperity,” the statement read.
                





            Eight people were killed, including children, and 35 injured, Pakistan's military spokesperson said after India launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan early Wednesday.
    


            India targeted six locations with 24 strikes in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said in a news conference early Wednesday.
    


            Previously, Pakistan said five locations were struck. India has said nine sites in total were targeted.
    


            Five people were killed, including a 3-year-old girl, in Ahmadpur East, in Pakistan's Punjab Province, Chaudhry said. One man was also killed in Punjab's Muridke, a city near Lahore, the capital of the province.
    


            In Pakistan administered-Kashmir, a 16-year-old girl and 18-year-old man were killed in the city of Kotli, he added.
    


            Mosques were targeted in the strikes, according to the military spokesperson.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify the claim.
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified the capital of Pakistan, which is Islamabad.



            India defended its military operation in Pakistan on Wednesday, claiming that its actions were “focused and precise.”
    


                    “They were measured, responsible and designed to be non-escalatory in nature,” the Embassy of India said in a statement. “No Pakistani civilian, economic or military targets have been hit. Only known terror camps were targeted.”
                





            According to Pakistani sources, at least eight people were killed in Wednesday's operations, “including women and children.” Pakistani sources also said three Indian Air Force planes and a drone were shot down in locations “within Indian territory.” CNN cannot independently confirm the claims and has reached out to the Indian Ministry of Defence.
    


            The embassy statement said it was clear that “Pakistani-based terrorists” were responsible for last month's attack in Kashmir. But that instead of taking action, Pakistan “indulged in denial and made allegations of false flag operations against India.”
    


Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947. The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India — Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India — both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.
    


Here's a quick recap:



1947: India and Pakistan gain independence from Great Britain. The ruler of Kashmir initially decides to remain independent, choosing not to become a part of either Pakistan or India. After militants from Pakistan invade, he signs a letter acceding to India. Pakistan does not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control.
    


1965: India and Pakistan go to war again over Kashmir. The clash did not resolve the dispute over the territory.
    


1971: This was the biggest war fought between the two countries, which led to a humiliating loss for Pakistan and the creation of the state of Bangladesh from the region formerly known as East Pakistan.
    


1999: India and Pakistan fight a limited border conflict in Kashmir, after armed invaders from Pakistan cross the Line of Control in the town of Kargil.
    


            United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the April attack in Kashmir, and urged India and Pakistan to “avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control.”
    


            “Make no mistake: A military solution is no solution,” Guterres wrote in a post on X, noting that tensions between the two neighbors are “at their highest in years.”
    


            At least three Indian Air Force planes have been shot down, Pakistani security and government sources have told CNN, in the latest in the latest escalation between the two countries.
    


            It comes shortly after India said it launched a military operation in Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure.” India has not confirmed the loss of any jets, CNN has reached out to the India authorities for comment.
    


            At least eight people were killed in India's strikes, Pakistan said.
    


            Meantime, a blast was also heard in the city of Srinagar, the largest city in Indian-administrated Kashmir, according to eyewitnesses.
    


Here's what we know so far:



CNN's Elise Hammond, Aditi Sangal, Sophia Saifi, Rhea Mogul, Max Saltman, Avery Schmitz and Thomas Bordeaux and reporter Vedika Sud contributed reporting to this post.



            A third Indian aircraft has been shot down by Pakistan, Pakistani security and government sources have told CNN.
    


            A senior Pakistani intelligence source said three Indian jets were shot down in locations “within Indian territory,” as well as a drone.
    


            A separate senior Pakistan government source confirmed that three aircraft and a drone were shot down.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify the claims and is reaching out to the Indian government and military for a response.
    


            India's strikes against Pakistan are the deepest New Delhi has ventured into Pakistan's undisputed borders since the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.
    


            Pakistan on Wednesday said five locations were struck by India, three of them in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and two in Pakistan's Punjab province.
    


            The locations in Punjab are Ahmadpur East and Muridke. 



            The 1971 Indo-Pakistani War was a major military conflict between India and Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh.
    


            The last time India struck inside Pakistan's undisputed borders was in 2019, when Indian jets conducted airstrikes on several targets after it blamed Islamabad for a suicide car bomb attack that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in the region.
    


            A blast was heard in the city of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir early Wednesday, eyewitnesses told CNN.
    


            The cause of the blast is not yet known. Srinagar is the largest city in Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


            Reports of the blast come after India launched a military operation against Pakistan, in a major escalation between the two neighbors following a massacre on tourists inside Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


India and Pakistan each control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full and have fought three wars over the territory. Kashmir is one of the most militarized places in the world.
    


            Wednesday's strikes by India are the most significant military actions since 2019, when Indian jets conducted airstrikes on several targets inside Pakistan.
    


            India's Minister of Defense has publicly responded to the military operation launched against Pakistan.
    


            “Victory to India!” Rajnath Singh wrote on X in Hindi, in a short statement.
    


            Senior India officials have spoken to their counterparts in a number of countries to brief them on the steps taken by New Delhi, a senior Indian government official told CNN.
    


            Among the countries briefed were the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Russia.
    


            Pakistan's military claims it has shot down two Indian Air Force aircraft.
    


                    “There are two confirmed aircraft of the Indian Air Force have already been shot down,” Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, spokesperson for the Pakistani military, told CNN's Jim Sciutto. “There are other reports of multiple damages that the Pakistani forces, both on ground and air, have inflicted. But I can confirm you at least two aircraft of Indian Air Force that have been downed,” he added.
                





            CNN cannot independently confirm Chaudhry's claims that Indian planes were shot down. We are reaching out to the Indian Ministry of Defence for comment.
    


            The locations of the engagement are “around Bhatinda” and Akhnoor, Chaudhry added, noting that there is an engagement “already ongoing between the two air forces.”
    


            Bhatinda is a small town in the Indian state of Punjab that borders Pakistan and Akhnoor is located in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
    


            Pakistan issued a notice Tuesday night closing airspace around Lahore, in the country's north, and the coastal city of Karachi amid airstrikes from India. The notice went into effect at 4:30 p.m. ET and is scheduled to expire on at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
    


            The notice to airmen, also known as a NOTAM, appears to have diverted numerous flights with routes planned through or near Pakistani airspace, according to flight data reviewed by CNN from FlightRadar24.
    


                    Citing the “changing airspace conditions in the region,” major Indian airline IndiGo reported impacted flights in and out of Jammu, Srinagar, Amritsar, Leh, Chandigarh, Dharamshala and Bikaner. SpiceJet, another airline, said some airports in northern India are closed “until further notice.”
                





            As tensions between India and Pakistan increased in recent weeks after an April mass shooting in the disputed Kashmir territory, numerous airlines have avoided flying over Pakistan, including Air France and Lufthansa.
    


            India said early Wednesday it had launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir.
    


            Relations between India and Pakistan have cratered in recent weeks following a deadly rampage by gunmen who murdered 26 people, the majority Indian tourists, at a scenic spot in Kashmir. Read more about the attack.



Here's what you need to know:



Targets: India said nine sites in total were targeted. Pakistan said five locations were struck, three of them in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and two in Pakistan's Punjab province.
    


Casualties: At least three people were killed, Pakistan said.
    


What India has said since: “Justice is Served,” the Indian Army wrote on X in a short statement, its first since the operation's launch. “Jai Hind!” (Victory to India)
    


Pakistan's response: Pakistan's military claims it has shot down two Indian Air Force aircraft. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said the country “has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war imposed by India and a befitting reply is being given.” A military spokesperson said the country “will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing.”
    


Flashpoint: Kashmir is one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints and is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety. The two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars over the mountainous territory that is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control (LOC) since their independence from Britain nearly 80 years ago.
    


            Pakistan has called India's strikes an “unprovoked and blatant act of war” in a statement early Wednesday.
    


                    “The Indian Air Force, while remaining within Indian airspace, has violated Pakistan's sovereignty using standoff weapons, targeting civilian population across international border in Muridke and Bahawalpur, and across Line of Control in Kotli and Muzaffarabad,” a statement from Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
                





            “India's act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.” 
    


            India early Wednesday said it launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in a major escalation between the two neighbors.
    


            The attacks come more than two weeks after a massacre on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor — a claim Islamabad denies.
    


            Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said the country “has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war imposed by India and a befitting reply is being given.”
    


                    “The Pakistani nation and the Pakistani Armed Forces know how to deal with the enemy very well,” the prime minister's office said in a statement. “The enemy will never be allowed to succeed in his nefarious objectives.”
                





            The prime minister called a meeting with the National Security Committee following the military operation, according to the Federal Minister of Information.
    


            Pakistani military sources told CNN that India's strikes hit five locations inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
    


             The locations are Kotli, Ahmadpur East, Muzaffarabad, Bagh, and Muridke.
    


            Of these, Ahmadpur East and Muridke are particularly significant as they are in Pakistan's Punjab province – inside the country's undisputed borders.
    


            Wednesday's attacks are the first time since 2019 that India has conducted strikes inside Pakistan's territory, when Indian jets targeted multiple locations after it blamed Islamabad for a suicide car bomb attack that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in the region.
    


            That retaliation itself was particularly fraught because it was the first time India had struck inside Pakistan's undisputed borders since the two sides fought a war in 1971.
    


            India has now taken ﻿that significant step again.
    


Kotli, Muzaffarabad and Bagh are in Pakistan-administered Kashmir – a mountainous, contested region controlled by Islamabad but also claimed by India.  It is an area that has seen frequent periods of military contact and skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani troops.
    


            United States President Donald Trump called India's confirmed military operation against Pakistan “a shame” and that he just learned of the news ahead of his Oval Office event Tuesday evening.
    


                    “It's a shame. We just heard about it, just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval, just heard about it. I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past, they've been fighting for a long time, you know, they've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries,” the president said after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.
                





            “I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said.
    


            India said early Wednesday it had launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, in a major escalation between the two countries.
    


The US State Department also said it is “closely monitoring developments,” according to a spokesperson Tuesday.
    


                    “We are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,” the spokesperson said. “This remains an evolving situation, and we are closely monitoring developments.”
                





            Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with top officials from both countries last week as tensions rapidly escalated after a massacre in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Rubio encouraged India and Pakistan to work with each other to “de-escalate tensions,” according to State Department readouts of the two calls on April 30.
    


            Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told Geo News that “civilians were killed, including women and children” in India's military operation.
    


                    “India is claiming it attacked terrorist camps; this is not true, international media can visit the places civilians were targeted,” Asif said in a statement.
                





            The Indian Army on Wednesday released its first public comments since India launched a military operation inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
    


            “Justice is Served,” the Indian Army wrote on X in a short statement. “Jai Hind!” (Victory to India)
    


            Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.
    


            The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.
    


            For decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, leaving tens of thousands killed in the violence.
    


            But attacks on tourists in the picturesque Himalayan region are rare.
    


            Tensions between India Pakistan over Kashmir have surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked its constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi.
    


            India said early Wednesday it had launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, in a major escalation of tensions between the two neighbors and in response to an attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir on April 22.
    


Here's what you need to know about the attack:



What happened: Gunmen opened fire on tourists in a popular travel destination in the mountainous destination of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national were killed in the massacre, which unfolded in a valley only accessible by foot or on horseback. Eyewitnesses described scenes of horror as the gunmen approached, opening fire on people from close range. Some recalled how the men among the group were singled out and shot at. Other survivors told local media the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting Prime Minister Modi.
    


Who claimed responsibility: Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media but it has reportedly since walked back that claim, according to multiple local media reports. Pakistan has denied involvement. India has not publicly blamed any group for the attack but has justified its retaliatory moves as a response to Pakistan's alleged “support for cross-border terrorism.”
    


Some background: India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. Attacks by militants have in the past led to a sharp escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, both of whom have rival claims to the Himalayan region. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers.
    


            Three people, including a child, have been killed by Indian strikes in Pakistan, the country's military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Pakistani outlet Geo TV.
    


            Chaudhry also told Geo TV that mosques were targeted.
    


            “The attacks on mosques indicate [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and RSS's Hindutva mentality,” Chaudhry said referring to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates Hindu supremacy within India.
    


            Kashmir, one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints, is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety.
    


            The two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars over the mountainous territory that is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control (LOC) since their independence from Britain nearly 80 years ago.
    


            Tensions ratcheted up again after gunmen massacred 26 civilians in Pahalgam in Indian-controlled Kashmir on last month, the deadliest assault on Indians in recent years.
    


            India has accused Pakistan of being involved in the Pahalgam attack — a claim Islamabad denies. Pakistan has offered a neutral investigation into the incident.
    


            The massacre sparked immediate widespread anger in India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been under tremendous pressure to retaliate with force.
    


            In the days after the Pahalgam attack, both countries swiftly downgraded ties with each other and have been since been engaging in escalating tit-for-tat hostilities.
    


            India ordered its citizens to return from Pakistan, shut a major border crossing and suspended its involvement in a crucial water sharing treaty that has been in force since 1960.
    


            Pakistan suspended trade with India and expelled Indian diplomats. It said that that any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan would be considered an “act of war.”
    


            Both countries have also shut their airspace to each other.
    


            New Delhi and Islamabad had also been flexing their military might as tensions simmered along the LOC with small exchanges of fire across the demarcation in recent days. Both sides have also closed their air spaces to each other's airlines.
    


            Pakistan's military said India struck early Wednesday with missiles.
    


                    “Pakistan will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing,” Pakistani military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Geo TV. “This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”
                





            Pakistani military sources told CNN five locations were struck at Kotli, Ahmadpur East, Muzaffarabad, Bagh, and Muridke.
    


            Three of those locations – Kotli, Muzaffarabad and Bagh – are in Pakistan-administred Kashmir. Ahmadpur East and Muridke are both in Pakistan's Punjab province.
    


            India said early Wednesday (local time) it had launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, in a major escalation of tensions between the two neighbors.
    


                    “These steps come in the wake of the barbaric Pahalgam terrorist attack in which 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen were murdered,” India's Ministry of Defence said in a statement, referring to an attack last month tourists in India-administered Kashmir.“Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” the statement added.
                





            India said nine sites in total were targeted.
    


            Multiple loud explosions have been heard in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, according to a CNN journalist.
    


            Pakistan's military said India had struck with missiles.
    


                    “Pakistan will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing,” Pakistani military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Geo TV. “This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”
                





            Prior to Wednesday's military operation, multiple major airlines were avoiding flying over Pakistan as relations with neighboring India crater.
    


Air France told CNN it has suspended flying over the South Asian country until further notice because of the “recent evolution of tensions between India and Pakistan.”
    


            The airline is “adapting its flight schedule and flight plans to and from certain destinations,” the French flag carrier said, adding some routes will require longer flight times.
    


                    “Air France is constantly monitoring developments in the geopolitical situation of the territories served and overflown by its aircraft in order to ensure the highest level of flight safety and security,” the airline said.
                





            Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa also confirmed to Reuters that it was “avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice.”
    


            Both sides had already closed their airspaces to each other's aircraft since the attack, but the increased tensions are now impacting other international airlines and will likely cost them as they burn extra fuel taking longer routes.
    


            Flight-tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates traveling over the Arabian Sea and then turning north toward Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, Reuters reported.
    


            By the numbers, India's military would be seen as superior to Pakistan's in any conventional conflict.
    


            The Indian defense budget is more than nine times Pakistan's, according to this year's edition of “The Military Balance,” an assessment of armed forces by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
    


            That budget supports an active-duty Indian force of almost 1.5 million personnel, compared to 660,000 for Pakistan.
    


On the ground, India's 1.2 million-strong army has 3,750 main battle tanks and more than 10,000 artillery pieces, while Pakistan's tank force is only two-thirds of India's and Islamabad has fewer than half of the artillery pieces in New Delhi's arsenal.
    


At sea, the Indian navy's advantage is overwhelming. It has two aircraft carriers, 12 guided-missile destroyers, 11 guided-missile frigates and 16 attack submarines.
    


            Pakistan has no carriers and no guided-missile destroyers, with 11 smaller guided-missile frigates being the backbone of its naval fleet. It also has only half the number of subs that India fields.
    


            Both air forces rely heavily on older Soviet-era aircraft, including MiG-21s in India and the Chinese equivalent – the J-7 – in Pakistan.
    


            India has been investing in multirole French-made Rafale jets, with 36 now in service, according to “The Military Balance.”
    


            Pakistan has added Chinese J-10 multirole jets, with more than 20 now in its fleet.
    


            Though Pakistan still has dozens of US-made F-16 fighters, the backbone of its fleet has become the JF-17, a joint project with China that came online in the early 2000s. About 150 are in service.
    


            Russian-made aircraft play a significant role in India's air fleet, with more than 100 MiG-29 fighters in service with the air force and navy combined, plus over 260 Su-30 ground attack jets.
    


            The rivals are closer in capabilities when it comes to nuclear forces, with around five dozen surface-to-surface launchers each, though Indian has longer-range ballistic missiles than Pakistan.

Follow:


            India launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan, both countries said on Wednesday and Pakistan claimed it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets, in an escalation that has pushed the two nations to the brink of wider conflict.
    


            India's missile strikes early Wednesday morning targeted “terrorist infrastructure” across nine sites in Pakistan's densely populated Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, it said. They came in response to a massacre by militants of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago, that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor.
    


            Pakistan said at least 26 people were killed in Wednesday's strikes – including women and a three-year-old girl – and 46 wounded. The country's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the strikes as “an act of war” and Islamabad has vowed to retaliate.
    


            From early Wednesday the two sides have exchanged shelling across their border, with locals on both sides telling CNN they were taking shelter. A CNN journalist in Pakistan-administered Kashmir heard multiple loud explosions.
    


            “A shell landed at a house close to the mosque in which two people were injured. Shells also hit other houses in our area and we fled from our area to a safer place,” said Shakeel Butt, a resident of Muzaffarabad, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. A senior Indian defense source said at least eight people had been killed on the Indian side of the border.
    


            Pakistani military sources later said they shot down five Indian Air Force jets and one drone in “self-defense,” claiming three Rafale jets – sophisticated multi-role fighters made in France – were among those downed as well as a MiG-29 and an SU-30 fighter.

            A local resident and government official told CNN that an unidentified fighter aircraft had crashed on a school building in Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


            Photos published by AFP news agency showed aircraft wreckage lying in a field next to a red-brick building. But it was not immediately clear from the pictures of the wreckage who the aircraft belonged to.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify the claim and has reached out to the Indian government for a response. At a later press conference where Indian officials said their strikes had targeted training camps belonging to militant groups Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), officials did not address the claims and took no questions from the media.
    


            Indian jets have previously bombed Pakistani territory following militant attacks on its soil but Wednesday's operation is the deepest India has struck inside its neighbor since the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971, the biggest of several wars between the two countries.
    


            The situation is now “obviously serious and fluid,” said Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University. “Retaliation to India's actions will likely now be inevitable.”
    


            India dubbed its military action “Operation Sindoor” – a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage. It is a symbolic nod to April's massacre on civilians that left several women widowed.
    


World leaders and the United Nations have expressed concern over the strikes and have urged restraint from both countries. The US Department of State said it was “closely monitoring” the flare-up.
    


            Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India have inched closer to open conflict since gunmen massacred 26 people in a popular holiday spot in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, with India's Hindu-nationalist government under intense pressure from its base to respond to the attack.
    


            Pakistan was swift to deny any link to the attack but in the days following, both countries swiftly downgraded ties with each other and have since been engaging in escalating tit-for-tat hostilities.
    


            Analysts said it was a question of when, not if, India retaliated.
    


            India said its strikes were “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature.”
    


            “No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” its defense ministry said in a statement.
    


            The strikes have put the region on alert, with commercial airlines keeping almost entirely clear of Pakistani airspace, flight-tracking website Flightradar24 showed. The airport in Srinagar, ﻿Indian-administered Kashmir's biggest city, has been closed to civilian traffic, and several airlines have suspended or diverted flights to Pakistan and northwest India.
    


            Video obtained by CNN on Wednesday showed chaotic scenes at a hospital in Pakistan's Punjab province, as the wounded were rushed for treatment.
    


            Muslim-majority Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both countries gained their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            The two nations that emerged from the bloody partition of British India both claim Kashmir in full and, months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.

            The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.
    


            For decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, with tens of thousands killed.
    


            India has long accused Pakistan of harboring these militant groups – a charge Islamabad denies – and had vowed to retaliate against those they deemed responsible.
    


            Tensions over Kashmir have also surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Modi's government revoked the region's constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi.
    


            Observers say a response from Pakistan to the strikes will be likely, and concern now turns to how to manage what comes next.
    


            “Pakistan‘s response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,” said Ajay Bisaria, former high commissioner of India to Pakistan.

India launched strikes on both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Wednesday local time.  It comes after gunmen killed more than two dozen civilians, mostly tourists, in Indian-controlled Kashmir last month. India accused Pakistan of being involved, which it denied. Pakistan's defense minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told CNN that India's latest assault marked an “invitation to expand the conflict” between the two neighbors — but cautioned that Islamabad is “trying to avoid” a full-fledged war.

India launched ‘Operation Sindoor' on the night of May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan in retaliation for a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgram, Kashmir last month. New Delhi stated that it hit at least nine targets.

“Our actions have been focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in the selection of targets and method of execution,” the Indian government said in a statement.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif descried the strikes as a “cowardly” attack and said Islamabad ""has every right to respond forcefully to this act of war imposed by India, and a forceful response is being given.""

Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated to military actions following the killing of 26 innocent vacationers in Pahalgam, Kashmir by Pakistan-backed terrorists in a Hamas-style terror attack.

Pakistan Army and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) links were established by India's National Investigation Agency days after the mass killing. The public was angry, and sought appropriate revenge. 

A wide range of diplomatic and economic measures were announced by both nations following the attack.  Remarkably, India has put the 1960 Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in abeyance for the first time since the pact was inked by the two neighbors. Rejecting India's move to suspend the IWT, Pakistan warned that any diversion of water will be treated as an ‘Act of War.' Islamabad also said that it would hold “in abeyance” its participation in all bilateral agreements with India, including the landmark 1972 Simla Agreement.

Pakistan pledged a full-spectrum national power response to any threat against its sovereignty, put its armed forces on high alert, and began selective mobilisation. Most measures were quite expected. But by suspending the Shimla Agreement, Pakistan unwittingly handed over  big advantage to India. 

The Shimla agreement between India and Pakistan was signed on July 2, 1972 at Barnes Court (Raj Bhavan) in the town of Shimla in the Indian state of  Himachal Pradesh, between then-Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her Pakistani counterpart Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. It was ratified on July 15, 1972 (by Pakistan), and August 3, 1972 (by India), and became effective the next day.

The agreement had come in the wake of Pakistan's comprehensive defeat in the 1971 war that split the country and created independent Bangladesh. 

The agreement stated:“The Government of India and the Government of Pakistan are resolved that the two countries put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations and work for the promotion of a friendly arid harmonious relationship and the establishment of durable peace in the sub-continent, so that both countries may henceforth devote their resources and energies to the pressing task of advancing the welfare of their peoples.” 

The document was meant to lay the foundation of a peaceful and stable relationship between the two nations. It was decided that the two countries are resolved “to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed upon between them.”

The treaty mandated that the two countries resolve issues bilaterally, and superseded the United Nation's resolution on Kashmir. Perhaps more importantly, under the agreement, India and Pakistan established the Line of Control (LoC), previously called the Ceasefire Line, making it a quasi-border between the two nations.

New Delhi succeeded in persuading Islamabad to change the name of the ceasefire line to the Line of Control (LoC), thus delinking it from the UN-imposed 1949 ceasefire line and highlighting that Kashmir was now a purely bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

The treaty clearly stated that Indian and Pakistani forces must be withdrawn to their respective sides of the “international border.” That in Jammu and Kashmir, the LoC resulting from the cease-fire of December 17, 1971, shall be respected by both sides without prejudice toward the recognised position of either side. 

Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations. India returned around 13,000 square kilometers of land taken in battle on the western border but retained some strategic areas, including Turtuk, Dhothang, Tyakshi, and Chalunka in Chorbat Valley, covering more than 883 square kilometers, so as to facilitate lasting peace. Both sides further agreed to refrain from the threat or the use of force in violation of the LoC. 

The fact that there has only been one limited war since the agreement was signed reflects its effectiveness. 

Some Indian bureaucrats later argued that a tacit agreement to convert this LoC into a international border, was reached during a one-on-one meeting between the two heads of government. Pakistani bureaucrats have denied any such thing. Nor was that acceptable to Indian public.

The Shimla agreement called on both sides to resolve all issues bilaterally. But Pakistan never respected this part of the treaty, and has taken matters to an international level, especially by doing chest-beating over Kashmir at the UN. The latest example of this attitude is Pakistan's outcry over the Abolition of Article 370 by the Narendra Modi-led government in 2019. One critical clause was that “both shall prevent the organisation, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious relations.”

Pakistan has been engaging in cross-border terrorism as a foreign policy tool to bleed India and to foster separatism in Kashmir, as well as to keep the Indian Armed Forces pinned down. Some of the major Pakistan-sponsored Islamist attacks against India have included a terrorist attack on the Parliament of India in New Delhi on December 13, 2001, the attack on the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar in 2002; the Mumbai train blasts in 2003; twin blasts at Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai in 2005, Delhi bombings and 2006 Mumbai train bombings, train blasts in Jaipur in 2008, and the tragic Mumbai attacks in November 2008. The latest large-scale attacks occurred in Kashmir: a deadly terrorist attack on the Army camp in Uri killed 17 Indian soldiers and an attack on the military convoy in Pulwama resulted in the death of 40 personnel.

Islamabad believes that by suspending the treaty it can once again take all issues to the UN or other bodies and invite third parties to intervene in the India-Pakistan disputes. But by suspending the Shimla agreement, the sanctity of the LoC becomes open-ended. It will be possible for either side to unilaterally take advantage and try violate it to gain ground.

India is more powerful, both militarily and otherwise, and will have the advantage. Pakistan tried to breach the LoC in 1999, resulting in the Kargil War, where Pakistanis were not only thrown out but also faced a humiliating defeat and very high casualties. Earlier, in 1984, Pakistan attempted to take control of the Siachen Glacier, an Indian territory demarcated by the Karachi agreement. In response, India launched Operation Meghdoot in 1984, gaining full control of the glacier. 

With the suspension of the Simla Agreement, New Delhi is free to use military options without violating any treaty. These options could be many. India could pro-actively target terrorist camps across the LoC in order to slow or stop terrorist infiltration. India could regain territory in critical sectors, especially gains like the Haji Peer Pass, that it had earlier frittered under international pressure. There are other sectors where India can create greater buffer zones to reduce threats to the Srinagar-Leh highway. 

When the treaty was signed, Pakistan had the support of the West, particularly the US, because Washington needed Pakistan for its operation against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. 

Things have changed ever since. Today the world is wooing India. India is a mature democracy with a powerful economy. It is a significant military power, too. Russia, Europe, the US, the Arab world, and even China need India for economic reasons. 

India can now use the leverage it has over major powers to isolate Pakistan. It was encouraging to note that when the New York Times reported that the Pahalgam tourists were gunned down by “militants in Kashmir,” the US House Foreign Affairs Committee rectified the headline, referring to the gunmen as “terrorists.” India's ties with China are also improving – causing insecurity in Pakistan.

The Shimla agreement had not prevented the relationship between the two countries from deteriorating to the point of armed conflict even before – in the Siachen glacier or during the Kargil War of 1999.

The prerequisites for reconciliation, good neighborliness and durable peace between the two, has been breached repeatedly by Pakistan sponsored terrorism. They were expected to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of each other, this too has been violated. Pakistan's army has repeatedly vowed to avenge the humiliating defeat and surrender of 93,000 able-bodied soldiers, “throwing peace into the wind.” 

The progressive normalising of relations as envisaged by the treaty was not allowed to happen by Pakistan's army, which has de-facto run the country since 1947. Pakistani Army's power flows from the insecurity of the nation's masses. Steps that were to be taken to promote travel, trade, and cultural relations kept seeing setbacks. The suspension of the treaty has raised concerns about the future of peace and stability in the region, especially regarding the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. 

The suspension could potentially revive the proxy warfare tactics that the Simla framework aimed to curb. It may not have immediate tactical consequences, but could open the door to greater diplomatic and military brinkmanship. Revival of hostilities or border instability could derail developmental and democratic consolidation efforts in J&K's post-Article 370 abrogation. The escalation conflict between two nuclear-armed states have already raised alarms in the international community, prompting calls for restraint and dialogue.  

The suspension of the Simla Agreement has provided India with an opportunity to recalibrate its security and diplomatic strategies. It also strengthened the case for Pakistan's re-listing in the Financial Action Task Force grey list. 

By disregarding the Simla Agreement, Pakistan has done a great favour to India and Prime Minister Modi to reclaim Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, something that the entire political class of India would support. India has nearly $680 billion in foreign exchange reserves, while Pakistan's are $15 billion. Pakistan cannot sustain a conflict. The extent of armed conflict will be graded. It is time to wait and watch as things unfold.

Trump of course denies it, but in fact the Ukraine conflict is now his war. The fundamental problem facing the American president is that the US is a co-belligerent, making any role as a mediator almost absurd. This is why real diplomacy and negotiations are critically needed.

Ukraine EU accession talks should be launched in 2025, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed on Wednesday. She argued that such a step would enhance Kiev's negotiating position against Moscow while also opening the door for more investments in the country's military industry.

Kiev has repeatedly expressed its desire to join the EU. However, Ukraine's “immediate” accession has been consistently opposed by several member states. Hungary has voiced concerns over corruption, the treatment of ethnic minorities, and economic competition, particularly in agriculture.

Other EU nations, including Slovakia, France, and Germany, have also expressed reservations, emphasizing that Kiev must meet existing reform benchmarks before talks proceed.

Speaking at a Europe Day event on May 7, von der Leyen said that the EU's current task is to “help Ukraine stand strong, defy Putin's intimidations.”

“Today, I would like to focus on how we can do so, and on three priorities for our action. First, support Ukraine's defense. Second, complete the phase-out of Russian fossil fuels. And third, accelerate Ukraine's accession path to our Union.”

She added that Brussels is “working hard with Ukraine to open the first cluster of accession talks, and to open all clusters in 2025.”

While Russia has consistently rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, its position on EU accession has been more restrained. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that the country has a “sovereign right” to join the bloc, provided that it remains a matter of economic integration and not military alignment.

At the same time, Russian officials have increasingly warned that the EU is losing its purely civilian character. Peskov has accused the bloc of actively working to prolong the Ukraine conflict by repeatedly expressing its intention to keep supporting Kiev in its desire to “continue the war.” 

He has also criticized Brussels for undermining peace efforts by consistently portraying Russia as the bloc's primary adversary.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had previously also stated that the EU was “becoming militarized at a record pace,” and claimed there was now “very little difference” between the EU and NATO.

MOSCOW, May 7. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused certain EU countries of resorting to ""uncivilized"" tactics to hinder international guests from traveling to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations.

""In line with the campaign of intimidation of European leaders that has been unleashed by Brussels to please the Kiev regime and prevent them from traveling to Moscow, the most zealous EU members are using uncivilized methods, seeking to close transport routes leading to Russia,"" she said in a statement.

""EU countries continue the practice of restricting the sovereign right of nations to carry out their own foreign policy, using all means at their disposal,"" Zakharova went on to say.

She said the refusal of Lithuania and Latvia to allow the plane carrying Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to fly through their airspace represents ""another egregious case"" of that practice.

""The behavior of the Lithuanian and Latvian authorities is unfortunately not surprising,"" she continued. ""Vilnius and Riga have long reserved for themselves the role of a Russophobic outpost, ready for any wild antics just to spite Russia and anyone who refuses to follow the lead of EU bureaucrats acting as supervisors.""

""Malicious intrigues will remain fruitless in this case as well,"" the spokeswoman said. ""No one can ruin our strategic partnership with Belgrade, the centuries-old friendship with the brotherly Serbian people.""

""Russia will celebrate the anniversary of the Great Victory with dignity, together with an impressive number of foreign guests who believe it is important to mark this sacred holiday among friends in no other place but Moscow.""

MOSCOW, May 7. /TASS/. Moscow is deeply concerned over the rising military tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, commenting on the latest escalation between India and Pakistan.

""We are deeply concerned by the heightened military tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of a terror attack near the town of Pahalgam,"" the diplomat said.

According to Zakharova, ""Russia resolutely condemns acts of terrorism as it opposes any manifestations of it and accentuates the need to join forces globally for an effective fight against this evil.""

""We call on the parties concerned to exercise restraint in order to prevent the situation in the region from escalating,"" the diplomat continued. ""We hope that the latest dispute between New Delhi and Islamabad will be resolved through peaceful political and diplomatic means on a bilateral basis in accordance with the provisions of the 1972 Simla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration,"" she concluded.

Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after armed men killed 25 Indians and one Nepalese national in the popular tourist town of Pahalgam in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor and struck nine targets in Pakistan. Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif warned that his country has every right to respond forcefully to India's aggression.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

CIA, NSA and Defense Intelligence Agency all included in ‘collection emphasis message', report says

Denmark has said that it will summon the US ambassador to Copenhagen to respond to reports that US intelligence agencies have been ordered to increase espionage in Greenland.

The Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said on Wednesday that he was concerned about the report in the Wall Street Journal, telling the Ritzau news agency: “It worries me a lot, because we don't spy between friends.”

Speaking on his way to a meeting in Warsaw, he added: “I can't know if it's true because it's in a newspaper. But it doesn't seem to be strongly rejected by those who speak out. That worries me.”

High-ranking officials working under Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued the instruction to agency heads in a “collection emphasis message”, the Journal reported.

Such messages customarily help to set intelligence priorities and direct resources and attention to high-interest targets.

The Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency were all included in the message. It told chiefs to study Greenland's independence movement and attitudes to American efforts to extract resources on the island, according to the Journal, citing two unnamed officials familiar with the matter.

Seasoned intelligence operatives say the Arctic island of about 56,000 inhabitants has not historically been a target of US espionage activity.

The move will further alarm Denmark, a US ally and Nato member, which has repeatedly vowed that the island is not available for sale or annexation. The country is planning to spend $1.5bn to protect Greenland, which has autonomous status under Denmark's constitutional monarchy.

Trump, who has mused since his first presidency about the possibility of possessing Greenland, refused to rule out seizing the 836,000 sq mile territory by force in an interview with NBC that was broadcast last weekend.

“I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,” he said. “We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”

The comments renewed a vow the president made in an address to a joint session of Congress in March, when he said: “One way or the other, we're going to get it.”

The Journal quoted a national security council spokesman, James Hewitt, as saying: “The president has been very clear that the US is concerned about the security of Greenland and the Arctic.” He declined to comment on the switch of intelligence focus to the island.

Gabbard issued a statement saying the newspaper “should be ashamed of aiding deep state actors who seek to undermine the president by politicizing and leaking classified information”.

Denmark's embassy in Washington has not commented.

The intelligence messages follows a visit to Greenland in March by Vice-President JD Vance, the then national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Chris Wright, the energy secretary, that was fiercely condemned by Danish leaders and local Greenland politicians.

Mette Frederiksen, Denmark's prime minister, said the visit put “completely unacceptable pressure completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population”.

She added: “President Trump is serious. He wants Greenland.”

 This article was amended on 7 May 2025 to clarify that Greenland is 836,000 sq miles, not sq feet.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Libya's provisional government has denied claims flight could happen as soon as this week

The Trump administration is planning to deport a group of migrants to Libya, according to reports, despite the state department's previous condemnation of the “life-threatening” prison conditions in the country.

Libya's provisional government has denied the reports.

Reuters cited three unnamed US officials as saying the deportations could happen this week. Two of the officials said the individuals, whose nationalities are not known, could fly to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but they added the plans could still change. The New York Times also cited a US official confirming the deportation plans.

It was not clear what Libya would be getting in return for taking any deportees.

Human rights groups condemned the reported plans, noting the country's poor record on human rights practices and harsh treatment of detainees.

“Migrants have long been trafficked, tortured and ransomed in Libya. The country is in a civil war. It is not a safe place to send anyone,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (Dawn), wrote on X.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on the platform alongside a picture of a Libyan detention facility: “Don't look away. This is what Libya's migrant detention facilities look like. This is what Trump is doing.”

Reichlin-Melnick added: “Amnesty International called these places a ‘hellscape' where beatings are common and sexual violence are rampant. There are reports of human trafficking and even slavery.”

Claudia Lodesani, head of programs for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said the group was “very concerned” about the possible consequences of such a plan, saying reports by media outlets and human rights organisations showed that “Libya is not a safe country for migrants”

Lodesani pointed to a 2023 United Nations report which documented “widespread practices of arbitrary detention, torture, rape and slavery and concluding there were grounds to believe a wide array of crimes against humanity have been committed against migrants in Libya”.

Government agencies, including the defense department, the White House, state department and department of homeland security did not immediately respond to the Guardian's requests for comment. The defense department later directed inquiries to the White House.

Reports of planned deportations to Libya come as the Trump administration is expanding its efforts to negotiate the deportations of US migrants to third-party countries, including Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda. This is alongside the at least 238 Venezuelan immigrants already deported to a prison in El Salvador.

Libya is a major transit point for Europe-bound asylum seekers. For years, human rights organisations have documented how migrants trapped in the country are at the mercy of militias and smugglers. Tens of thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa are kept indefinitely in overcrowded refugee detention centres where they are subjected to abuses and torture.

In its annual human rights report released last year, the US state department criticised Libya's “harsh and life-threatening prison conditions” and “arbitrary arrest or detention”, citing how migrants , including children, had “no access to immigration courts or due process”.

The news has prompted condemnation from aid agencies and NGOs that operate in the central Mediterranean, which have long warned about the harsh conditions faced by asylum seekers in Libya. They have also accused European governments of being complicit in such treatment by working with Libya to intercept migrants.

‘‘For 10 years now since our foundation, as a search and rescue organisation, we have continuously highlighted that Libya is not a safe place for migrants and refugees,” said Mirka Schäfer, a political expert for the German search-and-rescue organisation SOS Humanity. “Evidence from survivors onboard our vessel Humanity 1, includes refugees with traces of torture on their bodies, gunshot wounds, pain caused by beatings, physical and psychological wounds while in transit, in detention camps in Libya, or fleeing Libya across the Mediterranean.”

One person onboard the Humanity 1 ship said criminal groups operating in Libya “sell people like they would sell bread”.

Luca Casarini, the Italian founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, said the reported move by Trump was “an endorsement of the horror that has characterised his administration's policies since the very beginning”.

‘‘Libya is one of the most hellish places on Earth, where mafias and smugglers operate with the complicity of the European Union. But Trump goes a step further. The American president claims ownership of this horror by deporting people to a hell that is Libya, flaunting his power. It is a move that drags our civilisation toward the abyss.''

Libya's government of national unity said on Wednesday it rejected the use of its territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent. The government added there was no coordination with the US regarding the reception of migrants.

Trump, who made immigration a major issue during his election campaign, has launched aggressive enforcement action since taking office, increasing troops to the southern border and pledging to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the US.

As of Monday, the Trump administration had deported 152,000 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump's administration has tried to encourage migrants to leave voluntarily by threatening steep fines, trying to strip away legal status, and sending migrants to notorious prisons in Guantánamo Bay and El Salvador.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, last week said the US was not satisfied with sending migrants only to El Salvador, and hinted that Washington was looking to expand the number of countries to which it could deport people.

“We are working with other countries to say: we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings; will you do this as a favour to us?” Rubio said at a cabinet meeting at the White House last Wednesday. “And the further away from America, the better.”

A fourth US official said the administration had for several weeks been looking at a number of countries where it might be able to send migrants, including Libya.

On 19 April the supreme court temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelans it accused of being gang members.

Trump's administration, which has invoked a rarely used wartime law, has urged the justices to lift or narrow their order.

In his first interview since leaving office, former US president told the BBC he fears for US-Europe relations 

Joe Biden has accused Donald Trump of “modern-day appeasement” in his approach to Russia and expressed fears that Europe would “lose confidence in the certainty of America” in his first interview since leaving the White House in January.

“He [Vladimir Putin] believes it [Russia] has historical rights to Ukraine,” Biden told the BBC. Anybody who thought the Russian president would stop if Kyiv conceded territory, as recently proposed by Trump, “is just foolish”, he said.

Speaking in Delaware as the Allied nations mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, Biden said Trump's stance was “modern-day appeasement” in reference to the attempts of British prime minister Neville Chamberlain's to appease Adolf Hitler in the 1930s.

He also said he feared Europe was going to lose confidence in the “certainty of America and the leadership of America” and that a breakdown of US-Europe relations under Trump “would change the modern history of the world”.

Biden said the leaders of European nations would be left “wondering, well, what do I do now? … Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?

“I fear our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been in the last 80 years,” he said.

Biden told Nick Robinson that he found the extraordinary meeting in the Oval Office between Trump and Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy “beneath America”.

He went on to condemn Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama canal, make Canada the 51st American state and seize Greenland.

“What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,” he said. “We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.”

Challenged about his own actions on Ukraine – critics have said he was too slow to supply the weapons Kyiv needed for its defence and lift restrictions on their use – he said: “We gave them everything they needed to provide for their independence, and we were prepared to respond, more aggressively, if Putin moved again.”

Asked about his decision to leave the US presidential race only months before the election, leaving his successor, Kamala Harris little time to prepare, Biden said: “I don't think it would have mattered. We left at a time when we had a good candidate.

“Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away. And it was a hard decision,” he said. “I think it was the right decision. I think that … it was just a difficult decision.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Voicing frustration over the lack of success in ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for renewed focus on “our No. 1 geopolitical foe” — China.

“Not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what's happening with China is more important in the long term for the future of the world,” Rubio told Fox News host Sean Hannity.

US President Donald Trump's inner circle has long spoken of China as the archenemy, with some suggesting that ending the Ukraine war would free up resources to counter Beijing — especially if it seeks to move on Taiwan.

Yet more than 100 days into Trump's term, observers notice a surprising lack of attention on China. Trump has hit the country hard with tariffs, but otherwise, there has been little by way of articulated strategy.

Rubio, who in his US Senate confirmation hearing warned that China could affect “virtually everything that matters to us in life” within a decade, has yet to visit East Asia, focusing attention on Trump's priority of deporting mostly Latin American migrants as well as to diplomacy on Ukraine.

“I think that the White House thought that they'd be in a different place with China now than where they are,” said Wendy Cutler, a former top US trade negotiator who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

Trump's tariff war “escalated so quickly that it's hard to unwind now,” she said.

China is “playing a longer game,” with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) rallying the population by blaming the US for economic pain, she said.

Trump is surrounded by reputed hawks such as Rubio, but the president appears “enamored with Xi Jinping,” Cutler said.

“He thinks that they get along well, and that if it's leader to leader, they can figure out this relationship and put it back on track,” she said.

The US and China plan their first formal trade talks this week in Switzerland, over a month after Trump unveiled his sweeping levies.

Trump, who has vowed to remake the global economic system, has slapped 145 percent tariffs on products from China, which has responded with 125 duties on imports from the US.

Trump has shown himself to be far more radical than in his first term on a host of issues, but he has shown signs of pragmatism on China, despite heated rhetoric against Beijing on the campaign trail.

David Perdue, a former senator and Trump's pick for ambassador to Beijing, wrote about China during the campaign that “America is at war,” but in his confirmation hearing said the US approach should be “nuanced, nonpartisan and strategic.”

Former US president Joe Biden's administration also identified China as the top rival, but sought to work together on targeted areas, such as fighting climate change and curbing fentanyl.

Yet the Biden administration also pursued a broader regional strategy of facing down China through alliances. It began a shift of US forces in southern Japan and northern Philippines — within proximity of Taiwan — and pursued coalitions to reject the use of Chinese high-technology.

Trump has derided allies, especially in Europe, and has hit even US friends with tariffs, while China has quickly reached out to Japan and South Korea, among the closest US allies, to explore a free-trade deal.

“By undercutting core US alliances and partnerships across Europe and Asia, he is reducing the leverage that the United States can bring to bear vis-a-vis China,” said Ali Wyne, who follows China for the International Crisis Group.

He also questioned how the tariff war fit into a considered strategy on China, which has an incentive to double down on achieving greater self-sufficiency and has projected itself as “a more stabilizing geopolitical force than the world's preeminent power.”

“Despite his alleged friendship with Xi and his stated desire for the United States and China to collaborate more robustly, he has created a trade impasse from which neither leader has an easy face-saving off-ramp,” Wyne said.

Singapore's ruling party was always going to win this election, but in a world rocked by the unpredictability of the US, the trade-dependent nation reached for security. The People's Action Party (PAP), which has been in power since before the city-state became independent in 1965, won a resounding mandate.

It is a sign of how insecure voters are feeling about the future. The party would be wise to pay attention to them.

Under the PAP, Singapore has transformed into Asia's richest nation, but it is also among the most unequal. Citizens live in what Freedom House ranks as only a partly free society. Opposition parties have struggled to gain ground in a system they describe as stacked against them, and say the PAP has built-in advantages when it comes to setting the terms of the election — claims it denies.

Still, the message that the party knows best how to steer the nation through global uncertainty clearly resonated. Voters in Singapore, like those in many nations, are anxious about bread-and-butter issues — the cost of living, housing and whether their children would have stable job prospects. The PAP should not let them down.

Singapore has benefited immensely from globalization and free trade, but that world order is under pressure. US President Donald Trump's trade war is threatening the economy — the initial round of new tariffs is already set to hit 60 percent of exports to the US. This could drag on future growth while keeping inflation elevated, according to the central bank.

The economic picture is growing more challenging. Consumer prices are on average 17 percent higher than they were in the last election in 2020. The cost of public housing, where approximately 80 percent of citizens live, has soared, too. The PAP leaned into the uncertain environment as part of its campaign, arguing that only a tried-and-tested team could get Singapore through the coming storm.

For Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong (黃循財), who was appointed a year ago, this election was also a referendum on his personal credibility. He should be pleased with the result.

Wong, who took over from Lee Hsien Loong (李顯龍), son of the nation's first prime minister and founding father Lee Kuan Yew (李光耀), made his name during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing reassurance as one of the senior politicians leading the response.

He has promised a kinder, more compassionate way of governing, but many have wondered whether this rhetoric would translate into real political reform. Now is the time to make good on those words.

PAP officials might be tempted to think that voter confidence means that they do not have to worry about internal change and more transparency. That would be a mistake. Singaporeans might not have handed more seats to the main opposition Workers' Party than in previous elections, but thousands attended their rallies. Young people appear to be drawn to their ideas of more inclusivity and greater openness in governance, with some expressing a desire for more political engagement.

The ruling party might feel that to maintain the control it has had on Singaporeans, it needs to further clamp down on independent media or citizens' freedom to vent their frustrations online. Doing so would breed more resentment. It should not treat engagement by younger voters as a threat, and instead allow them to help shape the conversation around national issues such as housing and education. After all, it is the next generation that is the most impacted by decisions made by today's politicians.

PAP politicians would also do well to avoid being tone-deaf around economic issues. They are among the most highly paid public servants in the world, something Singaporeans regularly complain about. The government could address this by finally completing the delayed review of political office holders' salaries that was due in 2023. (It was deferred because of what the government called other pressing issues, such as the uncertain geopolitical situation.) Renewing the discussion around the level of ministerial salaries would help to reassure Singaporeans that their politicians are not out of touch with regular citizens' problems.

Despite having one of the shortest campaign periods in the world — this one ran for nine days — voters used the time well, engaging in discussions at housing estates, coffee shops and rallies, comparing manifestos, questioning prospective members of parliament and creating some of the most entertaining political memes that I have seen in my time covering Singaporean politics. These lively conversations reflect a maturing electorate, as I have noted before.

Singapore might have voted for stability in the face of Trump's trade war, but that should not be taken for granted.

In more general military parlance, the concept refers to an asymmetric capability that targets a critical vulnerability of an adversary. China has found its modern equivalent of the assassin's mace with its high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) weapons, which are nuclear warheads detonated at a high altitude, emitting intense electromagnetic radiation capable of disabling and destroying electronics. 
An assassin's mace weapon possesses two essential characteristics: strategic surprise and the ability to neutralize a core dependency.

The tone of his address was grave, revealing deep anxieties about China's current state of affairs. Essentially, what he worries most about is systemic threats to China's normal development as a country.
The US-China trade war has turned white hot: China's export orders have plummeted, Chinese firms and enterprises are shutting up shop, and local debt risks are mounting daily, causing China's economy to flag externally and hemorrhage internally. China's

While criticism of the government can be a healthy expression of a vibrant, pluralistic society, and protests are quite common in Taiwan, the discourse of the 426 rally nonetheless betrayed troubling signs of collective amnesia.
Specifically, the KMT, which imposed 38 years of martial law in Taiwan from 1949 to 1987, has never fully faced its

According to reports, Hualien County Government officials visited several people to verify their signatures. Local authorities allegedly used routine or harmless reasons as an excuse to enter people's house for investigation. 
The KMT launched its own recall campaigns, targeting Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers, and began to collect signatures. It has been found that some of the KMT-headed counties and cities have allegedly been mobilizing municipal machinery.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Andrew Giuliani, son of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, would serve as executive director of the presidential task force for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. 

During Trump's first term, Andrew Giuliani served as a special assistant to the president and associate director of the US Office of Public Liaison. Trump described him as a highly competitive golfer and person. 

In the post on Truth Social, Trump also said Carlos Cordeiro, a FIFA senior adviser, would serve as a task force senior adviser.

“Together this group will help plan the biggest, safest and most extraordinary soccer tournament in history,” Trump said at a task force meeting where FIFA president Gianni Infantino and US Vice President J.D. Vance were also present. 

Trump said he wanted people traveling to the US to watch the competition to have a seamless experience during every part of their visit. 

The US would also host the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup from June 14 to July 13, which would take place across 11 cities. 

“America will welcome the world,” Infantino said of the US hosting the two international tournaments. 

Infantino said the two events would bring almost US$50 billion in economic output to the US and create almost 300,000 jobs. 

Vance, who serves as vice chair of the task force, said the group would do everything in its power to make the events successful. 

“Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event. I know we'll have visitors from close to 100 countries,” Vance said. “We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game, but when the time is up, they'll have to go home, otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary [of Homeland Security Kristi] Noem.”

Ukraine suggested creating a demilitarized zone jointly controlled by Kyiv and Moscow, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg said in a Fox News interview on May 6.

Kellogg described the proposal as a buffer zone with both sides pulling back 15 kilometers, creating a 30-kilometer area monitored by observers from third countries.

He said the arrangement could accompany a ceasefire ""in place,"" meaning both sides would maintain control of the territory they currently occupy.

The proposal contrasts with Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands, which require Ukrainian forces to withdraw from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts.

Russia claimed to annex the four regions during its full-scale invasion in 2022, but it does not fully control any of them.

Kellogg said the main obstacle to reaching a deal is Putin's refusal to accept a ceasefire.

""I think we're close. The one man who can deliver it, I believe, is President (Donald) Trump, as long as Putin agrees. And that's one of our, probably our, impediments to progress — the president of Russia right now not agreeing to it,"" Kellogg said.

Responding to Kellogg's statement, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow has not received any proposals from Kyiv regarding the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the front line, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Moscow has listed maximalist demands in ceasefire talks and rejected a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, which Kyiv accepted on March 11.

""You get to a 30-day ceasefire. It'll get extended. And it is so hard to do this when you're a military guy… to restart a conflict. And I don't think they will,"" Kellogg added.

Since taking office in January 2025, Trump has not approved any new U.S. military aid for Ukraine. His campaign pledge to end the war within 24 hours has failed to yield results after more than 100 days in office.

Despite frustration with Moscow's refusal to de-escalate, the Trump administration has not imposed new sanctions or taken other steps to pressure the Kremlin.

United States President Donald Trump attributed Russia's invasion of Ukraine to its exclusion from the Group of Eight (G8), now the Group of Seven (G7).

Speaking to reporters at a World Cup planning meeting on May 6, Trump said it was a ""foolish decision"" to ban Russia from the group.

""If they didn't vote Russia out... I think you probably wouldn't have this ridiculous, deadly war... It was a very bad decision,"" Trump said.

""They threw them out and because of that... millions of people are dying,"" Trump added, referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 

When pressed about whether he would invite Russia back to the group, Trump responded that ""it's not good timing now,"" contradicting previous statements.

Earlier this year, Trump said that he would ""love"" to see Russia readmitted into the G7, calling Russia's expulsion from the group a ""mistake.""

The G8 became the G7 after Russia was expelled in 2014 for its invasion of Ukraine's Donbas, and subsequent annexation of Crimea.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, G7 countries have collectively supported Ukraine, including through the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration program, which aims to provide Kyiv with $50 billion in loans using frozen Russian assets.

Current G7 members include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union is also represented in the group.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A law requiring U.S. streaming giants to inject millions into Canada's creative sector risks becoming a target in Washington amid President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on all foreign-produced films, experts say. 

A body representing several U.S. platforms called Tuesday for a halt to the implementation of Ottawa's Online Streaming Act, which has yet to be fully enacted by Canada's broadcasting regulator.

Adam Taylor, a trade expert representing U.S. movie studios and streaming platforms, said foreign interactions with the U.S. screen industry are now “fully in the crosshairs of the Trump administration,” and the act – which was known as Bill C-11 – is likely to become another sticking point in trade negotiations. 

Mr. Taylor said that “with the Trump administration targeting Canada's film industry,” it is only a matter of time before the Online Streaming Act moves up the agenda in Washington.

He said he thinks Canada should put revisiting the act on the table with the White House to stop the issue from escalating. 

“We know that the U.S. Trade Representative has already flagged the Online Streaming Act as a bilateral trade issue of concern that discriminates against U.S. companies, and so we should fully expect that this issue is now in the basket of other bilateral trade issues that are going to need to be negotiated,” he said.

The act modernized Canada's broadcasting law, requiring foreign streaming platforms to support Canadian creative industries – including film and TV – as traditional broadcasters do. They are also required to promote Canadian content.

The law will compel foreign streaming giants to collectively pay about $200-million a year to support Canadian music, TV, film and radio.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission has yet to fully implement the Online Streaming Act, which received royal assent two years ago. It is currently looking at modernizing the official definition of Canadian content. 

Graham Davies, president and chief executive of the Digital Media Association – which represents companies with streaming platforms, including Amazon, Apple and YouTube – said the act “is discriminatory” and “unfairly punishes streaming services.”

“We are urging the new federal government to reconsider the continued implementation of this flawed legislation,” he said. 

Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in internet law at the University of Ottawa, said the regime set up by Bill C-11, mandating payments by American streaming platforms to pay for Canadian productions, could be seen as protectionist and “pose significant risks in the Trump era.”

“There's a significant risk that especially Bill C-11 could become the target for Trump's clear concerns about the state of the U.S. film sector,” he said. 

Last year, 19 members of Congress, including 11 Republicans, wrote to then-U.S. trade representative Katherine Tai, saying the act discriminates against Americans and asking her to take up the matter with Canada.

It was raised as an issue of concern by Ms. Tai before Mr. Trump took office in January. Bill C-11 was also raised during talks in 2022 at the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Free Trade Commission ministerial meeting.

Last year, several foreign streaming platforms – including Netflix, Amazon and Spotify – launched Federal Court challenges to how the regulator is implementing the Online Streaming Act.

Mr. Trump's tariff threat prompted calls from within Canada's film sector for greater domestic support for the industry. 

Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, said in an e-mail that Mr. Trump's announcement “is further proof that Canada must have rules in place that support a strong, independent domestic industry.”

“We can partner with foreign companies – in fact we want to – but we need to be able to tell our stories without depending on them.” 

Jack Blum, executive director of Reel Canada, said Mr. Trump's pronouncement is “potentially disastrous” not just for the Canadian film industry but the Hollywood studios, and “entirely incomprehensible.” 

“I can't imagine the voices against this being any louder than in LA,” he added.

He said the film industry is “integrated across the world” and big film productions involve expertise in many countries, which “works extremely well.”

As well as shooting on location in Canada, U.S. film studios rely on Canadian expertise including in sound editing, animation and special effects, he said. 

Canada must develop not just its own film industry but work more closely with filmmakers outside the U.S., including in Europe and India, Mr. Blum added. He mentioned the 2015 film Brooklyn, a co-production with Britain and Ireland starring Saoirse Ronan and Jim Broadbent, as an example of such a successful collaboration.

“We have to wean ourselves away from the U.S. and strengthen domestic production, and reinstate our relationships with other countries around the world,” he said.

There's a philosophy of contemporary toddler-parenting that holds that parents should strive to distinguish between behaviours that are harmful or dangerous, and those that are merely annoying. Dumping all your toys on the floor? Annoying. Throwing your toys? Harmful. Mashing food with your fork? Annoying. Mashing your hand with your fork? Dangerous. Parents are instructed to intervene when actions could cause real harm, but to mostly let the other stuff go. 

The intention here is twofold: one, for parents, to preserve their sanity (it's liberating to realize you don't have to take up every battle) and two, for toddlers, to encourage their creative expression. So your toddler wants to make a mess of their dinner? So what. Let them do their thing, and get them to help clean up the mess afterward. Otherwise, every meal turns into a tantrum. 

I have no insight as to whether Prime Minister Mark Carney follows “@biglittlefeelings” or similar influencer parenting accounts on Instagram. But his conduct during his first public-facing meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday followed precisely what is prescribed by such accounts for dealing with highly irrational, emotionally volatile individuals who frequently test limits and insist on doing everything themselves: two-year-olds, in other words, or on rare occasions, American presidents.

Mr. Carney spoke up when the President mused about Canada becoming the 51st state; you cannot let the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth talk openly about absorbing a sovereign nation any more than you can let a toddler try to cut her doll's hair with nail clippers. It's too dangerous. But you try to speak their language in order to soften your intervention. “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” Mr. Carney said to Mr. Trump. This is the geopolitical equivalent of saying, “Yes, it's fun to play hair-salon, but those clippers might give you or your doll a boo-boo.”

Mr. Carney continued: “Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign, over the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale – ever.” And before Mr. Trump's face could turn red, Mr. Carney redirected the conversation; he noted Canada's investment in strengthening its border security, its commitment to its partnership with the U.S., and he ended with a little flattery: “And I'll say this as well, that the President has revitalized international security, revitalized NATO and us playing our full weight in NATO.” You made your doll look so pretty with all that marker on her face.

Beyond that, the 30-minute dialogue was mostly an exercise in the Prime Minister biting his tongue. Mr. Carney didn't correct Mr. Trump when he said that Canadians are “paying a tariff on cars and steel and aluminum,” though the economist in him was surely suffering a slow death behind his pursed lips. Mr. Carney looked at his lap when Mr. Trump referred to former finance minister Chrystia Freeland – whom he didn't directly name – as a “terrible person,” and offered only the slightest side nod when Mr. Trump turned to him and said, “You know who I'm talking about.” 

When Mr. Trump claimed that, “We don't do much business with Canada....They do a lot of business with us,” the Prime Minister waited about eight minutes to deliver a gentle fact check, noting that Canada is “the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods.” And though Mr. Carney's body language suggested he wanted to speak up when Mr. Trump claimed that the U.S. is “subsidizing Canada to the tune of maybe $200-billion a year,” the President shut down the event before he had a chance to chime in.

Some might view Mr. Carney's restraint as a sign of weakness, but challenging Mr. Trump's every statement would have been a foolish, counterproductive thing to do. Indeed, it was much better for everyone that the Prime Minister picked his battles – interjecting when Mr. Trump said something harmful or dangerous, but letting the annoying stuff go. Otherwise, Canada might be dealing with an awful tantrum right about now. 

Though expectations for this meeting were low, Mr. Carney performed just about as well as Canada could've hoped for its new Prime Minister. He did exactly what he was elected to do, which is to act as the adult in what is really a very silly – but high-stakes – situation. Mr. Trump seemed pleased by the interaction, and quite taken by Mr. Carney personally. These are good signs for Canada, and good signs for our collective sanity. We just might make it through to the next dinnertime.

Are brakes now made differently?","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/culture/article-my-brake-rotors-rusted-from-not-driving-enough-are-brakes-now-made/","Wed, 07 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Hello, I own a two-year-old Mini, with 11,000 kilometres on it. To my shock, I was told that the brake rotors were rusted and needed replacement. The reason being I was not driving and braking enough.

A friend owns an electric Volvo. His vehicle developed a shake at six months after leaving the dealership floor. The problem, he was told, was rusted brakes, which was considered wear and tear, not covered by insurance. The issue again being low mileage and the brakes not being used. Eventually the dealership did cover the cost.

My question is: is this legitimate? Are cars being manufactured with a flaw in the braking system? – Gayle G., Conception Bay South, NL

Many moons ago, when I was a Honda dealer technician, I recall brake rotors that could be resurfaced/machined a couple of times and regularly lasted 200,000 kilometres before replacement was required. A vehicle owner could get at least two, sometimes even three, brake pad replacements to one set of brake rotors.

Now, we don't even bother trying to save them because they are corroded well past the point of being able to service them. You are now more likely to see a one-to-one relationship, meaning that for every brake pad replacement a set of new brake rotors are also required.

Setting aside the metallurgy discussion (as I'm sure there are those out there far better to discuss this than I am), simply put, contemporary brake rotors are made differently. They now are manufactured using grey cast iron, which differs from the brake rotors of yesteryear that were regular cast iron but with corrosion resistant compounds and quite often coated with a rust inhibiting outer layer. The differences in choice of materials simply comes down to cost savings.

Almost all drivers have now experienced the dreaded brake grinding sounds after their vehicle has sat outside for several days in the rain. The noise often dissipates once you drive the vehicle a short distance.

This is because of a layer of corrosion appearing on the brake rotors after sitting overnight and then the first few brake applications wipe away the light corrosion. However, what happens when a vehicle sits for extended periods? Without the daily drive refreshing the surface of the rotor, corrosion will build to the point where it can no longer be simply wiped away. This is what you are experiencing.

While some consider it a flaw, all manufacturers now consider this normal. The low yearly mileage that your vehicle sees indicates that you will likely deal with this repeatedly. Your friend with the EV has the added bonus that their vehicle has regenerative braking, resulting in the physical brakes being used even less than a gas-powered vehicle. This further emphasizes the rusty brakes situation, which often is first made apparent to the driver as a shake.

When asked to describe his idea of an Israeli victory, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he envisions Gaza being ""completely destroyed"" and its residents displaced.

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said that, from his perspective, defeating Hamas means completely razing Gaza. 

Speaking in the West Bank settlement of Ofra, Smotrich said his idea of winning in Gaza would mean the territory would be ""destroyed"" with civilians moved to a ""humanitarian zone"" in the south of the Palestinian territory.

From there, he said, they would start to ""leave in great numbers"" to third countries.

The minister also voiced hopes for the formal annexation of the West Bank before the end of the current government's term.

Meanwhile, Paris and Beijing have expressed their reservations and opposition to Israel's plans to expand its offensive in Gaza.

This blog has closed. Below is our roudup of news on Israel, Gaza and the wider Middle East on Tuesday, May 6.

Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Israel was ""a cause of great concern"" for the new government in Berlin.

""Humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip must be ensured,"" Merz said.

He spoke to public broadcaster ARD after he had been elected as new chancellor in the second round of voting in the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament.

Merz also said the Israeli government must fulfill its obligations under international law and humanitarian law. 

While reaffirming that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas militants, Merz noted that this right comes with responsibilities.

""Israel must also remain a country that lives up to its humanitarian obligations, even where — especially where this terrible war is now raging in the Gaza Strip — where this confrontation with the Hamas terrorists is necessarily taking place,"" he said.

Merz said his new foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, is set to travel to Israel this weekend.

President Donald Trump said the United States would stop bombing Yemen's Houthis after the Iran-backed rebels allegedly begged for a truce.

""They said please don't bomb us any more and we're not going to attack your ships,"" Trump told reporters, referring to the faction disrupting shipping lanes in the Red Sea.

Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the group's supreme revolutionary committee, said they will review the US decision to stop ""aggression"" against Yemen.

Writing on X, he said the group would continue to support Gaza. 

Meanwhile Oman said it mediated a ceasefire deal between the Houthis and the US. According to a statement from Oman, neither side will target the other, including US vessels in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait.

There was no mention of Houthi attacks on Israel. 

The Iran-backed group has been attacking Israel and shipping in the Red Sea since 2023 in retaliation for Israel's war in Gaza. The group has since been classified as a terrorist organization by the US.

In March, Trump ordered a sustained bombing campaign against the Houthis.

The Israeli military says it has launched airstrikes against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, fully disabling the country's main international airport in the capital, Sanaa.

The military also said it had struck several power plants. It had earlier warned people to leave the area around the main airport in Yemen's Sanaa, a day after it struck the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. 

The Israeli attack on Monday killed four people and injured 39, according to the Houthi health officials. It came in response to a Houthi missile that landed near Israel's Ben Gurion airport  a day earlier.

Foreign airlines had began to resume flights to Israel in recent months, but some companies responded to the latest attack by halting flights once again.

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich described his idea of Israel's victory over the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas as Gaza being ""destroyed"" and its civilian inhabitants evacuated.

""Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to... the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,"" the firebrand politician told a conference in the Israeli settlement of Ofra in the occupied West Bank.

Smotrich also expressed his hope that the occupied West Bank would be formally annexed during the current government's term, which could last until late next year.

France has said it ""strongly condemns"" the Israeli plan to conquer the Gaza Strip and its new military campaign in the Palestinian territory, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Tuesday.

""It is unacceptable,"" said Barrot in an interview with the broadcaster RTL, adding that the Israeli government ""violates humanitarian law.""

""What is urgent is a ceasefire and unhindered access to humanitarian aid, massively,"" Barrot added.

His comments came a day after the Israeli security cabinet announced that it had adopted a plan to expand the military campaign in the Gaza Strip, which includes the ""conquest"" of the Palestinian enclave and control of the territories seized.

This plan would also entail the internal displacement of the majority of Gazans, according to the army.

Virtually all of the Gaza Strip's inhabitants — some 2.4 million people — have been displaced several times since the war in the territory began in October 2023.

After the revelation of an Israeli plan to conquer the Gaza Strip, a senior official with the militant Islamist Palestinian organization Hamas said the group rejected all further ceasefire talks.

""There is no point in holding talks or considering new proposals for a ceasefire as long as the war of hunger and annihilation in the Gaza Strip continues,"" Hamas representative Basem Naim told the AFP news agency on Tuesday.

Hamas is labeled as terror group by many nations, including Germany and the US.

Naim said the world must pressure the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the ""crimes of hunger, thirst, and killings"" in Gaza.

Welcome to our coverage of the ongoing conflict in Gaza where Israel has said it will intensify attacks and displace people within the enclave.

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said his vision of victory inlcudes the Gaza Strip being ""entirely destroyed"" with civilians relocated at the end of the after the ongoing war with Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas.

Separately, Israel said it bombed the main airport in Yemen's capital Saana, after hitting the port city of Hodeidah the day before.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has so far killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, the majority of which are civilians, according to the Hamas-rung Gaza Health Ministry.

The current conflict broke out on October 7, 2023, when militants led by Hamas — designated a terror group by Germany, Israel and the US among others — launched a major assault on Israel resulting in the deaths of more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Fact check: Fake news spread after India strikes Pakistan","https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-kashmir-conflict-out-of-context-old-videos-computer-game-footage-disinformation/a-72465246","Wed, 07 May 2025 15:54:45 GMT","

Viral social media posts claim to show India's attacks on Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. But some videos are used out of context and try to stoke tensions even more.   

Tensions are high after India carried out strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir . India's military said it struck infrastructure used by militants, while Pakistan's army said India had killed 26 civilians. This attack came days after India blamed Pakistan for the deadly Pahalgam attack in the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir region, which killed 26 people in a tourist hotspot.

As the worst outbreak of violence between the two nuclear powers in two decades ramps up, misinformation on social media is spreading like wildfire. DW Fact check takes a look at some of the most viral video claims.

Claim: These videos allegedly show Indian missiles raining down on Pakistan and the aftermath of the bombing on the ground. The first video tagged with the hashtag ""Operation Sindoor"" has been viewed 5 million times at the time of publishing. The Indian military has given its missile strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir this name.

DW Fact check: False

These videos don't show the current conflict and are taken out of context.

A reverse image search with a video still showing missiles in the night sky from the first video takes us to the same video that was first published over seven months ago. It shows Iranian missiles hitting Israel. What looks like an insert showing the location seen in the right corner is actually the logo of Indian broadcaster DD India, which published the video on October 1, 2024.

The second video that allegedly shows the impact on the ground in Pakistan was first posted three weeks ago in the context of Gaza. In the video, chaotic scenes show adults and children running around, covered in dust and carrying injured people. Children can be heard screaming, and people are speaking Arabic, which is not a native language of Pakistan. 

In this deep-rooted conflict, partisan misinformation is spread by both sides.  



Claim: This presumably pro-Pakistan commentator claims to be posting about France-made Rafale fighters, used by the Indian Air Force, shot down during last night's strike on Pakistan, near Bahawalpur.

DW Fact check: False

The picture attached to the post does show a French-designed aircraft. However, it is not a Rafale fighter but a Mirage 5. This type of assault jet was retrofitted for the Pakistan Air Force so that it could carry and deliver nuclear weapons.

The wreck shown in the X-post, according to India TV, Dawn and The Economic Times, had been a plane on a training mission in Punjab in South-Eastern Pakistan three weeks ago, on April 16. Both pilots got away with minor injuries after ejecting themselves, escaping the crash near Multan.

The historic region of Punjab was split in the mid of last century when the modern states of India, Pakistan, and, several decades later, Bangladesh emerged, following the subcontinent's independence from the British Empire. Therefore, there are two Punjabs, one is a province in Pakistan, and the other a state in India. 

However, it wasn't just Pakistani social media users posting out-of-context footage. 

Claim: This X post with more than 2 million views, reads: ""(....) Pakistanis shoots down 1 Rafale & 1 Su-30 near Akhnur! And destroyed our brigade HQ"". It was published on an X account whose owner refers to the Indian government as ""the Modi regime"" in another post and claims to be ""Proud Indian"" and to rate ""Truth over propaganda"" in his account description.

DW Fact check: False

In this case, the account is spreading misinformation, as two of the pictures attached to his posts are not related to the Indian strikes on Pakistan last night. 

The upper right image does depict a Russian-built MiG-29 of the Indian Air Force, one of which Pakistan claims to have shot down last night. But DNA India and other media outlets published the same photo as early as September 2024. According to these sources, the fighter jet had crashed into uninhabited territory in the Indian state of Rajasthan during a routine flight, causing no other damage than the plane itself. The pilot reportedly ejected himself to safety.

The picture on the left also shows an IAF aircraft, but just like the previous two, it was not used in the strikes on Pakistan. Times Now reported more than a month ago that an Anglo-French Jaguar fighter jet plummeted in the Northern Indian state of Gujarat, showing the very same image.



Claim: This video allegedly shows how Pakistan shot down an Indian fighter jet.

DW Fact check: Fake

Users online were quick to point out that this scene is from a video game, most likely from this one here. Compared to other footage at night, the video is suspiciously well-lit and has an overall artificial feel to it. Going through the video frame by frame, the unnatural pixelated lights are a hint that the video is fake.  

It's not the first time that video game footage has been used in conflicts. DW Fact check has reported on other cases in the past.

Following the death of Pope Francis on Easter Monday, cardinals are meeting in the Sistine Chapel to elect his successor. DW has the latest.

Here is the latest from the conclave election process taking place in Vatican City from Wednesday, May 7:

The doors of the Sistine Chapel have closed. 

Catholic cardinals who will select the next pope were sealed behind the heavy wooden doors. 

The conclave officially began, and, if all goes according to the Vatican's plan, the public won't hear anything until a new pope is elected and white smoke rises from a chimney on top of the Sistine Chapel. 

The 133 cardinals who will choose Pope Francis' successor are walking from the Pauline Chapel to the Sistine Chapel to begin the conclave.

As they enter, they individually swear an oath of secrecy.

They will be locked in ahead of a first vote later today.

As stated earlier in our blog, the modern papal conclave began after the nearly three-year negotiation that resulted in the papacy of Gregory X in 1274, but does today's ritual vote have anything to do with its predecessors? 

Gregory was elected after 18 cardinals were literally bricked-up in a palace until they finally made their choice. Sequestration remains a key aspect of the vote even now.

The first conclave to feature regular daily voting was held in Arezzo, Tuscany, resulting in the 1276 election of Pope Innocent V. The secret written ballot was introduced by Gregory XV in 1621, and the oath of secrecy — even after the conclave — was codified by Pius X in 1904.  

The conclaves were not always held in Rome, most notably during the so-called Avignon papacy (1309-1376) which arose out of conflict between the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor and then the Catholic Church's subsequent four-decade schism, which saw two popes on two thrones — Rome and Avignon, France — each claiming to be the rightful heir to St. Peter and excommunicating one another in a tit-for-tat tussle for control of the church.

The tradition of cardinals electing the pope began far earlier, in 1059, under Nicholas II; and the idea of a two-thirds majority vote, still valid today, was introduced by Alexander III in 1179. Pope Paul VI set an age limit of 80 for voting cardinals in 1970.

The role of the papacy and those who have held the position has also changed dramatically over the centuries. Although the head of the modern church holds high moral authority and the church has great wealth, earlier popes had far more worldly wealth, as well as political and military might. This led to the election of men who would be unrecognizable compared to someone like Pope Francis or any of his contemporary predecessors.

The history of ambitious and morally flawed men ascending to the papacy is far more scary and colorful than most can even begin to imagine today, ranging from outright bribery to attain the position (Alexander VI) to the murder of fellow contenders (Sergius III) as a stepping stone to what was unlimited power and a seemingly endless income stream.

As the cardinals set to elect the next pope gathered in prayer, the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, directly addressed their responsibility, saying: ""We are here to invoke the help of the Holy Spirit, to implore his light and strength so that the pope elected may be he whom the church and humanity need at this difficult and complex turning point in history.""

""This is also a strong call to maintain the unity of the church… a unity that does not mean uniformity but a firm and profound communion in diversity,"" he said while emphasizing the ""exceptional importance"" of the decision at hand.

Re urged cardinals to set aside ""every personal decision"" and pray for, ""a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all in today's society, characterized by great technological progress but which tends to forget god."" 

His words hinted at the great uncertainty gripping the world both geopolitically and technologically, as well as divides within the 2,000 year-old Catholic church itself, which has struggled to come to grips with sexual abuse scandals and dwindling popularity in the face of growing secularism and evangelical Christianity, among others.

The College of Cardinals has begun morning prayer at Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome as they prepare for the task of selecting a new leader for the Catholic church. Bells rang and church faithful began gathering at the colonnaded square in front of the vast church in anticipation of the historic event.

Pope Francis left his mark on many aspects of the church. That is perhaps most evident now, as he appointed roughly 80% of those cardinals who will elect his successor. That is unique enough, but more striking is the make-up of those electors. 

This College of Cardinals is the most geographically and racially diverse ever assembled. Francis, the first Latin American pontiff, was keenly aware of the need for agency among the broader congregation of the global church. 

This conclave is the first in the history of the Catholic Church in which Europeans make up less than half of electors. Though most cardinals gathered are from Italy (17), followed by the US (10) and Brazil (7), Francis appointed 163 new cardinals from more than 70 countries during his time at the Holy See, many who had never been represented in the College of Cardinals. 

Though he appointed Latin American and Scandinavian cardinals, the greatest number of appointments came from Africa and Asia.

The selection of a new pope is a process veiled in secrecy. On Monday, officials, conclave staff and the College of Cardinals took an oath of secrecy regarding all matters related to the election.

All who swear the oath are bound to secrecy until death unless otherwise instructed by the new pope or his successors.

The rule, which also bans the use of any audio or video recording devices such as cellphones, derives from the ""Universi Dominici Gregis,"" or apostolic constitution, as proclaimed by Pope John Paul II on February 22, 1996. Failure to uphold the oath results in excommunication from the church. 

The deliberative selection process has no set time limit — meaning that it can be over quickly, as in the case of Francis, who was elected on the first day of voting in 2013, or can drag on for weeks or months.

The record for the longest-ever election process ended with the appointment of Gregory X in 1271 after three years of deliberation. It was Gregory who established the institution of the conclave in the papal bull ""Ubi periculum"" referring to the first words of the document and meaning ""where the great danger lies.""

The Catholic church's College of Cardinals has gathered at the Vatican in Rome, Italy, and will begin the process of electing a new pontiff to replace Pope Francis on Wednesday. 

Francis, the church's 266th pontiff, died on Easter Monday (April 21), after leading the church for 12 years.

Voting during the so-called papal conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel and is conducted by secret ballot. 

On Wednesday, 133 cardinals will begin the process with the traditional Holy Mass for the Election of the Pope (Pro Eligendo Romano Pontefice) at 10:00 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) in St.Peter's Basilica. 

At 10:30 a.m., they will gather to pray the Litany of Saints at the Apostolic Palace's Pauline Chapel before proceeding to the Sistine Chapel.

All voting cardinals, each a potential successor to Francis, swear an oath to fulfill the mission of Peter — the first leader of the Catholic church — known as the ""Munus Petrinium,"" should they be elected. 

The so-called Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies, then proclaims the famous Latin words ""extra omnes"" — everyone out — instructing those who are not voting to leave the Sistine Chapel immediately.  

The Preacher Emeritus of the Papal Household, Cardinal Raniero Cantalamessa, will then lead a second meditation attended by the cardinals and the Master of Liturgical Services. The two then leave the chapel, at which point the sequestered cardinal electors begin the quest to select a new leader amongst themselves.

The first ballots will be cast on Wednesday evening and, barring the the unlikely event that the conclave produces a winner on the first ballot, voting will continue four times each day until a new leader has been found. Subsequent votes will be held twice each morning and twice each evening until a new pontiff has been found.

Famously, ballots are burned after each round of voting. The smoke eminating from a special chimney installed in the chapel informs the outside world of the result, with black smoke indicating the failure to find a leader and white smoke letting the world know that a new pope has been found.

Many would like the next pope to come from either Asia or Africa. Like Francis, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Asia's largest Catholic nation, the Philippines, has embraced marginalized communities.

The death of Pope Francis sparked a renewed interest in the ""Conclave"" movie about the fictional election of a new pope.

The success of the Oscar-winning film — based on a best-selling book — has in turn ramped up interest in the real-life conclave taking place in the Vatican City.

DW takes a look at some of the parallels between Hollywood and the Holy See.

A major supporter of Palestinians in Gaza, Pope Francis declared in his last wishes that one of his popemobiles should be donated to the embattled strip to be used as a mobile clinic for children.

The so-called popemobiles are the vehicles the leaders of the Catholic Church have used over the years on papal visits to various countries and territories.

Read the full story on popemobile being donated to Gaza.

The 2025 conclave is less predictable than ever after Pope Francis shook up the Catholic Church during his years as pope. What will that mean for the election of his successor?

DW takes a deeper look at why it is so difficult to predict who will be the next pope.

The conclave process to choose the new pope is starting on Wednesday, but how does it work?

The eyes of the world will be fixed on the Vatican this Wednesday, as Catholic cardinals from around the world meet in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope.

The 133 cardinals, the so-called ""Princes of the Church,"" have all arrived in Rome.

Thank you for joining us on the first day of the conclave as cardinals meet to elect a pope who will be the spiritual head of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.

It is not known how long this conclave will last, nor who is the favorite to become the new pontiff, however, many are wondering whether the church will get its first Asian or African pope.

People will also be waiting to see if Pope Francis' successor will maintain his progressive trajectory or whether a more conservative pope will take his place.

Two weeks after a deadly terror attack in the disputed Kashmir region, India has fired missiles into Pakistan. The Indian government claims that it carried out nine “precision strikes at terrorist camps” in Kashmir. Pakistan claims to have shot down several Indian jets and is threatening an imminent retaliation against India.

The escalation of tensions is unsurprising. As soon as the April 22 terror attack took place, Indian officials deemed Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba culpable and accused the country's authorities of complicity. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif angrily rejected these accusations and urged the US to steer India towards a course of de-escalation. These recommendations were not heeded by New Delhi.

Now that India and Pakistan are on an escalation course, the big question is what comes next? If you're an optimist, history suggests that a swift de-escalation could be on the cards. The 1999 Kargil War provides a precedent for this scenario. In May 1999, Pakistani troops disguised as Kashmiri militants launched incursions into India's side of the Line of Control. After over 1,000 casualties on both sides, India recaptured Kargil in June 1999. The war was followed by numerous tit-for-tat attacks in the years that followed. Nevertheless, these escalations did not trigger a major war between nuclear-armed powers in South Asia.

Despite these sanguine historical precedents, there are reasons to believe that this conflict is more dangerous. The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty had institutionalised water resource sharing from the Indus region's six major rivers and served as a crisis-proof agent of de-escalation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pausing of this treaty removed this guardrail. Although India lacks the dam and reservoir infrastructure to store large amounts of additional water, Modi appears to be determined to cut off Pakistan's access to water resources from the Indus region. This resolve is interpreted in Islamabad as a non-negotiable act of war.

Domestic politics in Pakistan and India also favours conflict. Since the ousting of Prime Minister Imran Khan in April 2022, Pakistan has faced riots and uneven civil-military relations. As the de-escalation of the Kargil War paved the way for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's exit and General Pervez Musharaff's coup d'etat, Pakistan's leadership might be hesitant to swiftly sue for peace. Meanwhile, Modi's frequent painting of the rival Congress Party as soft on Pakistan and linkage of anti-Pakistan rhetoric to his populist appeal adds another domestic layer of escalation.

The simultaneous escalation of US-China tensions adds a further layer of complication to the India-Pakistan conflict. Due to the 3,000km China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which was inaugurated in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping views Pakistan as a core strategic partner. Under Trump's leadership, the US has weathered a tariff war with India and pursued closer relations with New Delhi. While neither the US nor China benefits from open war in South Asia, these polarisations could prevent them from supporting de-escalation in a unified manner.

Over the past three years, the world has watched with bated breath as Russia threatened nuclear Armageddon against Ukraine and the West. The incipient India-Pakistan conflict takes the risk of an apocalyptic clash between nuclear powers to new heights.

Texas school districts have banned hundreds of titles over the past few years, leading the country in banning books.

Over the past weekend, several candidates in suburban Texas school districts who opposed book bans won their elections, defeating conservative officials who had supported and implemented such policies in recent years.

Book bans in the Lone Star State have largely targeted titles with LGBTQ themes, Black or Brown characters, or authors of the same backgrounds. In the 2022-23 academic year alone, around 625 books were banned within the state. The year prior, the state banned over 800 books, the highest number of book bans in the country.

Local elections were held throughout Texas this past weekend, including school board races featuring incumbent candidates who supported such policies. In many of those contests, voters chose to remove far right leaders who had pushed hardest for book bans.

In the Mansfield Independent School District (ISD), just outside of Dallas and Fort Worth, the board president, board secretary and another board member were all handily defeated by local candidates opposed to book bans. Ana-Alicia Horn, a data management professional, defeated Keziah Valdes Farrar, the incumbent board president who was backed by a far right mobile phone company called Patriot Mobile, attaining more than 60 percent of support from voters.

Mansfield ISD had watered down its book ban policies in 2023 in response to public outcry, but the new plan still blocked children from accessing multiple titles, shifting decisions on banning titles to a committee appointed by the school board that would review any complaint brought up by residents in the district.

On Saturday, Horn celebrated her victory, which came in large part from constituents opposed to book bans.

“Thank you to every voter, volunteer, and supporter who believed in a vision rooted in transparency, collaboration, and putting students first,” Horn wrote in a victory message. “I'm excited to get to work on behalf of ALL families in our district, and I promise to lead with integrity, accountability, and heart.”

Elections in Katy ISD, just outside of Houston, saw incumbent board president Victor Perez defeated by former principal James Cross. In addition to pushing for book bans (including pressuring a committee in the district to reconsider books it had already deemed acceptable), Perez supported a right-wing policy in the district to inform parents if their children asked teachers to use pronouns that differed from the gender they were assigned at birth, essentially outing kids without their permission. Such policies can often result in harm to children, who may have parents with transphobic views.

Cross, who campaigned on a platform of being a former educator “with a heart,” also promised to make the board more collaborative and less motivated by partisanship. 

“My hope is that you see a shift (from politics) pretty quickly,” he said after his victory.

And in the Fort Bend ISD elections, Rick Garcia, a board member and backer of one of the state's “most restrictive” book ban policies, was defeated by business owner and community organizer Afhi Charania. 

Charania made the issue of book bans central to her campaign, addressing bans on her website.

“Book banning doesn't protect students. It limits them,” Charania wrote, adding:

These policies risk isolating vulnerable students, compromising educator autonomy, and prioritizing control over compassion.

Book bans are unpopular across the country. Frank Strong, a Texas-based blogger and teacher, called the elections this past weekend a “drubbing” of candidates who support such policies. 

“I've been covering Texas school board elections for seven cycles, and as I have documented over and over again, book bans, attacks on educators and public schools, and attempts to target LGBTQ students do not fare well at the polls,” Strong wrote on his Substack page.

“Voters across Texas clearly and consistently punished the people who have been restricting students' reading and learning,” Strong added. “They delivered a message: Texans are sick of book bans, sick of attacks on educators and librarians, sick of leaders waging culture war battles at the expense of good governance.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

“They are terminating people's financial lives,” the former Social Security Administration commissioner says.

Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.

They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom “there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.” So employees have to “resurrect” them — affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.

Revivals were “sporadic” before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Donald Trump's second term.

Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Joe Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. “In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,” he said.

It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead “impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.”

“They are terminating people's financial lives,” O'Malley said.

Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.

Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to “self-deport.”

Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. “Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?” he said.

The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.

But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.

Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer — whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record — believes they could be zero.

Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.

Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.

The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, “then she will be homeless,” Seda recalled telling an agency employee. “I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.”

Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, “it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,” the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.

While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.

For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to National Academy of Social Insurance survey results published in January.

Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.

Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. “For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,” she said. “The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.”

When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Trump's “resounding mandate” to make government more efficient.

“He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,” Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.

Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.

A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security — which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 — had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.

Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.

“We're seeing more mistakes being made,” said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. “We're seeing more things get dropped.”

What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.

She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem — only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.

Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored — the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.

“To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,” the lawyer said.

Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.

Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. “As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,” he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. “It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.”

The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which “the problems surface first,” Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, “those things languish.”

Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.

Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks “just sit there.”

Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and “those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,” putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.

Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. “There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,” said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.

The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. “It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,” he said.

The news heightens concerns that the administration is pushing the independent mail agency toward privatization.

President Donald Trump and the U.S. Postal Service's leadership have reportedly agreed to appoint a FedEx board member to succeed Louis DeJoy as postmaster general, heightening concerns that the administration is pushing the independent mail agency toward privatization.

The Washington Post reported late Tuesday that Trump and the USPS Board of Governors are expected to name former Waste Management CEO David Steiner to lead the Postal Service. Steiner is currently the lead independent director at FedEx, a Postal Service competitor.

Brian Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers — a union representing nearly 300,000 active and retired letter carriers — called the decision to place Steiner at the head of the USPS “an aggressive step toward handing America's mail system over to corporate interests.”

“Private shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years,” said Renfroe. “Steiner's selection is an open invitation to do just that. This isn't just bad policy — it's a direct assault on the workers who keep the mail moving and the public connected. The damage will hit rural communities hardest, where the Postal Service isn't just a convenience — it's a lifeline. And make no mistake: If this appointment stands, it threatens 7.9 million jobs tied to the postal industry and service to over 300 million Americans.”

“The board has the responsibility to do what is best for USPS,” he added. “This decision is not only a failure in that responsibility but shows open contempt for the work of America's letter carriers and the public good.”

The USPS Board of Governors — which is currently comprised of two Democrats, two Republicans, and an independent — is ultimately responsible for appointing the head of the mail service, who cannot be directly fired by the president.

The Post reported Tuesday that postal governors, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, submitted three postmaster general finalists to the White House in recent days, including Steiner.

“Trump has the power to immediately reshape the [postal board] with five appointments: The board has four vacancies, plus a seat that is occupied temporarily,” the Post noted. “Trump announced plans to nominate Anthony Lomangino, a GOP financier, to one of those roles.”

Earlier this year, Trump considered but soon dropped a plan to fire every member of the postal board and bring the USPS under the direct control of his administration. The president has also spoken openly about privatizing the mail service, saying in the wake of his 2024 election win that “it's an idea that a lot of people have liked for a long time.”

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement Tuesday that “the Trump administration has been relentless in its attempts to privatize America's most trusted institution, both outwardly and behind the scenes.”

“If these reports are true, it is a blatant conflict of interest and an attempt by President Trump to install a handpicked loyalist who he believes will put his interests over what may be best for the Postal Service and the American people,” Connolly said of Steiner's selection. “The American people deserve a postmaster general who will stand up for an independent, fair, and accessible Postal Service and who will work with Congress to ensure Americans in all communities nationwide can continue to rely on this public service to deliver mail, medications, ballots, and more without prejudice.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

A legal watchdog group founded by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has filed a lawsuit against Supreme Court Justice John Roberts and former District Judge Robert Conrad over their alleged refusal to honor Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

Chief Justice Roberts heads the Judicial Conference, and Judge Conrad is director of the Administrative Office. Both are being sued in their official capacity as leaders of these organizations.

The Judicial Conference is a group of committees that meets twice a year to make policy for the federal court system; it is always headed by the sitting Chief Justice. The Administrative Office “handles the nonjudicial, administrative business of the United States Courts such as maintaining statistics and managing Court budgets,” according to its website.

America First said in court documents that Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) consulted with these two groups in an attempt to implicate Justices Thomas and Alito of ethics violations.

In July 2024, Whitehouse asked then-Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate Justice Thomas for a string of other violations going back to 1991, including tax fraud and failing to disclose gifts like sports tickets and air travel. Previous inquiries had already cleared Thomas of any willful wrongdoing.

America First asserts that since the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office cooperated in these Congressional oversight maneuvers, which “are the province of the executive branch,” they are executive agencies, and subject to FOIA transparency.

America First submitted FOIA requests to the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office in July 2024, asking for all records relating to Justices Thomas and Alito, and any communications with Sen. Sheldon, Rep. Johnson, or their staff since April 2023.

The Administrative Office and an attorney for the Supreme Court both declined to honor the requests, saying that FOIA only applies to the executive branch of the government, not the judicial or legislative branches.

Even if the Administrative Office were subject to FOIA, the requested records “would not be releasable,” as those specific documents are exempt from FOIA requests, the Supreme Court's attorney said.

A spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the United States Courts said the organization cannot comment on pending lawsuits.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Columbia University announced on Tuesday that it will lay off nearly 180 staff members after the Trump administration revoked more than $400 million in federal research funding, Columbia's Office of the President said in a May 6 statement.

The layoffs, which represent about 20 percent of university employees who were funded by the now-terminated federal grants, come as Columbia grapples with the fallout from the U.S. Department of Education's decision to cancel hundreds of millions in grants and contracts.

The department cited the university's alleged failure to adequately address persistent anti-Semitism on campus as the reason for the funding withdrawal.

“Across the research portfolio, we have had to make difficult choices and unfortunately, today, nearly 180 of our colleagues who have been working, in whole or in part, on impacted federal grants, will receive notices of non-renewal or termination,” the statement read.

The university said it has been engaged in a two-pronged effort in response to the funding crisis. First, it is working to restore partnerships with federal agencies that support critical research. Second, it has asked deans and principal investigators to prioritize research activities and develop plans for managing projects affected by the loss of federal support.

During the review period, Columbia continued to pay salaries and stipends for those whose compensation had been covered by the terminated grants, according to the press release.

Columbia's leadership said they are continuing discussions with federal officials in hopes of resuming activity on the canceled research awards and other projects that remain active but unpaid.

They said the financial strain is “intense,” and the university has been forced to reduce expenditures and scale back research infrastructure in some areas. Some departments are winding down activity but are prepared to reestablish capabilities if funding is restored, according to the university.

The funding revocation follows President Donald Trump's Executive Order 14188, signed on Jan. 29, which directs federal agencies to use all available legal tools to prosecute and hold accountable those accused of anti-Semitic harassment and violence on college campuses.

The Department of Education launched investigations into several universities, including Columbia, where “widespread antisemitic harassment has been reported.”

The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, which includes the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and the General Services Administration, has been reviewing Columbia's compliance with federal regulations, particularly under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs.

In response to the crisis, Columbia has established a Research Stabilization Fund to help mitigate future funding risks and support its scientific community. The fund will provide internal grants to scientists seeking alternate sources of funding or completing research for publication. The university will also contribute funds to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows affected by the loss of federal training grants, according to the press release.

“We are grateful for the exceptional leadership and professionalism of our deans, chairs, and senior management who have come together to navigate this critical moment with care and integrity, while upholding and advancing Columbia's mission, values, and the unique qualities that make this a vital, extraordinary place,” the statement said.

The university warned that further actions may be necessary in the coming months to preserve financial flexibility and invest in key areas.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

In the run-up to World War II, the United States had become dangerously overdependent on foreign imports of critical minerals and metals—even though officials had warned about the supply chain's vulnerabilities for a decade. Congress passed an act creating the National Defense Stockpile in 1939. But when the United States went to war a year later, the scale and urgency of its immediate defense needs still vastly exceeded its domestic mining and production facilities as well as its new stockpile.

President Franklin Roosevelt had to rush to shift control of the stockpile to a newly created agency—the Metals Reserve Company, run by civilian industrialists—that scoured the globe to buy or barter for whatever it could from wherever it could at whatever cost. To sustain the war economy, government agencies and private industry also expanded U.S. domestic mining and refining operations, engineered synthetic material substitutes, and funded technological advances to improve mines' efficiency and productivity. Although the United States went on to decisively win the war, the country's lack of preparedness led to excess emergency spending as it struggled to outbid the Axis powers for critical materials and costly delays in ramping up the production of tanks, aircraft, and munitions. Washington had to rely on risky and untested foreign sources for minerals and metals and use shipping routes vulnerable to attack.

Today, the United States finds itself in a similar position as it was in the late 1930s. Government officials and independent analysts have long understood that the United States is again dangerously overdependent on foreign adversaries, mainly China, for critical minerals, metals, and rare-earth elements. These resources—which are key inputs in advanced technologies, energy infrastructure, and defense systems—play a vital role in the United States' peacetime economy and national security. Over the past decade, Washington has taken some meaningful steps to address the country's supply chain vulnerabilities.

Yet these efforts remain too modest. Should a serious conflict between the United States and China escalate in, for example, the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea, China could plausibly shut off all of its exports of critical materials to the United States and its allies alike. Unlike in 1940, the United States' current key military adversary is the same country that produces the great majority of the minerals and rare-earth elements necessary to scale up the manufacturing of defense systems and advanced technology—and controls up to 90 percent of the world's processing of these materials.

In the meantime, over the past 15 years, Beijing has shown that it is willing to use its near monopoly over the provision and refinement of strategic resources to punish its adversaries. In 2010, for instance, China cut off its exports of certain rare-earth elements to Japan because of a dispute over what it refers to as the Diaoyu Islands (known in Japan as the Senkaku Islands). China has restricted exports of key critical minerals, rare-earth elements, and proprietary refining technologies to the United States in retaliation against export controls and tariffs levied by the Biden and Trump administrations. Absent an urgent response today to “de-risk” its supply chains, the United States may have no way to adequately address China's chokehold tomorrow.

After the Cold War ended, the U.S. Defense Department determined that 99 percent of its national defense stockpile of critical minerals and rare-earth elements—which, at its peak, was worth nearly $42 billion (inflation-adjusted)—was surplus. So the Defense Department sold it off, switching to just-in-time global sourcing. Over the next three decades, Washington's complacency and Beijing's strategic ambition to dominate the full supply chain for critical minerals and rare-earth elements gave China a global mining footprint and a near monopoly in the refinement and processing of those materials. Beijing invested in mines in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and built its own domestic mining, refining, production, and recycling facilities at a lower cost than American companies could manage, especially because they faced fewer environmental and labor-related barriers. China also developed proprietary technologies to improve efficiency and productivity, including cutting-edge end-use products such as batteries, turbines, and weapons.

China's subsidized investments drove many market-based competitors into closure or bankruptcy. Today, China's giant mining and refining companies operate without much pressure to remain commercially viable, unbound by many constraints on firms funded by private investors and lenders. As a result, Chinese mining companies can flood the market, depressing global commodity prices and further undermining commercial projects.

Recognizing the United States' vulnerability to a rising and adversarial China, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders to secure greater resilience across mining exploration, extraction, refining, production, and recycling. President Joe Biden subsequently launched a whole-of-government assessment of supply chain resilience during his first 100 days in office and invested yet more government funding into the critical mineral supply chain as new funds became available. Most of this investment utilized Department of Energy grant or loan programs and the 1950 Defense Production Act. That act allows the president to give domestic, Canadian, and (more recently) Australian companies grants, loans and loan guarantees, and purchase commitments to reopen old mines or develop new ones, build new refining and recycling facilities, and support the production of batteries.



These moves by Washington funded the first U.S. producer of battery-grade manganese, the first fully integrated rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, scale-ups in the mining and production of lithium, and the expansion of the graphite supply chain. The Biden administration used government funds to support R & D into extracting materials from nontraditional sources such as mining waste and engineering new substitute materials; it also supported the early-stage commercialization of these new technologies. And Biden launched the Minerals Security Partnership with trusted allies to further secure and co-finance diversified supply chains.

In his second term, Trump has already signed several executive orders creating a more centralized critical minerals strategy under the new National Energy Dominance Council, expediting the permitting of new mining and refining projects, opening federal land to new mining, and expanding industrial-policy investment tools. The first of these executive orders acknowledged that the United States' “national and economic security are now acutely threatened” by its “reliance upon hostile foreign powers' mineral production.” He has also sought to secure overseas deposits of critical materials, targeting the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Greenland, and Ukraine. But the steps both Biden and Trump took will not be enough. Trump's unilateral style is putting the future of Biden's Minerals Security Partnership at risk, as partnerships require trust. But trade negotiations with resource-rich allies may secure more opportunities to co-finance mining, refining, and downstream production of magnets and batteries. At the end of the day, there are a limited number of countries with the geological assets to help secure contemporary critical-materials supply chains, and the Trump administration must determine how best to engage with them. Yet the United States must do more than mine and refine. Washington can catch up, but only if it also ramps up stockpiling for both defense and critical civilian needs; employs innovative new financial tools to protect U.S. commercial investments; introduces policies and funding to encourage development of a robust recycling industry for critical minerals and rare-earth elements; and more fully supports research and development.

The most immediately achievable task is to strengthen the National Defense Stockpile. As of early 2023, the NDS held just $1.3 billion in assets, including $912 million worth of stockpiled minerals—barely enough to meet half of the Pentagon's estimated requirements and only a tenth of what is needed for critical civilian infrastructure. The shortfall: $13.5 billion. In the short term, Congress should appropriate at least the full $13.5 billion to close this funding gap, addressing both defense and civilian industrial deficits and prioritizing storing the minerals most vulnerable to Chinese weaponization.

In practice, the stockpile should offer a fixed price floor for a fixed period each month to purchase domestically sourced materials, which would provide U.S. producers more price certainty. After that fixed period, to save U.S. taxpayers' money, it should have flexibility to source and purchase at the lowest available price on the global market, taking advantage of Chinese dumping and global commodity price gluts. Washington's medium-term aim should be to restore the NDS to its Cold War scale until its supply chains become less vulnerable.



Expanding the functions of the NDS is a first step to protect against Chinese nonmarket practices. But large, state-subsidized Chinese companies not only dominate the supply of critical minerals and rare-earth elements. They control their pricing, and compared with other commodities such as crude oil, the prices for many critical minerals and most rare-earth elements are illiquid and opaque. Unless private exchanges begin to offer adequate price clarity and reasonable hedging tools, the United States must deploy new financial tools so that market-based mining and refining companies can hedge against Chinese dumping and price illiquidity. The U.S. government already uses the Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation to play a similar function in 22 agricultural commodity markets, protecting American farmers from the consequences of price volatility when prices fall below a guaranteed level.In 2024, two Democratic and two Republican senators proposed the Critical Materials Future Act to support domestic critical material processing. If passed, the legislation would empower the Department of Energy to start pilot programs to provide price floors, advanced market commitments, or forward contracts to eligible projects that refine, process, or recycle raw critical materials into purified forms suitable for first-use applications. With that increased price certainty, companies could plan better and more easily secure debt and equity financing. The bill would also create a Critical Materials Revolving Fund at the Treasury Department that reinvests proceeds from recovered prices into new projects.

But if Congress cannot pass such legislation, it still has options. It could authorize the Strategic Materials Division at the Defense Department's Defense Logistics Agency, which currently manages the NDS, to deploy these same tools under guidance from the Energy and Treasury Departments. Ramping up the financial capacities of the agency already responsible for the purchase, sale, storage, and management of critical minerals and rare-earth elements could better align the NDS's management with a broader industrial policy. Other government institutions could also be afforded expanded mandates and new financial instruments. These should support the domestic development of critical materials supply chains and protect market-based businesses through equity purchases, loans or loan guarantees, or other credit instruments that counter Chinese competition. Trump's first executive order on U.S. mineral production envisions expanding the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's authority to fund domestic critical mineral projects. Because the DFC is set for reauthorization later this year, Congress is already contemplating broadening its scope, size, and available financial tools.

Shoring up the United States' access to raw materials is only one part of the puzzle. Regardless of their origin, most critical minerals and nearly all rare-earth elements are sent to China for refining and processing. This chokepoint is the Achilles' heel of the entire supply chain. The Trump administration should prioritize expanding U.S. refining capacity over supporting new mining. But because refineries are water-intensive, can pose environmental hazards, and are often located near indigenous lands, permitting new refineries would remain difficult and time-consuming, even if contemplated reforms are implemented.

Recycling offers a partial but powerful solution that should feature more in Trump's proposals. Unlike fossil fuels, many critical minerals and rare-earth elements can be recovered from used electronics, batteries, and even weapons systems. Although current recycling methods cannot generate enough strategic materials to replace those produced by new mines and processing facilities, recycling can create a key secondary source. In 2022, for instance, the Defense Logistics Agency launched a program to recover germanium—an element needed for high-tech, military, and energy-related applications—from retired weapons systems and night-vision equipment. Two years later, this effort helped fill a dangerous gap when China banned germanium exports to the United States. In the coming years, the DLA recycling program is expected to yield ten percent of the U.S. defense industry's germanium needs.

But the United States' capacity to recycle strategic resources continues to lag behind China's. For example, Beijing mandates that battery producers take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products, including recycling. The European Union has also implemented a recycling mandate for battery producers. Washington should follow suit and more intentionally incorporate recycling into its resilience strategy. The Defense Department could be required to recycle more military waste products that could yield critical minerals, metals, and rare-earth elements. The Department of Energy has recommended that the government adopt end-of-life recycling requirements for batteries similar to those imposed by China and the EU, but for this to happen, Washington must better support the development of private-sector recycling infrastructure that can help reduce costs.

Ultimately, the United States needs to invest more in the kind of technological innovation in which it has already excelled. U.S. companies have extracted lithium from brine deposits in Chile for decades, but more recently, government-funded innovation has supported extraction from geothermal brine in California. Newer technologies are enabling commercially viable lithium extraction from oil and gas fracking wastewater, unlocking an enormous and previously overlooked domestic resource. Companies are actively exploring methods to recover rare-earth elements from coal and coal byproducts, too, turning environmental liabilities into strategic opportunities. Government labs and universities are spinning out startups working on revolutionary processes for recovering and extracting critical materials.

In fact, advances in battery chemistry could eventually reduce the United States' need for certain minerals altogether. Newer lithium iron phosphate batteries, for example, require less cobalt than older designs; sodium-ion batteries could further diminish the need for lithium and nickel. Materials engineering breakthroughs enabled by AI may identify new compounds or substitutes for traditional inputs that may upend today's assumptions about what resources are critical at all.But the innovations that could transform U.S. supply chains require much more capital and policy support, including more government funding for labs and universities studying materials engineering, grants for demonstration projects, support for startups on their way to commercial viability, and policy signals that Washington is ready to pursue a comprehensive resilience strategy. There is broad bipartisan agreement that the United States must secure its access to critical minerals and rare-earth elements. There is no time for incremental improvements. The United States' intensifying rivalry with China, growing instability in the Indo-Pacific, and the trend toward economic decoupling all mean that Washington must take urgent action. As in 1940, the moment calls for both speed and ambition. A national critical minerals strategy that expands U.S. stockpiles, creates new financial tools to support domestic mining and refining, deploys rapid support for recycling, and supports new technologies can once again ensure that America's industrial base is ready for any challenge.

 Antony Beevor

History is seldom tidy. Eras overlap and unfinished business from one period lingers into the next. World War II was a war like no other in the magnitude of its effects on the lives of people and the fates of nations. It was a combination of many conflicts, including ethnic and national hatreds that followed the collapse of four empires and the redrawing of borders at the Paris Peace Conference after World War I. A number of historians have argued that World War II was a phase of one long war lasting from 1914 to 1945 or even until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991—a global civil war, first between capitalism and communism, then between democracy and dictatorship.

World War II certainly brought the strands of world history together, with its global reach and its acceleration of the end of colonialism across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Yet despite sharing this international experience, and entering the same order built in its wake, every country involved created and clung to its own narrative of the great conflict.

Even the matter of when the war began is still debated. In the American telling, it started in earnest when the United States entered the conflict after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the German dictator Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States a few days later. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, insists that the war began in June 1941, when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union—ignoring the joint Soviet and Nazi invasion of Poland in September 1939, which marks the start of the war for most Europeans. Yet some trace its origin back further still. For China, it began in 1937, with the Sino-Japanese War, or even earlier with the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931. Many on the left in Spain are convinced that it began in 1936 with General Francisco Franco's overthrow of the republic, launching the Spanish Civil War.

These clashing worldviews remain a source of tension and instability in global politics. Putin cherry-picks from Russian history, combining homage to Soviet sacrifice in the “Great Patriotic War,” as World War II is known in Russia, with the reactionary ideas of exiled tsarist White Russians after their defeat by the communist Reds in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22. The latter include religious justifications for Russian supremacy over the entire Eurasian landmass—“from Vladivostok to Dublin,” as Putin's ideologue Aleksandr Dugin has put it—and a deeply rooted hatred of liberal western Europe. Such ideas have also begun to circulate within U.S. President Donald Trump's orbit.

Putin has rehabilitated the World War II–era Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who, as the Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov has said, was directly responsible for even more millions of deaths than Hitler. The Russian president goes so far as to insist that the Soviet Union could have won the war against Nazi Germany on its own when even Stalin and other Soviet leaders privately acknowledged that the Soviet Union would not have survived without American aid. They also knew that the U.S.-British strategic bombing campaign against German cities forced the bulk of the German Luftwaffe back home from the eastern front, thus giving the Soviets air supremacy. Above all Putin refuses to acknowledge the horrors of the Stalinist era. As Mary Soames, the daughter of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, recounted to me at a dinner in 2003, Churchill asked Stalin during an informal meeting in October 1944 what the Soviet leader regretted most in his life. Stalin took a moment to reflect before he quietly answered, “The killing of the kulaks”—the landowning peasants. This campaign peaked with the Holodomor in 1932–33, in which Stalin deliberately inflicted famine on Ukraine, killing more than three million people and instilling a hatred of Moscow among many survivors and their descendants.

World War II also produced an often uneasy balance between Europe and the United States. Hitler's hegemonic ambitions forced the United Kingdom to abandon its self-appointed role of world policeman and turn to the Americans for aid. The British were genuinely proud of their part in the ultimate Allied victory, but they tried to hide the sting of their declining global influence by spouting the cliché that the United Kingdom had managed to “punch above its weight” in the war and by clinging to their “special relationship” with the United States. Churchill was dismayed by the prospect that U.S. troops might simply go home after the war in the Pacific ended in 1945. Although American attitudes continued to fluctuate between seeking an active global role and retreating into isolationism, the threat from Moscow ensured that Washington would remain deeply engaged in Europe until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Today, the first major continental war in Europe since World War II is in its fourth year, driven in part by Putin's selective reading of Russian history, while deadly conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere threaten to spread further. The Trump administration, meanwhile, appears to be casting aside the United States' global leadership in a confused tantrum. Eighty years ago, the end of World War II paved the way for a new international order based on respect for national sovereignty and borders. But now, a steep bill for American ambivalence, European complacency, and Russian revanchism may finally be coming due.

The sheer cruelty of World War II was seared into the memories of several generations. It was the first modern conflict in which far more civilians were killed than combatants. This could have been made possible only by an ideologically fueled dehumanization of the enemy—nationalism stirred to a fever pitch and racism promoted as a virtue on one side, and Leninist class warfare that endorsed exterminating all opposition on the other. (Tellingly, after the war, Soviet diplomats fought to prevent class warfare—which would have included the Soviet Union's mass killing of aristocrats, bourgeoisie, and land-owning peasants—from being mentioned in the United Nations' 1948 Genocide Convention.)

In all, some 85 million people died in World War II, a figure that includes those who perished from famine and disease. Nazi Germany killed around six million Jews, among other people, in the Holocaust. Almost a fifth of the Polish population, also nearly six million people, was lost. The Chinese lost well over 20 million, more of whom perished from famine and disease than from fighting on the battlefield. Estimates of Soviet deaths range from 24 million to 26 million, many of them needless. Stalin was aware in 1945 that the total exceeded 20 million, but he owned up to just a third of that loss as he tried to conceal the extent of the horror he had unleashed on his people. The international relations scholar David Reynolds has noted that Stalin “settled for 7.5 million as a figure that sounded suitably heroic, but not criminally homicidal.”



It is not enough to remember the dead, many of whom were deliberately rendered nameless by their killers. For those who survived, the prisoners of war and the civilians imprisoned in camps, the conflict changed life in incalculable ways. Those resigned to their lots were often early victims. The most likely survivors were those with a burning determination to return to their families, to hold on to their beliefs, or to bear witness to unspeakable crimes.

Many other captured soldiers did not make it home. Those from the Soviet Red Army who had been forcibly recruited by the German military were rounded up while in German uniform in France and handed over to Soviet officers, who executed suspected leaders in the woods before transporting the rest back to the Soviet Union. There, the soldiers were sentenced to slave labor in the frozen north. Just days after Germany's surrender, British forces in Austria ordered that more than 20,000 anticommunist Yugoslav nationals in the area under their jurisdiction be handed over to communist Yugoslav authorities, who shot and then buried them in mass graves. British forces also handed over to Soviet authorities Cossacks who were Soviet citizens but had fought for Germany. The British government almost certainly knew that a harsh sentence awaited these soldiers but feared that letting them go would mean the Soviet authorities would hold on to British prisoners of war that the Red Army had liberated in Poland and eastern Germany. The Red Army also rounded up 600,000 Japanese soldiers in northern China and Manchuria; all of them were sent to labor camps in Siberia and worked to death.

For decades after the war, its memory lived on in those who had experienced it firsthand. The postwar order was shaped by generations whose aim was to prevent such a tragedy from ever occurring again. But for those who did not experience the conflict and look back from today, the casualty count of World War II may be just a figure—it is difficult to truly absorb the reality of tens of millions of deaths. Losing this direct connection to the past means losing the shared resolve that for 80 years has produced an unbroken, if highly imperfect, great-power peace.

The war left the world an entirely changed place. In the combatant nations, few lives were left untouched. Many women whose fiancés were killed in action never married or had children. Others found that returning men could not cope with the reality that women had taken over the running of everything, making the men feel redundant. The backlash was strongest in continental Europe. In Germany, men who had been imprisoned during the war heard for the first time of the mass rapes committed mainly by the Red Army. They felt humiliated that they had not been there to defend their women. Nor could they handle learning that the women had dealt with the trauma in the only way possible—by talking to each other about it. In France and other occupied countries, men who returned from prison camps and forced labor in Germany wondered how women without any means of support had managed to survive and began to suspect them of relationships with enemy soldiers or black marketeers. Not surprisingly, these responses produced a socially reactionary period that lasted through the 1940s and 1950s.

Intense political conflict persisted even after the end of hostilities. In August 1945, well after the fighting in the European theater had ended, the Soviet Union began to release ordinary Italian soldiers it had captured in the latter part of the Axis powers' campaign to take Stalingrad. These soldiers were sent home without their officers, however, because the leader of the Italian Communist Party had appealed to Moscow to delay the return of higher-ranking prisoners who might publicly condemn the Soviet Union and hurt the party's chances in upcoming elections. Communist groups gathered at railway stations in Italy to welcome the returning soldiers, whom they expected to be more sympathetic to their cause. They were appalled to see the soldiers had scrawled the words abbasso comunismo—down with communism—on the train cars, and fights broke out at the stations. The communist press labeled the returnees who criticized the Soviet Union in any way as fascists.



Borders were obliterated or redrawn during and after the war. Many people who had been displaced no longer knew their nationalities. Large populations, sometimes entire cities, were uprooted, evacuated, or killed by paramilitaries, secret police, and troops. In 1939, Poles from what suddenly became western Ukraine had been dumped in the deserted spaces of Kazakhstan or Siberia and left to starve. The Polish city of Lwow was occupied twice by the Soviets and once by the Nazis, who sent its Jews to death camps. After the war, Lwow was given a new Ukrainian name, Lviv. At the Yalta conference in February 1945, where British, Soviet, and U.S. leaders met to discuss the organization of postwar Europe, Stalin forced the Allied powers to accept that the whole of Poland was to be shifted to the west, receiving former German provinces on the western side while the Soviet Union absorbed Polish provinces to the east. To complete the execution of this plan, the Red Army carried out the largest systematic forced removal of a population in modern times, transplanting more than 13 million Germans, Poles, and Ukrainians.

As the discussions at Yalta continued at the Potsdam conference in August 1945, Stalin's desire to expand Soviet territory became clear. He showed interest in assuming control of former Italian colonies in Africa and suggested the removal of Franco in Spain. “It must be very pleasant for you to be in Berlin now after all your country has suffered,” Averell Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, remarked to Stalin during a break in the talks. Stalin eyed the ambassador without changing his expression. “Tsar Alexander went all the way to Paris,” he replied. The line was hardly a joke—the year before, the Soviet leadership had ordered plans to be drawn for an invasion of France and Italy and a seizure of the straits between Denmark and Norway. In 1945, Soviet General Sergei Shtemenko told Sergo Beria, whose father had been a feared Soviet secret police chief during the Stalin era, “It was expected that the Americans would abandon a Europe fallen into chaos, while Britain and France would be paralyzed by their colonial problems.” This, Soviet leaders thought, created an opening. Only on learning that the United States was close to building the atom bomb were the plans abandoned—even if Moscow's appetite for expansion was not.

World War II, of course, was also the dawn of the nuclear age. Many regarded the invention of the atom bomb with horror and considered the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be a war crime. And yet the targeting of those two Japanese cities in August 1945 involved a weighty moral choice. Before the bombings accelerated the end of the war, Japanese generals wanted to fight on rather than accept the terms of surrender issued by the Allied powers in the July 1945 Potsdam Declaration. They were prepared to sacrifice millions of Japanese civilians by forcing them to resist an Allied invasion with only bamboo spears and explosives strapped to their bodies. By 1944, some 400,000 civilians a month were dying from famine in areas of East Asia, the Pacific, and Southeast Asia that were occupied by Japanese forces. The Allies also wanted to save the American, Australian, and British prisoners of war who were starving to death in Japanese camps—or being slaughtered by their captors on Tokyo's orders. Thus, although the atomic bomb took more than 200,000 Japanese lives, that terrible weapon may have saved many more in an unsettling moral paradox.

For better or worse, World War II reset the trajectory of global politics. The defeat of Japan eventually paved the way for the rise of modern China. The collapse of the British, Dutch, and French empires in 1941–42 marked the end of imperial Europe, and the experience of the war spurred the movement toward European integration. Both the United States and the Soviet Union, meanwhile, were elevated to superpower status. World War II also produced the United Nations, whose key objectives were to safeguard the sovereignty of countries and to prohibit armed aggression and territorial conquest. The UN was very much U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt's dream, and he was prepared to let Stalin have complete control over Poland to achieve it. Yet in February of this year, the United States turned its back on the UN's founding principles, voting alongside Russia and refusing to condemn Russian aggression against Ukraine.

World War II also led into the Cold War. Some historians say that this new conflict started in 1947 with the Clay-Robertson agreement, in which British and U.S. authorities decided to industrialize western Germany, provoking Stalin's paranoia. That year certainly saw tensions intensify, with Stalin issuing an order in September for European communist parties to dig up their weapons in preparation for future war and setting the groundwork for the Soviet blockade of Berlin the next year. But the origins lay much further back, in June 1941. Stalin had been traumatized by Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union, which began that month. He became determined to surround himself with satellite states across central and southern Europe so that no invader could take the Soviet Union by surprise again.



For centuries, Russia had been obsessed with dominating its neighbors to prevent encirclement. Stalin's fixation was Poland. Putin has preserved this basic mentality—only for him, the country's most vulnerable frontier is Ukraine, which he argues belongs to Russia. When Putin acted on that claim with the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he brought back a characteristic of the World War II era that has largely been absent in global politics since. Leaders, several of them empowered by the totalitarian systems they controlled, shaped the course of that vast conflict. From Churchill to Roosevelt to Stalin, their machinations reactivated the idea in the popular imagination of the “great man” driving the course of history. In recent years, political leaders have had comparatively less influence. The globalized economic system, for one thing, greatly restricts their freedom of action, and constant consideration of how a decision will play in the media makes many of them more cautious than bold. For decades, it seemed as though the characters of leaders would never again determine the course of events the way they did in World War II. Putin's invasion has changed that, and Trump, taking Putin as a role model, has, too.

Today, as Russia prepares to celebrate Victory Day on May 9, Putin is determined to milk the story of his country's “Great Patriotic War” for all it's worth. He may well revert the name of the city of Volgograd to Stalingrad—it was changed in 1961 as part of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's de-Stalinization campaign—to highlight the Red Army's eventual victory over the Axis invaders in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the great psychological turning point of the war. He may also sharpen the worst of his historical distortions, attempting to justify his continued war in Ukraine by claiming that the Ukrainians are “Nazis,” contradicting his own insistence before the invasion that Ukrainians were no different from Russians.

In truth, there is no one set of conclusions to draw from World War II. The war defies generalization and does not fit into easy categories. It contains countless stories of tragedy, corruption, hypocrisy, egomania, betrayal, impossible choices, and unbelievable sadism. But it also contains stories of self-sacrifice and compassion, in which people clung to a fundamental belief in humanity despite appalling conditions and overwhelming oppression. Their example will always be worth remembering and emulating, no matter how dark today's conflicts become.

The vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board has been abruptly removed from his position, the White House confirmed Tuesday, a rare move that comes as the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters juggles more than 1,000 cases.

The Trump administration removed Alvin Brown a little more than a year after he was sworn in for a term that was expected to end in 2026. The White House didn't say why he was removed and Brown has not publicly commented.

The decision comes as NTSB investigates nearly 1,250 active cases across the U.S., while supporting more than 160 foreign investigations, according to March testimony by NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy.

The investigations include the deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people in January and the medical transport plane that plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood that same month, killing eight people. It's also investigating the catastrophic collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge in March 2024, which killed six construction workers.

Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said he has never seen an administration remove a member of the board.

Board members have been known to stay on after their term is over if the administration hasn't appointed anyone yet and then they leave once the next administration selects someone else, he said.




“That happens a lot over the years, but that's normal and expected because you served your term and now it's time for someone else to serve in there,” he said. “But this wasn't that. This was just more abrupt and directly from the administration, and I don't know what the impetus is.”

By Tuesday evening, Brown's photo and biography had already been removed from NTSB's website. 

The agency includes five board members who serve five year terms, according to the NTSB website. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The chairman and vice chairman are both designated by the president and serve for three years. By Tuesday evening, the website only showed four members of the board.

Brown was sworn in as a member of the board in April 2024 after being nominated by then-President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to fill one of two vacancies. His term was expected to run through 2026, according to an NTSB press release at the time. He was the only Black member of the board.

He was the mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, from 2011 to 2015 and joined the board after serving as senior adviser for community infrastructure opportunities for the U.S. Department of Transportation, according to the release.

The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators.

It typically works on about 2,200 domestic and 450 foreign cases each year, according to Homendy. She said she expects “the number of cases annually to remain high and continue to increase in complexity.”

The agency has been excluded from the deferred resignation program and probationary employee cuts to downsize the federal workforce. Homendy often presents NTSB as a lean agency “that plays a vital role in ensuring public safety and protection of life and property,” although she did ask for modest budget increases last year and this year.

The deadline to get a REAL ID is almost here, after nearly two decades of postponements and delays.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most airports around the United States operated smoothly Wednesday as new REAL ID requirements took effect because travelers without the updated document were still allowed to move through security easily.

Those without the IDs were given flyers informing them that going forward they would need to present REAL ID or other federally accepted ID for air travel within the U.S.

“The ID you presented is NOT REAL ID-compliant,” the flyer reads. “You will need a REAL ID or other acceptable form of identification for your next flight or you may expect delays.”

It includes a QR code travelers can use to see a list of acceptable identifications. 

At Philadelphia International Airport, a TSA agent was pre-checking travelers' IDs as they entered the security check line. Agents had flyers ready for those who didn't have compliant IDs, according to Philadelphia Department of Aviation spokesperson Heather Redfern.

Many airports reported wait times of a few minutes at security checkpoints on their websites on Wednesday morning, although some had longer waits. LaGuardia Airport reported no wait at one TSA PreCheck checkpoint and wait times ranging from 2 to 11 minutes in the general lines. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website showed wait times at its security checkpoints ranging from 5 to 16 minutes.

Nashville International Airport reported a wait time of less than 20 minutes on Wednesday morning.




“The Department of Homeland Security's REAL ID policy is now in effect, and we are pleased to share that the TSA lines are moving efficiently,” the airport said in a social media post. “You can help ensure that continues by bringing your REAL ID if you have it when you are coming to the airport.”

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports most travelers must have a REAL ID now to fly in the U.S., or face extra screening.

The day ahead of the deadline, people lined up at government offices across the country to secure their compliant IDs. In Chicago, officials established a Real ID Supercenter for walk-in appointments, while officials in California and elsewhere planned to continue offering extended hours for the crush of appointments. 

“I'm here today so I won't be right on the deadline, which is tomorrow,” said Marion Henderson, who applied for her REAL ID on Tuesday in Jackson, Mississippi.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday assured people who don't yet have a REAL ID but need to take a domestic flight Wednesday that they will be able to fly after clearing additional identity checks.

Some complained about the need to secure the ID after waiting in line for hours. 

Michael Aceto waited in line at a DMV in King of Prussia, in the Philadelphia suburbs, for about two and a half hours Tuesday before getting his REAL ID. 

“It's a pain in the butt. It's really a lot of time. Everybody's got to take off from work to be here,” he said. “It's a big waste of time as far as I'm concerned.”

The Transportation Security Administration warned people who don't have identification that complies with REAL ID requirements to arrive early at the airport and be prepared for advanced screening to avoid causing delays. 

TSA posted on X that people may get additional screening but it wasn't clear how many passengers, if any, were pulled aside for extra screening.

The new requirements have been the subject of many Reddit threads and Facebook group discussions in recent weeks, with numerous people expressing confusion about whether they can travel without a REAL ID, sharing details about wait times and seeking advice on how to meet the requirements.

Noem told a congressional panel that 81% of travelers already have REAL IDs. She said security checkpoints will also be accepting passports and tribal identification, like they have already been doing. 

Those who still lack an identification that complies with the REAL ID law “may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step,” Noem said.

“But people will be allowed to fly,” she said. “We will make sure it's as seamless as possible.”

REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that Homeland Security says is a more secure form of identification. It was a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission and signed into law in 2005. It was supposed to be rolled out in 2008 but the implementation had been repeatedly delayed.

¨The whole idea here is to better validate those individuals that were encountering a checkpoint to ensure they are who exactly they say they are,” said Thomas Carter, TSA's Federal Security Director in New Jersey.

Carter said those without a REAL ID should give themselves extra time to clear security. 

“If they do that, I do not have a belief that this will cause people to miss their flights if they take that additional time in,” he said.

Besides serving as a valid form of identification to fly domestically, people will also need a REAL ID to access certain federal buildings and facilities.

State government offices that issue driver's licenses and state IDs have seen a significant increase in demand for REAL ID and some have extended their office hours to meet the demand. Some officials have recommended people wait for a while to get REAL ID compliant licenses and cards if they don't have flights planned in the next few months. 

“We are encouraging people who have passports or other REAL ID-compliant documents and people who don't have travel plans in the next few months to wait until after the current rush to apply for a REAL ID,” said Erin Johnson, a spokesperson with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

Johnson said that the department has seen a significant increase in demand for REAL ID in recent weeks. In February, there were more than 48,000 applications for a REAL ID; that has nearly doubled to over 99,000 in April, she said.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A security guard was charged Tuesday with murder in the shooting death of the dean of a small technical college near Los Angeles, officials said.

The dean of student affairs, Cameisha Denise Clark, died at the hospital Monday after being shot Friday afternoon at the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology campus in Inglewood, according to family. Another female employee was wounded in the shooting.

Jesse Figueroa, 40, was charged with murder, attempted murder and several counts for possessing a firearm as a felon. He also faces gun sentencing enhancements, which can lead to additional penalties when a gun is used during a crime. 

Figueroa will appear in court May 29 and faces a maximum sentence of life in state prison if convicted as charged. His public defender did not respond to request for comment.

The technical college's campus president, Chris Becker, said Figueroa worked for a company that provides security to the school.

Inglewood Mayor James Butts said last week it appeared to be an incident of workplace violence, but charging documents did not lay out a possible motive.

Clark's family said she had been recently promoted to dean at the school.

“Cameisha uplifted everyone fortunate enough to cross her path,” her family said in a statement to KNBC. “Her leadership, integrity, and deep sense of purpose helped shape futures of countless students from the campus of Clark Atlanta University to Spartan College. She believed in the potential of others even when they could not yet see it in themselves.”

Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., on Speaker Mike Johnson's struggle to get enough Republican votes to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running and the FBI complying with congressional record requests.

The FBI is investigating a sophisticated criminal network targeting kids and teens online known as ""764.""

The predators are known for targeting minors on social media and using coercion to get them to film themselves committing violent or sexual acts, and then using those videos to extort minors for increasing violent or sexual videos that are then shared with ""764"" followers online.

""The FBI is investigating at least 250 subjects who are tied to violent online networks commonly referred to as '764' but includes many offshoot networks and names,"" the FBI told Fox News in a statement on Tuesday evening. ""All 55 FBI field offices across the country are involved in these investigations.""

The agency added that it is ""growing increasingly concerned about a loose network of violent predators who befriend minors and other vulnerable individuals through popular online platforms and then coerce them into escalating sexual and violent behavior — pushing victims to create graphic content, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), harm family pets, cut themselves with sharp objects, or attempt suicide.""

""Some of these predators even watch live-streamed self-harm and other violent content,"" the FBI said.

In a May 6 post on X, FBI Director Kash Patel called the group ""deeply disturbing,"" adding that it is ""critically important to understand what's out there and be aware of the threats American kids and families are facing every day.""

""The criminals in these networks use online platforms to target vulnerable kids, coerce victims, and recruit others — often resulting in horrible cases of abuse. It is absolutely tragic — and I want people to know we're cracking down hard,"" he wrote. ""Remember, last week we announced our agents and partners arrested two alleged leaders within 764. We've opened hundreds of cases around the country and our field offices are fully engaged. This is a priority for myself, [FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino], and our leadership team.""

Last week, the Justice Department announced the arrests of two suspected ""764"" leaders, including 21-year-old Leonidas Varagiannis, also known as War, and 20-year-old Prasan Nepal, also known as Trippy, of High Point, North Carolina, for their ""crimes operating an international child exploitation enterprise in connection with a nihilistic violent extremist (NVE) network known as 764.""

The two defendants allegedly operated a subgroup of 764, called 764 Inferno, through encrypted messaging platforms. They are accused of coercing or participating in the production of CSAM and facilitating the grooming ane extortion of minors.

They also allegedly ordered victims to self-harm, such as cutting ""blood signs"" into their skin, and engaged them in psychological torment and extreme violence using threat and manipulation tactics.

They are accused of targeting at least eight children as young as 13 years old.

The defendants face the maximum penalty of life in prison if they are convicted, according to the Justice Department.

Former commercial pilot Mike Coffield joins ‘America Reports' to break down the recent incident at Newark Liberty International Airport, where air traffic controllers temporarily lost contact with a flight.

The right wingtip of a United Airlines plane departing a gate collided with the left wingtip of another United plane in San Francisco early on Tuesday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

""While United Airlines Flight 863 was pushing back from the gate at San Francisco International Airport, its right wingtip struck the left wingtip of United Airlines Flight 877,"" the FAA told Fox News Digital.

""This occurred in an area where air traffic controllers do not communicate with flight crews. Flight 863 was headed to Sydney, Australia, and Flight 877 was headed to Hong Kong, China. The FAA will investigate the incident, which occurred around 12:35 a.m. local time on Tuesday, May 6.""

ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt says that federal action against antisemitism on college campuses is 'long overdue' but warned the Trump administration risks overreach. 

One of the men accused of taking part in the antisemitic sign controversy that appeared at one of Barstool Sports' bars in Philadelphia spoke out Tuesday in the latest twist in the ordeal.

A sign that read ""f--- the Jews"" was spotted at the bar in a video that went viral across social media over the weekend. Dave Portnoy has weighed in, at times furiously, and offered one of the men a trip to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust as penance for the antisemitic incident.

However, that offer has since been revoked.

Mo Khan, who Portnoy identified as one of the men involved in the incident, released a statement about the antisemitic incident and accused Portnoy of sensationalizing it to his millions of social media followers. He implored those who watched his video to donate to his GiveSendGo fundraiser and blamed Portnoy for the attacks he has received.

""Although I had nothing to do with the sign coming out, nor do I know who did it, I know that the sign was provocative because it reminded people of the unjust things Israel is doing around the world, thus leading me to report on it,"" Khan said, reupping his claim that he was a ""citizen journalist"" in the matter.

""Dave Portnoy and his friends can choose to be triggered over the sentiments of that sign and even kick me out of the establishment forever. However, they have no right to destroy my life over free speech and ultimately something that was an edgy joke. Frankly, they're more worried about destroying and uprooting me than the thousands of people getting destroyed and uprooted in genocide.""

Khan claimed that Portnoy and the Jewish community have claimed that they were the victims in this incident, but he said he was the true victim. Khan said he was suspended from his university, lost an internship and received death threats over the incident.

Khan said when he agreed to Portnoy's offer of an Auschwitz trip, he was making those statements ""under duress"" because he does not have the means or connections that Portnoy has. He said Portnoy is ""hypocritically lynching me"" and trying to cancel him while building a business based on an anti-cancel culture.

""Dave Portnoy owes me restitutions and an apology for everything he has done and caused for me in these past few days,"" Khan said. ""In an attempt to expose me, he exposed himself as almost a total fraud, going back on anything he stands for.""

DAVE PORTNOY BLASTS TV STATION OVER CONTENTIOUS INTERVIEW

Portnoy responded to Khan's statement later Tuesday. He wrote in a post on X that Khan was a ""flat liar.""

""I talked to him on the phone with his buddy and they both owned up to it and cried about it. He then lawyered up after speaking with his family,"" Portnoy wrote. ""His name got out because he's a moron and uploaded ‘f--- the Jews' sign to his Instagram before I even knew about it. He already went viral without me. He spreads hate and uses the conflict in Middle East as his excuse. And did it in a bar with my (company's) name on it. 

""Now he's trying to profit from it. I'm sure he'll make money because there is lots of antisemitism in the world. Regardless this is the least surprising thing ever.  He is the definition of a coward.  Zero accountability for his actions. I don't care what religion you are or even how you feel about Middle East. This was an act of pure hate and this should disgust you.""

Dave Portnoy believes ""credibility with the audience"" is a key to success. (Stacy Revere/Getty Images)

Portnoy said in a separate video he felt ""dumb"" trying to ""show grace"" and make things right.

""This is what the face of being a coward is,"" he said of Khan.

Joey Jones joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to share his thoughts on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell appearing alongside President Trump at the White House to announce the 2027 NFL Draft will be held at the National Mall. 

Phil Simms, the legendary New York Giants quarterback, and his family have been wrestling with the notion of letting the team's first-round pick, Abdul Carter, wear his retired No. 11 jersey. 

While Simms himself said he would be open to letting Carter wear the same number he wore at Penn State, the women in his family ultimately shut it down. 

Chris Simms, Phil's son and current NBC NFL analyst, broke down the debate inside his family circle on ""PFT Live with Mike Florio"" on Monday, when he said ""shedding tears"" actually came for his sister, Deidre, and mother, Diana.

After Simms made his comments about being open to letting No. 11 go to Carter, Chris had a phone call with his father, asking if he was going to make it happen for real. 

However, Deidre called and could not believe Chris was on his father's side. 

""'I thought you were going to be on my side, how dare you. Forget it, I don't want to talk to you and we're hanging up,'"" Chris said Deidre told him over the phone.

""That's when I knew, ‘Uh oh, mom and sister have gotten involved here.' And mom and sister have one more vote than me and brother (Matt), and I don't know where my brother stands on this.""

Chris said that his father asked him if he could sway his mom and sister to his side. However, Chris was right – the Simms women's votes held more power in the end. 

""I knew they threw a fit,"" Chris said. ""I think it's going to the point where literally there was like, they were shedding tears. I'm not trying to embarrass my mom or my sister, but that's how important it was to them. And on top of that, the blowback off of that and the amount of people that came to my dad, ‘Don't give your number up, don't do that,' I think he was a little taken aback by that.

""Ultimately, he's not going to do it, he got outvoted by his family, specifically his daughter and his wife, but that's where it stands right now.""

Carter, who went third overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, has sparked some controversy revolving around the jersey number he wants to wear. Lawrence Taylor, the Hall of Fame linebacker whose retired No. 56 was brought up by Carter, told the rookie to make his own number famous. 

That was when Carter pivoted to No. 11, which Phil openly said he would consider giving to him. Now, however, Carter will have to find his own number like every other player. 

It seems trivial to believe a rookie could take a retired number, but it has happened recently in the NFL, including with the Giants this past season. Malik Nabers got permission from the family of Ray Flaherty to wear No. 1, and he did well in it last year.

Also, in this year's draft class, Warren Moon gave Cam Ward, the number one overall pick, the right to wear his retired No. 1 with the Tennessee Titans. Of course, Moon has the right to give away his number if so. 

While jersey numbers usually do not carry weight for rookies, the NFL world is now fixated on what Carter will do now that both of his requests have been denied.

The pickup truck that collided with a tour van near Yellowstone National Park last week is to blame for the crash, which left seven people dead, according to police.

Idaho State Police said a Dodge Ram pickup truck crossed the center line on Highway 20 near Henry's Lake State Park and hit the Mercedes tour van, causing both vehicles to burst into flames. It is unclear what caused the truck to leave its lane.

""Crash reconstruction is ongoing, and ISP troopers are working to determine all contributing factors,"" state police said on Tuesday.

The driver of the truck and six of the 14 people inside the tour van died in the crash, police said.

In addition to Idaho State Police, the National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the crash since it involved a commercial vehicle. 

""NTSB personnel have visited the scene and are reviewing evidence. While information is being shared between ISP and the NTSB, each agency is conducting its own investigation,"" the ISP said.

Idaho state troopers responded to the tragic scene at around 7:15p.m. on Thursday, which took place approximately 16 miles west of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.

Fox News' Bill Melugin reports the latest on the new policy. The 'Outnumbered' panel also weighs in on how DHS is incentivizing illegal immigrants to self-deport.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted operations in Nashville this week, resulting in the arrests of a convicted child sex predator and an alleged gang member, but the mayor of the city said the arrests were not focused on making the city safer.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shared Democratic Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell's letter to the city about the ICE arrests.

""Our top priority is keeping people safe, and we're deeply concerned that what appear to be federal actions are making that harder,"" O'Connell wrote. ""Overnight, we understand that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents detained people during enforcement actions in Middle Tennessee. As we learn more, I want to be clear: No [Metropolitan Nashville Police Department (MNPD)] personnel were involved in last night's enforcement action.""

He added that the city's police department does not have federal immigration authority, nor are its members trained to conduct immigration enforcement.

O'Connell also said the police department lacks access to federal immigration databases.

""This type of federal enforcement action is not focused on making us safer and leaves people in our community fearing any interaction with law enforcement when there is a crime occurring,"" he added. ""We will be seeking the names of those detained.""

DHS said the Nashville operation resulted in the arrests of a convicted child sex predator, an alleged member of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, an individual convicted of aggravated assault and multiple illegal aliens on drug charges.

""The Nashville Mayor should want these criminal illegal aliens off American streets,"" DHS posted on X. ""Attacks and demonization of our brave law enforcement is wrong. ICE officers are now facing a 413% increase in assaults. President Trump campaigned on immigration enforcement, the American people voted for it, and DHS is delivering.""

O'Connell's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

ICE recently announced that during President Donald Trump's first 100 days of his second term, the agency arrested over 66,000 illegal immigrants and removed more than 65,000.

ICE arrested 66,463 illegal immigrants and removed 65,682, including those accused of threatening public safety and national security, according to a news release from ICE.

Three in four arrests of illegal immigrants involved someone accused of committing a crime, ICE claimed.

The total number of ICE illegal immigrant arrests includes 2,288 alleged gang members from Tren de Aragua, MS-13, 18th Street and other gangs. Tren de Aragua and MS-13 are now listed as foreign terrorist organizations.

EXCLUSIVE — President Donald Trump is being lobbied by activists on both sides of the aisle to crack down on the sale of illicit, Chinese-manufactured electronic cigarettes to American children and teenagers.

Javier Palomarez, president of the Hispanic Business Caucus, sent a letter last month to the president and members of the Cabinet pressing Trump to “set up an effective regulatory and enforcement framework” targeting black market vapes.

LIST: THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

The letter, obtained and reviewed by the Washington Examiner, proposes securing the northern and southern borders to prevent cartels from smuggling black market Chinese products into the United States, tightening regulations regarding shipments received from China, and publishing new vape-related guidance for consumers and retailers.

“More authorizations will provide us with a working market with safer products. More enforcement will stop illegal imports and protect consumers. More transparency will provide clarity for businesses, retailers, and law enforcement,” the letter concluded.

Trump has dabbled in vaping politics. In 2019, he proposed a ban on selling flavored e-cigarettes to deter rising teenage vaping. He then slowed the rollout and eventually amended the proposed rule in 2020, allowing manufacturers to circumvent the ban by going through a premarket tobacco application process.

He also signed a bill into law raising the federal minimum age for purchasing all tobacco products, including vapes, from 18 to 21. And on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump injected himself into the debate, repeatedly vowing to “save vaping.”

“I saved Flavored Vaping in 2019, and it greatly helped people get off smoking. I raised the age to 21, keeping it away from the ‘kids.' Kamala and Joe want everything banned, killing small businesses all over the Country,” the president said in a September 2024 post on Truth Social. “I'll save Vaping again!”

The White House told the Washington Examiner that it received USHBC's letter but declined to comment on any forthcoming policy decisions.

The departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, also declined to comment.

Youth vaping rates exploded after electronic nicotine delivery systems hit the market in the early 2000s, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention charting a roughly 2,000% increase in the number of teenage vapers from 2011 to 2019. And while youth usage rates have slowly decreased over the past five years, CDC data show that, in 2024, more than 1.63 million middle school and high school students reported using e-cigarettes daily. Of that total, more than 67% reported trying to quit in the last year, while nearly 88% reported preferring flavored products to nonflavored ones.

Meanwhile, industry figures estimate that Chinese manufacturers are producing the overwhelming majority of illicit, unregulated vapes sold in the U.S.

Tobacco conglomerate Altria told shareholders during an earnings report earlier this month that 70% of black market e-cigarettes can be traced back to China, while Polaris National Security, a think tank founded by Morgan Ortagus, deputy U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, believes that number is north of 90%. In a white paper last month, Polaris suggested that Chinese manufacturers will broach $200 billion in annual illicit vape sales by 2030.

According to the CDC, teenage vaping is not specifically a racial problem for Hispanic youth, with 6.1% of Hispanic students reporting daily vape usage compared to 7% of black students and 5.9% of white students. However, Palomarez said in an interview that, beyond the obvious health concerns, the black market vape trade is causing significant confusion among USHBC's membership of more than 4.5 million.

“We're finding that some of our own members are selling this stuff, not even knowing that it's illegal, and so that's concerning as all get out,” he explained. “Think about an illicit vape — it's very easy to package, very light. It has an amazing shelf life. Obviously, there are no regulatory or health issues or permitting that you need to worry about. It takes up very little shelf space. It's got a great profit margin.”

Palomarez even suggested that American politicians' focus on the fentanyl trade is incentivizing black market Chinese producers and the cartels who carry their product across U.S. borders to prioritize the vape trade over other contraband.

“It's China manufacturing this stuff, but it's the cartels that are carrying them into the United States,” he continued. “It's clear to me, were it not for the Chinese manufacturers being incentivized to do this, because there are loopholes all over the place and we're not enforcing, and a willing cartel that's more than willing to carry it across the border, we wouldn't have this problem.”

Palomarez also said Chinese manufacturers are specifically targeting young Americans through the use of flavored-nicotine products and packaging with bright colors or animals, and even suggested that some Chinese e-cigarettes sold in U.S. markets are clearly labeled “Not For Sale In China.”

“They won't sell this s*** to their own kids, but they're selling it to ours. And you know, it enrages me that, you know, for four years this thing languished out there,” he said. “The Chinese jumped right through that loophole. And, you know, are making hundreds of millions of dollars on this market.”

Palomarez, a self-identified “known Democrat,” said he was disappointed with former President Joe Biden's approach to curbing tobacco consumption. 

BECOMING AN AMERICAN: HOW TO FIX THE LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

Biden pursued two smoking-related regulations during his term in office: a ban on menthol and other flavored cigarettes and, in late 2024, an effort to mandate “low-nicotine” levels for all combustible cigarettes, which would have effectively banned all products currently available in legal markets. Drug policy and law enforcement experts argued widely at the time that Biden's rules were “regressive,” would disproportionately affect communities of color, and would drive a surge in black market sales.

Trump rescinded the flavored-cigarette rule shortly after entering office, but his FDA reintroduced and amended a version of Biden's low-nicotine standard in late February.

“I have higher hopes that this administration will work with us on this issue than I ever did with the last administration. I hate to say it, but that's the truth,” Palomarez explained.

The matter is also gaining some traction on Capitol Hill. A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-SD), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), and John Moolenaar (R-MI), sent a separate letter to the administration in March urging the president to mobilize the executive branch to “combat this serious issue, including by pursuing, as appropriate, civil and criminal penalties both against companies who unlawfully export to the United States and the distributors who sell them to America's children.”

Still, one senior Trump administration official told the Washington Examiner that anti-Chinese vape activists are facing some administrative roadblocks created by the president.

In addition to increasing regulation enforcement, anti-vaping activists have called on Trump to place new penalties on American companies relating to the sale of illicit e-cigarette products.

TRUMP'S SKINNY BUDGET CALLS FOR DEFENSE SPENDING HIKE AND DOMESTIC CUTS

However, an executive order Trump signed shortly after entering office, which requires the federal government to take 10 regulations off the books for every new one added, could complicate that.

“I would guess that this is pretty low on the president's to-do list,” the official, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, told the Washington Examiner. “Still, if [HHS Secretary Robert F.] Kennedy [Jr.] gets on board, that could change.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","What 'due process' do illegal immigrants actually get by law?","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3403384/what-process-are-illegal-immigrants-due-trump-deportations/","Wed, 07 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump has been carrying out his deportation plans forcefully and rapidly, pleasing his base while alarming some advocates who say the administration is ignoring due process rights of deportees. Recent high-profile deportation cases that have attracted the legal services of well-funded liberal immigration groups have put a spotlight on due process and how much a person living in the country illegally should receive.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that the Constitution extends due process to anyone on U.S. soil, but illegal immigrants do not have the same rights as citizens to it.

Trump aide Stephen Miller declared on Monday that an “illegal alien facing deportation” is not guaranteed due process, a remark that followed the president himself conveying uncertainty about the matter in a television interview.

Asked by the interviewer if he believed citizens and noncitizens alike deserve due process, Trump replied, “I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.”

The Constitution “might say that, but if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials,” Trump said, later adding that he would follow Supreme Court orders.

In Reno vs. Flores, a Supreme Court decision about detaining migrant children, the late Justice Antonin Scalia was unequivocal.

“It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings,” Scalia wrote in 1993.

The Supreme Court reiterated Scalia's words in April in an order directing the Trump administration to give “reasonable” notice to alleged transnational gang members the government planned to deport under the Alien Enemies Act.

They must have the opportunity to “seek habeas [corpus] relief” before they are deported, the high court said, referencing the legal recourse available to those who believe they have been wrongly detained.

Attorney Neama Rahmani, a California-based former federal prosecutor, highlighted how illegal immigrants appearing in immigration courts are not entitled to a lawyer. Many groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Immigration Project, have made it their mission to volunteer their legal services to help illegal border crossers navigate the U.S. legal system, but recipients of those services are in the minority.

“The vast majority of migrants don't have lawyers in these proceedings,” Rahmani told the Washington Examiner.

Rahmani also said that in criminal proceedings, citizens are entitled to bail, and the burden is on prosecutors to present factors supporting their detention, such as that they are a flight risk or danger to the community. Migrants do not get the presumption of bail, he said, so if they are apprehended, they typically remain detained unless they are granted parole or otherwise successfully seek out their release.

The Biden administration notoriously paroled around one million migrants into the country. The Trump administration, by contrast, has sought to revoke their parole status or entice them to self-deport by offering to pay for their travel and write them a $1,000 check.

Migrants who have recently entered the country can be fast-tracked right back out of it by a border official without ever appearing before an immigration judge under a set of immigration laws known as Title 8.

Migrants can avoid this form of removal by claiming asylum, a protection built into the immigration laws that they can receive if they present a credible fear for their safety in their home country. At that point, they have a right to make their claim to an asylum officer, who does the initial vetting of the claim.

From there, an asylum seeker has a right to appear before an immigration judge, which is an administrative judge employed by the Department of Justice, and that judge can review their claim. Immigration judges' discretion during these proceedings can shift with the change in a presidential administration.

Cases before an immigration judge can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and then reviewed by the circuit court, and then reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Andrew “Art” Arthur, a Center for Immigration Studies legal expert who previously served as an immigration judge, told the Washington Examiner he only saw a small percentage of appeals in his cases and his rejection of an asylum claim was never overturned on appeal.

Rahmani, meanwhile, said that while federal law does allow these individualized proceedings for asylum seekers, Congress could further streamline this process if it wanted. He also said that for all of the perceived process in place, the end result is often going to be that an illegal border crosser is deportable.

“As far as a legal leg to stand on, almost all of these migrants have none. They have no legal basis to be here,” Rahmani said.

In his most controversial deportation operation, Trump expanded the use of the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely employed wartime law, in an effort to deport dozens of alleged Tren de Aragua members to a Salvadoran prison on March 15.

The move has led to a web of court cases across the country because Trump bypassed routine immigration proceedings to carry out the deportations that day. The Supreme Court is currently weighing one of the cases, while two lower court judges have ruled that Trump improperly interpreted the law to mean the alleged Tren de Aragua members were invading the country at the behest of the Venezuelan government.

Arthur said those cases were receiving outsize attention and not representative of the Trump administration's broader deportation efforts.

Outside of the March 15 deportations, the administration “isn't sacking up random people on the street, tossing them in the back of a van, driving them in the dead of night to an airport, flying them to El Salvador, and releasing them to the Salvadoran authorities,” Arthur said.

He said he believed other deportees all have final orders of removal. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration told the court it deported him to the Salvadoran prison on March 15 in error. An immigration judge found in 2019 that he could be deported, just not to El Salvador because of a “withholding of removal” protection the judge granted him.

While Abrego Garcia has been heroized by some on the Left, details from his past have leaked out since his deportation that support the administration's allegation that he is an MS-13 gang member with a checkered past.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FACES ORDER TO RETURN SECOND MIGRANT FROM SALVADORAN PRISON

“There's always more to the stories that you hear,” Arthur said, noting how the government likely has nonpublic intelligence, outside of mere tattoos associated with gang membership, to support its determinations.

In the case of Abrego Garcia, the Supreme Court ordered the administration to “facilitate” his return so that he could be afforded the due process any other alleged criminal illegal immigrant would receive.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Bondi ‘learning' about pizza deliveries to judges that Durbin says are ‘threats'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3403605/pam-bondi-pizza-judges-deliveries-dick-durbin-ed-martin/","Wed, 07 May 2025 14:20:53 GMT","

Attorney General Pam Bondi said she is aware of reports that pizzas are being anonymously sent to judges' homes but withheld comment on the deliveries, which Democrats said are meant to be threatening.

“I'm just learning about that,” Bondi told the Washington Examiner at the White House on Wednesday.

When asked if the Justice Department had a response to the incidents, Bondi said, “Not yet, but we will.”

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on the DOJ and the FBI in a letter Tuesday to “immediately investigate” the deliveries. He described them as “threats intended to show that those seeking to intimidate the targeted judge know the judge's address or their family members' addresses.”

“The targeted individuals reportedly include Supreme Court justices, judges handling legal cases involving the administration, and the children of judges,” Durbin said. “Some of these deliveries were made using the name of Judge Esther Salas's son, Daniel Anderl, who was murdered at the family's home by a former litigant who posed as a deliveryman.”

During a brief Q&A session with reporters outside the West Wing of the White House, Bondi said she would speak with Ed Martin, President Donald Trump‘s nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, later Wednesday. Martin is currently serving in the role in an interim capacity because he does not have enough support from Republicans for a Senate vote.

“I'll be talking to Ed today and find out what's going on with that,” she said.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced on Tuesday that he would not support Martin's nomination out of committee because of the prosecutor's comments about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his defense of Jan. 6 defendants.

“I have no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on Jan. 6, and that's probably where most of the friction was,” Tillis said.

Bondi was also asked about House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer‘s (R-KY) comment that files regarding Jeffrey Epstein are “missing.”

“The FBI, they're reviewing. There are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn,” she said. “There are hundreds of victims, and no one victim will ever get released. It's just the volume, and that's what they're going through right now. The FBI is diligently going through that.”

Bondi was at the White House on Wednesday before meeting with victims' families who have had “no closure” after former President Joe Biden “commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 death row inmates,” she said.

“They found out, some of them, on Christmas Eve,” she said. “One, a Marine who had been raped and murdered. Her family has no closure. … These were people who were commuted off death row by the Biden administration.”

PAM BONDI CELEBRATES ARRESTS THAT ‘MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN'

Bondi will hold another press conference on Wednesday afternoon with FBI Director Kash Patel about Operation Restore Justice, a coordinated operation across 55 FBI field offices to “identify, track, and arrest child sex predators.”

“That's a vital report,” she said. “It's a huge case that we've been working on, the FBI, all of my prosecutors.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney “was like watching a grand master in chess.”

In recent weeks, Trump unveiled 10% tariffs against Canada that will take effect on July 9 and a 25% tariff on foreign automobiles. Carney and Trump met for the first time Tuesday since taking their respective offices. Miller also attended the meeting and discussed his takeaways on Fox News's Hannity on Tuesday.

“What I witnessed was like watching a grand master in chess perform. President Trump has opened up a completely new relationship with Canada,” Miller said. “The prime minister of Canada talked about finally contributing their fair share to NATO's defense. … He talked about achieving fair trade with the United States and acknowledged the prime minister of Canada. Canada acknowledged the need to strike a fair trade deal with the United States, as President Trump has long asked for. He emphasized, the prime minister of Canada, his deployment of troops and guards to the Canadian border at President Trump's request to keep fentanyl out of the United States of America.”

Trump has floated a requirement that NATO countries spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense to remain in the alliance. Only 23 of the 32 allies met the current 2% benchmark, and another five allies were over 3%.

Meanwhile, Carney's main request to Trump was to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state. The prime minister even repeated the request during a press conference that day.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's ordering of at least a 20% reduction of four-star generals and admirals has raised concerns that those cuts could be weaponized to cut officers deemed insufficiently loyal to the president and secretary.

Hegseth, in a memo to senior Pentagon leadership dated Monday, directed a reduction of at least 20% of four-star positions across the Active Component, at least a 20% reduction of general officers in the National Guard, and an additional minimum of 10% cuts in general and flag officers.

The one-page memo did not specify which positions could be cut or what criteria would be used to determine which cuts to make, raising concerns among experts that it could target senior military officers who do not appear to be aligned with the president's “America First” agenda.

“We're sending a clear message that if you don't concur with the president, ideologically, you are at risk,” Gene Moran, a national security expert and former adviser to multiple Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs during former President George W. Bush's time in office, told the Washington Examiner. “Historically, we have wanted the military to be politically agnostic.”

The 20% reduction of four-star generals sounds steep, though in reality it would only amount to seven or eight officers. Currently, there are 38 four-star generals and admirals in 44 total positions, a handful of which are not currently filled. It's also unclear if the cuts will be for the current four-star generals or the total four-star positions, because some are currently unfilled. There are roughly 900 general and flag officers with at least one star, indicating that the cuts will likely be around 90 officers.

Greg Williams, the director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight, also expressed concern that this reduction in senior officers “presents an opportunity for the administration to punish people who aren't falling in line with their policies,” he told the Washington Examiner.

“What we don't want to see is this kind of reduction turn into a loyal testing campaign where the people who get let go are people who are voicing independent thoughts and otherwise maintaining that the military is a non-partisan organization,” Williams added.

He recommended that the department focus on which positions they want to eliminate rather than specific individuals they want to fire.

Hegseth and the president have already dismissed multiple four-star officers: Gen. Charles Q. Brown, former chairman of the Joint Staff; Adm. Lisa Franchetti, former chief of naval operations; Gen. James Slife, the Air Force vice chief of staff; and he fired the top military lawyers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which are known as Judge Advocates General.

Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Washington Examiner that he believes the military should cut some of the four-star generals. However, he said the secretary “has shown me no reason not to be concerned” that this will be a political litmus test.

“I am concerned because Secretary Hegseth has shown me no reason to not be concerned that he would use this as a political tool,” he said, adding that it “would be massively inappropriate” if “it's some kind of political agenda masquerading as an efficiency effort.”

The firings of Franchetti and Slife “were clearly inappropriate and not based on any actual military qualification or war-fighting skill,” Montgomery added, noting that they both “met and exceeded any standard for four-star success,” though he made a distinction with Brown, given that the role of chairman of the Joint Staff is “uniquely” tied to the president.

Despite Montgomery's concerns, he's “not opposed” to the cuts broadly and said he does believe the department “needs to reduce the number of four stars, and therefore have a trickle down effect to some degree on three stars and two stars.” 

He called the current posture “disproportion[ate],” given the current number of active duty forces.

Hegseth has frequently noted that the military had 17 four- and five-star generals during World War II, who commanded a roughly 12 million-person force. The military currently has slightly more than two million active-duty personnel despite more than twice the number of four-star leaders it had at that time.

The secretary has argued since before his nomination that there were too many senior generals in the military.

“I would say over a third are actively complicit” in the politicization of the military, he told radio host Hugh Hewitt last June, adding, “then you have a lot of grumblers who are sort of going along, trying to resist the nonsense as much as they can.”

HEGSETH ORDERS REDUCTION OF SENIOR COMMANDERS, CUTTING 20% OF FOUR-STAR GENERALS AND ADMIRALS

Shortly before his nomination, the former Fox News host said on another podcast, “any general that was involved — general, admiral, whatever — that was involved in any of the [diversity, equity, and inclusion] woke shit has got to go.”

Moran also tied this reduction to the White House pushing out multiple officials in the National Security Council who were accused by conservative commentator Laura Loomer of being insufficiently loyal to the president.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) has been a steadfast opponent of illegal immigration. In recent years, she has blasted Democrats for enabling illegal immigrants to enter the country, regularly speaking out against sanctuary cities and demanding immigration reform. The Republican congresswoman took the battle over illegal immigration and sanctuary cities to her state's governor, calling for Illinois sheriffs to defy Gov. JB Pritzker's (D-IL) sanctuary law. 

In a press release issued on Tuesday, Miller insisted that Pritzker “uphold President Trump's federal immigration policies and cooperate with ICE to deport illegal aliens.”

“Governor JB Pritzker's sanctuary state policies have transformed Illinois into a cesspool of crime and drugs brought by the illegals he is actively resettling,” Miller said. “Our communities are being overwhelmed, innocent girls are being raped, and Americans are being ruthlessly murdered.”

She blamed these crimes on Pritzker's policies and called on law enforcement officials to help stop them from happening. This would require them to disobey Pritzker's commands not to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. 

“These are the tragic consequences of his failed leadership,” Miller said. “I call on every local sheriff in Illinois to defy these dangerous directives, cooperate with ICE, and support President Trump's deportation efforts. We must act now before one more innocent American life is lost or harmed.”

During his time in office, Pritzker was instrumental in passing legislation such as the Trust Act, which created barriers for state, county, and local law enforcement in Illinois to cooperate with ICE. In 2021, he signed several bills that strengthened the Trust Act and made “Illinois the second state in the nation to require local officials to end partnerships with ICE.”

Earlier this year, Rep. James Comer (R-KY), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, identified Pritzker and other Democratic governors as “obstructing federal immigration enforcement.” 

“The governors of these states must explain why they are prioritizing the protection of criminal illegal aliens over the safety of U.S. citizens, and they must be held accountable,” Comer said.

On Tuesday, it was reported that Pritzker, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), and Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) will testify before Congress on June 12 about their states' immigration policies, according to CBS News.

DEMOCRATS HAVE LEARNED NOTHING ON IMMIGRATION

As for Miller, she maintains that Pritzker's policies hurt U.S. citizens. Earlier in the month, Miller took to social media to express her thoughts on illegal immigration and its impact on national security. 

Every illegal immigrant in America must be deported — our national security depends on it.

“Every illegal immigrant in America must be deported — our national security depends on it,” Miller posted.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Anne Applebaum and America's backsliding democracy

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

In this episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic's David Frum reflects on the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, examining how postwar reconciliation—not battlefield triumph—became America's true finest hour. He contrasts that legacy with Donald Trump's recent bombastic Victory Day statement, urging a rededication to the values that built a more peaceful world.

David is then joined by The Atlantic's Anne Applebaum to discuss the astonishing and brazen corruption of the Trump presidency, how authoritarian regimes seek to break institutions, and the hardship of losing friendships to politics.

Finally, David answers listener questions on fostering open-minded political dialogue among polarized high-school students, why America hasn't developed a strong worker-based political movement like its European counterparts, and how to think about class in modern U.S. politics. He also weighs in on the risk of data suppression under the Trump administration and reflects on whether his long-held conservative values still belong to the political right.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to Episode 5 of The David Frum Show. I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. This week, I'll be joined by my Atlantic colleague and dear friend Anne Applebaum, one of the world's leading authorities on democracy and authoritarianism, kleptocracy, and the rule of law. I am so looking forward to the conversation with Anne, but first, some thoughts.

[Music]

This podcast will post in the week that the world commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe. The Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945. After his death, the German armies in Europe, one by one, began to approach the Allied commanders to surrender—in Italy, in Northwestern Europe. Finally on May 7, the overall command structure of the German armies approached the supreme allied commander, Dwight Eisenhower, to discuss an instrument of surrender for all the remaining German forces.

The original instrument of surrender was rejected by the Soviet army. It didn't mention the Soviet Union explicitly, and they had some other objections to it, and so the final instrument was negotiated during the day of May 8—was agreed about shortly before 10 p.m. on the 8th of May—and went into effect a little past 11 p.m. on the 8th of May. Eleven p.m., May 8, was, of course, the early morning in Moscow, May 9, and so this chain of events has left ever afterwards a question mark about what is the exact and proper date of the end of the Second World War in Europe: whether it's May 8—as it was in Berlin and where the Allied armies were—or May 9, as it was in Moscow.

Of course, the war itself would continue for more months. As the Germans surrendered in the West, American forces in the Pacific were fighting a brutal battle on the island of Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles of the whole war—certainly, I think, the bloodiest battle of the American Pacific campaign. And no one knew on the day that the Nazis surrendered how long that war in the Pacific would last, except for a handful of Americans who were party to the secret of the atomic bomb. Most Americans—most people—assumed that there was probably another year of fighting ahead, an invasion of Japan, and many thousands, maybe many hundreds of thousands, of American casualties and Allied casualties, too, because the American army that entered Japan would be supported by Commonwealth forces: Australia, British, Canadian. But the atomic bomb did explode. Japan did surrender, and the war came to an end—a final and formal end—with the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay on the 2nd of September, 1945.

So this is a time of commemoration, and in this time, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, issued a very strange post about the event on the 8th of May. He wrote:

Many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II. I am hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II and November 11th as Victory Day for World War I. We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything—That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!

Now, that post was such a perfect crystallization of the Trump style: bombast, boast, all of it making Trump himself the center of a story that he had nothing whatsoever to do with. The statement is unwise and unattractive in all kinds of other ways too. It denigrates the sacrifices and heroism of others. And it turns the tragedy and horror of war into a triumphant narrative that was completely alien to almost all the people who experienced it as nothing but a tale of suffering and waste and cruelty and misery.

I want to draw attention to something maybe less obvious about what is wrong—what is missing—from the president's statement. The first is, as so often when Donald Trump talks about American military history, he emphasizes power and success and triumph and military genius, but always lacking is any mention of the values for which Americans fought. America didn't go into World War II—or even World War I—to be top nation, to beat and dominate others. It went to defend things that Americans regarded as precious, and not only Americans but others too—and one of the measures of how precious those values were, not only to Americans and to others, but to the world that has grown up as a result of the war.

Because at this interval of eight decades, I think it's maybe most useful and most necessary not to think about the war that ended in Europe on May 8, or the war overall that ended on September 2 in Tokyo Bay. I think it's more useful to think about what began the process of reconstruction and reconciliation that occupied the next eight decades: the way in which former enemies became present partners, the way the Germans and the Japanese themselves discovered, in their own defeat, their own liberation because they came to accept the values for which Americans went into battle.

The story of how we turned the chaos and trauma of the Second World War into something better—and not Americans alone but Americans working with allies, working with defeated adversaries—that is not as dramatic as the battles of World War II. I don't know that people are going to make successful documentary series out of trade negotiations in food aid and the negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But those achievements were great, and they are the things that at the eighth-decade interval require us most to be mindful, because they're the things that are most in danger of being lost. You know, they're marble and bronze statues that commemorate all the horror and bloodshed of the war. But those quiet victories of peacetime that built a better world, we're in danger of forgetting them because right now, the United States is, step by step, unraveling its own great achievement.

You know, Winston Churchill described the Battle of Britain, in 1940, as Britain's finest hour. If Americans are looking for a finest hour of their own, it's not anything that happened during the war—when America was, by the way, a late entrant. It's the five, seven years, 10 years after the war, when Americans and others learned from the mistakes after the First World War and built a better world that we still enjoy. Now all of those lessons have been forgotten, and Donald Trump is single-handedly determined to repeat all the mistakes that after the First World War put the world on the path to the Second World War: protectionism, isolationism, narrow nationalism, lack of forbearance, lack of mutual understanding, lack of any understanding of America's place as a leader—because of its values, because it's a country that is admired and trusted, not just because it's a country that is strong and powerful and feared.

We should think of the 8th of May, and the Victory in Europe Day and Victory in Japan Day, as the beginnings of our modern story. And maybe the message that we need to hear from leaders is not a message of self-congratulation and self-celebration but a message of rededication to the work that was done after the end of the war to build a better world that those of us who grew up in it had the privilege of enjoying and that we are at risk of not bequeathing to the generations that come after us.

And now my conversation with Anne Applebaum. But first, a quick break.

[Music]

Frum: I am so pleased and happy to welcome today Anne Applebaum to join the conversation. Anne Applebaum is one of the world's leading thinkers on problems of authoritarianism and democracy. Normally, you have to say, “English-speaking world,” but not in Anne's case, because she's just been awarded a prize as a hero of the German nation. She's, of course, a colleague at The Atlantic. She is a dear friend. She is the author of books that have shaped the way we all think about these issues. Her book Gulag won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004. She really did win a prize as hero of the German nation. Other prizes, too many to count. She's also a longstanding, dear, dear friend of mine and my wife. My wife and Anne wrote a cookbook together. So we're going to be making a lot of references to a lot of common points, and I hope they're not too obscure.

But before we begin, I have to ask Anne about the president's comments this weekend about Americans, especially American girls, owning too many pencils. And the reason I'm raising this is: On my way into the little home studio I use, I accidentally tripped over the case in which my wife keeps her art supplies. So I found not one case of two dozen pencils, but all of these pencils, and I feel a certain shame that America can't be great again so long as we are indulging this insane accumulation of excessive numbers of pencils per person, especially per female person.

The president's words reminded me of a line from a movie I think we both love, Ninotchka, with Greta Garbo, in which she explains as a Russian operative that the goal of the Russian state is fewer but better Russians. And I think we're all looking forward to a world of fewer but better pencils. Well, maybe worse pencils. Is there some phrase from the Soviet Union about people who accumulate too many pencils?

Anne Applebaum: You know, I don't think, like, even Stalin had a thing about pencils or about there being too many pencils, although it's funny—I do remember there was a shortage of pencils in the Soviet Union, and it was a big problem. I know that, for example, accountants in the Gulag often had trouble getting pencils to make their accounts, and they talk about creating them from bits of charcoal, and people kept records with all kinds of things because there was a scarcity of pencils, even out there. So maybe, you know, it was a decision that Stalin made without telling us.

Of course, there's the more-famous line attributed, probably incorrectly, to Marie Antoinette, which is when she was told that the people of France have no bread, she said, “Let them eat cake.” And so I suppose we're now waiting for Trump to say, They have no pencils. Let them use fountain pens.

Frum: Yeah. (Laughs.) Well, there's something that's also quaintly old-fashioned about this. Like, you realize the last time he thought about getting gifts for the children, pencils were a big item, along with a tangerine, perhaps, and maybe, like, a wooden doll. The idea that you would to modern American children say, Here you go. Happy Birthday. Pencils. (Laughs.)

Your most recent book is a book about the intersection of autocracy and corruption. And that's the theme of your most recent article, a very important article for The Atlantic. I want to start by raising a problem that you and I were talking about just before we began, which is: In the Trump era, there's just too much bad news to keep track of. There's one appalling incident after another. There's one absurd incident after another. There's this pencil matter. And so the way I thought to set you going was: I think I can group the things that have happened in this first term into six major headers, of which the corruption theme is the last and the binding one.

So the first is attacks on due process and individual liberties for disfavored entities and persons. So that's the attacks on law firms. That's the removal of due process from people who are suspected of being in the country illegally, and bags are put on their head, and they're sent to El Salvador without a hearing.

The second category—so the first is attacks on due process and rights for disfavored. The second is impunity for the favored, so pardons for the January 6 criminals, lots of pardons for, you know, Republican officeholders who get caught up in corruption charges. There seems to be one of those a week.

So due process for the disfavored, impunity for the favored. Then a foreign policy that attacks allies and then sympathizes with foreign dictators. Then the reconstruction of the whole American economy along lines that empower the state and create more favor—ability of the state to dispense favors. Attacks on science, medicine, and otherwise objective sources of information. And then, finally, self-enrichment by the president, his family, his friends.

And your—one of your many great contributions—is to say this last is the binding agent that unites all the others. Can you take it from there and explain how we should think about this?

Applebaum: So if you look around the world, if you look at what links modern dictators and stipulate that modern dictators have very different ideologies—you know, you have nationalist Russia and Communist China and theocratic Iran and whatever North Korea is and the Bolivarian socialists in Venezuela. And you ask, What is it they have in common? Why do they support one another? Which they do. Why do they help keep one another in power? Which they do. There's a whole consortium of countries keeping the Venezuelan dictator [Nicolás] Maduro in power, for example, even though they would seem to have nothing in common.

One of the answers is that they all share an interest in stealing and hiding money and in helping one another evade the sanctions that have been set up to prevent them from doing that and in perpetuating not just their own power but their own wealth. And that's a—there is now a set of systems that exist, some of which are facilitated by the Western financial world, by the offshore banking havens that we've created, and the shell-company system that we created that helps people hide money. But it's the one thing that they have all in common, and it's the one thing that they all pursue.

It's also true that when you have a declining democracy—or a mixed system, as you had in Russia, for example, in the '90s—the moment when the regime begins to really earn money is also often the moment when they really feel the need to crack down on civil liberties. Because the most effective protest movements—and Russia is the best example of this—are often the ones that organize around corruption, because people can see and feel corruption. Ordinary people, you don't need to know—you don't have to read John Stuart Mill or know the history of the American Constitution, you know, or even have much of an education. You can be living in rural Ukraine or in Somalia and you can intuitively understand that it's wrong for some people to be able to steal and keep their money, whereas other people are very poor. And so this is often the motivating and organizing idea of antiauthoritarian movements.

I mean, actually, the Ukrainian revolution of 2014—which was the moment when a lot of young Ukrainians went out on the street; they were waving EU flags; they were calling for an end of their authoritarian regime, which was at that time closely linked to Russia—that was an anti-corruption movement that was classic in this sense. So Ukrainians understood that they were poor because their leaders were rich. They understood that their leaders were tied to Russia. They imagined being part of Europe, being part of the transatlantic world as a way to have the rule of law. And to avoid that—and when they won, this was the thing that panicked Putin because it's that kind of rebellion and that kind of movement that he's most afraid of inside his own country.

And indeed, the one really successful opposition leader in Russia over the last decade was Alexei Navalny. His movement was an anti-corruption movement. His organization was called the Anti-Corruption Foundation. And he was murdered, in essence, for successfully galvanizing Russians around that theme. So this is both the thing that unifies modern dictators, and it's also the thing that often unifies their opponents.

And so the fact that the Trump administration is moving so quickly in a kleptocratic direction and beginning to eliminate, one by one, all kinds of norms, defying all kinds of laws, changing existing laws to enable theft, essentially, and to enable corruption should really alarm us because this is very often what precedes a broader crackdown on civil society. Wherever you see a regime that is rapidly accumulating money and is rapidly enriching itself, you will see some kind of resistance movement and some kind of crackdown afterwards. And that's, I suppose, why I'm so concerned about it.

Frum: In President Trump's first term, he directed money to himself in a way that had never before been seen by an American president—never remotely. Like, not in the same neighborhood. He would stay in his hotels, so the Secret Service would pay him money to protect him. He would make clear to anyone from foreign nations that if they wanted his attention, they had better stay overnight at his hotel and hold their events in his hotel. At the beginning of his presidency, when he won by surprise in 2016, a number of the Persian Gulf states, which had planned events at other hotels in early parts for Christmas 2016, hastily rebooked at the Trump Hotel to gain favor. He also moved a lot of party money—not only public money, but if you were a Republican and you wanted his endorsement, you would have an event at his hotel.

That's a lot of money. On the other hand, it's like something you'd expect from, like, a crooked governor, not someone who controls the United States. And it looks like in his second term, he thought, You know, if I ever get another chance, this time I'm going to think big. And it looks as if through his various mysterious crypto ventures, hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, are moving from all kinds of people all over the planet to himself and to his family. And again, this is shadowy. It can't be very precise, but it looks like vastly more money than in the first term has already moved into his hands in the second.

Applebaum: It is really an extraordinary transformation. I can only attribute it, one, to greater preparation. This time, his family and some of his business contacts were prepared for him to win and had a set of plans ready to go, you know, should he become president.

Also, it's true that, as you say, in the first term, there were these small violations. There was another incident when Mike Pence went many miles out of his way to stay at a Trump Hotel in Ireland. I mean, there are all kinds of things like that that happened, and there was really no resistance. Nobody ever said, You're breaking the law. Nobody stopped him. It wasn't even really a major topic of concern among the many things that people were concerned about.

But you're right—this time around, it's very, very different. I mean, there are about four different kinds of things happening, and this is one of the reasons it's so hard to keep track of. One is violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. This is essentially the clause that says the U.S. president isn't supposed to benefit in any way from relationships with foreigners. Clearly, Trump benefits directly from relationships with foreigners.

You know, he was just at his golf course a few weekends ago, where a tournament was taking place that's sponsored by state-owned Saudi companies. The head of the Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, which is one of the sponsors, was actually there. So he would've met many Saudi people who are his investors, essentially, and clients who, of course, are also interested in his Middle Eastern policy and in American foreign policy. So you could argue that they were there if—maybe it's touchy to say they were trying to buy American foreign policy, but they were certainly trying to influence it. Why else? Why else would they be? Why else would they be there?

Secondly, there are conflicts of interest, and this, again, is on a scale that we have never seen before. Elon Musk has been put in charge of—with his group of DOGE, whoever they are, engineers and internet trolls, have been in charge of—taking over and managing regulatory bodies who regulate Musk's own companies. He's also got control and the power to hire and fire people at agencies that subsidize his companies.

So in other words, he can determine government policy towards his own companies. He can direct money towards his companies if he wants to. He can eliminate regulations of his companies if he wants to. And he is somebody who has been found in violation of all kinds of regulations—pollution regulations, other kinds of legal issues have plagued a lot of his companies from the beginning. And he now has been given a mechanism to escape that. And I should say, he's just the most egregious version of this. There are many people throughout this administration who have kept their private interests, who haven't recused themselves from investment issues, you know, who have nevertheless kept their jobs.

Thirdly, there are legal changes. There are laws that were on the books that the Trump Department of Justice or the Treasury Department will not enforce. There's something called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This was designed to forbid U.S. entities from bribing companies abroad. That law is now not being enforced. There's also a Corporate Transparency Act, which was designed to force the owners of shell companies and anonymous properties to register their names so that when someone bought, for example, an apartment in a Trump building, we would know who the real owner was—you know, is it Joe Smith down the street, or is it a Kazak billionaire who's interested in having influence on the U.S. government? And they have now said they will not be enforcing that law either.

And then finally, there is outright corruption. So Trump has created a cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial, which appears to be attracting investors who have a direct interest either in escaping a regulation or, in some cases, a lawsuit or an indictment by the federal government, or who have some interest in influencing Trump or his family in some other way. And as you say, there may be hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into this project and into others. We have no clear way to keep track of it. We don't know the exact relationship between those investors and decisions made by the Treasury Department or the Justice Department. And it is, again, corruption and self-dealing on a scale that we've never seen in American history. And this really puts this administration in a completely different league.

Frum: There's nothing like it, because the presidencies that are thought of as corrupt—Harding, Ulysses Grant—what happened there was you had a typically inattentive president, or in Grant's case, a president who was a little too protective of his beloved wife's relatives and turned a blind eye to corrupt practices by people around him, and maybe the president should have known what was going on. In Grant's case, Grant was obviously no fool. He should have known what was going on. Harding was more of a fool.

But the presidents themselves, the money didn't stick to them. And people remember Teapot Dome as being associated with Harding, but Harding didn't benefit from Teapot Dome. He just was ineffective and inattentive. In the same way, Grant didn't get rich as president. His wife's family picked up some lucrative positions and made dirty tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars in the money of the day. But again, Grant was inattentive and overprotective. FDR allowed some of his children to engage in business practices that they should not have—no suggestion that any of it stuck to him. Again, inattentive and overindulgent. Those are the practices. It has never been a case of money flowing into the hands of a president as president on this kind of scale.

Now, one of the questions that will, I'm sure, be occurring to many people who watch and listen is, Isn't this illegal? And you've cited some specific laws. There's also—we discussed this a couple of weeks ago with Peter Keisler, the former acting attorney general—there are general background statutes that say you can't use public office at all, in any way that benefits yourself. You know, even if we haven't specified, This is forbidden, there's a general, Oh, and one more thing. You can't do this. But as you were saying, all of this depends on the president to enforce the law. And if the president is determined not to, and punishes those who try and removes those who try, the system in the end cannot be enforced against the wish of the president, at least not so long as he has Congress on his side.

Applebaum: Presumably, the body that would be responsible for enforcing, you know, corruption laws against the president is the Department of Justice. And the Department of Justice in this administration is fully controlled by the president. There's a very political, very partisan group of people in charge of it.

We are hearing all the time—I'm sure you've heard this, as well—about current employees of the Department of Justice resigning. Some have done it publicly; some have done it more quietly. They're, you know, looking for jobs afterwards, and they don't want to be in the newspapers. But there are many people who are resigning because the department isn't doing its job, not just in terms of enforcing the laws on the president but everyone else.

And so what we're going to have very soon is a very, very partisan group of lawyers—or pseudo-lawyers—who are supposed to be enforcing the law but who are all there serving at the pleasure of the president, not there to enforce the Constitution or the legal system. You know, it's always a tough thing. I've encountered this problem in other countries. I mean, sometimes it's called the chief prosecutor. In our system, it's called the attorney general. It's always a tough thing to say that that person is independent of the president, even though they're appointed by the president. I mean, they're meant to act independently. In theory, they should have the mentality of someone acting independently. And it's always—that's always a touchy thing to ensure.

But at least in the last, you know—in modern American history, those people have, you know, sought to attain and to portray some kind of independence. They take an oath, not to the president personally but to the legal system, to the law. They attract the best lawyers in the countries—very young, idealistic people, because those are people who want to work for the U.S. government, for the American people, not for the personal benefit, the financial benefit of the president.

I'm sure, you know, listeners can point to many exceptions and moments when, you know, the system hasn't worked. But that was the theory of it. That was the idea. You know, how do you get and ensure rule of law? You get it by having people inside the system who have some kind of independence, some sense of independence. And some of this is not ensured by some statute in the Constitution or some legal rule. It's assured by the ethos of the people who go to work for the Department of Justice or the ethos of people who become judges. You know, people don't become a judge—they don't become a federal judge—because they want to enrich the president's family. They do it because they feel some fealty to the Constitution. And that system has worked up until now, and now we will see whether this second Trump administration can break it.

I would add one other thing, which is that we know that people who were being asked for promotion and who are being up for promotion inside the Department of Justice, some of them have been asked very political questions. For example, What do you think happened on January 6? And the right answer, of course, is that, you know, The great American patriots arose up to ensure that the correctly elected president, Donald Trump, would remain in office. And people who are unable to say that—because, of course, it's not true, and so if you're saying it, you're lying—they're not going to get promoted in Trump's Department of Justice. So we're going to have a very different body of people seeking to enforce the law, and you can already see the results.

Frum: Yeah. Bad character becomes a bona fide job qualification.

You point to something here, and this is how this becomes a linking theme: When you're doing a backsliding democracy—we're not, of course; this is not a full-blown dictatorship like Maduro's Venezuela; this is a backsliding democracy like those we've seen in other parts of the world, in Central and Eastern Europe and perhaps in parts of East Asia, as well—it becomes quite dangerous to be the chief executive, because you're accumulating all this money.

There are, actually, statutes on the books that say you're not supposed to do this. And there are broken but still present parts of the bureaucracy that are theoretically supposed to enforce these laws against you. So you need, for self-preservation, one by one to shut them down. And that is, I think, the linking point between Donald Trump's repressive agenda and his corruption agenda. The corruption agenda is possibly legally dangerous, unless you break, also, all the rest of the state.

Applebaum: Yeah, no. He's going to have to break a lot of institutions. I mean, he's seeking to break the Department of Justice right now. He will have to break the FBI, which he's already partway towards doing by putting, you know, the extreme partisan Kash Patel in charge of it. He may eventually have to break the federal judicial bench. I mean, you know, the people who are the judges in our political system at the federal level are all people—I mean, including and maybe even especially the conservatives are all people—who have made the Constitution a kind of fetish. You know, these are often constitutional originalists, you know, people whose theory of the judiciary is that we should hew as closely as possible to the letter and the spirit of the law as it was written in the 18th century. So he will have to either defy all of those people or find some way of getting around them or find some way of intimidating them if he is to continue.

So you're right: This creates an enormous interest that he has—and many of the people around him have—to continue breaking and subjugating those institutions. Plus, there's a whole host of other—I mean, anybody whose job is transparency (that includes journalists; that includes investigative groups, you know, the consortia of journalists and NGOs who've been created over the years to do investigative reporting), a lot of those are going to become targets. And some already have been, you know, either targets of smear campaigns on Twitter, or maybe they will even be investigated by the administration itself. All of those things—those transparency bodies, those legal bodies, all of them—will have to be somehow pushed out of the way if this accumulation of funds is to continue.

Frum: Yeah, I mean, one of the things that Trump and his defenders often say is they feel uniquely persecuted: No president has ever been investigated as much. No president has been convicted of crimes before. No president has been impeached twice. And they don't connect any of these results, the predicates of their own action.

But what is revealing about those comments is they reveal how endangered Trump and the people around him feel. I mean, even if, in the end, the American political system cannot hold a president to account, which looks like something we discovered about the system in the Biden years. That had a president who tried to overthrow the government of the United States; there's lots of evidence he'd taken bribes, he'd stolen documents, and everybody seemed to make a kind of collective, unspoken decision, You know what? Too big. We can't deal with this. But lots of other people went—a thousand people who took part in the January 6 crime were prosecuted and were sentenced. The others are also in danger, so they become co-authors of the need to break institutions with the president, who may, in the end, get away with it because the American system can't do that to its own president.

Applebaum: That's interesting. I mean, I hadn't thought of that psychological insight, namely that they talk all the time about being prosecuted and being victims and so on, and maybe it's because they, you know—of course, they know they're guilty. They know they broke the law. They know what happened on January 6. They know how much money they're stealing. So you're right. Maybe they do feel—maybe it's a reflection, a kind of authentic reflection of how afraid they feel. And they are all people who are engaged in breaking the law and in destroying and undermining the Constitution. And they're, perhaps at some level, consciously or unconsciously afraid eventually they might pay a price for it.

I mean, this, of course—we see this also in other countries. I mean, you know, why is Netanyahu, for example, so keen to break the Israeli judicial system? It's partly because he, too, is worried about being held to account. You know, why is Viktor Orbán so determined to stay in office despite the fact that his—this is the prime minister of Hungary—you know, his numbers are falling? He has a real political opponent. You know, what might persuade him to try and to, you know, block that political opponent, maybe even through illegal means? It's also, again, the fear that the very real crimes he's carried out—the money that he stole and the money that his family have benefited from taking from the Hungarian state—you know, maybe that's going to be investigated. So their anxiety and paranoia has a real basis. You're right.

Frum: And if there are free and fair midterm elections, given the very bad economic news that seems to be arriving day by day, Congress can be an investigative body, even if you can shut down the Department of Justice. So you have to worry—you just have all these points of danger, and you have to shut them down one by one, the free press being one of the most important.

Now, historically, Americans have seldom cared all that much about corruption and government. People always cite Watergate. But I think one of the things I think we've all learned from the Trump years is: If 1974, if instead of being the worst economic year since the Great Depression, the year of Watergate—if it had been a great economic year, I am no longer very confident that Richard Nixon would've been in much trouble, and that people were ready to hear bad news about Watergate because it was a terrible year economically: inflation and unemployment and oil shortages and gas lines. But 2017, 2018, 2019 were pretty prosperous years. And although the offenses that were happening over those years—not as big as now, but bigger than anything ever seen before—Americans tended to shrug as, by the way, they mostly shrugged through Teapot Dome.

Applebaum: I wonder if it's that or whether it's the extreme, you know, partisanship that we now live in that makes people literally unable to see Trump's corruption. And this is a theme you may also be interested to discuss. I have one or two friends who, during the Biden years, became very angry by what they perceived to be as Biden's corruption—nothing that was ever proven, nothing that was ever shown.

There were a lot of rumors about what Hunter Biden had done or not done. You know, as far as I can see, Hunter Biden was guilty of taking advantage of his father's name, and he got himself appointed to a couple of boards. But there is no—you know, we're not even living in the same world, you know, the world in which it's very bad that Hunter Biden was on a board of a Ukrainian or any other company because of who his surname was, and the world in which the president himself is openly taking hundreds of millions of dollars in de facto bribes from all over the world. These aren't really the same planet.

And yet, you can find people who will say, What about Hunter Biden? Or Joe Biden was very corrupt too. And that's a fallback position that people continue to find very useful. And if you live in the media bubble where you watch Fox News and your information comes from the right, then you probably haven't heard very much about the scale of corruption in the Trump administration, and you've probably heard endlessly about Hunter Biden.

And so that's the other piece of the story that's, I think, maybe even different from the 1970s. I don't think we were that divided. I don't think we were that partisan. I mean, of course, in the 1970s, the other thing that happened was that we had—you know, it was the Republicans, ultimately, who held Nixon to account, and the Republican Senate and the Republican Congress who put pressure on him to resign. And we don't have that anymore either. We're missing this really vital piece of the U.S. Constitution. We're missing—as you said a minute ago, we're missing Congress. And if there are no leaders on the right—if there are no Republican leaders who are willing to stand up to this—then maybe it's not surprising that ordinary Americans who take their steer from their political leaders don't see it either. They're not hearing anyone talk about it. They're not hearing anyone investigate it or say anything about it at all.

Frum: Well, Hunter Biden stands in a long and rather dismal American tradition of the bad relative of the serving president. And there is almost always one of these. Jimmy Carter's brother, Billy. You go through the list. George H. W. Bush had a son who traded on the family name. There's almost always a relative. I think Eisenhower is the only one where all the brothers were as exceptional as Eisenhower himself, each in his own way. Usually, there's a disgraceful relative out there. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's children—my God—they were the Hunter Bidens of their day, and they did all kinds of shady business deals.

But this maybe does create some shadow of permission for those who want to believe in Trump, because if you are minded to ignore what's going on, you can say, Well, every president has a son or brother, a nephew, who is making a dishonest living of hundreds of thousands of dollars by trading on the president's name and selling paintings to people who obviously are not interested in the quality of the art in the painting. And therefore, that practice inures you or predisposes you, as you said, if you're partisan, to say, And therefore, there's no difference between the president himself taking hundreds of millions of dollars—not hundreds of thousands—and using it in a way that that directly influences American politics in ways we can see. 

The crypto industry is going to go unregulated, in part because the crypto industry has directed so much money to Donald Trump. Or the direct benefit—apparently, as best we can tell—to Elon Musk's companies and interests have flowed from his actions in government. These are different kinds of things, but if you want to give yourself permission to cite Franklin Roosevelt's children or Joe Biden's, you can do that, but you're not telling yourself the truth. You're saying, here are two things, and we can apply words to these two quite different things and use words to make them seem similar, even though they're not.

Applebaum: Yeah. No, but it's effective. I mean, you know, I have heard people use this logic and make these arguments, and it seems to be useful in, you know, convincing people who might otherwise have some doubts about Trump and the Trump administration, who might otherwise feel a little uncomfortable about supporting something that's this obviously corrupt.

I mean, there's another mechanism that I'm also worried about, and this is something you get in authoritarian regimes, which is: When you have a political leader who so constantly and repeatedly lies himself—I mean, Trump was lying just the other day about gas prices, for example. He says they're lower than they are. And he will lie about the effect of tariffs as they come in. He lies about things that people can see and feel. I mean, Americans who buy gas know what the price of gas is, you know, so Trump saying it's something else doesn't change that.

But when the president lies like that, he creates, also, an atmosphere where people say, like, The president is lying, and who knows what's really true? I have no idea what any of this means. I'm just going to stay out of it. Like, I'm staying home. I'm not going to involve myself in this totally corrupt, dishonest world that is our political system. I'm not going to participate. I'm not going to engage. How can I have any influence in a world where—as my friend Peter Pomerantsev used this Hanna Arendt quote for his book title, you know—nothing is true and everything is possible? Anything can happen, and I don't have any control on it.

So you can see, you know, the beginnings of, really, an attempt not just to keep journalists out and people who are interested in transparency and accountability out, but also everybody out. You know, nobody's going to want to be part of this completely corrupt system where everyone is bad.

Frum: Some of this, I think, is an unintended result. And I think I'll give two examples from the weekend that I suspect even the politically engaged people who would listen to a podcast like this will recognize in themselves what I'm describing.

So over the weekend just passed, President Trump tweeted about restoring Alcatraz as a federal prison. Now, this can't happen. I mean, Alcatraz is an ancient prison. It's been a federal museum, I think, for half a century. The cells are not to modern standards. You can't do it. And it looks like what happened was a TV station that he was watching had a movie that was set in Alcatraz, and he watched the movie and thought, Alcatraz, I'm going to make that a prison again. And as the whim formed itself in his impulsive brain, he put a message on Truth Social that he wants to do this.

Should you react to that or not? And I think most of us react, I'm not going to react to—that's so obviously something that's not going to happen. That's not a real thing. It's just noise. And I'm sure that's the correct response for each of us as working individuals with finite time and finite energy. You know, you can't react to everything crazy he says, because he says more crazy things than you can have reactions to. On the other hand, it opens a process of endless devaluation of the president's words, that what the president says really doesn't matter.

So in that same weekend, President Trump posted on Truth Social a comment about how he wanted to have tariffs on movies to create an all-in-America movie industry. So that's a little less impossible than turning Alcatraz back into a federal prison. It's also pretty impossible and something that he's probably not going to do. And again, but it's something that could happen, unlike the Alcatraz example. And so should you take the energy—if you're a journalist who writes about these things, if you're a concerned citizen—to react to the movie thing, or should you let that one go?

And there's this endless pushing of just, he says so much stuff that's nonsense that you actually begin—and your more sophisticated peers will say, You're kind of a sucker. It's just something the president said. He says things all the time. You can't react to that. And then when he says, I don't know whether I'm bound to—in the same weekend—I don't know whether I'm bound to obey the Constitution or not, which is something he said, is that something we should dismiss? Is that Trump just gassing? Or is that something that is directionally significant?

So he wears down people, even who are the most committed, by saying so many things that are just ridiculous, but buried in them are little poison barbs of danger.

Applebaum: No, I mean, and he devalues the word of the president. Nobody knows whether to take him seriously or not. And you're right: And then when we come to a moment where it matters what the president says, and it matters what decision he takes, and it matters whether he believes in the Constitution or not, there will be a lot of people who have tuned out because there's so much noise.

You know, the president a couple of days ago posted a photograph of himself dressed as the pope, a kind of AI image of himself—you know, profoundly insulting to millions of Catholics around the world who are still in mourning for the late pope. And all of it contributes to this atmosphere where people just want to say, Well, I don't—this is too much. I can't stand it. I'm not going to participate, and I'm going home. 

And that is that is the quintessential authoritarian tactic, you know? Because what you want is to rule behind a shadow of secrecy. You know, you want to be able to steal the money or take the money and have no one know about it. You want to be enacting, you know, laws and rules of your own design in the dark, without courts, without judges, without attention. And you want the population to be dulled and bored and angry and cynical, and you want them all to stay home. And so we see all that. We've seen this movie before in other countries, I should say, and we're seeing it happen in the United States right now.

Frum: Well, let me wrap up by taking us in a slightly different direction to something that it's a little uncomfortable for us to discuss. When you and I talk about people who do this or people who do that, it's not just a figure of speech. We're talking about people oftentimes who we know personally, know sometimes quite well, because—I think you a little less than me, but I very much come from the conservative political tradition, very much a conservative legal tradition. I was a president of the Federalist Society on a college campus a long time ago. And many of these people are people you also have come into contact with. And we watch people we know, sometimes cynically—or at least at the start, it's cynical, and then it becomes more fanatical—you know, people we knew from the Claremont Colleges, which has somehow become a center of right-wing anti-Constitutionalism.

How do you cope with this in your—and I'm not going to ask you to use names or anything like that—but in your private life, how do you cope with people whom you once held dear going off in these bad paths?

Applebaum: So this was a topic of my previous book, Twilight of Democracy. I had this experience, actually, in multiple countries because—I don't know if you would call me conservative or Republican, but I was certainly an anti-communist, and that put me in that camp for many years. And my friends in Poland, where I lived part of the time, and in London, where I worked for many years, and in the United States also I came from that world. And I watched that world divide in many places.

And it's funny: I thought that in 2016, I'd been through that—in 2015 in Poland, 2016 in the U.S., that I'd been through that, that the divisions had resolved themselves, that the people who were really fanatical and wound up being pro-Trump or fanatically pro-Brexit in some cases, you know, that they had sort of faded out of my life. And then I discovered in this election cycle in 2024 that there were new incidents of it, and there were new friends who were put off, whether it was by transgender issues or whether it was by economic issues, who found themselves wanting to support Trump. And I, frankly, don't cope very well with it. I know some people are better at separating their political views and their private lives than I am. I know a lot of people have relatives who are on the other side of a divide, and they have to live with them because you don't desert your elderly father for something like that.

But I have found it difficult because this story comes so close to, I want to say, values that I hold but also values that I thought all of us shared, you know? So the people who I know and who I consider to be friends, I think of them as people who believe in the rule of law, who support the Constitution, who think, you know, a democratic political system is better, who are bothered by lying in politics. And, you know, it's not that we all share—we don't have to have the same views about everything, but there are these kind of basic values that we share, and I've discovered that that's not true. And I find it now difficult to deal with people who now live in this other reality.

And the thing I'm most afraid of now is that once you made the decision to vote for Trump in 2024, especially—in 2016, it was different because we didn't really know what kind of a president he was going to be. It could have been a protest. You didn't like Hillary Clinton, whatever. There were reasons why people did it. When you chose in 2024, you chose someone who had broken the law in multiple ways, and you knew it. You know, you chose someone who sought to overthrow the results of the election of 2020, and you knew it. So you were choosing someone who you knew to be lawless, who you knew had disdain for American institutions. And I think that the people who made that decision are going to have a lot of trouble backtracking, moving back on it.

I've seen lots of commentary now about, you know, Trump did this or that, you know, Are the people who voted for him going to be sorry now? And I think it's going to be a long time before they're sorry, because they made this intellectual commitment to something that was against many of the things that they stood for. They had to justify it to themselves in many different ways. We just talked about one of them—because, you know, because Biden is corrupt, whatever.

And now it's going to be very hard to turn around and say, That was wrong. You know, it's going to be—you know, they will stick to this. They will go stand by it. They will find new reasons to support Trump, precisely because it was such a bad choice, and precisely because they had to overcome their own internal doubts, and precisely because they know he broke the law, and precisely because they know he has disdain for things that they say that they value. And so I worry that it's going to be very hard to make up with them at some point in the future.

Frum: Anne, let me end with this last, more hopeful thought. Maybe what happens in the lives of countries is: You get these periodic moral crises as a sort of prod to alert us. I mean, American politics was much cleaner after Watergate than it had ever been before. Before the Second World War, America was a democracy for some people; but for many, not. I mean, there's a lot of research now about how much of the Nuremberg laws the Nazis imposed on German Jews in 1935 were based on the everyday practices in southern American states in 1934. And not only did the Nazis notice it, but Americans noticed it, too, and became ashamed. And you wonder: If there hadn't been a World War II, and if there hadn't been a Cold War, would the transition away from racial segregation in this country have been as dramatic and decisive and more or less peaceful as it was?

So maybe this is one of those—I think, doesn't Lincoln say something in the second inaugural address about how this is one of those offenses that needs to come? And maybe it's an offense that needed to come because the people who'd grown up since the Cold War had lost sight of some of the things that we experienced during the Cold War, but why democracy was precious and worth fighting for.

Applebaum: The feeling of losing things and the understanding that something is slipping away can be very dramatic. It can galvanize people to resist. That's true. And you can hear in the national conversation—I had a conversation with a niece yesterday, and I've talked to a lot of other younger people. They feel and understand that something is wrong and that something is being lost, and they are beginning now to reorient themselves to think about how they protect it or how they save it, or how they change the country in ways that make sure it doesn't happen again.

I mean, it may be that, you know, certainly as we've been discussing, there has been a long slide in this direction. You know, it wasn't just as if Trump, you know, arrived in January and suddenly began to do things that had no precedent. I mean, he had a precedent in his first term. The decline of the electoral system began, you know, much longer ago with Citizens United [ v. FEC]. You know, the role of money in politics has been increasing. You can trace—he's part of a path. But he is now creating a crisis that takes us off that slow glide and makes this into a moment that could galvanize people. And you're right. I hope it will.

Frum: Anne, there's never a conversation I have with you where I don't come away feeling I've learned something and maybe also steeled myself to try a little harder and better. So thank you. It's such a pleasure, and it's such a kind act that you would come and talk to me. Bye-bye.

Applebaum: Thank you.

[Music]

Frum: Thanks to Anne Applebaum for that fascinating and inspiring conversation. I'm so grateful to her for joining The David Frum Show. Now I'm going to put in a commercial here for The Atlantic because Anne and I are colleagues there. If you like what you see and hear on The David Frum Show, remember, you can support Anne's work and mine and the work of all Atlantic journalists when you subscribe to the Atlantic at theatlantic.com/listener. Repeat that slowly: theatlantic.com/listener.

And now some questions from viewers and listeners that I'll try my best to answer. The first question is from Soren. Soren writes: “I'm a high-school student in Seattle, and I've noticed many of my peers are deeply polarized, often echoing media talking points and struggling to engage in thoughtful political discussions, especially across party lines. How can I encourage more open, level-headed political conversations among young people who seem entrenched in tribal thinking?”

Well, Soren, I commend you for this open-minded approach and for your patience with your peers, and I salute the question you're asking. It's a difficult problem. And look—it's not like those of us who are older succeed any better at it than those of you who are younger.

I think one thing—I remember doing this when I was in high school and debating with my friends—is sometimes saying, Look—I'll tell you what: I'm going to give you one thing to read, and you can do the same for me. You give me something you want me to read; I'll give you something I'd like you to read. Let's read them both together and then talk about afterwards what we've read. And if you can limit the conversation to what's on the page—no “what about” questions, no Well, what do you also think?—just what's on the page, I think the more you channel a conversation, the more productive it can be. And at the very least, you can introduce your friends to a better quality of reading material than maybe they've been reading so far.

Here's a question from Bruno: “In the latter part of the 19th and first half of the 20th century, working classes supported political movements that bettered their lives against the so-called robber barons. Now it seems they support political movements which worsen their lives to the benefit of billionaires. Why?”

Well, congratulations, Bruno, for putting your finger on one of the most vexed questions in all of American history and political science. In the 19th century, across most of the industrial world—Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Italy—there arose social democratic parties associated with trade unions that tried to advance a worker-focused agenda. The United States never produced such a movement, such a party. Instead, the United States produced protest movements that operated within and against both the Republican and Democratic Parties, never producing a really effective broad-based social democratic movement. So that's the historical part.

To your question about the present day, I think the problem is: In the modern world, the idea of working class is an idea that makes less and less sense. So many people claim to be working class, and it's often very hard to understand exactly what they mean, or they mean contradictory things. Very classic example: Imagine an argument over Thanksgiving dinner between one brother-in-law with a high-school diploma—is working as a car salesman, and in a good year might make $120,000 and in a bad year makes $60,000, but has not that much status in society and is a little insecure about his academic bona fides—and he argues with his brother-in-law who is an adjunct professor at a local college and who makes maybe $45,000 a year but who has a Ph.D. Which of them is working class? Well, they will argue about that all night.

I think just generally, class-based analysis doesn't really work all that well in America, because it's a country with so many differences of people's situations that people often end up transposing class as a marker of attitude and consumption patterns.

I remember, a political scientist named Charles Murray wrote a quiz years ago in which he asked the question, How thick was your bubble? And he had a set of questions, and they were all cultural. What kind of clothes did you wear? What kind of cars did you drive? That's what made you working class. And the idea was: He was very hostile to people who got a lot of their position in society from their levels of education. But if a person with a lot of education is economically precarious and works under the direction and control of others, I don't know what we are saying when we say that that person is or isn't working class.

In 2024, Donald Trump did very well among the most affluent people in society. The Republican vote still skews rich. There are a lot of people who will tell you it doesn't. But the way they get to the claim that the Republican Party is a working-class party is by using education as their metric, rather than income or rather than working under the supervision and control of others.

From Jeff: “At what point will the Trump administration start fudging or outright falsifying economic data, such as jobs reports, inflation measures, and consumer-confidence data, and other traditional information put out by the departments of labor or commerce? And how will we even know the information is bogus?”

This is a great question and an important question. A big part of the project of Elon Musk's DOGE—I don't know if I'm supposed to pronounce it “dog” or “doja”—group was to break a lot of the conveyor belts for reliable public information, not so much to create false information but just to withdraw accurate information. And we see the president himself doing his bit by making up these crazy stories about the price of gasoline, based on strange data sequences like wholesale prices, not the price of the pump.

Mercifully, there is abundant private-sector data on many economic issues that you can get some idea of whether things are right or wrong. The government produces jobs reports, but there is a lot of information on purchasing and things like that that tends to be proprietary and is sometimes expensive. But the people who care about these issues can track and will begin to sound an alert if the government information is wrong. I would worry in the immediate term not about false information but about lacking information, absent information, broken information. That's the direction the Trump administration, with Elon Musk's help, seems to be heading.

And the last question from Colin—he quotes something I said on air in an episode or two back: “I had always thought of myself as a conservative because I believe in things like a strong and robust foreign policy to oppose authoritarians abroad in free markets and personal liberties and in constitutional values that underpin our democracy.” Colin asked, “Well, why do you call those things conservative?”

And I suppose I'm reflecting the world in which I came of age. But in the late 1970s, the question of market or not market, that was a lively debate. And the people who were skeptical of markets proudly identified themselves as being on the left. That was a time when there was a lot of post-Vietnam trauma over America's role in the world. And the people who were more skeptical of that role, who doubted that the United States was a force for good or, anyway, thought that good intentions would likely go awry again, they mostly—not always, but they mostly—identified themselves proudly as being on the left. And so it seemed to me that the people who are opposite those things were the people on the right.

But many of these are deep American values that at normal times are more broadly shared. Unfortunately, we live right now in what is not a normal time. And a lot of the things that I thought of when I was a young Reagan enthusiast in 1980 as belonging to the Republican Party and the conservative movement, they've surrendered those commitments and those beliefs. And it's shameful for them and sad for all the rest of us.

We're in the middle of the worst measles outbreak in 30 years.

by  Dylan Scott

The United States is in the middle of what's shaping up to be the worst measles outbreak of this century. 

The outbreak began within a small religious community in West Texas in January, but it has since spread across four states in the Southwest. Two school-aged children and one adult have died so far. The number of reported cases is set to surpass 1,000 this week — though the real count may be much higher.

The challenge measles presents in 2025 is very different than in the years before a vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. In those days, we had limited defenses against the virus, which was highly contagious and highly dangerous to young children. 

Today, we have perhaps the single best defense we have against any virus: a vaccine that is 97 percent effective in preventing measles, far better than vaccines against diseases like the flu or Covid. We have the means to snuff out measles. We're just not using it, thanks in large part to an anti-science backlash that has gotten fresh momentum with the rise of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation's health agency. 

Now we're in a dangerous moment of backsliding on decades of progress. How did it happen? The following four charts tell the story of how the US is losing the fight against measles — and why:

The January outbreak is now the single largest since the United States managed to eradicate, or end the disease's natural spread in the country, in 2000: Texas has reported 702 cases, New Mexico 67, Kansas 46, and Oklahoma 17 — 832 in total, as of May 6. Since measles was eradicated, most cases in the intervening years have involved international travelers. The US saw more overall cases in 2019 — 1,274 in the final count — but that was the accumulation of several smaller outbreaks started by international travelers that affected Orthodox Jewish communities in New York City.

Some time this month, 2025 will likely surpass 2019 to officially become the worst year of measles overall in the United States since at least 1992, when there were about 2,100 cases.

When I spoke with infectious disease experts in February, as the current outbreak was just beginning to spread, they were concerned but not panicked. They expected the outbreak to remain largely contained to the isolated communities where it began, and that perhaps we would see a few hundred cases. 

But we are well past that line now — and the spread has still been picking up speed. 

There can be a long lag in measles cases being confirmed, but as more data comes in, it appears things are still getting worse. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 111 new infections in the week starting March 30 — the single worst week for new measles cases in the US since the 1990s.

In 2000, the year the US declared measles eradicated, Americans were nearly unanimous in their belief that it was important for parents to get kids vaccinated against a host of diseases, measles included. 

But that consensus has since weakened. Kennedy's appointment underscores the national mood: The former presidential candidate spent much of the past 25 years spreading the debunked claim that childhood vaccinations lead to autism. And what had once been a fringe view is now in the seat of power.

In his role as head of US Health and Human Services, Kennedy has been as much a hindrance as a help. He has paid lip service to the value of vaccines in official statements, but continues to cast doubt on their safety in interviews and tout unproven, sometimes dangerous, alternative treatments. 

Last week, Kennedy announced that the health department would investigate new therapeutics for measles, rather than putting his support behind the MMR shot, which is highly effective in preventing the disease and leads to better outcomes for patients who take it for the first time even after an infection starts.

Vaccination rates are declining in parallel with these attitudes, leaving us a long way from the “herd immunity” vaccination level necessary to contain the virus. 

Experts say that 95 percent or more of an area's schoolchildren need to be vaccinated in order to prevent measles from spreading widely. As recently as the 2019–2020 school year, more than 95 percent of kindergartners nationwide were vaccinated. But as of this year, that number has fallen below 93 percent. 

And even that 93 percent nationwide figure is misleading. Fewer than a dozen states exceed the 95 percent threshold and, in some communities, the share of school-age kids who are vaccinated can be much lower. Some of the Gaines County, Texas, schools where the virus first took hold during the current outbreak had about half of their students protected against measles.

If you are an adult who believes you were vaccinated against measles and fear you may be in the way of the outbreak, there are steps you can take to double-check your immunity. If you're a parent of a young child, it may be worth talking to your doctor about what your options are for getting your kid vaccinated early. I have 3-year-old twins who received their first dose around age 1 and, on the advice of their doctor, will get a second in the coming days, about a year ahead of schedule.

It's the kind of precaution that would have been unthinkable — and wholly unnecessary — a decade ago. But things have changed. This is the new reality that we are living in.

We're about to get our first window into whether the judiciary will allow Trump's trade war to continue.

by  Ian Millhiser

On Tuesday, May 13, a three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade will hear a lawsuit asking it to strike down President Donald Trump's recently imposed tariffs. The case is known as V.O.S. Selections v. Trump.

The trade court, a New York-based federal court that hears lawsuits related to US trade laws, will not be the last word on this high-stakes dispute, which is likely to wind up before the Supreme Court. The trade court, however, is poised to have the first word — meaning the May 13 hearing will offer the American public its earliest window into how federal courts view the tariffs.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The plaintiffs in V.O.S. Selections, small businesses that import goods and thus must pay the tariffs, have two significant advantages. 

One is that their legal arguments are quite strong. Under the Supreme Court's “major questions doctrine,” courts are supposed to cast a skeptical eye on, and typically reject, executive actions “of vast ‘economic and political significance.'”

According to the Yale Budget Lab, Trump's tariffs are expected to reduce the average US household's income by the equivalent of $4,900. If that's not a matter of vast economic and political significance, it's hard to imagine what is.

Two, about a dozen former Republican officials and other GOP luminaries filed an amicus brief calling on the trade court to rule that the tariffs are illegal. They include three former senators, a former US attorney general, and several former federal judges. Among them is former Sen. John Danforth, a mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas who gave Thomas his first job out of law school. The Supreme Court's Republican majority is often responsive to conservative legal elites and prominent members of their party.

That said, it is far from certain how the trade court — and, ultimately, the Supreme Court — will see this case. The major questions doctrine is brand new, and it has only been used in the past to strike down policies created by the Biden administration.

Broadly speaking, the courts could decide V.O.S. Selections (or any of several other lawsuits challenging the tariffs) in one of three ways:

The IEEPA permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” This power, however, “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.”

The strongest statutory argument against the tariffs is that Trump has not identified an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that can justify these tariffs. In his executive order laying out the rationale for most of his tariffs, Trump claims they are necessary due to “large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits,” meaning that the fact that there are many countries that buy more US goods than they sell to Americans constitutes a “national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve.”

But, as the amicus brief argues, this trade deficit is hardly unusual or extraordinary — rather, it is the result of “economic trends spanning more than two decades.” Emergency powers, the brief argues, cannot be used to address “longstanding policy grievances” that have existed for many years — those are the sort of grievances that can be addressed through legislative debate and congressional action. Emergency executive action, the argument goes, should be reserved for actual emergencies where there is no time for Congress to act.

In response, the Trump administration argues that courts may not review a president's decision to declare a national emergency. It even cites a federal district court decision claiming that “no court has ever reviewed the merits of such a declaration.” 

While that may very well be true, the IEEPA does not simply say that the president must declare an emergency before using any powers granted by that statute. It uses much stronger language, saying that these powers “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.” Thus, even if courts cannot review Trump's decision to declare an emergency, opponents of the tariffs have a strong argument that judges can inquire into whether decades-old trade deficits actually constitute an “unusual or extraordinary threat.”

Even if the IEEPA can be read to permit tariffs, the major questions doctrine suggests that courts should read the statute narrowly if it is at all possible to do so. As the Supreme Court said in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014), “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'” That is, if a law doesn't explicitly grant the executive branch a power, it doesn't have that power.

In response, Trump's lawyers make two closely related arguments. They claim that the major questions doctrine does not apply to actions taken by the president, and that it especially does not apply to presidential actions that touch upon foreign policy. As Trump's brief claims, “the major-questions doctrine has never been applied to the President's authority to address national-security interests or other circumstances where the President has independent authority.”

That statement is true. Again, the major questions doctrine is brand new and has never been used to strike down the policies of any president not named “Joe Biden.” All of the Biden-era cases invoking this doctrine involved domestic policies that technically were promulgated by agency leaders under Biden's supervision (or, in one case, a holdover policy from the Obama administration) rather than by a direct order from Biden himself.

It is difficult to predict how the courts will respond to Trump's arguments. The major questions doctrine was made up by the Supreme Court and appears nowhere in the Constitution or in any federal statute, so lower court judges have very little to go upon when they are asked to apply it to new situations. 

To my knowledge, only one federal judge — Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee — has addressed the question of whether this doctrine applies to presidential actions. Nelson concluded that it does, in large part because the Supreme Court rooted this doctrine in separation-of-powers concerns that apply equally to any member of the executive branch, including the head of it.

It is also unclear how the courts will respond to Trump's suggestion that the major questions doctrine applies with less force on matters of foreign policy. It is true that the courts are often deferential to the elected branches on questions of foreign affairs, but Trump's tariffs aren't just a foreign policy matter. They are one of the largest tax hikes in recent American history and one of the most consequential domestic policies enacted in many years. Trump justifies the tariffs in large part because he believes they will increase the number of Americans employed in domestic manufacturing jobs.

White House policy is being hatched in elite conservative bubbles.

by  Zack Beauchamp

Conservatives frequently accuse liberals of being out of touch with Americans. It's an accusation that stings partly because there's truth behind it: Real evidence suggests that liberal institutions, the Democratic Party chief among them, inhabit a moral universe distinct from that of the median voter.

Yet far less attention has been paid to the disconnect between the right's intellectual elite and the American public. Liberal intellectuals live in an unrepresentative world, but so too do the right's thinkers — causing them to develop an idea of America that is largely unmoored from the country most Americans experience. 

And in the Donald Trump era, this disconnect may be the more influential one.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

This right-wing elite bubble is perhaps most precisely described as two bubbles.

The first bubble is created by the overwhelmingly left-liberal tilt of elite knowledge production industries — most notably journalism and academia, but, to a lesser extent, law and tech. Conservatives in these areas often feel outnumbered and even persecuted in their professional life, creating a sense that the left is far more socially powerful in America than it actually is.

The second bubble is a reaction to the first bubble: the creation of internally homogenous spaces within these liberal fields. These are spaces where conservatives talk primarily with each other about liberals and the left, often exacerbating their shared sense of threat.

Fox News and the Federalist Society are two of the most influential institutions of the second bubble: islands of right-wing thought in fields where liberals predominate. But they are hardly alone. A host of other spaces, ranging from formal institutions like the Heritage Foundation to some billionaire-created group chats, serve as venues for right-wing professionals to talk politics among themselves.

There's nothing wrong with ideological movements hammering out ideas among themselves. However, there is always a danger in such spaces of groupthink and caricaturing one's opponents. Increasingly, both are happening inside the right's bubble — and warping its view of the country in the process.

In the past few years, there has been a cottage industry of right-wing intellectuals arguing that American culture and society have become fundamentally hostile to people like them. In their view, the right's embrace of Trumpian authoritarianism is not an act of political aggression, but a defensive response against a near-omnipotent cultural left intent on wiping conservatives off the face of the earth.

This is not, of course, America as it actually exists. Real America is a place where evangelical Christians are the largest religious group, the Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, and Donald Trump won the presidency twice.

Yet this caricature of the country has taken deep root among right-wing elites. It is a belief given life by the right's experiences inside left-wing professions, and then strengthened and radicalized in the spaces they've carved out as alternatives.

In prior years, this right-doomerism may have seemed like a sideshow confined to a handful of intellectuals. But in the second Trump administration, its adherents are helping shape policy in a host of key sectors, ranging from immigration to education to science to foreign policy. 

The carnage in those areas is, in no small part, these right-wingers swinging axes that have been ground for decades.

Generally speaking, most people who write about political ideas professionally are in one of two fields: journalism or academia. The data suggests that these fields really are dominated by liberals and the left. You're often equally likely to encounter a socialist as a conservative; in some academic fields, Marxists and critical theorists vastly outnumber people on the right.

This can understandably make conservatives in these spaces feel uncomfortable, or even unwelcome. But some of them go much further than that: They argue the ideological culture of the university is in fact the ideological culture of America, and that conservatives writ large are in the same position as the academic minority.

This move is central to the argument of Regime Change, Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen's 2023 book. One of the foremost Trump-aligned intellectuals — JD Vance endorsed his book, and Pete Hegseth was a former Deneen student — he believes America is being corrupted by left-wing rot that begins in the university.

“Universities…are today in the forefront of advancing new principles of despotism,” he argues. “These educational institutions help shape the worldviews and expectations of the managerial ruling class, who then deploy to a variety of settings where those lessons come to shape most of the main organizations that govern daily life.”

This overheated rhetoric grew out of Deneen's own experience in the academic bubble. In 2004, Princeton denied him tenure — a decision that he has publicly blamed on anti-conservative discrimination. In 2012, he left Georgetown for Notre Dame on the grounds that the former had become so secular and liberal that he could not feel comfortable there. “I have felt isolated and often lonely at the institution where I have devoted so many of my hours and my passion,” he wrote in a contemporary letter to his Georgetown students.

One can sympathize with Deneen's feelings of alienation without accepting his caricature of America as a giant faculty lounge. Yet despite Regime Change's analytic flaws (you can read my review here), it found friendly reception among many like-minded thinkers on the right, including Michael Anton, a longtime fellow at the pro-Trump Claremont Institute who is currently serving as the State Department's director of policy planning. 

“The main divide in conservative ranks today is between those who see clearly what the Left has done and those who deny it — and attack anyone to their right who notices. Say what you will about Patrick Deneen, he's on the right — in both senses of that term — side of this divide,” Anton wrote in the Claremont Review of Books.

When Anton speaks of “those who see clearly what the Left has done,” he is not speaking purely in abstract terms. There are discrete and concrete institutions and networks, including Claremont itself, where people who share this sense of being under cultural attack by the left-wing elite. These are places where fantastical pictures of America as a place in the grips of a liberal plot are not seen as caricatures, but bleakly accurate accounts of 21st-century life.

In such spaces, it becomes normal to treat America as a place where right-wing Americans are not just outnumbered, but on the verge of extinction. In one infamous 2021 essay, Claremont fellow Glenn Ellmers writes that “most people living in the United States today—certainly more than half—are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the term.”

For this reason, he argues that “the political practices, institutions, and even rhetoric governing the United States have become hostile” and that “the mainline churches, universities, popular culture, and the corporate world are rotten to the core.” In reaction, he writes, conservatives must prepare for a “counterrevolution,” possibly a violent one — writing that “strong people are harder to kill, and more useful generally.”

Ellmers's essay reflects a level of radicalism that permeates right-wing intellectual spaces. And now, such ideas are shaping policy.

We know this, in part, because some denizens of the right's intellectual bubble are now in top positions. Vance is vice president. Hegseth, a longtime Fox News personality, is the secretary of defense. Anton occupies one of the top positions at State, where he serves with Darren Beattie, an aggrieved former Duke PhD who was pushed out of the first Trump White House for associating with white nationalists.

But we also know it because of the policies being put in place. Hegseth, for example, has spent less time trying to fix American warfighting capabilities than waging culture war on alleged leftists at the Pentagon. Beattie is leading an internal inquiry into the political activities of State Department staff that one official there describes as a “witch hunt.”

Perhaps the clearest case is the preoccupation with destroying America's elite universities through federal funding cuts and revocation of tax-exempt status. The Trump approach here is widely credited to Manhattan Institute senior fellow Chris Rufo, who has made the notion of an America poisoned by New Left radicals in the faculty lounge the central principle of his career as a writer and activist.

“The most sophisticated activists and intellectuals of the New Left initiated a new strategy, the ‘long march through the institutions,' which brought their movement out of the streets and into the universities, schools, newsrooms, and bureaucracies,” he writes in his book America's Cultural Revolution. “Over the subsequent decades, the cultural revolution that began in 1968 transformed, almost invisibly, into a structural revolution that changed everything.”

At the end of the book, Rufo (like Ellmers) calls for a “counterrevolution” against the left. The Trump administration's demolition derby shows us what this looks like in practice.

AI is the future. It just can't predict it.

by  Dylan Matthews

Being able to predict the future seems nice. I would've liked to know that my S&P 500 index funds would peak in mid-February and then fall off a cliff in April. It would've been helpful for my reporting in the lead-up to the inauguration to know just how far the Trump administration would go to attack foreign aid. And while I'm at it, I'd like some sense of where mortgage rates are going, so I can better judge when to buy a house.

The art of systematically making these kinds of predictions is called forecasting, and we've known for a long time that some people — so-called superforecasters — are better at it than others. But even they aren't Nostradamuses; major events still surprise them sometimes. Superforecasters' work takes time and effort, and there aren't many of them. 

It's also hard for us mortals to emulate what makes them so effective. I wrote a whole profile of one of the world's best superforecaster teams, called the Samotsvety group, and despite their tips and tricks, I didn't leave the experience as a superforecaster myself. 

But you know what's sometimes better at learning than I am? AI models. 

In recent years, the forecasting community has increasingly pivoted to trying to build and learn from AI-fueled prediction bots. More specialized fields have, of course, been doing this in various forms for a while; algorithmic trading in financial markets, for instance, where computer programs using various prediction tools trade assets without human intervention, has been around for decades. But using AI as a more general-purpose forecasting tool is a newer idea.

Everyone I spoke with in the field agrees that the top human forecasters still beat machines. 

The best evidence for this comes from tournaments run quarterly by Metaculus, a leading prediction website, where participants compete to forecast the future most accurately. Originally for humans only, Metaculus recently began bot tournaments, where contestants enter custom-made AI-driven bots whose track record can then be compared to the best human predictors. 

So far there, we have results for three quarters — Q3 and Q4 of 2024, and Q1 of 2025 — and in each quarter, Metaculus's human superforecasters beat the best machines. (If you want to try, there's a $30,000 prize for each quarter's winner.)

But the gap, Metaculus CEO Deger Turan tells me, is narrowing with each quarter. More intriguing still is the fact that the best model in Q1 this year was incredibly simple: It just pulled some recent news articles, then asked o1, at the time the most advanced OpenAI model, to make its own prediction. This approach couldn't beat humans, but it beat a lot of AI models that were much more sophisticated.

o1 is no longer the cutting-edge OpenAI model; as of this writing, it's o3. And by some metrics, o3 isn't as good as Gemini 2.5 Pro, the best model from Google DeepMind. All of which is to say: While humans basically stay the same, the AIs are only getting better, and that could mean that the predictions they make will only get better as well. 

Almost every arena of human life relies on good prediction. Lawyers predict whether or not their opponent will agree to a settlement. Construction supervisors predict when a building project will finish. Movie producers predict what script will be a hit. Singles predict whether the person they're chatting up would prefer a first date over coffee or beer.

We're not very good at these predictions right now, but we could get much, much better soon. We're only just starting to realize the implications of that kind of shift.

In theory, an “AI forecaster” is just a program that relies upon machine learning models of one form or another to predict future events.

Prediction is at the heart of what machine learning models do: They analyze vast reams of data and then come up with models that can predict outside that data. For generative models like ChatGPT or Claude or Midjourney, that means predicting the next word or pixel that a user wants in response to a query. For the algorithmic trading models that financiers have been building at least since the founding of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies in 1982, it means predicting the future path of asset prices in stock, bond, and other markets, based on past performance.

For more generalized predictions about world events, forecasters these days tend to rely heavily on general-purpose models from firms like xAI, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, or Anthropic. These are trained with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of GPUs over several months, which is one reason why it's much more promising for the relatively small teams working on using AI for forecasting to piggyback on all that training than to start from scratch. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent. One of Anthropic's early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect.)

Forecasting is a world unto itself, with plenty of forecasting-specific jargon and references. Here's a brief guide to some common terms you'll hear in the forecasting world.

Base rate: The historical rate at which a given phenomenon happens (e.g., the rate at which countries go to war, or the percentage of days when the S&P 500 drops overall), before adjusting for specifics of a given case. Establishing your base rate is often the first step in forecasting.

Brier score: A common measure of how accurate forecasts turn out to be. Computed using a formula measuring the distance between a forecaster's assigned probabilities and actual outcomes.

Calibration: How well the probabilities a forecaster assigns to events happening match up with whether they actually happen — e.g., do events the forecaster estimates as 70 percent likely occur 70 percent of the time?

Metaculus: A popular website where forecasters can make predictions and compare accuracy. Not structured like a prediction market.

Prediction market: A stock-type market, usually online, where participants can bet real currency, cryptocurrency, or play money on specific events happening or not. Kalshi, Polymarket, and Manifold are popular prediction markets.

Scope sensitivity: The ability to reason clearly about the scale of different phenomena. An important attribute of good forecasters.

Superforecaster: A human whose forecasts are reliably much more accurate, and better calibrated, than the average human's.

One team based at the Center for AI Safety released a paper in October 2024 claiming “superhuman” forecasting ability by simply prompting a large language model (in this case, OpenAI's 4o model) and scraping recent news articles. That claim crumbled under scrutiny: Other researchers could not replicate the finding, and it appeared that the model could predict well in training partly because it had more recent data than it should've, a problem called “data contamination.” 

Imagine if you are, in late 2024, trying to train a model to predict who the Democratic nominee that year will be; you know it will be Kamala Harris, but to train the model, you try to only give it data from before that became obvious. If that data, though, isn't purely from early 2024, and includes references to Harris's eventual nomination, your forecast could perform very well, but only because it has access to data it'd never have in a real-world context.

A more promising approach comes from UC Berkeley computer scientists Danny Halawi, Fred Zhang, Chen Yueh-Han, and Jacob Steinhardt. Their forecaster also relied on language models, but did extensive amounts of “scaffolding”: instead of simply letting the bot run free, they asked the language model to do a series of very specific things, in a very specific order, to get the final result:

Just asking the language models directly, they found, led to terrible predictions: “Most models' scores are around or worse than random guessing,” the team wrote in their paper. But once they were able to fine-tune models by showing what thousands of successful predictions (and their underlying reasoning) looked like, the results were much better.

The resulting forecasting bot got 71.5 percent of questions correct. By comparison, the human prediction website the researchers used for comparison took the average prediction of their participants and got 77 percent accuracy. That human comparator isn't as good as the best superforecasters, but it's certainly better than random chance.

The takeaway: The AI forecaster is not quite up to human level, and certainly not up to the level of human “superforecasters” who beat the crowd. But it's not too far away.

That's impressive, but progress since has been fairly slow. “Arguably, from an academic perspective, nothing has surpassed [UC Berkeley's] Steinhardt's paper, which is now a full year old,” Dan Schwarz, CEO of the startup FutureSearch, which builds AI-based forecasting tools, told me. 

A full year may not sound like much, but that's because you're thinking in human terms. In the world of AI, a year is an eternity. ​That fact underlines something Schwarz and other entrepreneurs working on AI for forecasting told me: this stuff is harder than it looks.

One limitation is, ironically, that language models are not great quantitative thinkers or logical reasoners. Some common forecasting questions take the form of “will X event happen by Y date”: “Will China invade Taiwan by 2030,” or “Will China invade Taiwan by 2040.” One logical implication is that, for a given question, the odds should stay the same or increase as the date gets later into the future: since “China invading before 2040” includes all future where “China invades before 2030,” the odds of it happening by 2040 should, at the very least, not be lower than the odds of it happening by 2030.

But language models don't think logically and systematically enough to know that. Turan, the CEO of forecasting platform Metaculus, notes that a few bots that entered into the platform's contests have tried to impose this kind of consistency on them and were designed so as to force forecasts to be internally consistent. “They end up having way better results,” Turan says. Phil Godzin, a software engineer who won the fourth-quarter 2024 contest, has explained that the first step in his model is “asking an LLM to group related questions together and predict them in batches to maintain internal consistency.”

This limitation may become less important due to the dawn of “reasoning models,” like OpenAI's o3/o4-mini and DeepSeek's R1. These models differ from previous language models in that they undergo extensive late-stage training to ensure they give correct answers to logical and mathematical questions that can be easily checked (like “how many ‘r's are in ‘strawberry'”). They are also typically designed to use more computing power when queried, to ensure these kinds of questions are answered accurately. In theory, this evolution in the models should make consistency in forecasts easier to maintain, though it's too soon to see if this advantage shows up in practice.

Schwarz of FutureSearch cites poor web research skills as a crucial bottleneck. Despite rollouts of flashy features like ChatGPT's “Deep Research” mode, collation of basic facts about a given situation is still a major challenge for AI models.

FutureSearch this week revealed Deep Research Bench, an attempt to provide a benchmark for web-based research done by leading LLMs. It finds that, as of May 2025, even the best models struggle mightily with routine research tasks. The “Find Number” task, for instance, asked models to find a specific data point (e.g., how many FDA medical device recalls there have been in history). The best model, OpenAI o3, got a score of 69 percent on that; many got less than half right, and DeepSeek R1, which made a splash a few months ago, got less than a third.

The models did even worse at more complex tasks, like locating whole data sets. The best overall score, from o3, was 0.51 out of 1. FutureSearch estimates that a competent, smart, but fallible human should be able to get 0.8. “We can conclude that frontier agents under low elicitation substantially underperform smart generalist researchers who are given ample time,” the authors conclude.

Steinhardt, the Berkeley statistician who coauthored last year's paper, frames the situation a bit more positively. Sure, AIs have limitations, but ChatGPT was introduced just two and a half years ago, and they're already nipping at humans' heels. “I'd guess that if you applied the best-known forecasting ideas to the best AI systems today, you'd outperform the best human forecasters working as a group,” Steinhardt says. “Why is it good at this? Because humans are just really, really bad forecasters.”

Good forecasting requires you to be honest about your mistakes and to learn from them; to change your views all the time, by little increments, rather than suddenly and all at once; and to not be distracted by what's prominently in the news and being discussed around you, but give proper weight to all the information you're receiving.

Humans aren't especially good at any of that. We tend to base our beliefs on many topics on a single piece of information, often information that isn't even relevant. We give much more weight to information that is easier to recall or more readily available, whether or not it's more important. We're absolutely terrible at thinking about scope — even experts struggle to give, say, a thousand times the weight to a number in the billions compared to the millions. It stands to reason that AIs could be better at all of this.

Superforecasting, the bible of the whole field of general-purpose forecasting, came out in 2015. The psychologist who coauthored it, the University of Pennsylvania's Philip Tetlock, based it on research that had been ongoing for decades before that. 

Yet it's fair to say that, friendly coverage from folks like me aside, the idea that there are clear strategies that enable you to better predict the future hasn't set the world on fire. When the New York Times reports on border tensions in India and Pakistan, it does not cite superforecasters' view on likely outcomes. The White House does not ask superforecasters for a prediction on how China might respond to higher tariffs. Investing firms don't get into bidding wars to hire the best superforecasters to project trends.

This raises an important corollary question: If the world doesn't have a ton of demand for human superforecasting, would that change at all if it's done by machines? Why should AI superforecasting be different?

This worry might account for the relatively small scale of most AI forecasting efforts. Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other leading labs aren't prioritizing it. A few small startups, like FutureSearch, ManticAI (a top performer on the Metaculus competitions), and Lightning Rod Labs, are. Presumably, if the big labs thought that superhuman forecasting were a big economic game-changer, they'd invest more in it. Certainly, that's what a superforecaster would surmise.

That said, there are good reasons to think superhuman AI forecasting that is forecasting better than the best humans today would be a big deal. Human forecasters require time, energy, and resources to make good forecasts; they can't spit out an accurate probability estimate in a matter of minutes. A good AI model, in theory, could. 

Compare how useful a research librarian who takes a few weeks to send you a stack of useful books would have been before the dawn of the internet, to the ability to search Google today. Both give you useful outputs. A good librarian's output might even be more useful. But getting results instantly is incredibly important, and massively increases demand for the service.

Ben Turtel, a cofounder of Lightning Rod AI, imagines his forecasting AI being especially useful in cases where someone has a lot of unstructured data that the forecaster can evaluate quickly. Take, for instance, a nurse or doctor trying to anticipate a patient's trajectory based on scattered notes in their medical records, plus evidence from studies correlating outcomes with patient attributes like whether they smoke or their age. That is a difficult task for which there is no one recipe. Having a model that can instantly and accurately combine patient-specific data with broader evidence, and provide a prognosis with a probability, would ease their jobs considerably.

Similarly, companies that operate abroad often pay for political risk consultants that purport to tell them, say, “how dangerous is it to be working in Jordan right now,” or “what are the odds that a coup happens in Myanmar while we're working there.” Demonstrably superhuman AI forecasting might change that work considerably, and could threaten a lot of those consultancies — if those AI forecasts were trusted.

The “if trusted” part, though, is key. An AI superforecaster would be, if nothing else, a deeply strange entity. Imagine going up to America's octogenarian president and saying, “We made an oracle out of silicon, and it is now better at predicting wars than the CIA. You need to listen to it, and not your advisers with millennia of combined experience.” The whole scenario feels laughable. Even if you can prove a model is better than human experts on some class of problems, there'll be a long way to go before relevant decision-makers would truly believe and internalize that fact. 

The black-box nature of modern LLMs is part of the problem: If you ask one for a prediction, we don't ultimately know what computation it's doing to come to that answer. We might see a hybrid period first, where LLMs are asked for explanations of their predictions and decision makers only act on their judgment if the explanations make sense. Even still, acting on AI advice in some contexts, like medicine, could open risk-averse providers and administrators to lawsuits or worse.

But we can get accustomed to what feels strange. A good model here might be Wikipedia. In the 2000s, the website was popular and gradually improving in quality, but there were strong norms against citing it or relying upon it. Anyone could edit it; obviously it couldn't be trusted. But over time, those norms eroded as it became clear that on many topics, Wikipedia was equally or more accurate than more traditional sources.

AI prediction bots might follow a similar trajectory. First, they're a curiosity. Then they're a guilty pleasure that many secretly count on. Finally, we accept that they're onto something, and they begin shaping the way we all make decisions.

Yes, protein builds muscle. No, you don't need as much as lifting influencers say.

by  Marina Bolotnikova

If you've spent any time on the internet over the last several years, you may have noticed the profusion of two closely linked trends — one very positive, the other its warped refraction. 

Lots of Americans have taken up weightlifting, and partly as a result, protein maximalism has become the macronutrient fad du jour, like the low-fat diets of the 1980s and low-carb in the early 2000s. With the encouragement of fitness YouTubers, social media influencers, and even some opportunistic dietitians, the people are pouring “ultra-filtered” high-protein milk over their protein cereal, dumping protein powder into homemade cookie dough, and rediscovering their taste for meat, not that it had ever really been forgotten. 

Many of us, the fitfluencers claim, aren't getting enough protein, the macronutrient that's essential to building muscle and pretty much anything else structural in the body. To get stronger, they say, you need to eat one gram of protein per pound of body weight per day (that would be 200 grams for the average American man, who weighs about 200 pounds), or maybe even more. If you're a woman, especially an older one, be sure to consume massive servings of protein after each workout, they insist. And if you'd prefer to avoid animal products for ethical reasons, too bad, because you definitely, they warn, shouldn't get all your protein from plants. 

For a long time, most of the nutrition advice taken as gospel in the online weightlifting world confused me because it was entirely at odds with my own experience. Although my trajectory can only speak for me, and shouldn't be interpreted as nutrition advice for anyone else, it bears mentioning that I can appreciate the importance of protein better than most: I'm highly active, both running and lifting weights. I've built plenty of muscle without tracking my protein intake, without ever consuming protein powder, and without eating any animal protein. (Of course, you should check with your own doctors before starting any new health or diet regimen.)

One random, representative day last month, I counted up my protein and found I'd eaten about 90 grams — certainly less than the widely repeated “golden rule” recommending one gram per pound of body weight, but more than enough for my needs. If you learn about strength training from internet gurus, though, you'd be forgiven for thinking that lifting weights is a waste of time unless you're also crushing implausible volumes of protein.

It's a myth that's flat-out “not true,” Stuart Phillips, a professor in the department of kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada, and one of the world's foremost experts on protein for muscle building, told me. 

“It's baloney,” he said. “But there's a generation, particularly young men, and now an increasing number of young women, who are absolutely brainwashed by what they hear online.” 

I'll get to what a saner, more evidence-based protein goal would look like in a moment. But first, I hear you asking, what's the harm in aiming for a nice round number for protein (like one gram per pound of weight), just to be extra safe? 

For one thing, Phillips pointed out, extreme protein intake recommendations can make exercise feel unattainable. If you think you have to force yourself to wolf down 200 grams to make any progress, why bother? It also promotes needless rigidity and reduces flexibility in our diets. 

An arguably greater concern is that protein mania pushes people to eat more animal products. While it's not very hard to get enough plant-based protein to maximize muscle growth (I actually get more protein than the average American woman, according to CDC data, without consuming any animal products) it does get harder to rely on plants when protein maximization becomes an end in itself. Plus, many people simply hear “eat more protein” as “eat meat.” And the meat industry (along with eggs and dairy) is, to put it plainly, a grievous moral tragedy that we should avoid encouraging people to give more money to without reason. 

It's also wrecking the environment, and from a public health perspective, most Americans (yes, even those who work out) would benefit from eating less of it and more fiber-rich plant-based proteins. Against this context, there is something downright diabolical about liftfluencers brain-poisoning their followers into thinking that beans are a bad source of protein. 

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

Nutrition is a topic liable to scramble even the most rational minds. There are so many variables you could optimize and over-optimize for. It's also very hard to study, because researchers need to look at associations between foods and health outcomes over entire lifetimes and untangle correlation from causation. It helps to keep in mind that two things can be true at once: Understanding your protein needs undoubtedly matters for physically active people, but sometimes it's best not to overthink it. Protein deficiency is vanishingly rare in the developed world, and you're likely already getting enough to be able to gain strength. You don't have to run on egg whites and chicken breast to be a swole hottie. 

If you want to get into any sort of exercise, first, throw out the one gram of protein per pound of body weight rule, because it is fake. 

It's not entirely clear why that bit of bro science has caught on, though it's possible that it stems from a fatal misreading of the scientific literature. In any case, Phillips explained, for gaining muscle, the evidence indicates that the benefits of eating more protein top out at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day (or 1.6 grams per kilogram, as it's notated in scientific papers, but for clarity's sake, I'll stick to grams per pound). Above that level, he said, “the net gain is so small that for most normal people, you're not going to find” much difference. 

Nor do you have to fuss about hitting exactly 0.73 grams per pound of body weight, or creating a large buffer above it. It's an upper bound beyond which benefits tend to plateau, not a minimum. Eat below that level, and you'll still build muscle and see plenty of benefits from weightlifting because each incremental increase in protein only yields small gains in strength. Just doing the exercise is more important for gaining strength than piling on more protein. 

Phillips recommends that weightlifters aim for between 0.54 and 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. Advanced lifters who have been training for years don't necessarily need more. For a 170-pound woman (about the national average), that range comes out to between 92 and 124 grams. Compared to the one-gram-per-pound benchmark, which would tell her to eat at least 170 grams, that's a difference of one to three servings of chicken breast, or two to three cups of plain Greek yogurt (cows suffer a lot for that!). 

What about if, like many Americans, you're not very physically active? What's the lower bound for protein intake? 

The long-accepted guideline, or recommended dietary allowance (RDA), for adults, is at least 0.36 grams per pound of body weight, or about 61 grams for a 170-pound person. Beyond that, no one really knows what the ideal level of protein consumption is, and Phillips emphasizes that the RDA should only be considered a minimum for preventing deficiency rather than an optimum (it should be noted, though, that the RDA is designed with some slack, so falling slightly below it doesn't mean you'll automatically become deficient). Some experts, including Phillips, believe protein intake guidelines should be higher.

According to this school of thought, sedentary adults should eat closer to 0.45 grams of protein per pound of weight (25 percent more than the RDA), and older adults, who are more prone to muscle loss and impaired nutrient absorption, should get 0.54 grams per pound. Research on the benefits of higher protein intakes in older adults is mixed, however, as nutrition PhD Alice Callahan recently reported in the New York Times. Seniors have other, related health complications, like not eating enough overall, not getting physical activity, and social isolation.

Muscle loss in older adults is “mostly because they're sedentary,” Stanford nutrition professor Christopher Gardner told me. “To say you could take this depressed, lonely person with lousy teeth and give them a protein powder, that sarcopenia [muscle loss] would go away is ridiculous.” Again, actually using your muscles is far and away the most effective way to keep and grow them. 

One surprising upshot of all this is that ideal protein intakes for sedentary people and active people may not be as far apart as you might think. Average people might benefit from exceeding the RDA for protein somewhat, while weightlifters, contrary to the meathead stereotype, don't need a massive amount more. 

For many, many years, I've been getting the most boring question there is in plant-based nutrition: Where do you get your protein? 

There are infinite ways to get lots of protein on a plant-based diet. Here's one way I did it: 

Breakfast: Oats (1/4 cup dry steel-cut, but regular rolled oats are totally fine) with 3/4 cup soy milk, walnuts, ground flaxseed, and a banana. 16 grams protein, 488 calories

Lunch: Lentil soup (1/4 cup dry red lentils) with veggies, a tortilla, and an apple with 1/4 cup peanut butter. 32 grams protein, 776 calories

Snack: A plum and a toasted tortilla with 2 tablespoons hummus. 5 grams protein, 200 calories

Dinner: Braised tofu veggie stir-fry served with brown rice (about 1/3 cup dry). (Recipe here; I used both extra firm and super firm tofu and had half a block of tofu per serving. I also made some adaptations like adding bok choy and baking the tofu instead of frying it.) 38 grams protein, 757 calories

Total: 91 grams protein, 2,221 calories (like I said, I'm an active girlie!)

Virtually all whole foods have protein — not just those we think of as protein sources. But legumes are the most protein-dense plant foods, and I often have them at every meal of the day — soy milk in the morning and beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, or mock meats at lunch and dinner.

One last tip: If you're going plant-based, supplementing vitamin B12 is a must because it isn't found in modern plant-based diets. It may also be a good idea if you're reducing animal products — talk to your doctor.

It's boring because vegans and vegetarians have no problem meeting their protein needs. But in the field of sports nutrition, where demands on the body are especially great, it's taken some time for researchers to overcome the cultural bias against plant-based protein. 

“Everything we have done where we've compared plant to animal [protein], we find that the difference falls within the margin of error,” according to Phillips, who says he's changed his mind about plant-based proteins over the years, after seeing evidence trickle in that it's just as good for muscle gain as animal protein. Just a few weeks ago, a beef industry-funded randomized control trial from researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found no difference in muscle growth between lifters on vegan and omnivorous diets (participants in that study, by the way, ate 0.5 to 0.54 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily). 

If you're looking to reduce or eliminate animal products, which is something I'd encourage anyone to try to do, there are a few differences to keep in mind about plant protein. First, while some in the fitness space have perpetuated the idea that on a plant-based diet it's necessary to combine different foods with complementary amino acids at each meal to get “complete” proteins, this is widely recognized as untrue, Gardner said. Instead, eating a variety of foods — legumes, grains, nuts, vegetables — throughout the day will deliver enough of each amino acid. (It's also not true that plant proteins lack certain amino acids, he said. Rather, all amino acids are present in all plant foods, but some in smaller quantities.) 

Second, our bodies absorb somewhat less of the protein from whole plant foods than from animal foods, which is something to be aware of, but it's not that much less — certainly not enough to make or break a workout routine. The absorption gap attenuates when eating plant foods that have undergone processing — like tofu, tempeh, soy milk, seitan, an Impossible burger, or plant-based protein powder — compared to whole beans and legumes. 

And although many plant protein sources, unlike meat, come packaged with carbs and fiber and therefore have less protein as a share of calories than animal foods, many vegans (myself included) would tell you that with some basic nutritional knowledge, they find it to be a piece of cake to consistently exceed the RDA for protein, and often double it, on plant foods alone. 

In recent years, Gardner told me, nutrition science's messaging has shifted away from an emphasis on specific nutrients (“protein good” or “fat bad”) and toward a focus on foods and dietary patterns. And one clear consensus in the field is that diets high in whole plant foods, including fiber- and protein-dense plants like beans, are very, very good for us, reducing our risk of diet-related chronic diseases and early death. 

Isn't that, after all, the whole point of exercise? Very few of us are going to become Olympians; far more people want to preserve our strength and vitality for our brief time on Earth. 

I can think of many better things to worry about than chasing rapidly diminishing returns in muscle growth. And we mere mortals, I'd argue, should count ourselves incredibly lucky that caring for our health, and caring for our planet and fellow animals, don't need to pull in opposite directions.

How to block the next Covid in mid-air.

by  Dylan Matthews

In January 2024, I wrote a big piece on a relatively new, and very promising, approach to fighting respiratory diseases like Covid, tuberculosis, and flus. It's called “far-UVC,” a type of ultraviolet light, at wavelengths of roughly 200 to 235 nanometers, that can kill the vast majority of airborne pathogens it targets, without damaging human skin or eyes the way longer-wavelength UV does.

The potential here is massive. Imagine being able to place a few lamps in key rooms where disease transmission is common — like schools and daycares, hospitals, retail stores, and offices — and kill off the vast majority of diseases being spread through the air. The benefits, both in immediate public health and the ability to head off the spread of pandemics like Covid in their early days, would be massive. The lamps can kill over 99.9 percent of Covid viruses in the air — and would be similarly effective against new outbreaks that spread through the air.

So why don't we have far-UVC in operation right now? There have been at least two major factors holding the tech back to date, but in the year and a half since my piece came out, we've gotten some promising information on both of them.

Right now, if you want to get 222 nm ultraviolet light (the standard for far-UVC), you need what's called an excimer lamp. These work the way fluorescent light bulbs do: by putting an electric charge into a tube containing a gas, forcing the gas to emit light. You can use different gases and interacting elements to get different wavelengths of light; in far-UVC, the usual combination is krypton and chlorine gas.

This approach has a few problems. Krypton-chloride lamps produce mostly 222 nm light, but not exclusively. Excimer lamps have to include filters to avoid emitting other wavelengths; some filters work better than others, and a malfunctioning filter could be a safety risk by letting more dangerous wavelengths through. The krypton-chloride tubes also don't last forever and have to be periodically replaced, raising the price of far-UVC disinfection.

The dream, then, has been “solid-state” lamps. These would forgo the gas-in-a-tube approach in favor of mechanisms that emit only a specific wavelength of light. The most prominent approach to date has been LEDs, like those used in computer/TV screens and in modern light bulbs. LEDs get less efficient the shorter the wavelength you use, which poses a challenge. That said, we did eventually get LEDS that emit blue light, which is on the short end of the visible light spectrum, and startups like NS Nanotech have come a long way in making LEDs for far-UVC.

The big news this week, though, is in another approach: secondary harmonics. Basically, you can design crystals that, when lasers are shot through them, double the frequency of the laser light, which halves the wavelength. So if you shoot a 444 nm blue laser into an appropriate crystal, you get exactly 222 nm far-UVC light back.

Emerging from stealth this month, Uviquity, a Raleigh-based startup staffed by a group of veteran photonics engineers and backed with $6.6 million in seed money, told me they have gotten this process working in their lab. Blue lasers are an old technology at this point (they're where the name Blu-ray comes from), and have a mature supply chain, meaning building them is relatively cheap and easy.

The crystal that Uviquity uses is made from aluminum nitrate, which is not exactly hard to come by — “aluminum is plentiful and nitrogen is plentiful,” as CEO Scott Burroughs told me. “It doesn't require a whole new technology or infrastructure in order to build these devices,” Burroughs continued. “Once we realized that, we also realized just how well positioned this would be in order to scale up very rapidly.”

It's hard to overstate the importance of this kind of far-UVC emitter, once it goes to market. It could enable far-UVC lamps to see cost reductions mirroring the drastic drops seen in LEDs and other chips over the years. Making far-UVC disinfection exponentially cheaper could start to make the idea mainstream and speed adoption.

A big part of the appeal of far-UVC is that, unlike higher-wavelength UV — which can cause sunburns, cataracts, and worse — far-UVC is safe for humans' eyes and skins. But its effect on air quality has been less clear. As I explained in my piece:

When far-UV light hits oxygen molecules, it breaks some of them to form O3 — better known as ozone. Ozone itself is hazardous, and responsible for about 365,000 deaths a year worldwide. Ozone also interacts with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), small carbon-based molecules suspended in the air … These compounds interact with the ozone to create particulate matter. And particulates in the air — smog, basically — can also kill.

That sounds bad, but the basic chemistry leaves a lot of important questions unanswered. How much ozone and particulate pollution do far-UVC lamps actually make in practice? How hard is it for ventilation to clear that up? Are the levels of additional exposure big enough to be a major concern?

There's still a lot we don't know here. As a new report from the research group Blueprint Biosecurity explains, a lot of the uncertainty about far-UVC-related ozone is really uncertainty about why ozone is bad for you. 

If ozone's effect on mortality is because of ozone itself, then ventilating rooms indoors could be harmful; there's more ozone outside than inside, and better ventilation would just pull it indoors. But if ozone is harmful mostly because it creates other secondary pollutants, then ventilation is a good idea. 

We don't know, and that makes understanding the best way to use technologies like far-UVC and ventilation very difficult.

That said, some new research is making me tentatively more optimistic that the ozone effects of far-UVC are not concerningly large. One recent paper studied an office where either one far-UVC lamp (as recommended by the manufacturer) or four (way in excess of recommendations) were placed. The single lamp didn't do anything to ozone or particulate levels in the room. The four lamps did. The conclusion, then, is that if used in moderation, far-UVC lamps could disinfect without ruining indoor air.

Another paper did find modestly higher ozone levels with a single far-UVC lamp — but it found that if the lamp is placed on the ceiling, it both minimizes exposure to ozone by humans, and maximizes the lamp's effectiveness at disinfecting the air.

These are still early days for far-UVC, both in the engineering challenge of designing cost-effective lamps, and in the epidemiological challenge of understanding its effects on the air. What we need more than anything is additional research.

But I am modestly more confident than I was last year that we're heading toward a world where these lamps are ubiquitous. Potential pandemic threats, like bird flu, or even a new dangerous respiratory virus engineered in a lab with the help of AI, would face a formidable new foe that can kill them in midair. With luck, in 10 or 20 years, childhood flus, tubercular infections, and even pandemic viruses could be withering away due to the efforts of this new weapon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm a Republican CEO. I'm adding a 'tariff tax' to my price tags so customers know why prices are rising.","https://www.businessinsider.com/republican-business-owner-tariff-tax-line-item-price-tags-transparency-2025-5","Wed, 07 May 2025 09:20:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jared Fisher, the CEO and cofounder of Escape Adventures, an adventure tourism agency, and owner of several bike shops in Nevada and Utah. Fisher also ran for governor of Nevada as a Republican in 2018. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

I'm a Republican business owner who's been running an adventure travel business for more than 30 years. We operate multiday motor tours and road bike tours with hiking, mostly in the Southwest, and a hut-to-hut mountain biking route in Utah. We also own retail bike shops in Las Vegas and Utah.

Recently, I made the decision to start adding a tariff tax line item directly to the price tags on certain products in our stores, especially electric bikes. All of our electric bikes from our major supplier are going to cost 10% more.

We have the exact same electric bikes hanging on the same hook in our retail stores, and some cost $4,500, and the one right next to it costs $4,950. There's no difference except when we purchased them, so one has a line item because it was purchased when that price increase was implemented due to the tariff. It really puts us in an uncomfortable situation with our customers. We have to explain to them.

Whether we like it or not, we're paying those taxes, which is how I view tariffs, as a brick-and-mortar shop. We have to pay it to get that product into our store. If I don't have a bike in a bike shop, I'm going out of business.

So now the point comes to, are we going to pass that tax on to our customers or not? The bicycle industry runs on pretty tight margins. If you cut the 10% into that, you might as well get ready to have your exit strategy for your business, because you're not going to be able to operate. There's no way — that's just how it goes.

I ran for governor of Nevada in 2018 as a Republican. I didn't vote for Donald Trump. He was the reason I ran for office. I watched how he was as a businessperson, and America's not a business. I feel like he doesn't understand how much of an impact his decisions have. He's almost got blinders on.

I believe that people need to be responsible for their actions. You can implement a policy that you think is great, and we will back you up, but we're also going to tell everybody who's doing it. I have no problem labeling where this tax is coming from on my products. People need to know that so I have a fighting chance on my end.

This tariff policy has created chaos across the board. The uncertainty is absolutely insane. I ordered new sleeping bags from China for our summer tours, and I was just informed the supply chain has been disrupted, and now I don't know when I will get that product or what I'm going to do. We're having to redo items that are time-consuming during a season when we should be focusing on our customers' experience.

As a business owner, I don't have time for this baloney. I did my planning already in my slow season. It's really disruptive to my operations for me to have to go and find items for something that I've already done.

We're also seeing the effects on our tourism business. We have lots of Canadian customers, and when all this tariff talk started, they began canceling tours. These are $2,000 to $4,000 cancellations. One group told us, ""We love you guys, but we can't put our money into America because of what they're doing and what they're saying about our country.""

The tariffs affect everything at some level: some very big and some you won't even notice. It's like a lot of little cuts, and eventually you bleed out. Enough's enough, and people will shut their doors. The one word I could say for this whole problem that we're facing is unnecessary. It doesn't need to happen, but it is.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Mark Zuckerberg destroyed friendship. Now he wants to replace it with AI.","https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-destroyed-friendship-replace-ai-companions-loneliness-2025-5","Wed, 07 May 2025 08:17:00 GMT","

Facebook exacerbated loneliness. Meta is on a mission to make us even lonelier.

Forget those 700 Facebook friends you've largely neglected since college. In Mark Zuckerberg's latest vision for the future, we'll be filling our empty hours chatting away with our generative AI buddies. In an era when people spend more time alone than ever before, Meta's CEO is preaching not just about the power of his company to connect us to one another — but also about luring our attention to new, fake friends.

In an interview last week with the tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Zuckerberg spoke about ways AI could make social media more interactive, including turning AI chatbots into friends for people who have few and want more. ""Is this going to replace in-person connections or real-life connections? My default is that the answer to that is probably no,"" Zuckerberg says. ""There are all these things that are better about physical connections when you can have them. But the reality is that people just don't have the connections, and they feel more alone a lot of the time than they would like.""

Zuckerberg is far from the only one pushing a future with AI friends (and lovers, twins, coworkers, and parents), but this is his latest tone-deaf approach to the loneliness crisis that some say is inflamed by the very social media companies he owns.

On social media, his comments were met with widespread scorn. ""This is what happens when you believe that humanity is reducible to binary data — you think of friendship through the lens of supply & demand,"" the writer Neil Turkewitz said on X. ""An excellent example of the loneliness economy. Technology makes people lonely, then sells them a solution in the form of technology. Endless profit possibility,"" wrote Samantha Rose Hill, who's writing a book on loneliness.

Young people, forced onto Zoom during high school and college, want to meet and hang out IRL. In a 2023 survey of college and graduate students from Axios and Generation Lab, almost 80% of respondents said they used dating apps less than once a month, if at all. Nearly half of teens in a 2024 Pew Research Center survey said social media sites had a mostly negative effect on their age group, increasing from 32% in 2022. Meeting up in person helps young people: Those involved in extracurricular activities like clubs and sports have higher grades, higher aspirations, and a more positive attitude about school, research has found. People are ditching dating apps and pivoting toward book clubs, run clubs, or apps that host meetups to find their people. They're eager to hang out and be spontaneous.

The past two decades show us that Zuckerberg's ideas about friendship often leave something to be desired. Meta's own past internal research found that the company's social sites could exacerbate loneliness rather than alleviate it — but concluded Facebook was a ""net positive"" for loneliness. Social media has given us glimpses into thousands of people's lives at once, but the connections just skim the surface. Even if an AI pal is always at your fingertips, it's the kind of low-investment interaction that can only parrot connection, not substitute it.

That's because friendship, or at least a good one, isn't just about getting validation — it's a two-way street that's also about giving support. We feel good when we show up for friends and help them, says Jeffrey Hall, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas who has studied friendship. Social media platforms and the push to bake gen AI into our apps and interactions miss the entire point of having a friend, he says: ""Friendship is not efficient. It actually is at its best when it's inefficient."" It comes in the form of standing beside you at a wedding, maintaining a comfortable silence beside you on a long flight, and complaining over extended happy hours about the person you both hate. ""There isn't anything particularly efficient about a catching-up conversation,"" Hall adds. ""It's done because of the joy and the value of caring about another person.""

Several Big Tech companies are moving our online experiences further away from connecting to one another and closer to connecting with bots, who never need to log off to sleep or work or take their kid to the emergency room. An AI chatbot doesn't need you back — it's constantly present and quick to respond with questions and validation. If companies build a chatbot that begs for your attention, it could pull us further from human connection. ""It makes us want to go back to our devices more often,"" Hall says.

The average person spends more of their time on screens than in person with friends. The tech that promised to connect the world drove some of us further into isolation. Facebook started as a place less about meeting like-minded people online and more about adding your classmates and watching their every move for decades to come. Instagram's rise threatened to upstage photo sharing on Facebook with its more simplistic, visual-first design. The once candid app gave way to a commodified, performative playground for influencers and brands, and the comparative nature and pressure of posting have been linked to mental health issues in teens. In 2021, Zuckerberg turned his eyes to the metaverse, launching a multiyear obsession with a future in which we put on obstructive goggles and walk (as soon as they could figure out how to code legs) around cartoon malls, office parks, and arenas to see avatars of our favorite performers. It has cost Meta tens of billions of dollars.

The unrealized hype of the metaverse was quickly overtaken by the gen AI boom. It seems deeply unnatural to some that AI could become the newest way for us to seek connection without ever actually connecting to people. Pushing ahead, Meta launched an AI app last week based on the idea that AI-generated content should move from the private confines of chatbots to a more social feed. Facebook's original mission ""to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected"" made it sound like we had the power, but Meta's mission now is to ""build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.""

The chatbots Meta has built are already riddled with problems: Journalists found they could lie on Instagram about being licensed therapists and could have sexual conversations with users under 18. A Meta spokesperson told me the AI are ""clearly labeled and there is a disclaimer that indicates the responses are generated by AI."" They added that the sexual conversations are ""hypothetical,"" and show a manipulation of the tool. ""We've now taken additional measures,"" the spokesperson noted, to make it ""even more difficult"" to manipulate.

In the podcast interview, Zuckerberg claims that the average American has three friends or fewer but the capacity and drive for about 15. It's not clear where he pulls this stat from, but he's right that loneliness is an urgent problem. In a Pew survey from 2023, 38% of American adults said they had five or more friends, but 8% said they had none. The older someone was, the more likely they were to say they had five or more close friends, with half of people 60 and older falling into the category. Just 32% of people younger than 30 said the same. In 2023, Vivek Murthy, then the US surgeon general, called loneliness an epidemic. In a 2024 poll conducted by Morning Consult for the American Psychiatric Association, 30% of adults said they felt lonely once a week, and 10% said they felt lonely daily.

Facebook did not create the loneliness crisis, but it often gave us quantity over quality in our interactions as people spent more time alone. ""Likes"" and ""pokes"" and reminders to post ""happy birthday"" on someone's wall could substitute a phone call. There were some meaningful connections on Facebook for me: I joined a group dedicated to my incoming college freshman class and looked for roommates or other people in my major before arriving on campus. It became an easy way to find events in a new city or send out party invites. 

But largely, Facebook did little to grow or maintain deep connections on its platform — it was more a personalized newspaper for sharing college and job updates with the masses, a way to keep tabs on estranged friends and exes, and, ultimately, a gossip mill that let you know who's had a baby, who's gotten engaged, or who's dropping hints they're headed for a breakup. Facebook and Instagram have long been large and tied to our real names. In trying to take on everyone you knew as a friend or follower, a pressure grew to post in ways that looked cool to your peers but acceptable to your great-aunt. Context collapsed and curated images were everything.

None of this is to say that online connections can't be just as real as offline ones. I forged a best friendship as a teen on AIM with a girl who went to another school in the town, connecting over chat and eventually meeting up at the mall every weekend. Tumblr has fostered online friendships that span decades between people who run in the same fandom circles. Fan fiction sites offer communities, often with strict parameters and their own social norms. And AI chatbots have their benefits, too. Autistic people say they can help them practice navigating difficult social situations. Some say they act as an on-call therapist when they're working through a problem or help them prepare for job interviews.

Gen AI is still new, but we can already see that it's less like a true friend and more like an imaginary friend. ""AI personas are just like fictional characters,"" says Hannah Kim, a professor of philosophy at the University of Arizona. ""If the question is, will an AI friendship be helpful, or will an AI relationship be fulfilling, the corollary question is: Will an interactive fictional character that I engage with be as fulfilling as a friendship or relationship?"" Fictional characters can help us work out ideas about society and entertain us, but they can't have real, dimensional relationships with us. A chatbot might always be available and always have its full attention on us, but relying too heavily on them could further warp people's expectations of their real-life friends. ""If we expect that from humans, it's going to be pretty disastrous,"" Kim says.

Earlier this year, Meta took down AI-generated Instagram profiles that users hated. But Zuckerberg thinks they can get better and become our friends. For Meta, it doesn't actually matter if Facebook, Instagram, the metaverse, or AI chatbots make people less lonely. It matters that we keep clicking on them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Army Secretary: US Can't Make Expensive Weapons Vulnerable to $800 Drones","https://www.businessinsider.com/army-secretary-us-cant-make-expensive-weapons-vulnerable-cheap-drones-2025-5","Wed, 07 May 2025 09:51:00 GMT","

The US can't keep building and buying expensive weapons that are vulnerable to drones that are produced at a fraction of the cost, the Army secretary said.

""We keep creating and purchasing these exquisite machines that very cheap drones can take out,"" Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll said during an episode of the ""War on the Rocks"" podcast that aired Tuesday.

""If the number is even remotely right, that Russia has manufactured 1 million drones in the last 12 months, that just makes us have to rethink the cost of what we're buying,"" he continued.

""We are the wealthiest nation, perhaps in the history of the world, but even we can't sustain a couple-million-dollar piece of equipment that can be taken out with an $800 drone and munition,"" he said.

Driscoll was responding to a question about whether the US military was walking away from the Robotic Combat Vehicle. He said that while the concept was valuable, the cost ratio didn't work.

The US military has been watching the war in Ukraine, where cheap drones packed with explosives are damaging or destroying expensive combat equipment like tanks, other armored vehicles, air defenses, and even warships, highlighting the vulnerability of larger and more prized weapons that are insufficiently defended.

The proliferation of cheap drones — some of which cost as little as a few hundred dollars — has become a growing concern for the US military as it readies for the possibility of a large-scale confrontation between NATO and Russia in Europe or a fight with China in the Pacific.

Moscow said it produced 1.5 million drones last year. A Ukrainian tank commander called Russian drones a major threat to his American-made M1 Abrams tank, which costs about $10 million.

Ukraine has outfitted its Abrams tanks and other systems, including European-made tanks and American-made armored fighting vehicles, with additional armor to help protect the expensive equipment from drones, but it's not a perfect solution.

Armored vehicle losses in this war have been high. Ukraine, for example, has lost more than 4,400 armored vehicles, while Russia has lost more than 12,600, according to Oryx, an open-source intelligence site that tracks military equipment losses on both sides.

And drones aren't just a threat to land assets. Ukrainian naval drones packed with explosives have wreaked havoc on Russia's Black Sea Fleet. These drones have even been upgraded to launch missiles. Ukraine said one managed to take down two of Russia's $50 million Su-30 fighter jets over the weekend.

The 28-year-old banker whose death prompted a wave of backlash against Jefferies died from the ""toxic effects"" of fentanyl and cocaine, the Dallas medical examiner said.

Carter McIntosh, an associate with the bank's technology, media, and telecommunications coverage team in Dallas, was found dead in his apartment in January, leading Jefferies CEO Richard Handler to issue a memo defending the bank from ""unfounded"" speculation about the banker's cause of death.

The police initially ruled it an ""unexplained death."" An autopsy report by the medical examiner's office now says McIntosh's death was an accident caused by the ""combined toxic effects"" of fentanyl and cocaine, according to a copy of the report obtained by Business Insider.

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin, has proved a rising threat in the US, fueling an alarming surge in overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says overdoses remain the No. 1 killer of Americans ages 18 to 44.

""Our hearts grieve for Carter and our sincere condolences to his family, coworkers, and friends. Carter is missed by many at Jefferies and beyond,"" Handler told BI in a statement on Wednesday.

In the wake of McIntosh's death, Handler and the firm's president, Brian Friedman, released a memo to staff expressing their ""tremendous sadness"" and offering support to employees.

Handler also criticized what he called ""unfounded, vitriolic attacks"" against Jefferies' work culture.

""At this point, nobody knows exactly what happened and engaging in speculation with cynical assumptions serves no useful purpose and only adds to the grief that the McIntosh family is suffering,"" the memo said.

McIntosh worked at other financial services firms before joining Jefferies, including stints in equity research at Goldman Sachs and as an investment banking analyst at Moelis & Co., his LinkedIn page said. Before that, he attended Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.

Another F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet fell off the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and into the Red Sea on Tuesday, a US defense official confirmed to Business Insider.

It's the second fighter jet lost from the Truman in a little over a week and the third of the carrier's deployment. Super Hornets are estimated to cost roughly $60 million apiece.

The F/A-18F was landing on the flight deck of the Truman on Tuesday when the arrestment failed, causing the fighter jet to go overboard, the official said. Both the aviators safely ejected and were rescued by an MH-60S Seahawk helicopter.

Navy aircraft carriers have catapults for launch and arresting gear for recovery. The thick cables help aircraft quickly decelerate on landing. It's unclear what exactly failed during Tuesday's recovery.

""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries,"" the official said, adding that ""no flight deck personnel were injured.""

CNN first reported on the incident, which was the latest in a series of mishaps for Truman and its strike group.

On April 28, an F/A-18E and a tow tractor fell off the Truman and into the Red Sea after a move crew lost control of the aircraft. A sailor who jumped from the cockpit just before the fighter jet went overboard was lightly hurt.

In February, the Truman collided with a large commercial vessel in the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in the firing of the carrier's commanding officer.

And in December, the missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, part of the Truman's strike group, shot down a Super Hornet in what the US military described as ""an apparent case of friendly fire."" Both aviators ejected safely.

The Truman has been deeply involved in combat operations against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. But Tuesday's incident came as President Donald Trump said the US would end a seven-week intensive bombing campaign against the rebels.

Apple Inc. is “actively looking at” revamping the Safari web browser on its devices to focus on AI-powered search engines, a seismic shift for the industry hastened by the potential end of a longtime partnership with Google. 

Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, made the disclosure Wednesday during his testimony in the US Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. The heart of the dispute is the two companies' estimated $20 billion-a-year deal that makes Google the default offering for queries in Apple's browser. The case could force the tech giants to unwind the pact, upending how the iPhone and other devices have long operated.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

House Republicans have added a plan to raise billions of dollars to help pay for US President Donald Trump's massive tax cuts through the sale of thousands of acres of federal land — a politically charged idea that has drawn opposition from some in their own party. 

The plan, a late-night addition to a legislative package approved early Wednesday by the House Natural Resources Committee, mandates the sale of dozens of parcels totaling more than 11,000 acres (4,450 hectares) of federal land in Utah and Nevada.

The European Union is considering imposing sanctions on Litasco Middle East DMCC, a Dubai-based trading unit of Russian oil giant Lukoil PJSC, as part of sweeping new measures targeting Moscow's covert fleet of tankers.

The move, floated in documents seen by Bloomberg, would be the first time Western governments have sought to sanction a Litasco entity since the invasion of Ukraine. Its parent company Lukoil was the second-largest seller of Russian crude to foreign markets last year.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Warren Buffett's appointed successor has built a billion-dollar fortune in his time at Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But unlike the legendary investor — or even his friends and early backers who became spectacularly wealthy over his six-decade run — relatively little of that is tied up in company shares.

Greg Abel, 62, who'll replace Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive officer at the end of the year, holds about $175 million worth of stock. That makes up about 18% of his $1 billion net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is valuing his fortune for the first time.

More than half of the top holders of President Donald Trump's memecoin — who are jockeying for dinner with the president — have used foreign exchanges that say they ban US users, suggesting that many of the purchasers are based outside the US.

Buyers of the Trump token, a cryptocurrency the president began marketing days before his inauguration, drove sales higher in the past two weeks after its issuers announced an unprecedented promotion: More than 200 of the memecoin's largest holders would be invited to attend a May 22 dinner with Trump at his Virginia golf club, while the top 25 would qualify for an exclusive reception beforehand and what the memecoin's website describes as a “VIP” tour.

Now, an analysis by Bloomberg News shows that all but six of the top 25 holders who have registered on the website's leaderboard used foreign exchanges that say they exclude customers living in the US. More broadly, at least 56% of the leaderboard's top 220 holders used similar offshore exchanges. The prevalence of these likely foreign buyers echoes concerns that congressional Democrats have expressed about the ethics of marketing the coin with a promise of presidential access. And it raises questions about how attendees at the promotional dinner, who are publicly identified only by three- or four-letter usernames they've chosen, will be vetted.

Source: Bloomberg analysis of SolScan data

Note: Data as of 10 a.m. US East Coast time on May 5. Usernames are those listed on the memecoin's website and were chosen by wallet holders when they registered for the dinner promotion. One wallet that still appears on the leaderboard website's top 25 is not shown here because it sold nearly all of its holdings on May 3.

In the website's fine print, organizers say attendees must pass a background check. “We will also screen your wallet for KYC & compliance purposes. You are having Dinner with the President of the USA!” the website reads. (Wallets are digital tools that store the private keys owners use to access and manage cryptocurrencies. And “KYC” is a common term for the steps financial institutions take to know their customers.) The website provides no explanation of how such vetting would be conducted.

The memecoin's promoters didn't respond to a request for comment, nor did White House officials.

In order to appear on the official leaderboard, those who've bought the memecoin have to register with its website, which says it ranks them based on the number of tokens and the length of time they've been held. Many large holders have yet to register. But a second Bloomberg analysis of all the biggest purchasers — regardless of whether they're on the leaderboard — revealed that more than half of this broader pool of buyers also used foreign exchanges.

It's possible that some US purchasers found ways to use foreign exchanges despite prohibitions – say, by using a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask a US-based IP address. Most exchanges say they take steps such as collecting users' personal information to try to prevent such workarounds.
The three foreign exchanges that top Trump coin holders used most often to fund their accounts or to purchase the Trump memecoin are Binance, Bybit and OKX, all of which have imposed restrictions on US users. (Bloomberg's analysis found that six holders on the Trump coin leaderboard made purchases on OKX before the company launched a trading platform in the US on April 15. An OKX spokeswoman said that until then, the company did not allow purchases by US residents.) Representatives for Binance and Bybit didn't respond to requests for comment.

Two of the three exchanges have run afoul of US law previously. Binance paid the US more than $4 billion after it pleaded guilty in November 2023 to violating federal anti-money laundering and sanctions laws through lapses in internal controls. OKX pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations in February and forfeited more than $420 million.

This is not the first time that Trump-related crypto ventures have attracted significant interest from foreign investors.

Justin Sun, a Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur, became an adviser to World Liberty Financial, a separate crypto project promoted by the president and his sons, after Sun announced that he'd bought tens of millions of dollars of that project's proprietary token. Sun, who said at the time that he didn't expect any favors from Trump in return for the investment, may also be a top holder of the president's memecoin, according to a Bloomberg analysis of crypto wallet transactions.

World Liberty is promoting a stablecoin. Zach Witkoff, one of the company's founders and the son of Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, announced at a conference on Thursday that the stablecoin would be used to close a deal between Binance and an investment firm founded by Abu Dhabi's government. World Liberty executives didn't respond to a request for comment.

“Congress should demand the President disclose who's paying him tribute in the shadows to assess whether the public interest is being compromised,” said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US, a nonprofit interest group that has set up a “Trump Accountability War Room” online. Accountable found that at least 14 of the top 50 holders of World Liberty Financial tokens have also used cryptocurrency services that aren't available in the US. Bloomberg's own analysis found an additional eight wallets that did so. World Liberty disclosed in November that its initial $300 million offering was primarily being marketed offshore.

Note: Data as of 6:45 p.m. US East Coast time on April 30.

As the president, who once called Bitcoin a “scam against the dollar,” moves further into cryptocurrencies, his administration has begun to dismantle the regulatory and law enforcement teams that oversee these digital assets. Shortly after he took office, for instance, staff members who investigated crypto at the Securities and Exchange Commission were reassigned and many of their cases were dropped. In April, the Justice Department disbanded its crypto task force.

In a letter last month, Democratic senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren called for an investigation of the Trump coin dinner promotion by the US Office of Government Ethics. They said the May 22 event presents a “severe risk that President Trump and other officials may be engaging in ‘pay to play' corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family.”

The Trump family benefits from increases in the memecoin's price because a company it controls maintains a large stock of the tokens. Although the Trumps aren't allowed to sell any coins for some time under the terms of the coin's issuance, any fluctuation in the price changes their fortunes on paper. The April 23 announcement of the dinner caused the price to rise from around $9 to about $14 while 436 new transactions of more than $100,000 took place over the next five days. The largest of these transactions involved accounts interacting with exchanges that don't operate in the US. (The price of the token has since dropped to $10.82 as of 6 p.m. New York time on May 6).

Note: Data as of May 1.

To qualify for the dinner with Trump, coin holders must register a “self-custodied” wallet — one that's fully controlled by its holder, rather than a third-party exchange.

Bloomberg analyzed the transactions of the top 220 wallets on the website's leaderboard as of May 5 to determine whether their holders are likely foreign-based. A separate analysis examined all the self-custodied wallets that held enough Trump coins as of April 30 to qualify for a spot in the top 220, leaving aside any time-weighting. Many of the wallets with the largest holdings are not listed on the leaderboard, which suggests they have not yet registered or their time-weighted holdings may differ significantly from current holdings. Some may be strategically waiting to register.

While it is difficult to identify the people behind these accounts, there have been public clues for some. The entities at the top of the leaderboard have been swapping positions for the past few days — with at least one of them bragging about it online. The wallet called “MeCo” belongs to an entity called “Memecore,” which describes itself as an “EVM-compatible L1 multi-chain cross-staking mainnet secured by Proof of Meme.”

On X, the firm said: “We're not just aiming for #1 on the $TRUMP leaderboard — we're here to conquer the entire meme space.” Memecore has asked users to send it their Trump coins in order to climb the rankings. The coins will be returned to users with a bonus, the company said.

“The memecoin space is currently seen as stagnant — and we want to challenge that narrative. By showing up at this event, we want to signal that a meme is emerging again,” MemeCore's Chief Business Development Officer Cherry Hsu said in a statement over Telegram.

The holder that Memecore is chasing at the top of the list has chosen the username “Sun,” and is using a wallet belonging to HTX, according to Bloomberg's analysis of blockchain data. HTX has been linked to Justin Sun and lists him as an adviser. Sun himself, who has publicly acknowledged buying World Liberty Financial's tokens, has so far not said whether he's behind the wallet atop the memecoin's leaderboard. He did not respond to requests for comment.

The wallet labeled “Sun” began amassing a total of $17.9 million worth of the Trump coin when it was initially launched in January. It has acquired $4.5 million worth since the Trump dinner promotion was announced.

The SEC sued Justin Sun in 2023, alleging that he worked with companies he owns and controls to engineer the offer and sale of unregistered securities. Sun's attorneys denied those allegations and said the regulator's claims went “too far and should be rejected.” In February, after Sun spent at least $75 million to buy World Liberty Financial coins, the SEC paused its case against him, saying it was in both sides' interest to consider a potential resolution.

Using the Dune API, Bloomberg also compiled data on the 220 crypto wallets holding the largest number of Trump memecoin tokens. Bloomberg individually checked each wallet's activity using SolScan and categorized the account using the same methodology as for the accounts listed on the Trump Dinner leaderboard. Bloomberg removed accounts tagged by SolScan as official exchange wallets, market maker wallets and accounts tagged by Arkham Intelligence as “Official Trump Meme” wallets.

Bloomberg similarly collected data on top holders of WLF tokens from EtherScan. As with Trump tokens, Bloomberg individually checked each wallet's transactions and categorized the account based on whether it interacted with centralized cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the US or with foreign exchanges that say they are not available to US residents.

National Basketball Association superstar Russell Westbrook is taking a shot off the court at simplifying funeral planning with artificial intelligence.

The famed Denver Nuggets point guard on Wednesday announced the launch of Eazewell, a startup that uses AI technology to streamline the process for coordinating funerals. Westbrook founded the venture with former Charlotte Hornets star Kemba Walker and childhood friend Donnell Beverly Jr., who serves as president of Russell Westbrook Enterprises and CEO and co-founder of Eazewell.

""My whole career, on and off the court, has been about stepping up decisively in the moments that matter most,"" Westbrook wrote in a statement to CNBC. Westbrook and the Nuggets are currently facing the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Western Conference semifinals. ""Eazewell is exactly that — a decisive solution to a very real problem.""

The Los Angeles-based company uses AI to curate funeral options catered to each user's budgets and preferences. The platform assists with paperwork, budget planning, invitations and overlooked tasks such as canceling a deceased loved one's utility bills and social media accounts. Eazewell currently has 11 employees and has already tested its beta platform with more than 1,000 families. 

Eazewell has not disclosed funding but has revenue agreements with partner services. The startup is also working on partnerships with finance and life insurance companies in the space. The service is free to use and does not have an ads component ""at this stage,"" a company spokesperson said.

""We're trying to take the weight off people's shoulders as much as we can, and make this process so much easier for people,"" Walker told CNBC in a phone interview. Walker played college basketball with Beverly at the University of Connecticut.

Eazewell traces its origins to Westbrook and Beverly's high school days, when their friend and basketball teammate Khelcey Barrs III passed away unexpectedly from an enlarged heart. Westbrook commemorates Barrs to this day by wearing a bracelet with the initials ""KB3"" in every NBA game he plays and on his signature Jordan Why Not Zer0.6 ""Khelcey Barrs"" shoe.

""It's a reminder that life can change in an instant,"" Westbrook said. ""You don't get to choose the moment, but you do get to choose how you respond.""

The experience left a lasting effect on the two friends, Beverly said, but it wasn't until the death of Beverly's parents that he experienced funeral planning hurdles firsthand. Beverly said the experience was ""messy"" and ""grueling.""

Disillusioned and frustrated by the process after the death of his mother and father in 2016 and 2023, respectively, Beverly turned to his close friends to come up with the solution that became Eazewell.

""It just seems like the perfect time to really turn our shared pain into purpose,"" Beverly said.

One of Eazewell's most innovative features is its voice-activated AI agent that can gather cost quotes and call funeral homes on a user's behalf.

Recent advancements in AI have only recently made it possible to automate tasks and create agents that can manage these jobs in an empathetic and compassionate manner, said Viviane Ghaderi, Eazewell's tech chief and a former Amazon executive.

Stephen Stokols, an Eazewell investor and CEO of Tru Skye Ventures, an early-stage sports technology and wellness venture firm, said these ""transformational"" AI advancements helping bring the funeral industry out of the ""dark ages"" initially drew him to the project.

Walker said he hopes Eazewell can offer users the tools to navigate a topic that is not taught in school or early life.

""We know how important it is to have someone by your side to help with the details that come after a loss,"" Westbrook said.

Nuclear developer Elementl Power said Wednesday it's signed an agreement with Google to develop three sites for advanced reactors. It's the latest example of tech giants teaming up with the nuclear industry in an effort to meet the vast energy needs of data centers. 

Google will commit early-stage development capital to the three projects, although the exact terms of the deal remain private. Each site will generate at least 600 megawatts of power capacity, and Google will have the option to buy the power once the sites are up and running. The proposed locations remain private, but Elementl said Google's funding will be used for things like site permitting, securing interconnection rights to the transmission system, contract negotiations and other early-stage matters.

""Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy,"" said Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google. 

""Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation,"" she added.

Elementl Power, which was founded in 2022 as a nuclear power project developer, hasn't yet built any sites.

The company is currently technology agnostic, meaning it hasn't yet chosen what type of reactor it will use at its sites. Rather, when Elementl is ready to begin construction it will choose the reactor technology that's furthest along in development.

""Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals,"" said Chris Colbert, Elementl Power's chairman and CEO. Colbert was previously CFO, COO and chief strategy officer at NuScale Power, which is developing small modular reactors. 

Colbert added that once the projects reach a final investment stage Elementl will raise capital from other sources – for example infrastructure funds – to actually build the projects. The company is aiming to add 10 gigawatts of nuclear to the grid by 2035. 

In October, Google teamed up with small modular reactor company Kairos Power, pledging to buy power from the company's fleet of reactors. At the time, Google said the first reactor would enter service by 2030, with more coming online through 2035.

Earlier this year, China's artificial intelligence startup, DeepSeek, prompted concerns that the improved efficiency of emerging AI models may reduce the need to invest in the build-out of new power sources to support data centers. However, tech leaders such as Amazon and Nvidia have since said the need for baseload power is continuing to grow at a quick pace.

In April, Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark estimated 50 gigawatts of new power capacity will be needed by 2027 to support AI. That is the equivalent of about 50 new nuclear plants.

In this article

A new Disney theme park is coming to Abu Dhabi.

The Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with immersive destination and experiences company Miral to bring a park and resort to Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates.

This will be Disney's seventh theme park resort and it will be fully developed and built by Miral. Disney's imagineers will lead creative design and operational oversight on the project. The entertainment giant will not be investing capital in the project, but will reap the benefits of royalties.

The development in Abu Dhabi is not part of the $60 billion that Disney has pledged to invest in its theme parks over the next decade.

""This is a thrilling moment for our company as we announce plans to build an exciting Disney theme park resort in Abu Dhabi, whose culture is rich with an appreciation of the arts and creativity,"" said Disney CEO Bob Iger, in a statement. ""As our seventh theme park destination, it will rise from this land in spectacular fashion, blending contemporary architecture with cutting edge technology to offer guests deeply immersive entertainment experiences in unique and modern ways.""

Iger, in an interview with CNBC's David Faber on Wednesday, said imagineers have already begun designing the park. He declined to specify when the company expects the park to open.

""We're not pinning down a date yet,"" he said. ""It typically takes us between 18 months and two years to design and fully develop and approximately five years to build but we're not making any commitments right now.""

The announcement came after Disney reported a top- and bottom-line beat for its fiscal second quarter, with its experiences business — including parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products — reporting 6% year-over-year revenue growth.

The segment represented 37% of the company's overall revenue in fiscal 2024 and nearly 60% of its operating income.

""Experiences is obviously a critical business for Disney and also an important growth platform,"" Iger said on Disney's second-quarter earnings conference call. ""Despite questions around any macroeconomic uncertainty or the impact of competition, I'm encouraged by the strength and resilience of our business as evidenced in these earnings and in the second-half bookings at Walt Disney World.""

Disney has slowly been entering the UAE in recent years, adding retail locations and touring entertainment shows like Broadway's ""The Lion King"" and ""Disney on Ice.""

Iger told CNBC that the company first started eyeing the region as a potential new resort location in 2017 or 2018, but Covid and a CEO change delayed expansion into the UAE.

Disney noted that around one-third of the world's population lives within a four-hour flight of the UAE and that the region has an addressable tourism market of around 500 million visitors.

""This groundbreaking resort destination represents a new frontier in theme park development,"" said Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney experiences. ""Our resort in Abu Dhabi will be the most advanced and interactive destination in our portfolio. The location of our park is incredibly unique – anchored by a beautiful waterfront – which will allow us to tell our stories in completely new ways. This project will reach guests in a whole new part of the world, welcoming more families to experience Disney than ever before.""

Yas Island is a hub of entertainment and retail experiences. It is already home to Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, Yas Waterworld, SeaWorld Abu Dhabi and Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi as well as the Formula 1 Yas Marina Circuit. The area also hosts Abu Dhabi's largest mall and an award-winning golf course.

Upon completion, the new Disney park will have themed accommodations and unique dining and retail experiences that integrate the storytelling heritage of Disney and the futuristic and cultural essence of Abu Dhabi.

""It'll be much larger than anything that's currently here,"" D'Amaro teased on CNBC.

DETROIT — A closely watched barometer for used vehicle pricing jumped last month to its highest level since October 2023 as consumers rushed purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs.

Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index — which tracks prices of used vehicles sold at its U.S. wholesale auctions — increased 4.9% last month compared with a year earlier to a level of 208.2.

It also marked a 2.7% increase from March. That's a significant increase compared with a historically typical month-to-month index move of 0.2%, according to the auto data and logistics firm.

""The 'spring bounce' normally ends the second week of April, but this year, wholesale appreciation trends continued for the entire month and were much stronger than we typically observe,"" said Jeremy Robb, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights. ""We expected to see strong price appreciation in response to the tariffs, and that's exactly what came.""

While the tariffs of 25% on new imported vehicles and many parts do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market, which is how the majority of Americans purchase a vehicle.

Retail prices for consumers traditionally follow changes in wholesale prices, but they have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years.

Cox reports retail used-vehicle sales in April were down 1.7% compared with March but higher year over year by 13%. Over the last four weeks, the average retail listing price for a used vehicle increased by 2% to more than $25,000, Cox said. That compares to a new vehicle at nearly $48,000.

The Manheim index remains off the record highs it hit during the Covid pandemic but is still relatively high compared to historic levels before the onset of the global health crisis in 2020.

Cox previously said it was seeing used vehicle prices continue to stabilize after swinging wildly for several years before starting to calm down in 2024.

In this article

There's a new warehouse robot at Amazon that has a sense of touch, allowing it to handle a job previously only done by humans. Amazon unveiled the robot, called Vulcan, Wednesday at an event in Germany.

CNBC got an exclusive first look at Vulcan in April, as it stowed items into tall, yellow bins at a warehouse in Spokane, Washington. An up-close look at the ""hand"" of the robot reveals how it can feel the items it touches using an AI-powered sensor to determine the precise pressure and torque each object needs.

This innovative gripper helps give Vulcan the ability to manipulate 75% of the 1 million unique items in inventory at the Spokane warehouse. Amazon has used other robotic arms inside its warehouses since 2021, but those rely on cameras for detection and suction for grasp, limiting what types of objects they can handle. 

Vulcan can also operate 20 hours a day, according to Aaron Parness, who heads up the Amazon Robotics team that developed the machine.

Still, Parness told CNBC that instead of replacing people in its warehouses, Vulcan will create new, higher skilled jobs that involve maintaining, operating, installing and building the robots. 

When asked if Amazon will fully automate warehouses in the future, Parness said, ""not at all.""

""I don't believe in 100% automation,"" he said. ""If we had to get Vulcan to do 100% of the stows and picks, it would never happen. You would wait your entire life. Amazon understands this.""

The goal is for Vulcan to handle 100% of the stowing that happens in the top rows of bins, which are difficult for people to reach, Parness said. Limiting workers to stowing on mid-height shelves, the so-called power zone, could lower the chance for worker injuries. Amazon has long struggled with injury rates far higher than those at other warehouses, though the company claims those rates have improved significantly. 

""We have a ladder that we have to step onto several dozen times a day during your ten hour shift. There is a lot of reaching. We have to lunge and squat. So it's a lot of tough body mechanics,"" said Kari Freitas Hardy, an Amazon worker in Spokane. ""As a picker, if I had an innovation like this where I could have stayed within my power zone, my days would have been just so much easier.""

Amazon said Vulcan is operating at about the same speed as a human worker and can handle items up to 8 pounds. It operates behind a fence, sequestered from human workers to reduce the risk of accidents.

Experts agree that humans will work alongside robots in warehouses like Amazon's for the foreseeable future.

""Whereas if you build a terribly complicated automated system and it breaks, then everything stops,"" said Bill Ray, a researcher at Gartner. ""Taking out the last human is so expensive. It's so disruptive. It would be a huge investment and an enormous risk.""

Freitas Hardy recently transitioned from picking items to working with the robots. She's one of the 350,000 workers Amazon said it's spent $1.2 billion to upskill since 2019.

""It would be many decades off, to have them just come in and take over, so at this point it's more exciting if you ask me, to see the growth potential because that is where it does increase jobs on the back side,"" Freitas Hardy said.

Although Freitas Hardy said she isn't making more money in her new role, Amazon said others who participate in its Mechatronics and Robotics Apprenticeship program typically receive pay increases of about 40%.

Amazon said the team that developed Vulcan has grown from a handful of people to more than 250 employees in the three years since the project began. Amazon wouldn't disclose how much it cost to develop Vulcan, but Parness said it represents a big business opportunity.

""Vulcan can interact with the world in a more human-like manner, and that gives us a lot more process paths that we can use automation to bring down the cost that our customer pays, and the speed with which we can deliver those products to our customers,"" Parness said.

Another big return on investment may come from robots making fewer mistakes than humans.

""Product returns are incredibly high and product returns are incredibly expensive,"" Gartner's Ray said.  ""Some of them will be because the wrong thing was put in the box. And if you can reduce that, that's a real cost saving straight away.""

Meanwhile, Amazon's humanoid robot Digit has yet to bring operational efficiency. Amazon announced in 2023 that it was testing the Agility Robotics bipedal robot to help organize and move totes, but it's yet to deploy Digit at scale.

When asked if Vulcan indicates that robots have moved from gimmick to real world application, Parness said, ""It doesn't matter if the robot has legs or wheels or it's bolted to the floor. I think the thing that makes the robot useful is having that sense of touch so that it can interact in high contact and high clutter environments. That's the tipping point for me, and I think we're right there.""

For now, Vulcan is only in full operation at the Spokane warehouse. Another version of Vulcan that can pick specific items from inventory is being tested in Hamburg, Germany. Amazon said it plans to add Vulcan in more U.S. and German facilities in 2026.

Stocks on Wall Street and beyond have been rocked by volatility in recent weeks, as U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out some tariffs, paused others, and ramped up duties on Chinese goods to unprecedented levels.

Strategists at the Bank of America shed light on where some of the capital flowing out of the U.S. may be heading.

According to their data analysis, U.S. equities saw an $8.9 billion outflow in the week to April 30. For every $100 inflow to American stocks since the 2024 presidential election, there had been a $5 outflow over the past three weeks, the investment bank's strategists said in a note to clients on May 1.

At the same time, European equities saw a $3.4 billion inflow, according to the Wall Street bank.

Meanwhile, Japanese equities saw a $4.4 billion inflow in the week to April 30 — its biggest week of inflows since April 2024.

In a sign that investors were in a risk-taking mood, BofA said that cryptocurrencies and high yield bonds saw inflows of $2.3 billion and $3.9 billion in the past week, respectively. Gold and U.S. Treasury bonds collectively had $6 billion in outflows.

Bank of America also revealed that its private clients, who collectively have $3.7 trillion in assets, began to worry more about deflation in the United States, relative to inflationary risks over the past four weeks.

The bank said its investor clients were buying shares of utilities and low-volatility high-dividend ETFs, typically considered ""deflationary defensive"" assets, and were selling ""inflation hedges"" such as debt instruments, inflation-protected Treasury bonds, and financial sector ETFs.

In this article

Data storage firm Seagate is working to develop a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030, touting blistering demand from data centers for the 70-year-old technology in the artificial intelligence boom.

BS Teh, Seagate's chief commercial officer, told CNBC that the company is aiming to launch such a drive — which would have about three times the capacity of the firm's top-of-the-line hard drives — by 2030. The largest hard disk drive Seagate currently produces is the 36-terabyte Exos M model, which it launched in January.

""You may be thinking, 'Who would need it?'"" Teh said, referring to the idea of a 100-terabyte hard drive. ""Well, plenty.""

""I think there's definitely strong demand,"" he added. ""This is a key enabler for the industry to be able to deliver the storage capacity that the market needs, because there's no other technology that's able to produce this capacity of storage technology to meet the growth that the market needs.""

Seagate has been touting itself as more of an AI player in recent years amid the rise of foundational models like those being developed by OpenAI, Microsoft and Google. In the computer hardware market, the AI boom has largely benefited players like Nvidia which make the graphics processing units needed for training and running AI models.

Those models require vast amounts of data for training and making the quality of the AI's outputs more advanced. At the start of the year, Microsoft said it expects to spend a whopping $80 billion on data centers in its fiscal year ending June 2025.

But the boom in data centers comes with implications for the environment. Data centers require significant amounts of power to run.

According to the International Energy Agency, a single ChatGPT query uses up an average 2.9 watt-hours per request — nearly 10 times the amount required for a typical Google search — meaning if ChatGPT was used in the 9 billion internet searches done each day, almost 10 terawatt-hours of additional electricity a year would be required.

Teh explained that Seagate is working to address climate concerns surrounding AI's energy demands by increasing storage density on its hard drives and ensuring its manufacturing is underpinned by renewable energy.

""We focus on what we can influence, and what we can influence comes down to how we have a sustainable way to manufacture the product,"" Teh said. ""We have a target to make sure that all of our factories are using renewable energy to manufacture the product.""

""With the product itself, we design it to have lower power per terabyte, or to have higher density of the device itself, such that when you actually integrate that product into your data center, you require less space, less power, less everything, because you're using your fewer drives to fulfill that capacity,"" he added.

It's worth highlighting that Seagate faces competition from other technologies — not least from solid-state drives, which use flash memory chips rather than magnetic platters to store data electronically. However, Teh insists hard disk drive is ""a much more sustainable device technology"" than solid-state drives in terms of the embodied carbon.

In this article

Ford Motor has hiked prices on three of its Mexico-produced models effective May 2, becoming one of the first major automakers to adjust sticker prices following President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Prices on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pickup and Bronco Sport will increase by as much as $2,000 on some models, according to a notice sent to dealers, which was reviewed by Reuters.

Ford earlier this week said Trump's trade war would add about $2.5 billion in costs for 2025, but it expects to reduce that exposure by around $1 billion. Rival General Motors said last week that tariffs were projected to cost it between $4 billion and $5 billion following the imposition of hefty levies on foreign imports of automobiles, but it expected to offset that by at least 30%.

A Ford spokesperson said the price hikes will affect vehicles built after May 2, which would arrive at dealer lots in late June. The spokesperson said the price hikes reflect ""usual"" mid-year pricing actions, ""combined with some tariffs we are facing. We have not passed on the full cost of tariffs to our customers.""

Ford shares were down 1.7% at $10.26 at midday. The automaker is still running a discount program through the July 4 weekend on many of its models, the spokesperson said.

Trump's tariffs have unleashed weeks of uncertainty across the auto sector, as major carmakers in the United States and Europe have pulled forecasts, shifted production and caused companies to idle plants.

Following weeks of pushback from the auto industry, Trump softened his tariffs on foreign auto parts imports to give carmakers credits for what is produced in the U.S. and to avoid double-tariffs on raw materials used in auto production. However, the White House has not rescinded a 25% tariff on the 8 million vehicles the U.S. imports annually.

Analysts have said U.S. auto sales could drop by more than 1 million vehicles a year if tariffs were to remain in place.

Ford is in a better position to weather tariffs than some of its competitors because of its strong U.S. manufacturing base. The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker assembles 79% of its U.S.-sold vehicles domestically, compared with GM's 53%, Barclays analysts said in a note.

Still, Ford imports one of its most affordable and popular vehicles, the Maverick, from Mexico. Most major U.S. automakers face significant price hikes on their cheaper models produced in the country.

Ford and GM also face significant levies on imports from China and South Korea, respectively. GM estimated that the costs on its Korean imports totaled about $2 billion, while Ford declined to specify the expenses around importing vehicles from China.

Automakers that rely on exports to the United States are facing increased pricing pressure. A dozen major automakers including Toyota and GM import at least 40% of the vehicles they sell in the U.S., with some such as Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor importing more than 60%, according to 2024 data from S&P Global Mobility.

Before Ford's move, most automakers had not taken the step of boosting prices, but had warned that was on the way.

Porsche said it would have to boost its selling cost if tariffs remained in place while U.S. Volkswagen's Audi brand also suggested potential price increases, without providing any details.

By contrast, BMW expects U.S. car tariffs to decline from July, based on its contacts with U.S. officials - a more upbeat assessment of the trade climate than many rivals. GM's finance chief, Paul Jacobson, told analysts last week that the automaker was not expecting imminent price increases, saying they ""feel good about where the pricing environment is today.""

In this article

Disney posted fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines, boosted by better-than-expected subscriber growth for its Disney+ streaming platform. 

The company upped some of its fiscal 2025 guidance and posted revenue growth in all three of its business segments. It separately announced a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi.

Shares of Disney gained about 10% in early morning trading Wednesday.

Disney, which had previously said it expected Disney+ subscribers to decline during the quarter, reported a 1.4 million increase in subscriptions to its flagship service, bringing its global base to 126 million. Wall Street had expected Disney to report 123.35 million Disney+ subscribers, according to StreetAccount. 

Disney expects a modest rise in these subscribers in its current quarter.

Revenue for its direct-to-consumer business rose to $6.12 billion, up 8% compared with the same period a year prior. Higher prices and increased subscriber numbers led to the growth, the company said.

Here is what Disney reported for the period ended March 29 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

Disney now expects full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75, an increase of 16% compared with fiscal 2024. Previously, the company said it expected high-single-digit adjusted EPS growth.

Disney's net income for the most recent quarter increased to $3.28 billion, or $1.81 per share, up from a loss of $20 million, or a loss of 1 cent per share, during the same quarter last year.

Adjusting for one-time items, including the resolution of a tax matter, among other items, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.45. 

Disney's overall revenue was up 7% year over year to $23.62 billion.

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks, direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 9% year over year to $10.68 billion after a strong carryover from winter film titles.

While ""Snow White"" and ""Captain America: Brave New World"" underperformed, ticket sales from 2024 releases ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" and ""Moana 2"" buoyed content sales and licensing. 

Linear continued to drag on overall results, with revenue falling 13% to $2.42 billion.

Revenue for Disney's sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, rose 5% to $4.53 billion on higher advertising revenue. The company aired three additional College Football Playoff games and one extra National Football League game during the quarter, leading to higher ad rates and viewership.

For fiscal 2025, Disney said Wednesday it expects its sports segment's operating income growth will be up 18% year over year, higher than the 13% growth it had previously forecast.

Over at its experiences business, which includes parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products, revenue rose 6% during the quarter to $8.89 billion.

Its domestic theme parks saw revenue rise 9% to $6.5 billion, while international park revenues dipped 5% to $1.44 billion.

The company attributed revenue gains to higher guest spend at its domestic parks and higher volumes on its cruise ships following the launch of the Disney Treasure.

Its consumer products division saw revenue up 4% to $949 million due to higher licensing revenue from the newly released video game Marvel Rivals.

European markets closed lower on Wednesday, with traders monitoring regional corporate earnings releases and awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy announcement.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed down 0.5% provisionally, with retail stocks down 2.2%, leading the losses.

Europe's pharmaceuticals industry is still reeling from U.S. President Donald Trump's Monday announcement that tariffs for the sector would be announced within the next two weeks.

Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk bucked the sectoral trend to gain 1.3%, after the company's first-quarter earnings came in above expectations. The firm cut its 2025 guidance, however, citing weakening demand for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy.

Investors also monitored earnings releases from Ørsted, Pandora, Veolia, Legrand, BMW, Siemens Healthineers, Fresenius, Skanska B, JD Wetherspoon, Vonovia, Delhaize and Telecom Italia on Wednesday.

Across the Atlantic, the Fed's interest rate decision is due at 2 p.m. ET. Fed funds futures trading suggests just a 3.1% chance of the central bank cutting interest rates this meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Traders will nevertheless be listening for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments after the announcement for insights into the path of rates and state of the economy. 

U.S. stocks opened higher after government spokespeople said U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top trade official Jamieson Greer would meet with their Chinese counterparts this week in Switzerland. The news was taken as a positive sign for developments on trade negotiations after turbulent market action following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement last month.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong markets jumped over 2% to lead gains in Asia-Pacific after China's central bank and financial regulators announced sweeping plans to cut key interest rates in an effort to shore up growth in the face of trade worries.

Alexander Lacik, CEO of Pandora, discusses first-quarter results, revised 2025 guidance and explains how U.S. tariffs might impact the business.

New manufacturing orders in Germany rose by 3.6% month on month on an adjusted basis, provisional data from the country's statistics bureau Destatis showed on Wednesday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had been expecting orders to increase by 1.3%.

The March figures marked the first rise in industrial orders for Germany this year.

Retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in both the euro zone and the European Union in March, preliminary data from statistics office Eurostat showed on Wednesday.

Countries that saw the biggest contraction in retail sales were Slovenia, where sales volumes were 2% lower on a monthly basis; Estonia, where sales fell by 1.3%; and Slovakia, where retail sales were down 0.9%.

British construction activity continued to slide in April, S&P Global said in its latest UK Construction PMI on Wednesday, marking the industry's fourth consecutive month of output declines amid rising business uncertainty.

Commercial projects had fallen at their fastest rate since mid-2020, researchers said, while cost pressures had led to a ramping up of job cuts in the sector.

However, S&P Global noted that April saw the slowest decline in total activity in three months, with house building showing resilience.

Shares of Swedish carmaker Volvo were 0.1% higher at 10:54 a.m. London time, paring gains from earlier in the session.

It came after the company said it would cut 5% of the workforce at its Charleston, South Carolina plant, according to Reuters, with the company citing new trade tariffs and market conditions as drivers of the decision.

Volvo reportedly said the cuts were separate from the hundreds of U.S. layoffs announced in its first-quarter earnings report last week.

A spokesperson for Volvo was not immediately available to respond when contacted by CNBC.

Wind farm operator Orsted announced on Wednesday that it would discontinue its Hornsea 4 project, a move expected to incur costs of up to 4.5 billion Danish krone this year ($680 million).

The company cited multiple ""adverse developments"" that had influenced its decision to withdraw funding for the project, including rising supply chain costs, higher interest rates, and greater risks involved with completing construction within the current timeline.

""These developments have increased the execution risk and deteriorated the value creation of the project,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Therefore, Ørsted has taken the decision to stop further spend on the project at this time and terminate the project's supply chain contracts.""

Hornsea 4 would have been Orsted's fourth windfarm site in the Hornsea Zone of the North Sea, with the U.K. government awarding the company a contract last year to sell energy generated from the farm at 2012 prices. At the time, Orsted said it was targeting commissioning of the project by the end of 2030.

Wednesday also saw Orsted confirm its full-year guidance for 2025 and post an 18% year-on-year jump in operating profit. Quarterly operating profit came in at 8.87 billion Danish krone, above the 8.16 billion krone expected by analysts polled by LSEG.

Shares of Orsted were down 1.3% by 10:39 a.m. in London.

Regional health-care stocks led losses in Europe on Wednesday, with the Stoxx Healthcare index shedding 1.2% during early morning trade.

Medical device manufacturer Ambu was the biggest loser in the sector, with its stock falling 11.9% despite the company confirming its full-year guidance and assuring investors that it is ""prepared and well-positioned to navigate"" new U.S. tariffs. Ambu posted organic revenue growth of 11.7% in its fiscal second quarter, with revenue for the three months to March coming in at a worse-than-expected 1.55 billion Danish krone ($240 million).

Ambu is expecting organic revenue growth in the range of 11% to 14% this year.

At the other end of the sector index, Novo Nordisk shares were up 5% after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter profit and cut its 2025 outlook on weaker demand for its weight loss drug Wegovy.

Regional investors are also reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that sector-specific tariffs on pharmaceuticals would be announced within two weeks.

— Chloe Taylor

German carmaker BMW confirmed its full-year guidance on Wednesday, despite acknowledging ""volatile developments"" in relation to U.S. trade policy.

As it posted first-quarter revenues of 33.8 billion euros ($38.5 billion) — slightly below analyst expectations, according to LSEG data — BMW said it still expects 2025 earnings before tax to be flat from the previous year. Currency-adjusted revenues were down 8.7% from the previous year.

The company said that although vehicle deliveries fell by 1.4% year on year, its fully electric vehicles saw ""significant sales growth"" of 32.4% to account for a quarter of all sales.

Meanwhile, BMW's automotive EBIT margin, a key profit indicator, came in at 6.9% in the first quarter — putting it at the upper end of its 2025 target range of 5% to 7%.

The company said it expects demand to rise in many markets for the remainder of the year, while noting that permanent tariffs in the U.S. could lead to rising inflation.

However, BMW said it had already priced some of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime into its outlook.

""The guidance published … in March 2025 includes all tariff increases that had taken effect by 12 March 2025,"" it said in a news release on Wednesday. ""Due to the volatile developments and ongoing negotiations, the potential impact of tariffs in the current financial year can only be estimated, based on assumptions.""

The company added that it expects some U.S. tariff increases to be temporary, with reductions being rolled out from July.

""The forecast also includes mitigating measures to offset the impact of higher tariffs,"" BMW said of its outlook. ""Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year.""

— Chloe Taylor

Novo Nordisk on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected rise in first-quarter net profit but lowered its full-year sales growth forecast on weaker demand for its blockbuster Wegovy weight loss drugs amid increased competition from copycat compounders.

The Danish pharmaceutical giant's net profit came in at 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion) for the three-month period to the end of March, ahead of the 27.8 billion Danish kroner forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

Sales of the company's popular Wegovy obesity drug rose 83% annually at constant exchange rates to 17.36 billion Danish kroner, slightly below the 18.51 billion Danish kroner anticipated by analysts in a Factset poll Tuesday.

TCW CEO Katie Koch expects the rockiness to return to the markets as investors continue to digest economic data.

""There will be a lot of uncertainty,"" she said in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen from the sidelines of Milken Institute Global Conference Tuesday. ""This is a process and it's going to take time. We are going to continue to get a series of conflicting data points.""

""We've got a lot of dry powder and we're excited for the opportunity to lean in when that happens,"" she added.

The path of the economy can range anywhere from a soft landing to a recession to stagflation, Koch said. At the moment, she said a recession is possible but is too difficult to predict.

In the meantime, selectivity is key across the board, she said. In equities, there are some bottom-up opportunities and in private credit, she sees an opportunity in rescue financing. Still, longer term, Koch still believes in the artificial intelligence revolution and the shortage of energy to support it. 

""Do I think there is massive wealth creation opportunities in equity markets by allocating capital to AI and energy? 100%,"" Koch said. ""I just think in the near term we've got a lot of volatility that we'll have to weave through.""

— Michelle Fox

Stock futures rallied after U.S. government spokespeople said that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top trade official Jamieson Greer would meet with their Chinese counterparts this week in Switzerland.

Investors can take this as an indicator of forthcoming developments on trade negotiations after President Donald Trump's tariff announcement last month ratcheted up volatility in the market.

European markets are expected to open in mixed territory Wednesday.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index is expected to open 6 points lower at 8,591, Germany's DAX up 40 points at 23,276, France's CAC 5 points higher at 7,696 and Italy's FTSE MIB 26 points higher at 38,018, according to data from IG.

There's another busy day of earnings ahead with Novo Nordisk, Ørsted, Pandora, Veolia, Legrand, BMW, Siemens Healthineers, Fresenius, Skanska B, JD Wetherspoon, Vonovia, Delhaize and Telecom Italia. Data releases include European retail sales.

Investors are sticking with the India story, with optimism on its growth prospects dwarfing geopolitical fears.

Indian markets shrugged off the latest tensions with Islamabad after New Delhi struck several targets within territory controlled by Pakistan in a military operation early Wednesday.

""Structural reforms, resilient domestic demand, and strong macro fundamentals continue to offer a compelling case,"" said Mohit Mirpuri, an equity fund manager at SGMC Capital.

""Investors may take a momentary pause, but this doesn't derail India's trajectory as a key allocation in emerging markets,"" added Mirpuri.

Markets also appeared to be drawing support from the progress on India's trade talks with major trading partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K. sealed Tuesday.

The country is expected to be among the first in the region to strike a bilateral trade deal with the U.S., potentially before the third quarter of 2025, said Radhika Rao, a Singapore-based senior economist at DBS Bank.

""We believe Indian assets will remain fairly contained despite the increase in geopolitical tensions with Pakistan,"" said Johanna Chua, global head of emerging market economics at Citi, in a note to clients shortly after India carried out the strikes.

Chua said there were historical precedents for her team's views and pointed to investors' reaction in 2019, in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack where 40 Indian security personnel were killed in an ambush, leading to Indian strikes on Pakistan-administered territory.

Currency markets were ""fairly contained"" and 10-year Indian government bond yields traded within a range of 15 basis points despite an election year and interest rate cutting environment.

While anticipating some knee-jerk market reaction, investors are hopeful for a swift de-escalation that could limit the fallout.

Indian shares traded nearly flat in the wake of the military operation, having declined in the previous session.

The benchmark Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex were little changed, signaling investors so far were not perturbed by tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries. Though experts did not rule out a sharper market impact if the conflict escalated.

Indian equities could still see some volatility over the near term with downside risks, followed by a gradual recovery, said Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities.

""The key question is whether this turns into a full-fledged conflict or remains a limited defense strike,"" Bathini said. ""A wider escalation could dent investor sentiment, while a contained response may barely leave a mark on the markets, he said.

The rupee weakened 0.33% to 84.562 against the greenback amid a broader depreciation across Asian currencies, though it was still hovering near three-month highs.

Yield on Indian 10-year benchmark government bonds was marginally lower at 6.339%.

""While the latest exchange of fire has been much more aggressive than the previous episode in 2019, we still think it will end in de-escalation over the coming months."" Darren Tay, head of APAC country risk at BMP said, adding that investors should remain generally bullish on India.

However, others cautioned that the current environment was significantly more intense than in the aftermath of the 2019 attacks.

""The situation on the border remains quite fluid. The scope and scale of India's military action this time around is far greater than in 2016 or 2019. That, in turn, suggests Pakistan will feel more compelled than before to mount a ""proportionate"" response,"" Tom Miller and Udith Sikand, senior analysts at Gavekal told CNBC.

""Having said that, the muted reaction of Indian asset prices to events overnight suggests investors don't expect an endless cycle of military retaliation,"" they added.

India's operation follows a militant attack last month in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's edition of CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

If people are spending in China, it's likely to be on travel — and businesses want a slice of that.

After 10 years as the only hostel in China's Datong city, Fly by Knight suddenly gained six new competitors in one year, according to founder Daniel Huang. He said his 26-room venue was booked out for the May Labor Day holiday, which officially ran from Thursday to Monday.

""Hotels are opening everywhere in Datong,"" he said, noting that one no-brand operator raised its prices for the holiday by more than five times to over 1,000 yuan ($140) a night.

Surging interest in history and culture is helping. The popularity of Datong's Yungang Buddhist grottoes — a Unesco heritage site from around 1,500 years ago — skyrocketed after its statues were featured in the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong released last summer.

More than 43,700 people visited the caves on May 1 alone, up over 10% from a year earlier, according to state media. The Grand Canyon averaged 13,477 visitors a day last year.

The latest holiday shows young Chinese tourists remain very interested in museums and other cultural activities, said Ashley Dudarenok, founder of ChoZan, a China marketing consultancy.

""What it means for international brands or local brands is that collaborating with those cultural icons is still a very, very important part of connecting with the consumer,"" she said.

Nationwide, China reported 314 million domestic tourist trips over the May Labor Day holiday, continuing the steady increase in recent years and well above the pre-Covid level of 195 million in 2019. The government has extended the holiday in recent years, giving locals more time off as businesses typically offer employees only a handful of paid vacation days.

China's recently built transportation infrastructure is encouraging locals to visit smaller cities such as Datong, Huang said. He pointed out that before the Covid-19 pandemic, travelers had to take a six-hour train from the capital city of Beijing to Datong.

Now, a high-speed train between the cities (about $20 per one-way ticket) takes less than two hours, with dozens of departure times throughout the day. The train route opened in December 2019.

Tourists in China have been turning to less popular, more remote destinations that tend to be cheaper than visiting large cities. During the latest May Labor Day holidays, trips to rural areas rose by nearly 20% from a year ago, with interest in farm-themed stays surging, according booking site Trip.com.

Retail sales, including food, rose by 6.3% during the holiday from a year ago, according to official figures. Tourism revenue increased by 8% to 180.27 billion yuan.

""Despite concerns over macroeconomic headwinds, the strength of travel numbers tells us that consumer sentiment is resilient,"" said Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies. The company helps foreign brands — such as Vitamix and IS Clinical — sell online in China and other parts of Asia.

""Chinese consumers are prioritizing spending on what matters most to them -- and right now, that includes travel,"" he said.

When Chinese consumers were asked where they expected to increase their spending this year, travel topped the list, followed by groceries, according to a survey conducted on behalf of financial services firm TD Cowen in February and published last month.

However, in a sign of lingering uncertainty, fewer respondents than last year said they had made travel plans for the next six months. The survey covered 2,000 Chinese residents.

Sales of retail goods have remained tepid since the Covid-19 pandemic, up by just 3.5% last year, according to official data. The services sector, including tourism, sports and childcare, has seen faster growth at 6.2% last year. China started reporting services retail sales on a year-to-date basis in July 2023.

Chinese cities have meanwhile stepped up their efforts to attract tourists, whether through short videos on social media, virtual reality experiences or elaborate light shows splashed across skyscrapers.

Some cities, such as the panda hub of Chengdu, are starting to use drones for delivering food within scenic parks, or renting out robotic-powered hiking support, Dudarenok pointed out.

""We're going to see basically a lot of what the future of tourism is going to look like, and China is testing that massively over this May day holiday,"" she said, noting that places that have invested a lot are seeing robust tourist numbers.

Chengdu, for instance, claimed a 6.2% year-on-year increase in tourist trips over the holiday to 15.52 million. That's nearly three-fourths of the city's population of 21.4 million, as of 2023.

Social media influencers, as well as word-of-mouth comments about cleanliness and safety are also helping Chinese cities attract foreign travelers, Huang said.

Huang said his hostel primarily served international visitors prior to Covid, and the share of foreign guests has recovered modestly to about one-fifth of customers. Local visitors tend to concentrate their travel during public holidays, while trips by foreign tourists are more spaced out, he said.

China has expanded its visa-free policies in the last two years to attract foreign tourists. Citizens of the U.S., U.K., Canada and more than 50 other countries can now stay in China for 10 days without a visa, while people from Japan, South Korea and several European countries can visit for up to 30 days.

Inbound travel to China around the May Labor Day holidays rose by more than 40% from last year, according to Hostel World. The data showed Chongqing, Yangshou and Guilin surged in popularity versus Beijing and Shanghai.

Citi CEO: Trade impact will play out quite slowly

Jane Fraser, Citi CEO, joined CNBC's ""The Exchange"" to discuss how she processed the weekend's news from Warren Buffett, how trade policy is impacting Citi's business and much more.

China's future lies in tech; watch biotech and semiconductors: CIO

Wong Kok Hoi, CIO of APS Asset Management, says China is going ""all in"" on tech, and that markets have not yet priced in what could be a major boost in productivity and efficiency

The U.S.-China trade relationship has effectively ended, says The Hoover Institution's Neal Ferguson

Neal Ferguson, senior fellow at The Hoover Institution, joined CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" to discuss global geopolitics and the impact of tariffs.

The U.S. and China are finally going to talk on trade. It's not a presidential call, but both sides confirmed that Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing's top official for China-U.S. economic and trade matters, will meet with his U.S. counterparts while visiting Switzerland later this week.

Ten people died after four tourist boats capsized in southwest China's Guizhou province. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing on Monday visited the site of the accident, which state media attributed to ""sudden strong winds.""

China's National Health Commission is investigating a hospital scandal. The probe, involving a senior physician at a prestigious hospital in Beijing, stirred discussion on Chinese social media about the potential role of connections in obtaining highly sought-after healthcare positions.

Alibaba's Taobao e-commerce site has joined the on-demand delivery fray. The company is rolling out same-day delivery of food, clothing and other products, just days after JD.com and food delivery company Meituan ramped up their competition in the space. Taobao claimed it received more than 10 million orders in one day.

Chinese and Hong Kong stocks climbed Wednesday after the People's Bank of China and financial regulators announced sweeping plans to cut key interest rates as they strive to shore up growth.

China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% from 1.5%. The central bank will also lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points.

Mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.44% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — rose 1.5% as of 10:30 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 has lost roughly 2.8% while the Hang Seng Index has gained over 14.6% so far this year.

The benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond yield was slightly down at 1.63%.

The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened 0.18% against the greenback to 7.2227.

A thawing in the trade stance from both the U.S. and China has sent risk assets higher in the hours since the U.S. stock market closed on Wednesday.

""The current tariffs and trade barriers are unsustainable, but we don't want to decouple,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, disclosing plans to travel to Switzerland to meet with Chinese counterparts for trade talks this coming weekend.

""Senior U.S. officials have made a series of remarks hinting at adjustments to tariffs and have expressed, through various channels, a desire to engage with the Chinese side on tariff-related issues,"" said a China Ministry of Commerce spokesperson.

Ethereum activated its long-awaited “Pectra” upgrade on Wednesday, marking the blockchain's most significant overhaul since the Merge in 2022.



The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality, and improve overall efficiency. It arrives as Ethereum contends with rising competition and internal debates over its direction.



The Pectra upgrade, a ""hard fork"" in blockchain parlance, was triggered at 10:05 UTC and finalized around 13 minutes later.



A key element of the upgrade involves increasing the amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. This change could help speed up and streamline operations for stakers, the vast network of companies and individuals who help keep the Ethereum network afloat.



Previously, staking at scale required setting up multiple validators; now, stakers can consolidate up to that amount under a single node.



The upgrade, considered to be Ethereum's biggest since the 2022 Merge to proof-of-stake, comes at a delicate moment for the ecosystem. It follows two failed test runs, one of which put a key Ethereum test network permanently out of commission.



Additionally, Ethereum, the network that introduced smart contracts and blockchain-based decentralized applications, has steadily lost market share to more nimble competitors in recent months.



Solana, in particular, has attracted more new developers over the last year than Ethereum, which was long considered the dominant non-Bitcoin blockchain.



The Ethereum community has debated whether its unofficial leader — the non-profit Ethereum Foundation — is to blame for the lagging price of the ETH token, and the perception within the industry that the network lacks a cohesive vision.



In response, the Swiss foundation introduced new leadership and a fresh set of plans to reinvigorate the chain's developer community.



Central to the upgrade is EIP-7251, which increases the maximum amount validators can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH.



The change is intended to assist staking institutions and infrastructure providers by addressing the needs of validators who stake ETH to keep the chain operational. If you want to invest more than 32 ETH with the network, you must divide your stake among dozens—or sometimes, hundreds—of separate nodes.



This not only consumes time and incurs costs, but it has also resulted in weeks-long lines for new nodes to join the network.



By upping the staking limit, ""This means that small operators can compound their stake directly, while large ones can consolidate validators to reduce bandwidth use on the p2p network,” wrote Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, over X.



Another core component of the hard fork, EIP-7702, would allow crypto wallets to temporarily function as smart contracts. This change brings the Ethereum network closer to account abstraction, a series of features that pave the way for more user-friendly crypto wallets.



Users could, for instance, pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of ETH, set up an automatic payments system, or introduce recovery access to wallets if they forget their seed phrases.



While EIP-7251 and EIP-7702 are the main focuses of Pectra, nine other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have made it into the package, mostly affecting staking providers, validators, and developers:

According to a recent X post by crypto trader Coinvo, Ethereum (ETH) is ‘insanely undervalued' at its current price. Several on-chain metrics appear to support Coinvo's assessment, as ETH accumulation addresses continue to stack the digital asset despite lackluster price performance over the past few years.

Ethereum May Be Due A Rally Soon

Although ETH has risen 8% over the past two weeks, it remains down 43% over the past year, trading around $1,700 at the time of writing. From its all-time high (ATH), Ethereum is down 63.6%, in stark contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which is trading just 13.7% below its ATH.

Ethereum's relatively poor performance compared to other major cryptocurrencies has raised questions about its long-term outlook. While Bitcoin benefits from its first-mover advantage and broader institutional adoption, Ethereum faces increasing competition from rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL), SUI, and Polkadot (DOT).

Despite prevailing negative sentiment, some analysts believe ETH could be on the verge of a turnaround. Coinvo, for instance, claims that Ethereum is significantly undervalued and could be poised for a massive rally.

The trader shared the following chart leveraging the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score – a metric used to identify potential market tops and bottoms. According to the chart, Ethereum's MVRV Z-score has now entered the green zone – between 0 and -1 – a range that historically signals a market bottom and possible trend reversal.

Meanwhile, inflows into Ethereum accumulation addresses have surged to historic highs. In an X post, analyst CryptoGoos shared a chart showing record ETH inflows into these addresses in 2025.

​​High inflows to accumulation addresses indicate that long-term investors are actively buying and holding ETH, even during market downturns. This behavior often reflects growing confidence in Ethereum's future value and suggests a potential bullish sentiment building beneath the surface.

In a separate post, CryptoGoos also highlighted that Ethereum's exchange reserves are at a multi-year low. Diminishing reserves on exchanges point to reduced selling pressure and a tightening supply, which could strengthen ETH's scarcity narrative and drive prices higher in the near term.

ETH Holders Not ‘Bullish Enough'

Noted analyst Crypto Rover drew parallels between ETH's current price action and BTC's 2021 trajectory. According to the analyst, if Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin's past performance, it may be on track to reach a new ATH in the coming months.

That said, concerns remain around further decline in ETH's price if the global macroeconomic situation worsens amid the US President Donald Trump's looming reciprocal trade tariffs. At press time, ETH trades at $1,754, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum recently rejected from a key confluence zone, including the 0.618 Fibonacci level. With price back under the point of control, traders are watching closely for signs of a deeper move or a trap.Ethereum's (ETH) price action has stalled at a technically significant region, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the most recent pivot high to low. This area is also reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a descending VWAP, adding to its weight as a decision zone. After several failed attempts to push higher, ETH has now begun to roll over, trading back under the point of control (POC) of the local range.

After an impulsive move higher, Ethereum's price has spent several sessions consolidating below a heavy resistance zone. The 0.618 Fibonacci level, a widely watched retracement marker, is reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a declining VWAP drawn from the last major high. This confluence attracted notable selling pressure, and ETH has now failed multiple times to break above.What adds further caution to the current structure is the recent loss of the point of control within this region. Price has now dipped below the highest-volume node of the recent range, suggesting that the market is no longer accepting value at these levels. This often precedes range rotation or continuation in the direction of the rejection, in this case, to the downside.

The technical landscape also reveals a clear short-term bearish structure forming. ETH has been unable to print higher highs or maintain higher lows, increasing the probability of a broader correction. The next logical support level sits around $1,540, not only a structural level from previous sessions but also a zone with visible price inefficiencies (e.g., unfilled fair value gaps and single prints) that could act as magnets for price.This setup opens the door for a potential 10% downside move from current levels, especially if the recent swing low fails to hold. Still, traders should remain alert to the possibility of a fakeout, as Ethereum has previously shown sudden strength from similar rejection zones.

Ethereum's failure to break out above the 0.618 confluence zone and its rejection from the POC suggest a higher chance of rotation toward lower supports. If price breaks below the recent swing low, the $1,540 region could be the next target.

However, if buyers can defend current levels and reclaim the POC, this might prove to be a local fakeout before resuming upward. For now, caution is warranted as price hovers near a decisive level.

Binance delists ANIME/BNB, STRK/BTC, and THE/BTC trading pairs on May 9 due to low trading volumes, impacting user experience.

Binance suspends deposits/withdrawals for Ethereum and other blockchain networks on May 7 to support Ethereum's hard fork upgrade.

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is making critical adjustments that will impact a large number of users this week. With Ethereum's upcoming hard fork, Binance has announced it will both delist underperforming trading pairs and temporarily suspend withdrawals and deposits on several networks.

Binance will delist three spot trading pairs—ANIME/BNB, STRK/BTC, and THE/BTC—on May 9, 2025, at 03:00 UTC. The exchange stated that the decision was made due to low trading volumes and poor liquidity, which can negatively affect the user experience and overall market quality. Users who hold positions in these pairs are advised to close or adjust them before the delisting takes effect.

In addition to the delisting, Binance will suspend deposits and withdrawals across multiple blockchain networks on May 7, 2025, to support the upcoming Ethereum network upgrade and hard fork. The suspension will begin at 09:45 UTC, approximately 20 minutes before the scheduled upgrade at 10:05 UTC.

The networks affected include Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), zkSync Era (ZKSYNC), Base (BASE), Manta Network (MANTA), Starknet (STRK), Polygon (POL), Metis (METIS), Scroll (SCR), Cyber (CYBER), Metal DAO (MTL), Celo (CELO), and Worldcoin (WLD). Binance has confirmed that deposits and withdrawals on these networks will resume once the upgraded network is stable and secure.

Binance noted that these measures are part of its broader effort to ensure platform reliability, asset security, and smooth operations during critical blockchain events like the Ethereum upgrade.

This Ethereum hard fork is expected to introduce several core improvements to the network, and Binance's proactive steps are designed to minimize risk and enhance user safety throughout the process.

Bitcoin and most altcoins rose on Wednesday as investors cheered the upcoming US-China trade talks. The market also reacted positively to a drop in crude oil prices ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to $97,000, its highest level since February, giving it a market cap of over $1.92 trillion. Top altcoins like Stacks (STX), Flare (FLR), JasmyCoin (JASMY), and Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped by over 3%. 

The primary catalyst for the rally is the planned meeting between senior US and Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend. The talks aim to de-escalate tensions between the two countries following triple-digit tariffs imposed in April.

According to the Wall Street Journal, China is considering additional efforts to stem the flow of chemicals used to produce fentanyl in Mexico. The US, in turn, may consider reducing tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 50%.

However, while the upcoming meeting is a positive step, analysts believe that the final agreement will take time. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, recently said that the final deal may take up to three years. 

Altcoins like Stacks, Flare, Jasmy, and Dogecoin also rose as the price of crude oil continued falling. Brent and West Texas Intermediate dropped by 0.35% to $61 and $58, respectively.

Hopes of a trade deal and falling oil prices mean that inflation will not rise as fast. It also means that the US may avoid a recession, as some analysts were expecting. Indeed, Polymarket data show that the odds of a recession in the US fell to 51% from 62% in April.

These altcoins also rallied ahead of the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Most economists expect the bank to defy Donald Trump and leave interest rates unchanged at 4.50%. 

At the last meeting and in recent comments, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that rate cuts would only occur if inflation trends toward the 2.0% target. Officials also want to assess the inflationary impact of new tariffs. In a note to Bloomberg, one analyst said:

“Powell just stating the facts on the recent inflation data and repeating over and over that the Fed will react to tariff impacts on inflation and growth as they happen, might be a dovish relief for investors.”

Historically, Bitcoin, altcoins, and equities tend to perform well when the Federal Reserve cuts rates or signals future rate reductions. A clear example was the rally during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the 2022 correction as the Fed aggressively hiked rates.

 At the Blockchain Baddies event during Token2049 in Dubai, women in Web3 shared how clarity, education and community are key to attracting more women into crypto. 

In an industry filled with complexity, jargon and mistrust, women in Web3 say that the way to attract more women into the crypto space starts with clarity, education and community. 

At the Blockchain Baddies side event during Token2049 in Dubai, women shared personal experiences of entering the Web3 world and why they believe more female participation is essential for the future of crypto.

In interviews with Cointelegraph, community members said the path forward begins with simplifying technical concepts and fostering environments where women can learn and grow.  

From simplifying technical language to creating safe spaces for learning, women in Web3 said that demystifying crypto and making tools more intuitive can unlock more opportunities for women to enter the Web3 industry. 

Caroline York, the marketing director of Web3 firm Serotonin, said that making the space more welcoming to women starts with clarity. “In order to attract more women, we've got to make the information much more digestible and a lot clearer,” she said.

York told Cointelegraph that women also tend to feel safer in high-trust and intimate environments, with friends and peers as their information source. “Women learn from other women,” York added, pointing to community-driven educational initiatives like SheFi. York said these programs play a role in expanding female participation. 

Saima Tariq Khan, an engineer, educator and crypto community member, echoed York's sentiments. Khan told Cointelegraph that demystifying crypto's intimidating vocabulary is the way to go. “What is DeFi? What do I mean by cryptocurrency? What is blockchain? First, we need to build that first level of understanding,” she said. 

Khan also said that while many women graduate from computer science courses, they are underrepresented in the workforce. The community member said that Web3's remote-friendly nature offers an opportunity to engage with an untapped talent pool.

Paloma Soria Brown, an author and a SheFi scholar, also said education is the key. However, Brown said financial literacy should be the starting point. 

“People don't necessarily know what Web3 means,” Brown told Cointelegraph. “When you know about crypto but you're not an investor, you might only see the scams and rug pulls.”

Brown said that increasing financial education and building trust are essential to attracting women and more people into the space. She said if more people understood Web3's concepts of ownership, freedom and community, they would be drawn to its potential. 

Meanwhile, Abigail Xavier, marketing manager at Web3 financial platform Fasset, told Cointelegraph that companies have a role to play in making crypto more accessible to women. Xavier said their team actively seeks input from women-focused communities to improve their products. 

“We're partnering with a lot of women-inclusive communities to understand their experience and incorporate that feedback into our UI and UX,” Xavier said. “We want to make our platform and tools more intuitive for our female audience.”

Coinbase has announced a multi-year strategic partnership with Riot Games, positioning itself as the exclusive cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain technology partner for the developer's global esports events. The collaboration aims to bring enhanced fan experiences to two of the most-watched esports titles: League of Legends (LoL) and VALORANT.

The initiative debuts at the VALORANT Champions Tour (VCT) Masters Toronto on June 7, 2025, and will extend into the League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) from June 27 to July 12. As part of the agreement, Coinbase branding will be integrated throughout official broadcasts and events, solidifying its visibility within one of the fastest-growing sectors in entertainment.

In addition to traditional sponsorship elements, the partnership will introduce unique broadcast segments including “Econ Report” for VALORANT and “Gold Grind” for LoL. These features are designed to enrich viewer understanding of in-game decision-making by offering real-time analysis of in-game economies. Through this lens, fans can gain a deeper appreciation for how economic strategy shapes professional play.

Beyond broadcast integrations, the partnership also promises a range of interactive fan engagement opportunities. These include on-site event activations, exclusive promotional giveaways, and limited-edition digital collectibles. Some of the giveaways are expected to include VIP tickets, behind-the-scenes access, and even travel packages to major esports tournaments.

Both Coinbase and Riot Games have emphasized their mutual commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation in fan engagement. As such, future phases of the partnership may include deeper Web3 integrations—such as blockchain-based loyalty programs, NFT rewards, or tokenized in-game assets. These developments would mark a significant step toward blending digital ownership and competitive gaming in a secure, scalable way.

For Coinbase, this partnership represents another strategic move into the mainstream consumer space. By aligning with Riot Games, a titan in the gaming industry, Coinbase not only reinforces its brand among younger, tech-savvy audiences but also positions itself at the intersection of entertainment, finance, and technology.

From Riot Games' perspective, the partnership underscores its willingness to experiment with new technologies and create more immersive experiences for its global fanbase. With millions tuning into LoL and VALORANT esports events each year, the partnership has the potential to redefine what digital engagement looks like for competitive gaming.

This collaboration reflects a growing trend of cryptocurrency companies aligning with the gaming and esports industries to expand their reach and demonstrate real-world applications of blockchain technology. As the partnership unfolds, it could set new standards for how Web3 tools are used in mainstream entertainment ecosystems.

Ripple continued releasing its tokens from the escrow accounts. The project released $1 billion in tokens, but this release introduced some notable changes.

The changes should improve $XRP's market stability and investors' confidence. Although these releases raise questions about Ripple's price performance, pre-locking some coins helps mitigate those risks. But despite these actions, the $XRP price declined. The coin is down by 7% in the last 7 days. After the consolidation, Ripple is still holding its key support levels. But if these levels fail, $XRP could face a further decline.

Because of the potential risks, Ripple may not be a great investment option. If you are looking to earn from crypto, don't worry. We have a perfect alternative project that you can buy for a lower price than $XR, but enjoy massive utility and ROI. The project is Solaxy, and it could be a top-notch crypto with the upcoming sale to buy now.

Ripple releases 1 billion tokens from its escrow account each month as part of its broader strategy established in 2017. The main goal of these releases is to ensure sufficient liquidity, fund the project's operations, and support Ripple's payment solutions and institutional partnerships.

This month's release was different than the usual process:

Although the price fell after the release, the long-term impact of this approach will depend on various factors. The main ones are Ripple's actions with unlocked tokens, market conditions, and investor sentiment.

Despite Ripple's efforts to stabilize its token, the price drop suggests that stability isn't enough to attract investors. The investors are shifting to projects with better growth potential that can bring them massive ROI.

This is where Solaxy, Solana's Layer 2, enters the conversation. As a crypto presale with powerful features, massive ROI potential, and APY, Solaxy is a crypto presale worth watching 

Here is more about the project.



Solaxy combines all the top features of Ethereum and Solana into one blockchain. The goal is to overcome Solana's pain points: failed transactions and network congestion. That's why Solaxy introduced a roll-up system, bundling transactions before sending them to Solana.

Thanks to Ethereum's liquidity, Solaxy is easy to buy or sell without significant price changes. The project is a terrific option for meme coin traders because it supports large-volume transactions.

Solaxy blockchain will be lightning-fast, cheap, scalable, and without congestion. The first features are already available through the testnet. Investors can try Block Explorer, but other features like Bridge, IDE, and Wiki will come soon.

Further, Solaxy is also a great source of passive income. Investors can stake their $SOLX coins for 120% APY. These rewards are great for revenue-focused investors who can earn terrific ROI. But, with staking, investors also help reduce volatility and create upward price pressure for $SOLX.

There is no doubt that Solaxy is a crypto presale opportunity with strong potential. The project holds the potential of the next 10x crypto. $SOLX future value projection suggest this coin could gain over 400% in 2025.

Solaxy presale has raised over $33.4 million. If you want to invest, hurry and buy $SOLX before the upcoming price increase. The next presale stage starts soon, so act now!

Solaxy has some advantages compared to Ripple, particularly for investors seeking projects with high-growth potential:

While $XRP tries hard to manage its supply, the recent price performance reflects the uncertainty that has surrounded the project for a while. Meanwhile, Solaxy is smashing through its presale with over $33 million raised.

The project has a 10x potential and is a well-regarded early-stage crypto project if you want high-growth potential.

But act now and take the opportunity to buy Solaxy before its price increases with the next presale stage.

BlockChainGamer - Where the games business meets blockchain - Where the games business meets blockchain



Momentum is brewing for MapleStory Universe ahead of its inaugural game launch.

Within the first 8 hours after the public MSU Scroll NFT mint started on 6th May, MapleStory Universe hit 100,000 minted NFTs. It's now reached 300,000 minted NFTs within 12 hours.

Deployed on Avalanche, the MSU Scrolls are available for free via NFT marketplace OpenSea, and capped to one NFT per wallet. As for utility, they offer special in-game items for PC MMORPG MapleStory N, Nexon's first MapleStory Universe game launching on 15th May.

The public mint ends on 12th May.

Other positive indications ahead of the game launch are some stats recently released from Nexpace, Nexon's web3 arm developing the MapleStory Universe ecosystem. 

The total number of unique wallets registered on the MSU testnet during the playtest period reached 972,000, being one of the few web3 games to almost hit 1 million during a playtest.

In addition, 76% of circulating in-game tokens were spent, and the total number of players interacting with MSU testnet reached 506,000, with one in two consistently playing MapleStory N.

No coding, no perceived chaos – that's the promise from NFTs2Me, a project featured in this Shibarium Builder Spotlight. It aims to open the door to NFT creation on Shibarium with a process designed to be as simple as click, upload, and go live.

The idea driving NFTs2Me is to tackle a common frustration. Many artists, independent creators, or even small businesses are intrigued by the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but find the learning curve dauntingly steep. 

“We're solving the complexity and technical barriers of launching NFT projects,” said the NFTs2Me team. They describe their platform as an all-in-one solution for those “who want to enter the NFT space on Shibarium without needing blockchain development skills.”

This addresses a common friction point in Web3, the evolving, more decentralized internet. The promise of this new digital era often collides with the specialized knowledge required to build within it. 

NFTs2Me intends to be that bridge. The platform provides tools for crafting various NFT types – from one-of-a-kind art pieces to series of editions or algorithmically generated collections. It also manages the technical backend, like uploading files to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed storage network, and then deploying the NFT's smart contract onto the Shibarium blockchain, reportedly with minimal fees.

But the team is keen to emphasize that their offering extends beyond mere NFT minting. They highlight features designed to cultivate and manage a community around these digital assets. 

These include varied methods for acquiring NFTs, such as traditional credit card payments, the ability to set up custom web addresses for specific projects, and token-gated access, which restricts content to NFT holders. Tools for airdrops and tracking ownership are also integrated. 

“People often assume we're ‘just another NFT minting tool,'” the team explained, “but NFTs2Me is much more: it's a complete NFT ecosystem builder.”

The decision to build on Shibarium, where their platform went live in the summer of 2023, was deliberate. The NFTs2Me team has been engaged with the platform since its inception. 
            




They were attracted, they stated, to Shibarium's “low fees, scalability, and vibrant community.” These factors, they believe, make it “the ideal layer-2 to empower creators while tapping into the broader Shiba ecosystem's energy and reach.”

Accessibility remains a central theme. Their platform, currently operational, allows users to connect a digital wallet and begin the creation or deployment process almost instantly. 

To date, they have launched their comprehensive suite for NFT creation and deployment. As for future developments? 

“We're expanding with on-chain community engagement tools to help creators build deeper connections with their audiences,” the team shared.

NFTs2Me's long-term ambition is sweeping. “Our vision is to democratize NFT creation and ownership by becoming the go-to no-code NFT platform on Shibarium and beyond,” they articulated. 

The ultimate aim is to enable a wide spectrum of users, from solo artists to established global brands, to launch and cultivate their digital communities independently, without technical intermediaries. For individuals within the Shibarium community eager to connect with the project, NFTs2Me welcomes feedback via their Discord server and encourages participation in NFT drops. 

They also express openness to collaborations.

What appears to fuel their endeavor is the palpable dynamism they observe in the Shibarium sphere. “What excites us most is the grassroots innovation and energy,” the team remarked. “We're witnessing a shift where decentralized communities and creators are taking ownership of culture and digital identity.” And within that evolving landscape, NFTs2Me hopes to provide some of the crucial building blocks.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.


An early Ethereum investor sold $34M worth of ETH on Kraken ahead of the upcoming Pectra network upgrade.

A long-term Ethereum-holding whale recently sold 18,700 ETH, valued at approximately $34.11 million. The whale is believed to have acquired Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), during the 2015 Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

This significant offloading of ETH comes at a time when the Ethereum Pectra upgrade is approaching. In anticipation of the upgrade and hard fork, crypto exchanges like Binance have announced temporary suspensions of withdrawals and deposits for Ethereum-based tokens.





The ETH whale originally purchased their cryptocurrency during the 2015 ICO, when each Ether was priced at just $0.31. At that time, the whale acquired approximately 76,000 ETH, and the associated wallet remained dormant for years until recently, when it began transferring ETH to the Kraken exchange.

An on-chain analyst shared the activity on X, revealing that the whale transferred an additional 2,700 ETH, worth around $4.96 million, to Kraken. This move follows a series of significant sell-offs in recent weeks.

Initially, the whale sold 14,000 ETH for $24.75 million and has since continued offloading more in subsequent batches. All of the sales have been conducted through Kraken. Given the original purchase price of $0.31 per ETH, the whale has secured substantial profits from these transactions.

According to reports, the whale currently holds 11,000 ETH, valued at approximately $20.2 million. However, it remains unclear whether they plan to sell the remaining holdings. If recent activity is any indication, this may not be the final ETH sale from the whale.

These sales are occurring as Ethereum approaches a major upgrade, during a period of reduced spot trading volume. The upcoming upgrade is expected to enhance the network's overall functionality by introducing improved scaling capabilities, more efficient staking options, and advanced infrastructure enhancements.

Adding to the market anticipation, the ETH-BTC Bollinger Bands are currently at their tightest since June 2020, a technical signal that often precedes a spike in volatility. Traders are closely watching the ETH-BTC pair, expecting increased price movement following the upgrade.

Written By:Gopal Solanky

A whale involved in Ethereum's 2015 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) has set a buzz in the crypto market with offloading a staggering 18,700 ETH valued at $34.11 million over the past week. 

The transfer of ETH to crypto exchange from Whales often raises tension in the market and this time it's fueling an even more tense situation ahead of the Ethereum Pecta upgrade activation. 

This whale—originally acquired 76,000 ETH at a mere $0.31 per token—transferred an additional 2,700 ETH, worth $4.96 million to the Kraken exchange. This move continues a pattern of substantial sell-offs, with the whale's average selling price pegged at $1,824 per ETH, yielding massive profits from their early investment.

The transaction was noted out by an on-chain analyst Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) with the help of on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.

On-chain data reveals the whale still holds 11,000 ETH, valued at $20.2 million, suggesting more sales may follow. Although this isn't the first instance of such activity as the same whale has been tracked over weeks, with earlier transactions including 14,000 ETH sold for $24.75 million and additional batches moved to Kraken.

The timing of these transactions is notable, coinciding with the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on the mainnet today at epoch 364032. The dual-layer hard fork introduces key improvements, including enhanced staking mechanics, smart accounts via EIP-7702, and increased blob throughput for rollups. 

While the upgrade aims to bolster Ethereum's scalability and validator operations, the whale's consistent selling has sparked concerns about potential bearish pressure on ETH's price. 

Since the past few weeks, the market sentiment is already strained, with Ethereum struggling to break resistance levels within the $1,800 range. 

As the Pectra upgrade rolls out, traders are closely monitoring whale movements and on-chain data for signs of further market shifts. While Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong, the actions of early investors like this ICO whale continue to cast a shadow over its short-term price trajectory, urging investors to tread carefully.

              Highlights            



                        Regulatory uncertainty and political infighting are stalling progress on U.S. crypto and stablecoin legislation, with the GENIUS Act facing backlash from Senate Democrats over ethics concerns and potential conflicts of interest.                      


                        The GENIUS Act proposes a detailed framework for regulating stablecoins, emphasizing consumer protections, operational standards and anti-money laundering compliance.                      


                        GENIUS Act critics warn the bill may favor large institutions, including tech firms, and stifle innovation among smaller players.                      

The cryptocurrency industry in the United States wants regulatory clarity around its on-chain financial markets and digital assets like stablecoins.

It is having a lot of trouble getting there.

The industry's hopes for a productive policy discussion around a draft bill for digital asset markets were derailed Tuesday (May 6). With news that the GENIUS Act, an acronym for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act, is being rushed to a floor vote Thursday (May 8) amid growing partisan discord, the initially bipartisan outlook for domestically issued stablecoins could also potentially be scuttled.

“Other major economies around the world are years ahead in putting clear rules in place for stablecoins and centralized intermediaries,” Kraken Global Head of Policy and Government Relations Jonathan Jachym said in a statement. “After many years of legislative progress, it is critical that U.S. lawmakers come together in the coming months to finalize stablecoin and market structure bills by August.”

Internationally, jurisdictions like the European Union have already implemented comprehensive crypto regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which came into effect in December. The U.S. has been under pressure to establish its own regulatory structures to maintain competitiveness in the global digital asset market.

The move by Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota to schedule a procedural vote for the GENIUS Act Thursday could signal openness to negotiations to address the objections raised by Democratic senators. Discussions are underway to potentially incorporate amendments that would enhance consumer protections and national security measures within the bill.

Despite its bipartisan origins, the GENIUS Act has encountered political headwinds. A faction of Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mark Warner of Virginia, have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest, particularly in light of President Donald Trump's family's involvement in the crypto industry. The launch of a stablecoin by Trump's World Liberty Financial and a substantial investment deal with a foreign entity have intensified scrutiny, with critics arguing that the legislation could inadvertently benefit Trump's personal financial interests.

As their concerns come to a head, Senate Democrats introduced Tuesday the End Crypto Corruption Act, aiming to prohibit federal officials and their families from investing in or endorsing digital assets.

For its part, the proposed GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation lays out a comprehensive set of standards for the issuance, backing and operation of payment stablecoins, digital assets pegged to the value of fiat currency and used primarily for transactions. While the bill's proponents tout its potential to strengthen consumer protection and financial stability, critics argue that it could centralize control, limit competition and stifle innovation in a sector known for its dynamism.

Stablecoin issuers under the GENIUS Act will be expected to meet rigorous operational standards, including maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity buffers, implementing robust risk management systems, and complying fully with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), including anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions obligations.

Issuers would be required to submit monthly reserve reports certified by their CEOs and chief financial officers and audited annually by a registered public accounting firm. These measures aim to reinforce market trust following high-profile collapses of algorithmic stablecoins and undercollateralized issuers.

“For the largest banks, this is probably quite good,” former assistant secretary of the treasury Amias Gerety told PYMNTS in March. “I think the largest banks will succeed as stablecoin issuers.”

However, he cautioned that community banks would struggle to compete with potential stablecoin issuers like Apple or Meta.

Per the proposed bill, stablecoin issuers must obtain licenses, with oversight determined by their size. Entities with assets under $10 billion would be regulated at the state level, while larger issuers would fall under federal supervision.

“Even if stablecoins are the preferred medium for a lot of criminal activity, creating a regulated environment where these companies can operate in conjunction with law enforcement is probably a positive,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS in April.

As U.S. stablecoin regulation moves forward in fits and starts, the marketplace is continuing a markedly upward trajectory. Stablecoin infrastructure platform BVNK received an investment from Visa Tuesday. In April, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Congressional Democrats attack Donald Trump's 'corrupt' crypto connections","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/07/democrats-trump-corrupt-connections-crypto/83480328007/","Wed, 07 May 2025 09:12:01 GMT","

WASHINGTON – Congressional Democrats are increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump's personal connections to the cryptocurrency industry, and that's throwing a wrench in bipartisan efforts to regulate the digital currency.

Two of the cryptocurrency investments owned by Trump-affiliated entities have made at least $300 million in trading fees alone on sales of his meme coin and other digital currency since January.

In late April, a company affiliated with Trump promoted the $TRUMP meme coin by offering an “intimate private dinner” with the president at his northern Virginia golf club, after which the coin's value grew as much as 80%.

And another Trump family crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, announced on May 1 that one of its digital coins is being used by an Abu Dhabi government-backed investment firm for a $2 billion investment in cryptocurrency exchange Binance − a major outlay from a foreign government to the benefit of Trump's family.

At the same time, the administration is moving to support the crypto industry's growth in the United States, including creating a ""strategic bitcoin reserve"" and digital asset stockpile, and pulling back from a Biden-era crackdown on the industry.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, too, had planned to advance legislation this week to create a regulatory framework for stablecoin, a type of crypto linked to the value of another asset like the dollar, in order to remain stable. The bill has been aggressively supported by crypto lobbyists and is expected to accelerate the currency's growth.

But nine Democrats who had previously supported the bill abruptly announced on May 3 that they would no longer support the stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, citing concerns that the legislation doesn't do enough to prevent money laundering and protect national security.

At least seven Democrats would be needed to pass the legislation in the Senate, where lawmakers need at least 60 votes to overcome the filibuster. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, repeatedly told reporters only that ""Democrats and Republicans are talking to each other about the bill,"" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said the Senate will proceed with a vote regardless.

Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, walked out of a House committee hearing on cryptocurrency on May 6 ""because of the corruption of the president of the United States and his ownership of crypto and his oversight of all the agencies.""

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, called for an Office of Government Ethics investigation into the president's crypto connections, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, launched his own investigation into Trump's profits.

Blumenthal demanded information about the business structures and potential conflicts of interest of World Liberty Financial and Fight Fight Fight (the Trump-linked business that owns the $TRUMP memecoin) in letters on May 6, which were viewed by USA TODAY.

""Donald Trump is selling cryptocurrency like snake oil in the Wild West, and he's put a for sale sign on the White House for his meme coin,"" Blumenthal said. ""People in America deserve to know how he is potentially under the influence of foreign governments and investors who are buying his crypto assets.""

Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, and Schumer plan to introduce a bill on May 7 that would ban the president, vice president, members of Congress and their families from creating crypto assets. It is co-sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who is also a co-sponsor of the GENIUS Act.

""This is not a situation where somebody is passing a few thousand dollars under the table as a bribe. This is a situation where – on the table, in full view of the public – the president is selling access to his office,"" Merkley told USA TODAY. ""If we're going to have any credibility in working for the people, we have to end this vastly corrupt enterprise the president's engaged in.""

While Democrats remain the minority in both the House and Senate, the filibuster gives Democrats some leverage over legislation's fate in the upper chamber.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement that Trump is ""dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world.""

""His assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest,"" she said.

It's not just Democrats who have raised concerns about the crypto legislation in the Senate. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, and Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said this week that they're not sure if they can support the GENIUS Act.

Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, the primary sponsor of the legislation, said he is negotiating with Democrats to get their support for the bill. After months of work, he said, ""we're very close to having everything concluded and I expect it to be concluded by the end of the week.""

                    Many crypto enthusiasts often create or invest in tokens that reference ongoing news events [File]
                                          | Photo Credit: Reuters
                                      

Newly created crypto tokens referencing the Pahalgam terrorist attack and the Indian government's Operation Sindoor strikes against targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are circulating on decentralised exchanges, per coin listing platform CoinMarketCap.

The crypto assets with names such as ‘Operation Sindoor' and ‘Pahalgam' were mostly Solana tokens with relatively low market caps. Those with Operation Sindoor-related keywords were just a few hours old.

These assets have not been officially verified and listed on coin analytics platforms due to their recency and small volumes. Many did not link back to whitepapers, official websites, or formal social media channels, as legitimate projects are expected to do.

Furthermore, it is possible for almost anyone to mint a crypto token by using a cryptocurrency that has its own blockchain.

Many crypto enthusiasts often create or invest in tokens that reference ongoing news events, trending keywords, moments in pop culture, or even memes. While such tokens may balloon in price, largely due to their negligible values, essential details such as their tokenomics and founding aims remain unclear. 

Crypto tokens minted on the basis of impulse often pose both financial and cybersecurity risks to users. For example, they may be pump-and-dump schemes that suddenly rise and then crash in price, enriching the founders and those who sell their assets early. Others may find that such crypto assets cannot be sold anywhere, or that the project is a front for cybercrime operations and the theft of donations.

Those who wish to invest in new or untested cryptocurrencies should first discuss such investment decisions with a financial adviser and carry out detailed research before proceeding.

According to Alice und Bob on Twitter, there is a growing trend of discussing Web3 technology primarily in terms of price movements, which may distort the original intent behind decentralized innovations (source: @alice_und_bob, May 7, 2025). For traders, this signals a shift in community sentiment where price speculation increasingly overshadows fundamental technological analysis. This trend can lead to heightened market volatility and short-term trading opportunities as narratives focus more on token value rather than core utility. Crypto investors should consider monitoring sentiment indicators and social media discourse as part of their strategy to anticipate price swings linked to Web3 developments.

The glittering skyline of Macao tells a story of spectacular wealth, built chip by chip on the backs of high-rollers from across Asia. For decades, this tiny 33 square kilometre Special Administrative Region of China has flourished as the world's gambling capital, with revenues that once dwarfed Las Vegas sixfold. But Macao's leadership knows the danger of letting its economic fortunes ride on a single industry. Their problem? The diversification playbook they're using is missing what could be its most innovative chapter.

When China's anti-corruption campaigns and Covid-19 travel restrictions hit simultaneously, Macao's economic vulnerability was laid bare. Gaming revenues crashed 80 percent during the pandemic, sending GDP plummeting in a way that would make even the most stoic casino pit boss sweat. The government's long-standing desire to diversify suddenly transformed from strategic ambition to economic imperative.

Macao has been talking about diversification for two decades, but the results have been modest at best. The region desperately needs a genuine catalyst – something that aligns with its existing advantages while opening genuinely new economic frontiers.

[See more: Macao's gross gaming revenue in April up by just 1.7 percent year-on-year]

Enter digital assets and blockchain technologies – the very innovations Macao's regulators have consistently rejected. While neighbouring Hong Kong crafts a comprehensive, virtual asset service provider licensing regime – and positions itself as Asia's crypto hub – Macao has doubled down on prohibition, creating a stark regulatory divergence between the sister SARs.

The restrictions on crypto in Macao are pervasive yet strangely unofficial. There's no single comprehensive law banning digital assets – instead, a web of regulatory directives creates a de facto prohibition that affects every sector of the economy.

The Macao gaming regulator (DICJ) has issued explicit instructions prohibiting any gaming-related transactions, services or activities involving virtual assets. Meanwhile, the Macao Monetary Authority (AMCM) has declared that virtual assets aren't legal tender and that exchanging crypto to or from fiat money would violate the Financial System Act.

This regulatory approach creates cascading effects. Cryptocurrency is not an accepted form of payment by any gaming operator anywhere on their properties – from gaming floors to hotel accommodations – due to these directives that effectively prevent merchants from processing such transactions through local banking channels.

Yet the prohibition hasn't actually stopped cryptocurrency from entering Macao's gaming ecosystem – it has merely driven it underground. Players routinely arrive in Macao with USDT, USDC and other stablecoins, exchanging them through illegal money changers for Hong Kong dollars before hitting the gaming floors. This shadow economy creates precisely the kind of unregulated, untraceable financial activity that proper regulations should prevent. By refusing to acknowledge and regulate this activity, Macao has inadvertently created the very problems it claims to be preventing.

The restrictions extend beyond the gaming sector to impact ordinary citizens as well. Macao's banks enforce these restrictions with remarkable zeal, refusing to facilitate money transfers offshore if they suspect the funds will be used eventually to purchase digital assets. This overreach goes beyond blocking transfers to crypto exchanges – Macao's banks will even refuse transfers to traditional stock trading platforms such as Interactive Brokers if they suspect the money might be used to purchase crypto, digital assets, or even traditional stocks in companies involved in the digital asset space.

This creates a practical barrier that prevents most Macao residents from participating in the digital asset economy unless they have offshore bank accounts and obscure the true purpose of their remittances. While residents in neighboring Hong Kong benefit from a clear regulatory framework that enables licensed platforms to offer crypto services, Macao residents are essentially frozen out of an entire economic frontier if they only maintain local banking relationships – a striking disparity between sister SARs operating under the same “One Country, Two Systems” principle.

Macao's ban on cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based financial applications isn't just out of step with regional trends – it's potentially capping the ceiling on the region's diversification efforts. The territory's “1+4” diversification strategy focuses on developing finance, technology, health, sports, and cultural tourism alongside gaming. But without embracing digital assets, several of these sectors are missing powerful accelerants.

The irony is that Macao already understands virtualized value better than most economies. The entire gaming industry is built around chips – abstracted stores of value that exist within a controlled ecosystem. The conceptual leap to digital assets isn't nearly as great as regulators seem to believe.

One of the most persistent misconceptions driving Macao's restrictive stance is the belief that cryptocurrency is inherently untraceable and therefore creates risks. This fundamental misunderstanding contradicts the technology's basic design. Unlike cash transactions – which leave no digital footprint unless manually recorded – every cryptocurrency transaction is permanently recorded on a public blockchain ledger. Far from being untraceable, crypto transactions create an immutable, transparent record that could significantly enhance AML compliance when properly implemented.

Consider the current situation: high-value patrons carrying briefcases of cash into casinos presents inherent challenges despite elaborate counting and reporting mechanisms. A regulated blockchain-based system would actually improve visibility and traceability compared to cash. Instead of banning cryptocurrency, Macao should be encouraging operators to innovate in this space and leverage these technological advantages for better compliance and security.

What's particularly troubling is how this stance undermines Macao's technology diversification goals. Global venture capital and innovative talent are flocking to blockchain and crypto technologies, with billions in smart money pouring into infrastructure that will underpin next-generation industries. Any serious technology hub must engage with these developments or risk irrelevance.

How can Macao credibly position itself as a technology centre while rejecting the very infrastructure that will likely power future innovation? You can't say you're diversifying into technology while simultaneously blocking the most significant technological revolution in finance of the past decade.

Macao's reluctance to engage with digital assets stands in stark contrast to Hong Kong's approach. Since 2022, Hong Kong has systematically developed frameworks for crypto trading, issued guidance on stablecoins, and even launched tokenised green bonds on the blockchain. 

This regulatory divergence isn't just philosophical – it's creating tangible business migration.

At a time when Macao is desperately courting diversification, crypto-adjacent businesses either don't start or flee to Hong Kong. These aren't just exchanges – they're the payment processors, identity verification services, and compliance providers that form the backbone of modern fintech ecosystems.

The uncomfortable reality? Cryptocurrency and blockchain are rapidly becoming fundamental infrastructure for the global digital economy – just as AI evolved from experimental to essential. By effectively outlawing an entire technological framework, Macao has created an innovation dead zone.

[See more: Macao's mass-market baccarat revenue remains flat in the first quarter]

How can local entrepreneurs build competitive fintech when cut off from essential components of the modern tech stack? It's like trying to build a telecommunications company while pretending smartphones don't exist.

These restrictions cascade into Macao's meetings sector too. Operators of the region's sophisticated convention facilities reportedly turn away major Web3 conferences with thousands of attendees due to informal regulatory guidance. That business – along with all those high-spending visitors – flows instead to Singapore and Hong Kong.

The contradiction is striking: Macao invests billions in infrastructure to attract visitors while simultaneously rejecting an entire category of high-value commercial activity. No financial hub can remain competitive while walling itself off from the digital asset revolution that is fundamentally reshaping global finance.

Perhaps most telling about Macao's approach to financial diversification is its focus on establishing a traditional bond market and exchange. This strategy appears fundamentally misaligned with regional realities and future trends.

Macao is trying to compete in a space where Hong Kong and Singapore have decades-long head starts, established infrastructure, and global credibility. The bond market isn't just about creating an exchange – it's about developing an entire ecosystem of experienced issuers, traders, regulators, and service providers. That takes decades to build.

The decision to pursue traditional bond markets while rejecting digital assets reveals a backward-looking vision that may ultimately handicap Macao's diversification efforts. While established financial centres are racing to integrate blockchain technology into traditional securities markets, Macao is attempting to build yesterday's financial infrastructure from scratch.

[See more: Unlucky 13? One of Macao's fanciest hotels is back on the market]

It's like deciding to invest in fax machine manufacturing just as everyone is moving to digital communication. Why compete in a shrinking, saturated space when you could be pioneering the next generation of financial infrastructure? Macao should be looking forward to new areas of finance, not backward to financial structures already being disrupted.

What would a crypto-inclusive diversification strategy look like for Macao? The roadmap could include regulatory sandboxes for controlled innovation, specialized exchanges focused on particular asset classes, and integrated digital payment systems that bridge traditional finance with new digital paradigms.

The gaming industry itself presents a unique opportunity to demonstrate blockchain's advantages. Macao's casinos have already invested heavily in smart tables with RFID chip technology that track gameplay digitally. By linking these systems to a regulated blockchain infrastructure, Macao could pioneer the world's first fully traceable, cashless gaming ecosystem – eliminating most money-laundering concerns while improving operational efficiency.

Macao could carve out a differentiated position from Hong Kong. Perhaps Macao could create its own stable coin? Imagine a system where players could exchange global stablecoins like USDT or USDC directly with casinos for gaming chips through regulated channels with transactions recorded on the casino's own blockchain. Casinos could then settle in the pataca stable coin, creating an immutable audit trail far superior to cash-based transactions and displacing the current underground economy of illegal money exchangers.

Such innovation wouldn't just solve local problems – it could become an exportable Macao product, a regulatory and technological framework that gambling jurisdictions worldwide might adopt. This could position Macao as not just a place to gamble, but as the source of next-generation gaming compliance technology.

The implications extend far beyond current applications. As artificial intelligence and robotics increasingly become economic drivers, their underlying transaction and payment systems will likely utilize blockchain and crypto technologies. These next-generation systems simply won't be running on traditional banking infrastructure or settling in patacas through BNU bank.

The AI economy will be measured in milliseconds and microtransactions. Traditional banking rails can't support that. Blockchain-based payment channels and programmable money are the only viable foundation for automation economies. By cutting itself off from crypto, Macao is effectively foreclosing its participation in these future industries before they even mature.

Despite the compelling case for embracing digital assets, Macao's regulatory stance remains rigid. This reluctance likely stems from legitimate concerns about capital controls, consumer protection, and alignment with mainland China's own restrictive approaches.

Yet Macao's unique position within the “One Country, Two Systems” framework – the same status that allows it to operate casinos when gambling is prohibited in mainland China – provides the region with policy flexibility if leadership chooses to use it.

The current approach feels like a missed opportunity to write new rules for a game Macao could win. The territory has always thrived by offering something that exists nowhere else in China. Digital assets could be part of that unique value proposition.

As Macao approaches the 26th anniversary of its return to Chinese sovereignty, its economic future remains unwritten. For a territory built on calculating odds and taking measured risks, the conservative approach to virtual assets might ironically be the riskiest bet of all – one that could leave it on the sidelines while the greatest technological and financial transformation of the century unfolds all around it.

Ethereum activated its long-awaited “Pectra” upgrade on Wednesday, marking the blockchain's most significant overhaul since the Merge in 2022.



The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality, and improve overall efficiency. It arrives as Ethereum contends with rising competition and internal debates over its direction.



The Pectra upgrade, a ""hard fork"" in blockchain parlance, was triggered at 10:05 UTC and finalized around 13 minutes later.



A key element of the upgrade involves increasing the amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. This change could help speed up and streamline operations for stakers, the vast network of companies and individuals who help keep the Ethereum network afloat.



Previously, staking at scale required setting up multiple validators; now, stakers can consolidate up to that amount under a single node.



The upgrade, considered to be Ethereum's biggest since the 2022 Merge to proof-of-stake, comes at a delicate moment for the ecosystem. It follows two failed test runs, one of which put a key Ethereum test network permanently out of commission.



Additionally, Ethereum, the network that introduced smart contracts and blockchain-based decentralized applications, has steadily lost market share to more nimble competitors in recent months.



Solana, in particular, has attracted more new developers over the last year than Ethereum, which was long considered the dominant non-Bitcoin blockchain.



The Ethereum community has debated whether its unofficial leader — the non-profit Ethereum Foundation — is to blame for the lagging price of the ETH token, and the perception within the industry that the network lacks a cohesive vision.



In response, the Swiss foundation introduced new leadership and a fresh set of plans to reinvigorate the chain's developer community.



Central to the upgrade is EIP-7251, which increases the maximum amount validators can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH.



The change is intended to assist staking institutions and infrastructure providers by addressing the needs of validators who stake ETH to keep the chain operational. If you want to invest more than 32 ETH with the network, you must divide your stake among dozens—or sometimes, hundreds—of separate nodes.



This not only consumes time and incurs costs, but it has also resulted in weeks-long lines for new nodes to join the network.



By upping the staking limit, ""This means that small operators can compound their stake directly, while large ones can consolidate validators to reduce bandwidth use on the p2p network,” wrote Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, over X.



Another core component of the hard fork, EIP-7702, would allow crypto wallets to temporarily function as smart contracts. This change brings the Ethereum network closer to account abstraction, a series of features that pave the way for more user-friendly crypto wallets.



Users could, for instance, pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of ETH, set up an automatic payments system, or introduce recovery access to wallets if they forget their seed phrases.



While EIP-7251 and EIP-7702 are the main focuses of Pectra, nine other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have made it into the package, mostly affecting staking providers, validators, and developers:

Bitcoin surged above $97,000 late Tuesday, then slid to $96,500 in Asian hours Wednesday as India conducted airstrikes in parts of Pakistan to intensify tensions from the past few weeks.

A planned meeting to discuss U.S. and China tariffs sent risk assets higher in the hours since the U.S. stock market closed on Wednesday, as reported, but those gains reversed as news of India's “Operation Sindoor” emerged in the early hours.

Traders expect to see more volatility in the days ahead as the regional tussles further damage risk-taking sentiment among traders, though eventually leading to a move higher as bitcoin is perceived as a hedge.

“Volatility in the markets is soaring as bitcoin surges to $97K from the intensifying conflict between India and Pakistan,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. 

“This is in addition to plans by the US and China to discuss a trade deal this week. This upward movement came as a surprise, as investors were de-risking positions ahead of a decision by the Fed about changing interest rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic volatility may send Bitcoin to new highs as a hedge against greater market risks,” Ruck added.

Cardano's ADA led gains among majors with a 3% bump in the past 24 hours, adding to gains from Tuesday. Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, BNB Chain's BNB and ether (ETH) added less than 2%, while legacy tokens Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) surged as much as 10%.

The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, added nearly 2%.

Meanwhile, some traders said bitcoin's surge in the past weeks was coupled with a spike in active addresses — a metric of wallet activity that some consider a sign of oncoming volatility.

“Bitcoin's recent rally to the $87,500–a spike in active addresses backs $97,500 range (now at a 6-month high) pointing to rising demand and renewed network activity,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

“This surge supports a bullish case for a potential breakout toward $100K, though confirmation depends on multiple indicators aligning,” Lee said, mirroring separate analyst commentary from the past week.

“Traders should also monitor macro conditions, Bitcoin dominance, currently nearing the 55% mark, and rising hash rates. Meanwhile, Ethereum trades in a narrower $1,600–$1,900 range, still lagging behind BTC's momentum, with sentiment more muted amid fewer catalysts and cautious capital rotation into altcoins,” Lee added.

Movement Labs, the development firm of the Movement network, has officially cut ties with co-founder Rushi Manche following controversy surrounding undisclosed MOVE token deals.

The announcement came via the company's X account early Tuesday, stating that “Movement Labs has terminated Rushi Manche's employment and all affiliations with the company effective immediately.” 

It has yet to name a replacement or outline next steps for governance restructuring.

Movement Labs has terminated Rushi Manche. Movement will continue under different leadership.Details on leadership changes and a revamped governance structure will be coming soon.

The decision follows a CoinDesk report that first revealed secret agreements between Movement-linked entities and market makers during the project's token launch.

CoinDesk reported the existence of shadow advisors, hidden payment flows, and undisclosed token allocations surrounding MOVE's debut. Manche was directly tied to those arrangements, according to internal documents and investor correspondence reviewed by CoinDesk.

Manche was initially suspended on May 2, shortly after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. The delisting followed mounting community pressure on how the company operates behind-the-scenes and project governance.

MOVE prices are down 8.5% in the past 24 hours, a bulk of the slide coming after Manche's termination. The token is down 35% in the past week.

It's Fed day again, and traders are seeking cues on how much volatility this key event might spark. According to Volmex's implied volatility indices, major tokens could see price swings, but nothing out of the ordinary is anticipated.

According to data source TradingView, Volmex's annualized one-day bitcoin implied volatility index (BVIV) stood at 49% as of writing, which equates to an expected 24-hour price swing of 2.56%. 

In other words, bitcoin (BTC) could swing by $2,470 in either direction. As of writing, bitcoin changed hands at around $96,500.

The expected daily volatility in percentage terms is determined by dividing the annualized percentage by the square root of 365, as the digital assets market is open 24/7. In traditional markets, conversion from annualized to daily involves the square root of 252 days.

As of writing, Ether's (ETH) annualized one-day volatility was 66%, suggesting a 24-hour price swing of 3.45%. Similarly, Volmex's one-day implied volatility index suggested a 24-hour move of 4.3% in Solana's SOL.

Volmex doesn't publish volatility indices tied to payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP. That said, the expected move in the token could be gauged from the forward implied volatility (IV) derived from options listed on Deribit.

The forward IV for May 8 was 77.98% at press time, according to data source Amberdata. That equates to a one-day expected move of 4.08%.

The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 18:00 UTC, which will be followed by chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 18:30 UTC. 

The central bank is expected to hold rates unchanged, but commentary on the economic outlook against the trade war backdrop and possibility of a rate cut in June could move markets.

 At the Blockchain Baddies event during Token2049 in Dubai, women in Web3 shared how clarity, education and community are key to attracting more women into crypto. 

In an industry filled with complexity, jargon and mistrust, women in Web3 say that the way to attract more women into the crypto space starts with clarity, education and community. 

At the Blockchain Baddies side event during Token2049 in Dubai, women shared personal experiences of entering the Web3 world and why they believe more female participation is essential for the future of crypto.

In interviews with Cointelegraph, community members said the path forward begins with simplifying technical concepts and fostering environments where women can learn and grow.  

From simplifying technical language to creating safe spaces for learning, women in Web3 said that demystifying crypto and making tools more intuitive can unlock more opportunities for women to enter the Web3 industry. 

Caroline York, the marketing director of Web3 firm Serotonin, said that making the space more welcoming to women starts with clarity. “In order to attract more women, we've got to make the information much more digestible and a lot clearer,” she said.

York told Cointelegraph that women also tend to feel safer in high-trust and intimate environments, with friends and peers as their information source. “Women learn from other women,” York added, pointing to community-driven educational initiatives like SheFi. York said these programs play a role in expanding female participation. 

Saima Tariq Khan, an engineer, educator and crypto community member, echoed York's sentiments. Khan told Cointelegraph that demystifying crypto's intimidating vocabulary is the way to go. “What is DeFi? What do I mean by cryptocurrency? What is blockchain? First, we need to build that first level of understanding,” she said. 

Khan also said that while many women graduate from computer science courses, they are underrepresented in the workforce. The community member said that Web3's remote-friendly nature offers an opportunity to engage with an untapped talent pool.

Paloma Soria Brown, an author and a SheFi scholar, also said education is the key. However, Brown said financial literacy should be the starting point. 

“People don't necessarily know what Web3 means,” Brown told Cointelegraph. “When you know about crypto but you're not an investor, you might only see the scams and rug pulls.”

Brown said that increasing financial education and building trust are essential to attracting women and more people into the space. She said if more people understood Web3's concepts of ownership, freedom and community, they would be drawn to its potential. 

Meanwhile, Abigail Xavier, marketing manager at Web3 financial platform Fasset, told Cointelegraph that companies have a role to play in making crypto more accessible to women. Xavier said their team actively seeks input from women-focused communities to improve their products. 

“We're partnering with a lot of women-inclusive communities to understand their experience and incorporate that feedback into our UI and UX,” Xavier said. “We want to make our platform and tools more intuitive for our female audience.”

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially significantly reduces transaction fees. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of Ethereum decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch, said Pectra “introduces ‘smart account' functionality” at deeper protocol levels and “improves Ethereum's scalability” through layer-2 solutions.

0xAw, lead developer at Base Ethereum layer-2 DEX Alien.Base told Cointelegraph that EIP‑7702 “is a potentially great addition for Ethereum.” He said that account abstraction has so far been unable to gain traction due to the need to switch wallets.

The positives of adopting such a solution include “getting rid of approval flows, not having to sign each transaction, segregated permissions and actions, and automations on behalf of the user.” 0xAw added that, following the update, developers will have an easier time implementing the features.

While account abstraction “won't magically result in mass adoption,” it still “does remove a significant barrier to entry for new people.” He added:

1inch's Kunz said the update will pave “the way for native gasless transactions and simplified user flows.” Ivo Georgiev, founder and CEO of self-custodial smart wallet Ambire, told Cointelegraph that “there will be no more infinite ERC-20 approvals, and users won't need native currency like ETH to pay transaction gas fees.” He added:

Still, the change is not without its downsides. According to 0xAw, “users have one more dangerous thing they could sign, which would be even more damaging than an approval to wallet drainers.”

Mike Tiutin, chief technology officer at onchain compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “drainers proved that users will sign ‘harmless' messages in cloned DApps.” The risk will now get worse:

Georgiev is more optimistic, saying he is “confident there will not be a tangible increase in risk.” He explained, “By this point, the industry knows how to create a secure contract, especially with such a minimal scope as an EIP-7702 delegation.”

Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org, told Cointelegraph, “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.” Staking service clients had to obtain a signed message from their staking service provider to be able to exit and store it securely for later.

Until Pectra, stakers could not exit without the participation of the staking service provider. Those messages also couldn't be generated until about 13 hours after starting staking — now this exit delay will be decreased to about 13 minutes.

Another notable upgrade is EIP-6110. This makes the execution‑layer block carry data about new validator deposits to the consensus layer. Validator deposits are new validators joining Ethereum's staking protocol.

Consensus clients previously waited for block proposers to vote on a Merkle root that summarized deposits. Now, the execution-layer block includes (supplies) a list of new verifier deposits. 

This sort of upgrade makes changes very deep in Ethereum's consensus layer, and its introduction follows client bugs breaking the Holesky and Sepolia Ethereum test networks. 

Still, Parshakov said that his firm's biggest concerns “are client bugs, but we trust that respectable teams and the Ethereum Foundation are working together to prevent it from happening on mainnet.”

 With Bitcoin hovering around $95,000 to $97,000, Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca sees growing investor confidence to borrow using BTC as collateral. 

Bitcoin holders are becoming more comfortable borrowing against their crypto as market confidence grows, according to Seamus Rocca, CEO of the Gibraltar-based private bank, Xapo Bank. 

In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $95,000 and institutional adoption starting to catch on, the mood among investors has shifted from short-term speculation to a more long-term outlook. 

“I'm not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we're nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”

On March 18, Xapo Bank launched a lending product that allows users to borrow US dollars using their Bitcoin as collateral. With the product, qualified clients can access up to $1 million in loans while keeping their BTC.

Rocca told Cointelegraph that growing confidence in crypto's long-term trajectory had fueled demand for the product. This has been driven by developments leading to broader institutional adoption. 

“Expectations are for institutional space coming in, the ETFs, and the mood music on Bitcoin is much more about wider adoption and long-term thinking than very short-term speculation,” Rocca said. 

He said this shift is the key to unlocking demand for borrowing against BTC, as investors feel more secure and feel that sharp price drops are less likely to happen. 

The Xapo Bank CEO said that its Bitcoin-backed loans offer loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 20%, 30% and 40%, giving borrowers flexibility while managing risk. “If you get a 20% LTV loan and you have 100 Bitcoin, as a lot of early adopters do, that's still a couple of million dollars you can borrow without having to sell them,” Rocca said. 

With conservative LTV levels like 20%, Bitcoin must fall below $40,000 for borrowers to get liquidated. “We're nowhere near $40,000,” Rocca told Cointelegraph, pointing to the current price stability as a reason for growing borrower confidence.

Rocca said Bitcoin-backed loans provide a solution for holders who want to stay exposed to BTC when facing life's unexpected expenses. “If you follow the ethos of investing, the smart thing to do would be not to sell it in three days if it goes to $100,000,” Rocca said.

“But life gets in the way,” Rocca added. He told Cointelegraph that unexpected costs, like medical bills or replacing a car, often force investors to liquidate assets at unfavorable times. Rocca said that instead of selling Bitcoin for a $10,000 expense, investors could borrow against their holdings while simply paying interest on the loan.

“You continue to have the upside potential of the price appreciation of the Bitcoin because you haven't sold it,” he said. “But you get liquidity to pay for things that you need in everyday life.”

With institutional adoption deepening and the Bitcoin market maturing, the Xapo Bank executive is betting that more long-term holders will be ready to tap into crypto liquidity without selling their BTC. This marks a shift from the “hodl” culture to an age where Bitcoin owners can do more with the asset.

Prepare for ‘Sex, Drugs and Zombies'—Brood XIV Cicadas Are Coming

As 17-year cicadas emerge this spring, a zombifying fungus is waiting for them

As spring warms the eastern U.S. and green shoots peek from the ground, other forms of life stir in the soil. Periodical 17-year cicadas in Brood XIV—one of 15 broods found only in North America—begin to creep from their underground burrows. Last seen in 2008, they will emerge in the billions across a dozen states from early May through June.

Above ground, flightless cicada nymphs transform into black-bodied, winged adults, ready for a month-long bacchanal of song and sex. But for many cicadas—possibly tens of millions—mating will be a gruesome parody of procreation in which their body is turned into a disintegrating puppet by the deadly fungus Massospora cicadina, which only infects 13-year and 17-year cicadas.

An infected insect will try to mate even though its genitals have been consumed by the fungus and replaced by a plug of fungal structures called conidiospores, which spread their “zombification” effect on contact. M. cicadina makes male cicadas flick their wings like amorous females do; healthy males become infected when they try to mate with the imposters. The fungus also floods cicadas with cathinone, a stimulant that also occurs in khat, a plant chewed as a recreational drug in some parts of the world. In cicadas, cathinone may boost hypersexualized behavior.

“It's sex, drugs and zombies,” says John Cooley, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut. “Nature is stranger than any science fiction that's ever been written.”

Matt Kasson

Fungus and cicada, zombifier and zombie: their relationship is at least 100 million years old, and scientists are still piecing together how it works, says Matt Kasson, a mycologist at West Virginia University. Every brood emergence helps address questions that can't be answered in a lab, such as when the fungus invades nymphs' bodies.

“When you're dealing with something that spends 16.9 years underground, there's a lot of uncertainty there,” Kasson says.

When M. cicadina infects adults, it produces durable, thick-walled “resting spores” that drop from its host's crumbling abdomen onto the ground. Resting spores infect other nymphs, which, after metamorphosis, develop their own plug of stalklike conidiospores—the spores that sexually transmit the fungus to other adults. But scientists don't know if resting spores infect nymphs after they hatch or when they surface more than a decade later.

In fact, the fungus may have more than these two spore types; they can possibly produce others that kill nymphs underground, Kasson says. Researchers recently found that M. cicadina has the largest genome in the fungus kingdom, meaning that certain aspects of its biology—such as its reproductive cycle—could be quite complex. The only other fungi with a comparable genome size are rust fungi: plant pathogens with up to five life cycle stages. Given that rust fungi and M. cicadina both have unusually large genomes, M. cicadina might share other features with rust fungi, such as multiple spore varieties, Kasson suggests.

Daniel P. Huffman and John Cooley

According to Cooley, periodical cicadas' unusually long nymph stage has led to a lack of specialized predators of these insects, with one exception: M. cicadina. “It's not surprising that the thing that would crack the cicada life cycle is a fungus that can have resting stages, so it can just wait out until the appropriate time,” he says.

Because M. cicadina prevents its hosts from reproducing, the fungus may also affect cicada populations and brood distribution; that relationship, Cooley adds, is another piece of the periodical cicada puzzle.

For Cooley, periodical cicadas offer a window into species distribution and how populations shift over time. Despite their lengthy underground stage, periodical cicadas are nonetheless good research subjects because adults are abundant and easy to find.

“They're loud; they're obvious; they tell you exactly where they are,” Cooley says. “They turn out to be one of the world's best study organisms for asking really big evolutionary questions about species and speciation.”

Over time, climate change and human activity have reshaped the cicadas' habitats: populations wax and wane, and some broods vanish entirely. Brood XIV will include three periodical cicada species: Magicicada cassini, Magicicada septendecim and Magicicada septendecula. Their emergence will show how the species and populations interact and identify potential mates of their own kind.

“What I'm going after directly is the question of range change,” Cooley says. “I'm also looking for overlaps between this and other broods.” Within the broods, patterns of waxing and waning zombie infections can reveal how cicada populations change over time.

Brood XIV cicadas will be most abundant in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller populations as far south as northern Georgia and as far north as Massachusetts. Places with more cicadas will almost certainly have more zombies, says entomologist Chris Alice Kratzer, author and illustrator of the field guide The Cicadas of North America.

“I would expect to see a lot more Massospora in Kentucky and Tennessee this year than in some places like Pennsylvania or Massachusetts,” Kratzer says.

Based on prior records from the crowdsourcing app iNaturalist for other broods, Kasson predicts that approximately two to four percent of Brood XIV will be zombified. For people who want to contribute to M. cicadina research, “uploading photos to community science platforms like iNaturalist is really essential for scientists like myself to figure out where the fungus is and is not,” he says.

Kratzer, who has previously confirmed sightings of cicadas and M. cicadina for iNaturalist, is also verifying Brood XIV sightings for the platform. When someone posts a sighting of a cicada with a Massospora infection, Kratzer encourages the observer to create entries for both the cicada and the fungus. “It's a very exciting part of science to be in because anyone with a camera or a microphone can contribute.”

If cicada-spotters are patient, they could pinpoint a zombie or two. But even if they don't find any, the sheer number of periodical cicadas is impressive to behold. With predictions of as many as 1.5 million insects per square acre in some places, this year's Brood XIV emergence will be a sight that observers won't soon forget.

“Everybody loves a spectacle,” Cooley says. “And if these aren't a spectacle, I don't know what is.”

Including some huge feet.

A team of German archaeologists recently uncovered an ancient statue sanctuary in Cyprus dedicated to Apollo. Known as Frangissa (due to its location in the remote Frangissa Valley), the site was originally discovered in 1885 but was subsequently covered in sand and lost once again. The archaeologists on this team not only rediscovered the Frangissa site, but excavated it, exposing the walls of the dedication courtyard and over 100 statue bases. 

The site features hundreds of statutes—some shockingly large—and the remnants of some of those have been found for the first time, according to a translated statement from the Cyprus Department of Antiquities and the Deputy Ministry of Culture. The team also recovered statue fragments not cataloged in the 1880s, some of which will help complete partial statues taken from the site and displayed in the Cyprus Museum and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, restoring those statues to their original design. 

Additionally, the team found entirely new types of statutes previously unknown to have existed in Frangissa. “The discovery of clearly larger-than-life feet, for example, means that the existence of colossal male limestone figures from archaic times can now be proven,” according to the statement. “Such larger-than-life figures were previously only known here in Frangissa made from terracotta, including the famous ‘Colossus of Tamassos' in the Cyprus Museum exhibition.” 

The site also contained marbled glass beads and Egyptian amulets made of faience—materials that show cultural exchanges. “A preliminary evaluation of the finds showed that the area had been in use since the Iron Age and was used throughout the archaic, the classics, and Hellenism,” according to a statement from the University of Frankfurt. 

The inscriptions on the bases of two statues help tell that story. One features local Cypro-Syllabic characters, while the other refers to the Ptolemies—the Hellenistic rulers of Egypt who also controlled Cyprus at one time—in Greek. The inscriptions show that the sanctuary was not only popular during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., but through the end of the royal period. 

“In fact,” the Cyprus statement said, “the place of worship even underwent an explicit expansion phase during this time, which can be seen in the architecture.” During the expansion, a peristyle courtyard—likely used for banquets—was built next to the votive offering room, highlighting how the site evolved to serve as both a religious and social center. 

Other marquis finds in the sanctuary include small chariots, horsemen, and warrior figures made of terracotta, as well as large-format hollow terracottas that could be as big as life-size. Limestone statues also feature horses and riders on horses. 

While the larger pieces were captured by German researcher Max Ohnefalsch-Richter in 1885—and have ended up in museums in Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Ireland, Cyprus, and possibly even Russia—numerous fragments of limestone figures and large-format terracottas were left behind. 

“It was a surprising realization that not only the pedestals for votive statues were found in the 19th-century backfill, but also vast quantities of statue fragments themselves,” according to the Cyprus statement. “Apparently, in 1885, in the rush to find impressive discoveries, they were not recognized as artifacts.” 

Luckily, today, we see them for the treasures they are.

Local farmers had been digging up hoards of treasure just these have been for centuries.

Whether people buried their wealth as ritual offerings to the gods or to hide it from greedy leaders, the ancient hoards they left behind are extremely valuable to modern-day scientists. Using metal detectors and LiDAR surveys, one archaeological team recently found over 300 artifacts from at least six different hoards in Hungary, including weapons, amber beads, and tusks of domestic boars. Researchers published their findings in the journal Antiquity. 

The excavations took place at Somló—a wine region in western Hungary located mostly on the slopes of an extinct volcano—and were part of a larger research project by the National Institute of Archaeology of the Hungarian National Museum Public Collection Centre. 

Researchers determined that the hoards date back to between the Late Bronze Age (1450–800 B.C.) and Early Iron Age (800–450 B.C.). The transition between these periods is marked by the fall of several prominent Bronze Age civilizations and, as the name suggests, a shift to iron and steel tools. One notable find at the site is an elaborate Alpine-style spearhead, but archeologists also discovered fabric and leather remains buried in the area, along with countless other objects associated with bronze working.

Though the study is impressive, it's far from the first time relics have been discovered in the area. Modern-day Somló is known for its wine production, and in the 19th century, local farmers began accidentally unearthing artifacts on the hilltop. Unfortunately—as Bence Soós, first author of the study, told Live Science—there was no formal documentation tracking where the farmers found the hoards. However, researchers do know that the farmers discovered artifacts like jewelry, weapons, and bronze vessels. 

According to the paper, the “[s]ix new hoards present the unparalleled opportunity to study hoarding traditions and depositional practices, and to evaluate the changing roles and functions of the hilltop site.”

Researchers concluded that the hoarding practices in the area were “intentional and complex,” and the evidence from the new hoards will be combined with older discoveries to provide a more thorough understanding of the region. In the future, the team seeks to date the hoards and the inhabitants that buried them more precisely.

 According to the paper, one of the six hoards—known as “Hoard V”—will be particularly useful in this effort. 

“Hoard V is probably the most recent of the Late Bronze Age depositions so far identified on the hill,” the paper reads. As a result, “radiocarbon dating of zooarchaeological material associated with this hoard [...] could provide clearer chronological understanding of the transitional period between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age at the site.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Teens driving older vehicles have increased risk for fatal crashes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250507125835.htm","Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:44 GMT","

Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for U.S. teens. Newer vehicles and driver assistance technologies show promise in reducing crashes and injury severities. Researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital reviewed national fatal crash data (2016-2021) and examined the vehicle age and driver assistance technologies of vehicles driven by teen and middle-aged drivers, and their associations with driver deaths during fatal crashes.

In a study published today in JAMA Network Open, researchers found that driving vehicles 6-15 years old had a 19% greater risk of driver death in fatal crashes, and driving vehicles older than 15 years had a 31% greater risk, both compared to driving vehicles 5 years old or newer, regardless of driver age. Additionally, each driver assistance technology already present in vehicles was associated with a 6% reduction in the risk of driver death in fatal crashes.

""Because every family wants their teen to arrive anywhere safely, teen driver fatalities are a serious public health concern,"" said Jingzhen Ginger Yang, PhD, MPH, lead author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Injury Research and Policy of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's. ""Given teen drivers' high crash rates compared to other age groups and their increasing involvement in fatal crashes, it is crucial for teen drivers to operate the safest vehicles available.""

The study found that teen drivers (15-18 years) were more likely than middle-aged drivers (31-55 years) to drive vehicles older than 15 years and vehicles with fewer driver assistance technologies at the time of fatal crashes. Older vehicles and vehicles with fewer driver assistance technologies were associated with a higher risk of death for drivers involved in fatal crashes, regardless of driver age.

""Our findings, along with those from other studies, underscore the importance of safe vehicle strategies, education for families and ensuring teens drive safer cars whenever possible,"" said Fangda Zhang, PhD, research scientist in the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's and co-lead author of the study. ""Parents commonly pass their old vehicles to their teens who are still learning basic driving skills. While it is an exciting milestone for families with new drivers, this practice increases teens' vulnerability to vehicle malfunctions, making their driving less safe.""

Because parents and caregivers often control what vehicles their teens drive, their choices significantly impact the driving safety of their teens and other road users. Families should be advised to prioritize safety features when choosing the first car for teens, ensuring it is newer and safer, given the increased involvement of teen drivers in motor vehicle crashes and motor vehicle crash-related fatalities.

Based on the study findings, study authors propose several recommendations:

Data for this study were obtained from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), a comprehensive crash database widely recognized in traffic safety research for its detailed information on drivers, vehicles, and crash environments involved in US fatal crashes.

Metrics details

Climate extremes are escalating under anthropogenic climate change1. Yet, how this translates into unprecedented cumulative extreme event exposure in a person's lifetime remains unclear. Here we use climate models, impact models and demographic data to project the number of people experiencing cumulative lifetime exposure to climate extremes above the 99.99th percentile of exposure expected in a pre-industrial climate. We project that the birth cohort fraction facing this unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones will at least double from 1960 to 2020 under current mitigation policies aligned with a global warming pathway reaching 2.7 °C above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100. Under a 1.5 °C pathway, 52% of people born in 2020 will experience unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves. If global warming reaches 3.5 °C by 2100, this fraction rises to 92% for heatwaves, 29% for crop failures and 14% for river floods. The chance of facing unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves is substantially larger among population groups characterized by high socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Our results call for deep and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions to lower the burden of climate change on current young generations.

Climate extremes have detrimental effects on society and are a foremost concern around climate change1. Anthropogenic influences have been identified in heatwaves, river floods, droughts, crop failures and certain aspects of wildfires and tropical cyclones2,3. With continued atmospheric warming, the intensity, frequency and duration of some of these events are projected to increase further4,5,6,7,8,9, with varying levels and spread depending on the event considered3. Current policies could warm global mean temperature (GMT) to +2.7 °C (+2.2–3.4 °C) above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century10. As this warming is expected to increase human exposure to climate extremes3, young generations will reap the consequences of the present-day mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

The above climate extremes are projected to occur most frequently across the lifetimes of current young generations11. As such, the number of climate extremes experienced across a person's lifetime can far exceed the expected exposure under a pre-industrial climate. Yet, the number of people who will experience this unprecedented lifetime exposure (ULE) to climate extremes remains unclear. Here we cross an extensive portfolio of multi-model projections of climate extremes with demographic data, GMT trajectories and two measures of vulnerability. We evaluate the emergence of ULE to extreme events at the grid scale to estimate the global membership of birth cohorts that will face ULE (Methods). Then, we show how this sub-population is stratified in terms of vulnerability. This is one of the first estimates of the number of people projected to experience ULE across a multidimensional framework, including birth year, warming scenario and vulnerability.

We illustrate what ULE means for extreme heatwaves in one grid cell (0.5° × 0.5°) located over Brussels, Belgium, for three GMT pathways in which warming above pre-industrial temperatures reaches 1.5 °C, 2.5 °C and 3.5 °C by the year 2100. People born in 1960 and spending their life in Brussels are projected to experience three heatwaves in their lifetime, showing little sensitivity to the GMT pathway (Fig. 1a). In this location, the 1960 birth cohort does not exceed the threshold of ULE, which we define as the 99.99th percentile of a large sample of lifetime exposures in a pre-industrial control climate and which is six heatwaves here (Fig. 1b, grey histogram and dashed line). By contrast, the 1990 birth cohort emerges into ULE for the two warmest GMT pathways shown (Fig. 1c,d). This implies that, under temperature pathways reaching 2.5 °C or higher warming by 2100, this cohort will face more heatwaves than they would have been expected to experience with a one in ten thousand chance in the absence of climate change. Different GMT pathways cause a further divergence in the lifetime exposure of those born in 2020 in this location (Fig. 1e,f). In the 1.5 °C pathway, the 2020 birth cohort is projected to experience nearly 11 heatwaves, yet this increases to 18 and 26 heatwaves in pathways reaching 2.5 °C and 3.5 °C, respectively, by the end of the century. This by far exceeds the ULE threshold under each GMT pathway, with an age of emergence already around 40 years old for the 2.5 °C and 3.5 °C pathways (Fig. 1e). We then count the number of people per birth cohort that eventually reach ULE, using absolute population estimates at the grid scale and relative cohort sizes at the country level. In this location, a best estimate of 21,000 people from the 1990 birth cohort and 24,000 people from the 2020 birth cohort are projected to experience ULE (except for the 1990 birth cohort under the 1.5 °C pathway). Under a 1.5 °C pathway, all cohorts born in Brussels after 1990 reach ULE, totalling 665,000 people. For a 3.5 °C pathway, ULE begins for people born in 1978, increasing this total to 941,000 people. For cohorts that emerge, it is virtually certain (at least  >99.99% chance) that their lifetime heatwave exposure cannot be explained by internal climate variability.

Dashed lines show the 99.99th percentile of the pre-industrial sample distribution, that is, the threshold of unprecedented lifetime exposure (ULE) for this location, cohort and climate extreme. Counts of people (right of d,f) show the population of the birth cohort that has emerged beyond the 99.99th percentile of the pre-industrial sample distribution.

We now repeat this analysis for every land grid cell and project the population fraction of each birth cohort experiencing ULE to heatwaves across the globe (CFheatwaves for cohort fraction reaching ULE to heatwaves). Of the 81 million people born in 1960, on average, around 16% (13 million people) face ULE to heatwaves regardless of the scenario. This fraction rises towards younger generations, and from the 1980 birth cohort onwards, CFheatwaves begins to depend on GMT pathways (Fig. 2a). In a 1.5 °C pathway, CFheatwaves stabilizes for recent birth cohorts, reaching an average of 52% for the 2020 birth cohort (62 million people). Comparatively, CFheatwaves of the 2020 birth cohort is almost doubled in a 3.5 °C pathway, reaching 92%. This implies that 111 million children born in 2020 will live an unprecedented life in terms of heatwave exposure in a world that warms to 3.5 °C compared with 62 million in a 1.5 °C pathway.

a, Box plots show the cohort fraction reaching ULE to heatwaves (CFheatwaves) for 1.5 °C (blue), 2.5 °C (gold) and 3.5 °C (red) pathways for global birth cohorts between 1960 and 2020 (middle line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, extend to the full range of the model ensemble). b, Bars show global cohort sizes in millions, with totals in grey and median numbers of people reaching ULE to heatwaves for 1.5 °C (blue), 2.5 °C (gold) and 3.5 °C (red) pathways. c–e, Maps display country-level CFheatwaves of the 2020 birth cohort for 1.5 °C (c), 2.5 °C (d) and 3.5 °C (e) pathways.

At the country level, CFheatwaves for the 2020 birth cohort is the highest in the tropics under low GMT pathways, yet this pattern disappears as heatwaves become widespread under high GMT pathways (Fig. 2c–e and Supplementary Tables 1–3). Under a 1.5 °C pathway, equatorial regions have relatively high CFheatwaves; of the 177 countries in this analysis, 104 have most of the population of 2020 birth cohort living with unprecedented exposure to heatwaves (CFheatwaves ≥ 50%; Fig. 2c). This latitudinal pattern is less apparent in a 2.5 °C pathway (Fig. 2d). Here, 157 countries have CFheatwaves ≥ 50%. In a 3.5 °C pathway, 167 countries have CFheatwaves ≥ 50%, 155 countries have CFheatwaves ≥ 90% and in 113 countries the entire birth cohort faces unprecedented heatwave exposure (CFheatwaves = 100%; Fig. 2e).

We then expand the analysis to a total of six climate extremes12 and 21 warming pathways (Fig. 3 and Methods). For every combination of birth cohort, climate extreme and warming pathway, we quantify the number of people experiencing ULE at the grid scale and subsequently aggregate to the country or global level. Cohort fraction (CF) for climate extremes other than heatwaves is lower across all birth years and GMT pathways because they are generally less widespread than heatwaves; however, they still affect a large population fraction (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 4–18). In a 3.5 °C pathway, 29% of those born in 2020 will live through unprecedented exposure to crop failures (Fig. 3b). This is followed by river floods, in which 14% will face unprecedented exposure to this extreme (Fig. 3e). As not all climate projections reach high warming levels, the ensemble size shrinks towards higher warming levels. Consequently, crop failures, droughts, river floods and tropical cyclones, which are more dependent on changes in the water cycle than heatwaves, exhibit discontinuities in CF at some GMT intervals (Fig. 3b,d–f). These sampling artefacts disappear when visualizing CFs for a smaller subset of simulations that are available for all GMT trajectories (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Although model uncertainties are larger for extremes other than heatwaves, differences in CF across birth cohorts are statistically significant for all six climate extremes (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs.  2 and 3).

a–d, Cohort fraction (CF) across all birth years (1960–2020) and GMT pathways (1.5–3.5 °C) for heatwaves (CFheatwaves; a), crop failures (CFcrop failures; b), wildfires (CFwildfires; c), droughts (CFdroughts; d), river floods (CFfloods; e) and tropical cyclones (CFtropical cyclones; f). Each extreme event panel has its colour bar range.

Across all projections available for the 2.7 °C pathway aligned with current policies10, ULE to heatwaves occurs in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Australia already for the 1960 birth cohort and globally for the 2020 birth cohort (Supplementary Figs. 4m–o and 5e,k). The ULE to crop failures expands around the United States, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia between 1960 and 2020 cohorts (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5b,h). The ULE to river floods occurs in northern latitudes for the 1960 cohort, in line with the observations and model projections for precipitation changes13,14,15 and expands southwards into much of the world for the 2020 cohort (Supplementary Fig. 5d,j).

The lower CF of some extremes, such as tropical cyclones, is expected given the geographical constraints of these events and their distinct meteorological drivers. Tropical cyclones can, therefore, be re-evaluated by limiting the analysis to regions that can experience them. We consider these regions to be any grid cells exposed at least once to the event across our whole ensemble of exposure projections (Supplementary Fig. 6). CFtropical cyclones nearly doubles when constraining total birth cohort size to exposed regions. For the 2020 birth cohort, this estimate changes from 6% to 11% in a 1.5 °C pathway and from 10% to 19% in a 3.5 °C pathway.

Finally, we cross our grid-scale projections for ULE to heatwaves against two grid-scale indicators of socioeconomic vulnerability (Methods): (1) the Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index v.1 (GRDI; ref. 16), which expresses relative deprivation according to six socioeconomic indicators; and (2) lifetime mean GDP per capita (denoted as GDP; ref. 17). Binning our birth cohort members into the top and bottom 20% of GRDI (Fig. 4a) and GDP (Supplementary Fig. 7a) enables a grid-scale comparison of ULE for population groups with high and low socioeconomic vulnerability. Using GRDI, we find that the most vulnerable subset of each birth cohort projected to experience ULE to heatwaves under current policies is substantially larger than the least vulnerable subset. This implies that socioeconomically vulnerable people have a consistently higher chance of facing unprecedented lifetime heatwave exposure compared with the least vulnerable members of their generation (Fig. 4b). For example, of the 2020 birth cohort, 95% or 23 million members of the high deprivation (high socioeconomic vulnerability) group face ULE to heatwaves, whereas this is 78% (19 million) for the low deprivation group. This disparity is similar when using GDP, but with only 1974 and later birth years having significant differences across vulnerability strata (Supplementary Fig. 7). Here, for the 2020 birth year, 92% (22 million) of the low-income group face ULE under current policies, whereas this is 79% (19 million) for the high-income group. Under alternative warming pathways of 1.5 °C and 3.5 °C, although the same direction of disparities remains across vulnerability strata, the lowest vulnerability groups (low deprivation and high GDP) benefit the most from a low warming pathway (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 7c,d). Socioeconomically vulnerable groups have lower adaptive capacity and face more constraints when it comes to implementing effective adaptation measures18,19. Our results highlight that precisely these groups with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability and lowest adaptation potential face the highest chance for unprecedented heatwave exposure (Fig. 4). This underlines the disproportionate risk for deprived communities in light of past and future climate extremes.

Our analysis only quantifies local exposure by design; yet in reality, the effects of climate extremes cascade non-locally. For example, in 2023, smoke from an active wildfire season in Canada was transported south along the east coast of the United States, exposing millions of people to hazardous air quality20 and causing an increased cardiopulmonary disease burden21. Climate extremes also affect society through economic impacts, including the rising cost of living due to supply chain disruptions22 and taxation to recover public infrastructure23. For instance, climate change endangers staple crop production in the main breadbasket countries that supply most of our caloric intake globally24, forcing market instabilities that only the wealthiest can cope with25. These missing non-local impacts make our estimates conservative.

By contrast, we do not capture how people adapt to extremes and thereby potentially reduce their exposure or vulnerability. For example, exposure to heatwaves can be reduced for population groups that can afford access to air conditioning18. However, maladaptive responses to climate extremes can instead create lock-ins of vulnerability and exposure1. Therefore, our lifetime exposure estimates omit beneficial adaptation outcomes as well as detrimental non-local and maladaptation effects. Finally, opting for a threshold below 99.99% would lower the bar and increase ULE estimates, and vice versa. Yet this effect is limited because the reference distribution is typically composed of small integers. By contrast, using thresholds above 99.99% risks redundancy in our bootstrapped data sample (Methods).

Some demographic realities are not accounted for here. Factors such as within-country migration, fertility and mortality respond in reality to the climate extremes considered here11. In the United States, where the population faces exposure to all extremes analysed in this study, city centres attract young people26 and disparities in life expectancy have been found across race–county combinations27 and rural–urban residency28. For instance, life expectancy is longer for those living in cities, yet here we apply country-average life expectancy and cohort size distribution uniformly within each country. Furthermore, we do not account for within-grid-cell heterogeneity, that is, we miss some fine-scale variations in socioeconomic vulnerability and exposure in socioeconomically diverse regions such as cities. Finally, we focus on the socioeconomic dimension of vulnerability, thereby neglecting that vulnerability to climate extremes may also vary with, for instance, age, gender or disability status. As demographic and multidimensional vulnerability information becomes available at ever higher spatial resolution and explicitly accounts for climate impact projections, it will become possible to deepen the analysis of the interaction between climate change and population dynamics.

The uncertainties of the extremes other than heatwaves are non-negligible. Hydrological variables have high internal climate variability29 and projecting these events requires an additional impact-modelling step relative to heatwaves, which are computed directly from global climate model output (Methods). Furthermore, these events have sensitivities to input data quality and process representation across the modelling chain (Supplementary Note 2). Other uncertainties, such as demographic representation, are not captured in this analysis. Finally, we opt for assessing ULE at the grid scale instead of at the country level. In doing so, we downscale demographic data instead of upscaling climate data, thereby projecting lifetime exposure based on the local climate of individual birth cohort members. This incurs a trade-off for accepting natural variability in locations at which ULE occurs, yet minimizing year-to-year variability in country- and global-scale CF estimates (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 8).

In summary, we find that large fractions of global birth cohorts are projected to live unprecedented exposure to heatwaves, river floods, droughts, crop failures, wildfires and tropical cyclones. As the frequency of these six climate extremes increases with warming, so does the fraction of people who will face ULE to these events. More ambitious policies are needed to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C by 2100 relative to the 2.7 °C warming expected under current policies, especially as the most vulnerable groups have more members projected to face unprecedented exposure to heatwaves. Children would reap the direct benefits of this increased ambition: a total of 613 million children born between 2003 and 2020 would then avoid ULE to heatwaves. For crop failures, this is 98 million, for river floods 64 million, for tropical cyclones 76 million, for droughts 26 million and for wildfires 17 million. This underlines the urgent need for deep and sustained greenhouse gas emission reductions to safeguard the future of current young generations.

The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) provides a simulation protocol for projecting the impacts of climate change across sectors such as biomes, agriculture, lakes, water, fisheries, marine ecosystems and permafrost (www.isimip.org). In ISIMIP2b, impact models representing these sectors are run using atmospheric boundary conditions from a consistent set of bias-adjusted global climate models (GCMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that were selected based on their availability of daily data and ability to represent a range of climate sensitivities17; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (GFDL-ESM2M; ref. 30), the earth system configuration of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model (HadGEM2-ES; ref. 31), the general circulation model from the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model (IPSL-CM5A-LR; ref. 32) and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5; ref. 33). Impact simulations are run for pre-industrial control (286 ppm CO2; 1666–2099), historical (1861–2005) and future (2006–2099) periods. Future simulations are based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5 of GCM input datasets. Global projections of annual, grid-scale fractions of exposure to each extreme event category are calculated from ISIMIP2b impact simulations and GCM input data. For the full details of these computations, we refer to ref. 12, but we summarize extreme event definitions below.

For heatwaves, droughts, crop failures and river floods, we use localized pre-industrial thresholds to determine event occurrences, whereas for tropical cyclones, we use a single absolute threshold, and wildfires are modelled explicitly (Supplementary Table 20). Heatwaves affect an entire grid cell if the Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId; refs. 34,35) of that year exceeds a threshold in the pre-industrial control HWMId distribution in that grid cell11. Although we refer to heatwaves throughout the paper, our definition technically refers to a 3-day extreme heat event that is expected on average once per century under pre-industrial climate conditions. These extreme heat events occur, by definition, everywhere across the world, but with different associated absolute temperature values. Previous analysis highlighted that intergenerational inequalities in lifetime heatwave exposure are robust across a range of heatwave definitions11. Crop failures are based on the sum of the area occupied by maize, wheat, soy or rice within a grid cell when their simulated yield falls below a threshold of their pre-industrial reference yield. Droughts, such as heatwaves, affect an entire grid cell if, for 7 months, monthly soil moisture remains below a threshold of pre-industrial soil moisture levels. Floods only correspond to river flooding, and the flooded area is derived from comparing daily discharge simulations from models of the global water sector to pre-industrial discharge. CaMa-Flood, a global river-routing model36, is used to convert these discharge values to flooded areas. Tropical cyclones occur if a grid cell sustains hurricane-force winds (≥64 knots) at least once a year37,38. Exposure to tropical cyclones does not encompass the flood hazards typically associated with tropical cyclones. Wildfires occur when the burnt area is simulated in a grid cell. Burnt area is either taken directly from annual burnt area calculations or as the annual sum of monthly burnt area in cases in which impact models simulate burnt area sub-annually, capped at 100% of a grid cell. We reiterate that all exposure definitions here neglect potential exposure reduction measures and non-local effects.

We subsequently quantify human exposure to climate extremes in a way that facilitates comparison and aggregation across extreme event categories. We consider all people in a grid cell exposed to a climate extreme in a particular year if the climate extreme occurs in that year. We thereby assume that if such a river flood or wildfire occurs somewhere in a 0.5° × 0.5° grid cell, this is sufficiently close to any person located in that grid cell to be considered affected by this extreme event. Using demographic data (see below), we subsequently convert this annual human exposure to lifetime exposure of birth cohorts by summing annual grid fractions of individual event categories across their lifetimes.

Demographic data for population totals, cohort sizes and life expectancy enable our projection of the CF experiencing ULE to these six extremes. Population totals at the grid scale come from the ISIMIP database (Fig. 2b; ref. 17) and originate from population estimates from v.3.2 of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE3.2; refs. 39,40) for the historical period (1860–2000) and population projections from middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2; refs. 41,42) for the future period (2010–2100). We note that these datasets at present do not account for the impact of climate on population dynamics, for example, through changes in migration, fertility and mortality, although these feedbacks may substantially alter the demographic data. Cohort sizes from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital43 provide estimates of country-level population totals every 5 years (between 1950 and 2100) for each 5-year age group (0- to 4-year-olds, 5- to 9-year-olds, and so on, until 95- to 99-year-olds and a final age group for those 100 years and older). Life expectancy data come from the United Nations World Population Prospects (UNWPP; ref. 44) and describe the life expectancy of 5-year-olds at the country level for 5-year blocks (1950–1955 to 2015–2020). In this dataset, life expectancy is reported for 5-year-olds to exclude biases from infant mortality. Countries that can be spatially resolved at the ISIMIP grid scale and have cohort and life expectancy estimates in these datasets meet the requirements of this study and total 177. We refer to the supplementary material of ref. 11 for a broader discussion of these datasets but explain our application of them in this analysis below.

All demographic datasets are modified to represent lifetimes annually, beginning from 1960 to 2020. Life expectancies for each country are first linearly interpolated to annual values by assuming that the values of the original 5-year groups are representative of the middle of that group. Furthermore, we add 5 years to annual life expectancies to capture the life expectancy of each cohort since birth, as the original data begin at age 5. As the maximum UNWPP life expectancy for people born in 2020 prescribes the final year in this analysis (2113), annual population totals must be extrapolated to reach this year. For population totals, we take each year beyond 2100 as the mean of the preceding 10 years of the dataset, such that population numbers for 2101 are the mean of 2091–2100. For cohort sizes in each country, we interpolate annual cohort sizes and age groups from the original 5-year age groups and divide age totals by 5 to maintain original population sizes in this dataset and linearly extrapolate these estimates to 2113. This provides the absolute numbers of 0- to 100-year-olds for each year across 1960–2113.

To downscale this demographic information to the grid scale, we assume spatially homogeneous cohort representation and life expectancy. Birth cohort size is represented as the number of people of age 0 of a given birth year in a given grid cell. This is estimated by multiplying the absolute population of the birth year (using the annual grid-scale population totals from ISIMIP) by the relative size of the age 0 cohort (using the interpolated 0- to 100-year-old population totals from the Wittgenstein Centre cohort data). Spatial variability in age structure and life expectancy within a country is therefore ignored in this study.

To project CF across different warming pathways by 2100, we construct a series of incrementally warming GMT pathways between 1960 and 2113 based on GMT trajectories taken from the AR6 Scenario Explorer45. The time series from the AR6 scenario explorer were chosen as anchor points for interpolation to produce a range of plausible GMT time series. Furthermore, they were selected to minimize overshooting in the early years of low GMT pathways over higher GMT pathways, which can skew lifetime exposure estimates for early birth cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 9). The upper bound of this subset was limited to 3.5 °C in favour of sampling more simulations for higher GMT projections, which we discuss further below. For the lower bound, 1.5 °C was chosen because it is a more realistic minimal warming scenario than 1.0 °C. Note that the 1.5 °C anchor scenario maximally reaches 1.57 °C before reducing to 1.5 °C by 2100. It is, therefore, referred to as 1.5 °C throughout this analysis. These warming levels are reported relative to pre-industrial temperatures from 1850 to 1900. This yields a total of 21 GMT pathways for which we project CF.

Our dataset of extreme event exposures represents occurrences of these extremes forced by GCM-modelled climates. These climates have unique GMT warming pathways that depend on their radiative forcing scenario (historical or RCP), as prescribed by the ISIMIP2b modelling protocol. To project these exposure maps along even intervals of warming scenarios, which the original simulations do not provide, we use the 21 GMT pathways described above. For each pairing of the 21 target GMT pathways and the concatenated historical and future exposure projections, we sample exposures by matching the GMT warming levels of the exposure series to the years of the target GMT pathways (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). The GMT warming levels behind the exposure projections are first smoothed with a 21-year rolling mean before GMT mapping is undertaken. In cases in which our constructed GMT pathways exceed the GMT warming levels of GCM simulations by too much, this mapping erroneously resamples the year of exposures corresponding to the maximum warming level of their forcing GCM. To this end, we implement a constraint in this sampling procedure such that GMT-mapped series are only used if the maximum difference across all GMT pairs is no larger than 0.2 °C. This constraint incrementally reduces ensemble sizes of exposure projections for higher GMT pathways (Supplementary Table 19).

Estimating lifetime exposure to extreme events requires crossing life expectancy data at the country level with grid-scale exposure projections. For each GMT trajectory (1.5–3.5 °C, 0.1 °C intervals), birth year (1960–2020) and country (177), exposures are summed across lifetimes at the grid scale. This assumes life expectancy to be spatially homogeneous across each country. Exposure during the death years is also included in this sum by multiplying these exposure projections by the fraction of the final year lived. This produces country-wide maps of lifetime exposure at the grid scale for each GMT trajectory and birth year in this analysis.

To generate a baseline distribution of lifetime exposure in a world without climate change, large samples of pre-industrial lifetime exposures are bootstrapped assuming 1960 life expectancy in each country. Here, for each exposure projection originating from a simulation under a pre-industrial climate, 10,000 lifetime exposures are estimated by resampling exposure years with replacement. Depending on ISIMIP2b data availability, pre-industrial exposure projections have a length of 239–639 years per simulation from which to resample from11. This process generates 40,000–310,000 country-wide maps of lifetime exposure, depending on the extreme event considered and its underlying data availability, enabling exposure projections in a pre-industrial climate. Using the pre-industrial period as a baseline enables (1) our GMT mapping procedure; (2) bootstrapping a stationary time series to achieve a large reference dataset; and (3) the production of a reference dataset with information that is independent of the projections forming our ULE estimates.

We define an emergence threshold for ULE to extreme events as the 99.99th percentile of our grid-scale samples of pre-industrial lifetime exposure. When it comes to the selection of this percentile, we went as extreme as possible given the bootstrapping of the pre-industrial control runs. This choice was based on a sensitivity analysis for different percentile values that showed a levelling off of lifetime exposure for percentiles more extreme than 99.99%. This indicated that the 99.99th percentile achieves the limit of reliable information that can be extracted from the empirical distribution. For each extreme event, birth year, GMT pathway and grid cell, we assess if lifetime exposure emerges or passes this threshold of extreme exposure in a pre-industrial climate. If this threshold is passed, we consider the whole birth cohort in this grid cell to have emerged, tallying its size among a global pool of the same birth cohort and GMT trajectory of people projected to live ULE. This means that, in some locations, even if the sum of exposed grid cell fractions across a pre-industrial lifetime does not cover the entire grid cell, we still extract the entire birth cohort size associated with that grid cell. We sum the number of emerged people in each birth cohort globally, although this birth cohort has a different life expectancy in each country. Once the number of people who have emerged globally is tallied, we divide this by the respective total cohort sizes to estimate CF per birth cohort. Note that ULE, therefore, does not refer to unprecedented in terms of the magnitude of assets or people exposed, but rather in terms of the number of events accumulated across an average person's lifespan in comparison with what they would face in a pre-industrial climate.

We use two grid-scale indicators of vulnerability to compare with our estimates of ULE to heat waves. The first is an ISIMIP2b GDP input dataset using concatenated historical and SSP2 time series covering 1860–2099 annually17. This dataset was disaggregated from the country to grid level using spatial and socioeconomic interactions among cities, land cover and road network information and SSP-prescribed estimates of rural and urban expansion46. The second indicator is the Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index v.1 (GRDI; ref. 16), which communicates relative levels of multidimensional deprivation and poverty (0–100, least to most deprived). This deprivation score uses six input components. First is the child dependency ratio, which is the ratio between the population of children and the working-age population (15–64 years). This can indicate vulnerability, for which high ratios indicate a dependency of supposed consumers and non-producers on the working-age (producing) population47. Second, infant mortality rates (IMR), taken as the deaths in children younger than 1 year of age per 1,000 live births annually, are a signal of population health and form a long-term Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations48. Third, the Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI), an assessment of human well-being across education, health and standard of living, originates from the Human Development Index, the latter of which is considered one of the most popular indices to assess country-level well-being. The SHDI improves on the HDI in terms of spatial scale and in representing 161 countries across all world regions and development levels49. Fourth, as rural populations are generally prone to multidimensional poverty50, low values in the ratio of built-up to non-built-up area (BUILT) signal high deprivation. The fifth and sixth components use the mean (of 2020; VNL 2020) and slope (2012–2020; VNL Slope) of nighttime light intensity, a proxy for human activity, economic output and infrastructure development51, to indicate deprivation for areas of low nighttime light intensity. These input components range from 30 arc seconds (roughly 1 km) resolution to subnational regions and are harmonized in an ArcGIS Fishnet feature class for aggregation onto a 0–100 range representing low to high deprivation. For the final aggregation, the IMR and SHDI components are given half the weight of the rest of the inputs, given their coarser resolution. The GRDI, therefore, encapsulates multiple dimensions through which generations face deprivation and therewith socioeconomic vulnerability to climate extremes. Although our approach does not explicitly account for actual or potential adaptation to climate change, this multidimensional approach to vulnerability provides relevant information on the current adaptation potential of local populations.

We preprocess GDP and GRDI products to enable their comparison with our ULE estimates across birth years. For GDP, similar to other datasets in our analysis, we extend the series to 2113 to accommodate the longest life expectancy of the 2020 birth cohort by copying the final year of the original dataset. We then use our ISIMIP population totals to compute GDP per capita at the grid scale. Using the GDP per capita metric, we calculate lifetime mean GDP per capita using our life expectancy information for the 1960–2020 birth cohorts. We refer to lifetime mean GDP per capita as simply GDP. For GRDI, we conservatively regrid the original grid cells of  about 1 km to the 0.5° ISIMIP grid. Although GRDI is a map composed of data spanning 2010–2020, we assume this to be representative of 2020, but nonetheless compare it with the 1960–2020 birth cohort range, similar to the rest of the analysis.

We then identify 20% quantile ranges (that is, (0–20], (20–40], … (80–100]) for the lifetime GDP of each birth year and for the singular GRDI map (assumed to align with 2020 population totals). To this end, we rank the vulnerability indicators and apply these ranks to our birth cohort totals on the same grid and for the matching year. For example, the ranks taken from the lifetime mean GDP of the 2020 birth cohort are aligned with the population totals of newborns in 2020. Finally, we bin the ranked vulnerability indicators by their associated population totals into five groups of nearly equal population (as it is not possible to achieve perfect bin sizes given the sums of grid-scale population totals). This groups the richest and poorest and least and most deprived into the aforementioned quantile ranges. The quantile range of each vulnerability indicator is then a map that can be used to mask the existing locations of ULE, such as birth years and all GMT pathways. With GRDI (Supplementary Fig. 11) and GDP (Supplementary Fig. 12), we compare the lowest and the highest 20% of each indicator by population.

The data for this analysis originate from multiple sources and are hereby listed. Model inputs, raw impact model simulations and post-processed extremes (the latter as Derived Output Data) from ISIMIP2b, as well as GDP data, are accessible at the ISIMIP repository here (https://data.isimip.org). Cohort sizes are taken from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (https://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/wcde-v2). Life expectancy data come from the UN demographics data portal (https://population.un.org/dataportal/home?df=10750103-f8fa-4a7e-bb6a-b0f151970005). Global mean temperatures are extracted from the AR6 scenario explorer45 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7197970). GRDI is hosted on the NASA EARTHDATA platform (https://doi.org/10.7927/3xxe-ap97). Maps in this analysis contain base map information made with Natural Earth (naturalearthdata.com).

Metrics details

Climate injustice persists as those least responsible often bear the greatest impacts, both between and within countries. Here we show how GHG emissions from consumption and investments attributable to the wealthiest population groups have disproportionately influenced present-day climate change. We link emissions inequality over the period 1990–2020 to regional climate extremes using an emulator-based framework. We find that two-thirds (one-fifth) of warming is attributable to the wealthiest 10% (1%), meaning that individual contributions are 6.5 (20) times the average per capita contribution. For extreme events, the top 10% (1%) contributed 7 (26) times the average to increases in monthly 1-in-100-year heat extremes globally and 6 (17) times more to Amazon droughts. Emissions from the wealthiest 10% in the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions. Quantifying the link between wealth disparities and climate impacts can assist in the discourse on climate equity and justice.

Over the past two decades, extreme events attributable to climate change resulted in an annual average of US$143 billion in damages1. How these costs could and should be covered—both between and within countries—is a matter of debate2. Central to this debate is the stark disparity between those responsible for emissions and those affected by their impacts. The wealthiest 10% of the global population accounted for nearly half of global emissions in 2019 through private consumption and investments, whereas the poorest 50% accounted for only one-tenth of global emissions3. At the same time, regions with low historic emissions and income levels are typically more frequently and severely exposed to climate impacts4,5 and have limited resources for adaptation6. This cause-and-effect injustice is widely acknowledged7, yet a quantification of how emissions inequality translates into unequal accountability for the resulting global temperature levels and extreme climate events is missing. This translation should account for the individual warming contributions of emissions of non-CO2 GHGs, such as methane (CH4), given their major role in recent warming8.

In this study we combine wealth-based carbon inequality assessments3 with an emulator-based climate modelling framework9 to systematically attribute changes in global mean temperature (GMT) levels and grid-cell-level climate extremes to emissions from different wealth groups. We use the Model for the Assessment of the Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC)10, a simple climate model, in conjunction with the Modular Earth System Model Emulator for Monthly Temperature and Precipitation (MESMER-M-TP)11, a model that is able to generate large ensembles of spatially explicit monthly temperature and precipitation data that closely resemble those of complex Earth system models at a fraction of the cost.

We use attribution science frameworks to link human-induced GHG emissions to changes in the modelled frequency and intensity of extremes12. These frameworks were originally developed to attribute changes in total human emissions13,14. Today, they are increasingly applied for source attribution; that is, to quantify the relative contributions of individual emitter groups, such as companies or countries15,16. When attributing impacts among multiple emitters, various approaches exist and serve distinct purposes17,18. Here we assess the changes in the characteristics of monthly extremes but for the emissions attributable to a specific emitter group15,18.

We generate counterfactual emission pathways by subtracting the 1990–2019 emissions of specific emitter groups, namely the wealthiest 10%, 1% and 0.1% globally, as well as in the United States, EU27, India and China (Fig. 1b). Emissions data are drawn from ref. 3 and include emissions from domestic consumption, public and private investments and trade. These emissions are attributed primarily to consumers, except emissions from capital formation in production sectors, which are attributed to firm owners3. Emissions are reported as a basket of GHGs with warming expressed in CO2 equivalents. We convert these counterfactual pathways into GMT levels and gridded climatic variables (Fig. 1a), allowing us to compare the 2020 climate against the hypothetical 2020 climate state that we would observe if these groups had not emitted. Specifically, we attribute GMT levels and changes in the probability and intensity of extremely hot and dry months (Fig. 1c). Prolonged heat poses a significant burden on human health19 and sustained precipitation deficits impair crop yields and threaten water resources20, meaning that both climate extremes are highly relevant in driving climate impacts. We measure meteorological droughts with the standardized precipitation index computed over 3-month periods (SPI-3)20.

Counterfactual emissions were converted into GMT using the simple climate model MAGICC and subsequently translated into grid-cell-level realizations of climatic variables using MESMER-M-TP. a, Counterfactual CO2 emissions pathways.

We quantify climate impacts associated with wealthy emitters and compare them to the global average per capita contribution. We do not assess what would constitute fair or just emissions, nor do we assign direct responsibility for the resulting impacts. For illustration, we also provide counterfactual warming outcomes based on rescaling global emissions according to the per capita profile of individual income percentiles.

Our modelling framework depicts natural variability and uncertainty in the global response to emission changes (Methods). Unless mentioned otherwise, we provide median results with the 5th–95th confidence intervals in parentheses. All results are statistically significant (established via a one-sample t-tests, Methods) unless explicitly marked otherwise. As our database provides only basket emissions, we derived the main results by assuming that emissions for each GHG scale proportionally with the globally aggregated emissions (Methods). We explore the sensitivity to this assumption in Supplementary Section 2.

GMT in 2020 is 0.61 °C (0.45–0.83 °C) higher than in 1990. We found that about 65% (0.40 °C (0.27–0.56 °C)) of this increase is attributable to the global top 10%, 20% (0.12 °C (0.09–0.17 °C)) to the top 1% and 8% (0.05 °C (0.03–0.07 °C)) to the top 0.1% (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These warming contributions are higher (by about one-fifth) than the respective group's contributions to aggregated GHG basket emissions (Supplementary Table 2), underscoring the importance of non-CO2 GHGs21 (see also Supplementary Section 2).

Grey bars highlight the median GMT increase attributable to each region as a whole. Two CIFs are given: the lighter (darker) value is relative to the country's equal share (actual emissions) and measures global (regional) inequality. Vertical lines represent the 5th–95th confidence intervals from natural variability and uncertainty in the global temperature response. Circles highlight median values from the sensitivity analysis. Estimates are based on 600 ensemble members each.

To put these numbers into perspective, we defined a group's equal share as the contribution to warming they would have if their per capita impact matched the global average. Therefore, we scaled the total GMT increase according to the group's share of the global population (for example, the equal share of the global top 10% would be 10% of the full 0.61 °C increase). We then derived climate inequality factors (CIFs) as the group's actual contribution to global warming relative to their equal share. CIFs increase from 6.5 for the top 10% to 20 (77) for the top 1% (0.1%), indicating an amplification of climate inequality with increasing wealth.

The full depth of the disproportion in contributions to GMT level becomes tangible when global emissions are rescaled according to the per capita profile of global income groups (Fig. 2b). If the entire world population had emitted like the bottom 50%, there would have been minimal additional warming since 1990. However, if the entire world population had emitted like the top 10%, 1% or 0.1%, the GMT increase since 1990 would have been 2.9 °C, 6.7 °C or 12.2 °C.

Between 1990 and 2020, emissions from the global top 10% arose primarily in the world's highest emitting countries: the United States, the EU27, China and India (Fig. 2c). Note that the composition of the global top 10% shifts over time (Supplementary Fig. 1), and while our focus is on wealthy individuals from the world's largest economies, those from smaller (wealthier, as well as less wealthy) countries also contribute disproportionately3. Income levels from regional top emitters deviate from their global counterparts: the top 10% and 1% in the United States and the EU27 (India and China) are wealthier (poorer) than the globally wealthiest 10% and 1% (Fig. 2d).

Attributed GMT shares by regional emitter groups combine within- and between-region inequality. In the United States (EU27), the top 10% contribute 3.1 (2.8) times more to global warming than the average citizen, but 17 (8) times more than the global average. For the United States, the contribution of the top 10% alone exceedes the entire country's equal share. This relative inequality increases with increasing wealth: the top 1% in the United States (EU27) contribute 53 (21) times their equal shares, and the top 0.1% contribute 190 (64) times their equal shares. In China, where the overall CIF is near 1, the top 10%, 1% and 0.1% emit 4, 13 and 50 times their equal shares, showing even greater regional influence from societal elites. Similarly, in India, where the national CIF is 0.3 (implying that the countries per capita average emissions are below the global average), the top 10%, 1% and 0.1% emit 1.2, 4 and 10 times the global average.

We attribute regional increases in the frequency of extremely hot (dry) months, here defined as 1-in-100-year events in a pre-industrial climate, to the emissions of the global top 10% (Fig. 3a), so throughout this Article extremes or extreme events refer to a month being at least as hot (dry) as the hottest (driest) 1% of months in a pre-industrial climate. We state attribution results as additional event counts over a modelled 100-year period of current climate conditions compared with those in 1990 (Methods). For example, 10 additional attributable events indicate that a pre-industrial 1-in-100-year event happens an additional 10 times within 100 years, meaning that its probability has increased tenfold.

CIFs indicating the group's contribution to extremes relative to the average contribution are given above the bars. Vertical lines correspond to 5th–95th confidence intervals. We omit showing global drought estimates because of insufficient agreement among grid-cells. Distributions were derived by first computing median attribution results at each grid cell (estimated from 15,000 ensemble members each) and then computing statistics across all grid cells within each region.

For heat extremes, changes are most (least) pronounced in August (February), where 11.5 [8.5–15.4] (3.5 [2.4–4.3]) additional events are attributable to the global top 10%. These changes refer to the global median over land that is predominantly located on the Northern Hemisphere. Areas in strongly affected regions, such as the Amazon region, Southeast Asia or central Africa, face months with up to 30-fold increases in probability (see also Supplementary Figs. 5–8).

To account for differences in seasonality between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, we assessed heat extremes during the month with peak temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 4). Emissions from 1990–2020 led to a 12.3-fold (9.7–17.9) increase in the probability of heat extremes in the peak temperature month. The top 10% (1%) contribute 7.3 (25.7) times the global average to this (Supplementary Figs. 9–13e). In addition, the intensities of these extremes increased by 0.83 °C (0.75–0.97 °C) since 1990. Of this increase, 0.55 °C (0.50–0.67 °C) (0.17 °C (0.16–0.21 °C)) is attributable to the top 10% (1%), suggesting that their contribution is 6.7 (21.1) times higher than the global average (Supplementary Figs. 9–13).

Attribution results for meteorological drought extremes strongly depend on region and month, with robust drying found mainly in Central America, the Amazon, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and northern Australia (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figs. 5–8). This is expected, given the considerable intermodel disagreement and large uncertainties in regional precipitation projections22,23,24. We found the strongest attributable drying trend in the Amazon region in October. Overall, the region faces a threefold increase (1.7–4.2) in extreme probability compared with 1990 (Fig. 3b). The top 10% (1%) contribute 6.1 (16.7) times the global average to this increase. The Amazon region is of global importance, given its uniquely biodiverse system and its major role in the global carbon cycle. Drought events over the past century have already negatively impacted carbon storage in Amazonian rainforests25.

Overall, the spatial disparity in attributable changes at the grid-cell-level (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 5–13) implies that the regions that disproportionately contribute to the emissions of the top 10% (for example, the EU27 and the United States; Fig. 2) face smaller increases than regions that have contributed very little (for example, western North America and west and central Europe compared with the Amazon region and west southern Africa in Fig. 3c,d).

The relatively small (attributable) changes over India and parts of China and the simultaneously high intermodel disagreement are worth noting, given that they are inconsistent with the increasing number of climate-related disasters India is already facing26. We assume that this is related to the climate effects of air pollution, which we discuss in greater detail in Supplementary Section 3.

The inequality in warming contributions from affluent groups in high-emitting regions exceeds the inequality in their global counterparts (Fig. 2). This disparity also appears at the grid-cell-level: in the global median, emissions from the top 10% (1%) in the United States are associated with 1.3 (1.0–1.8) (0.3 (0.3–0.5)) additional 1-in-100-year heat events during peak temperature months. This impact represents 23 (60) times the global average contribution and about 3 (2) times the relative contribution of the global top 10% (1%) (Fig. 3). The increase in extreme heat is unevenly distributed across regions. For example, in heat-affected areas such as the Amazon and southeast Africa, emissions from the top 10% in China (the United States) are linked to 2.7 (1.9–3.2) (2.5 (1.7–2.8)) and 2.7 (1.1–3.4) (2.5 (1.0–3.2)) additional occurrences of extreme heat during months with peak temperatures (Fig. 4). In these areas, we can also robustly attribute heat extremes to the regional top 1%. In the Amazon, 0.8 (0.7–1.0) additional heat extremes are attributable to the top 1% in China. This corresponds to an increase in occurrence frequency of 80%.

Left: median number of additional heat extremes in selected regions that are attributable to the top 10% of emitters in China, the United States, the EU27 and India. Right: same as on the left but for the top 1% of emitters. Wider bars indicate that more events are attributable to a given emitter group. The values in the bars indicate the additional numbers of events over the course of 100 years. Median estimates were derived by first computing median attribution results at each grid cell (estimated from 15,000 ensemble members for each) and then computing statistics across grid cells within each region.

Attributing changes in extreme events to country-specific wealthy emitter groups becomes increasingly challenging as emitter groups decrease in per capita size, meaning that their cumulative emissions decrease even if their relative emissions contributions increase. Projected temperature distributions are characterized by strong changes in the trend and by consistency across models, allowing robust attribution results even for seemingly small emission amounts, particularly in highly affected regions. The magnitude depends on the definition of extremes, with tail risks seeing the strongest increase (Supplementary Figs. 18–21). For droughts, the situation is more complex. The SPI-3 signal is dominated by variability and considerable intermodel disagreement, which prevented us from deriving robust attribution results when emissions are small.

This study introduces a framework to link wealth-based emissions to shifts in GMT and to changes in regional monthly heat and meteorological drought extremes. We found that the wealthiest 10% contributed 6.5 times more to global warming than the average, with the top 1% and 0.1% contributing 20 and 76 times more, respectively. For heat, this imbalance is more pronounced at the grid-cell-level: the wealthiest 10% and 1% contributed over 7 and 25 times more than the global average to the increase in frequency of pre-industrial 1-in-100-year heat extremes during months with peak summer temperatures. The warming contributions of the wealthy are associated with considerable transboundary effects—for example, the contributions of the wealthiest 10% within the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions such as the Amazon, Southeast Asia and southeast Africa. The robust attribution of drought signals is more complex. We found the strongest signals in the Amazon region in October, where the emissions of the global top 10% (1%) led to a 2.3-fold (0.8-fold) increase in the frequency of extreme droughts.

Our analysis also underscores the critical role of CH4 emissions in near-term warming (Supplementary Fig. 2) and calls for new research to disentangle income-based emissions at the level of individual gases. Reducing CH4 emissions in line with Paris Agreement-compatible pathways could yield immediate reductions in global temperatures and climate extremes27.

We note that our study focuses on monthly extreme heat (that is, extremely hot months), meaning that heatwaves—defined as prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures lasting from two days to months28—do not directly relate to our metric. However, the probability of extreme daily temperatures is amplified during extremely hot months29, implying that attributable results for short-duration heatwaves might be even more pronounced. Further research is needed to explicitly explore this relationship.

Wealth-based emissions comprise private consumption and investment in capital formation across production sectors that supply goods and services consumed by society. Recognizing the associated unequal warming contributions can inform policy interventions. For example, deliberation over a coordinated global wealth tax can draw on this work, illustrating the climate co-benefits of attenuating stark wealth-based disparities in climate impact responsibilities30,31. The transboundary impacts we identify highlight how high-emitting individuals contribute to intensified extremes, even in distant regions. Similarly, the warming attributable to the investments of the wealthy underscores the need to realign financial flows to meet global climate goals32. This is particularly relevant for the wealthiest 1% and 0.1%, whose transboundary contributions to worsening local extremes arise primarily through investments, rather than consumption. Efforts to redirect these financial flows should also consider the shared responsibilities of governments to expedite systemic changes in financial and regulatory structures33.

Our granular impact analysis shows that low-income regions incur the brunt of the harm caused by emissions concentrated among wealthier populations worldwide. From an adaptation and loss-and-damage perspective, this provides a basis for policy discussions around contributions to compensatory and preventative measures. The amounts of adaptation and loss-and-damage finance provided currently are minuscule compared with the assessed needs34. Our work motivates innovative policy instruments targeted at wealthy individuals to bridge these glaring finance gaps35. Such policies can also improve perceptions of climate justice, a vital factor in fostering social acceptance of climate action36,37. Moving towards evidence-based and targeted policies that reflect polluter-pays principles, including on the domestic level in terms of individual contributions, may therefore be an important cornerstone to enhance policy support for climate action in general.

Considerations of our results in policy debates must, however, recognize the conceptual challenges and value judgements in our approach and implementation. First, our attribution relies on consumption-based emissions accounting, allocating emissions between consumers and shareholders through shared ownership (see ref. 3). Our approach contrasts with production-based approaches used to quantify the responsibilities of producers15. Exploring diverse accounting frameworks is key to developing policy mechanisms that address multiple dimensions, but requires care in determining responsibility. Second, we employ the ‘but for' attribution method. This approach directly links emissions to observed climate change while accounting for the timing of emissions and impacts. However, it is sensitive to the sequence of emissions removal and the design of the counterfactual scenarios18. Third, our approach is limited to changes in climate hazards only, and does not account for on-the-ground vulnerabilities and exposure, which are often key to driving the eventual impact of extreme climate events38. Integrating other causal drivers into extreme event attribution analysis increasingly allows us to address those limitations38,39 in a step towards using extreme event attribution to inform the discourse on loss and damage40,41. At the same time, wealth levels are a key determinant for adaptive capacity and vulnerability in the face of climate change, particularly at the levels of households and individuals42,43. We would therefore expect wealth-related drivers of vulnerability and exposure to further exacerbate the inequalities in responsibilities and experience of the impacts of the climate hazards we studied here.

All quantitative estimates are tied to these three assumptions, and we must recognize the choices and value judgements involved in the analysis when evaluating the ethical and legal implications of our findings.

Our analysis is further limited by the lack of data on how GHG emission compositions vary with income and wealth. This limits the accuracy of our results, given the role of non-CO2 GHGs in recent warming. In addition, our drought indicator only considers precipitation, which may lead to underestimations in drought risks24. Finally, our analysis is based on modelled data, which may deviate from observations44,45.

Accordingly, our analysis does not explicitly assign full responsibility for resulting climate impacts, nor does it determine fair emission levels for any income group. Such determinations require an integrated view of fairness, justice and socio-economic factors46,47, with different reference points for societies at varying levels of development.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate how individual emitter groups have contributed to increases in regional extremes globally. In times of growing economic and climate inequalities, advancing frameworks for attributing emissions to individual emitters can inform global climate action and enhance climate justice.

We quantified intensity and frequency changes in extremely hot (dry) months attributable to specific emitter groups. The methodological framework relies on three steps (Fig. 1): first, we constructed counterfactual emissions pathways (that is, emissions pathways with and without the emissions of selected population groups); second, we translated emissions into gridded temperature, precipitation and potential drought data via a chain of computationally efficient emulators; and third, we built on the framework of extreme event attribution to quantify changes in the grid-cell-level distributions of the climatic variables.

We relied on the SPI-3 to identify meteorological droughts20. The SPI-3 is computed from precipitation data only, meaning that it does not account for changes in soil- and plant-based water demands. As climate-driven precipitation signals are dominated by natural variability and intermodel disagreement24, climate change-induced trends in our drought indicator are probably a conservative estimate of actual changes20. Therefore, we also computed the SPEI-348. The SPEI-3 takes changes in water demands via potential evapotranspiration (PET) into account. Ideally, PET is estimated from temperatures, radiation, wind speed and humidity via the Penman–Monteith equation20,49. Given that our emulation framework only depicts temperature and precipitation, we relied on the Thornthwaite method to compute PET from temperature data only50. However, PET estimates via the Thornthwaite method are prone to overestimations in terms of magnitude and temporal trends51. This left us with an indicator for meteorological droughts (SPI-3) that probably underestimates drought risks and an additional indicator for potential droughts (SPEI-3 via the Thornthwaite method) that probably provides an overestimation. We used the conservative estimates in the main part of our analysis and show potential drought risks in Supplementary Section 5.

We assessed what our climate today would look like if the wealthiest 10%, 1% and 0.1% globally, as well as in the United States, EU27, India and China, had not contributed to global emissions between 1990 and 2019. We followed ref. 52 to construct a time series of historic baseline emissions from 1850–2019 resolved by gas. Next, we removed emitter-specific contributions from these baseline emissions (Fig. 1). To do so, we relied on a dataset of consumption-based CO2e emissions categorized by country and income decile between 1990 and 20193. The estimates relate to all emissions except those from agriculture, forestry and other land use. Our analysis required us to make assumptions about how to disaggregate the reported basket emissions into individual gases. We focused on decomposing emissions into CO2, nitrogen oxide (N2O) and CH4. These three gases make up 98.7% of the total global GHG emissions (excluding agriculture, forestry and other land use)53. The composition of production-side GHG emissions varies strongly by country, ranging from primarily CO2-based emissions (for example, Singapore) to almost equal shares of CO2 and CH4/N2O (for example, Qatar) and, in low-income countries in particular, primarily CH4/N2O (for example, Chad)54. The carbon inequality dataset from ref. 3 employs input–output tables that redistribute production-side emissions to consumers across countries. About one-half of global CH4 emissions are embodied in global trade, with household consumption dominating the final demand category55. Given these considerations, and a lack of alternative data, we chose to apply the same decomposition assumptions across countries and emitter groups. For our central estimate, we assumed that emissions for each GHG scale proportionally with the globally aggregated emissions. We tested the sensitivity to this assumption by providing two extreme cases in which the wealthy emitters (1) solely emit carbon (CO2case) or (2) solely emit CH4 and N2O (non-CO2case). Note that in the non-CO2 case, the emissions associated with the global top 10% are larger than the total global CH4 and N2O emissions combined, and we removed the excessive emissions from the CO2 time series. We converted between individual GHGs and CO2e using the Global Warming Potential 100.

We transformed counterfactual emissions into grid-cell-level distributions of temperature and precipitation using emulators and subsequently computed drought measures from the emulated data. The emulation consisted of two steps: first, converting emissions into GMT; and second, translating GMT into grid-cell-level monthly mean temperature and precipitation distributions (Fig. 1). The first translation step was carried out with MAGICC10,56. MAGICC is a simple, computationally efficient climate model for global climate indicators. Our temperature outcomes were calculated with MAGICC v7.5 in a probabilistic setting that reflects the assessed uncertainty ranges from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report24. We generated 600 GMT trajectories for each scenario. The second translation step was carried out using MESMER-M-TP11. MESMER-M-TP combines parametric approaches and stochastic sampling to approximate the behaviour of individual climate models. For any climate model, the emulator can be calibrated with a small set of actual climate model data and then used to generate gridded temperature and precipitation data that statistically resemble the climate model data. Here we calibrated MESMER-M-TP with 24 different models from the Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, we converted each GMT trajectory into a single gridded time series of temperature and precipitation. We computed the SPI-3/SPEI-3 indicator following ref. 48 and used the gamma distribution for normalization. This provided us with a dataset containing 4 variables × 600 realizations × 2,652 grid points × 170 years × 12 months for each scenario.

Traditional attribution studies typically aim to understand how climate change altered the statistics of a specified observed extreme. Our study deviates from this approach. We were interested in understanding the extent to which changes in a broad class of historic extremes can be related to emissions from specific emitter groups. We therefore used the framework for event attribution as a guideline14 but modified it according to our research questions. Most importantly, our analysis fully relied on modelled data, meaning that we were not taking observational data into account. Hence, the event attribution framework was reduced to three essential steps: first, we defined extreme events; second, we performed an analysis using emulated (climate model) data; and third, we synthesized the hazards into an attribution statement.

We defined extreme events relative to the reference period 1850–1900 and focused on 1-in-100-year (main text) and 1-in-50/1-in-10,000-year (Supplementary Information) events.

In a first step, we tested whether changes in the grid-cell-level distribution of a climatic variable under a given counterfactual scenario were significantly different from its present-day distribution. To this end, we computed the differences between the present-day and counterfactual present-day distributions and employed a Student's t-test57 to verify that the distribution was significantly different from zero. If this was the case, we proceeded with the actual attribution. We used the modelled distribution of climatic variables over the reference period to derive grid-cell-specific intensity thresholds for our defined events. To assess frequency changes, we counted how many times the reference intensity threshold was exceeded in a present-day (2020) climate and in a counterfactual 2020 climate, and attributed the difference to a specific emitter group. Similarly, we quantify intensity changes by assessing how hot (dry) a specific extreme would be in a present-day climate as compared to a counterfactual climate, and attribute the difference in values.

Metrics details

In bilaterian animals, gene regulation is shaped by a combination of linear and spatial regulatory information. Regulatory elements along the genome are integrated into gene regulatory landscapes through chromatin compartmentalization1,2, insulation of neighbouring genomic regions3,4 and chromatin looping that brings together distal cis-regulatory sequences5. However, the evolution of these regulatory features is unknown because the three-dimensional genome architecture of most animal lineages remains unexplored6,7. To trace the evolutionary origins of animal genome regulation, here we characterized the physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals (sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians)8,9 and their closest unicellular relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates)10 by combining high-resolution chromosome conformation capture11,12 with epigenomic marks and gene expression data. Our comparative analysis showed that chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture in ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians. These sequence-determined distal contacts involve both promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions. By contrast, chromatin loops are absent in the unicellular relatives of animals. Our findings indicate that spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution. This evolutionary innovation introduced regulatory complexity, ultimately facilitating the diversification of animal developmental programmes and cell type repertoires.

A fundamental characteristic of animal multicellularity is the existence of specialized cell types. These cell types result from differential access to genomic information in each cell. Thus, evolutionary changes in genome regulation are proposed to be a major innovation linked to the emergence of complex multicellularity with stable cell differentiation6,10. This idea is supported by comparative genomic analyses showing that gene innovation at the origin of animals was less extensive than previously thought10,13, thus suggesting that an important animal innovation was the ability to coregulate existing genes in different combinations.

In bilaterian animals, genome spatial compartmentalization mediates the organization of gene neighbourhoods that can be independently regulated3,4,6 and that are specific to different cell types14. Another mechanism contributing to elaborate gene regulation in bilaterians is the combinatorial interaction of distal cis-regulatory elements and gene promoters by means of chromatin loops that bring distant regions into spatial proximity through genome folding, contrasting with the predominant regulation by proximal promoter elements in unicellular eukaryotes10. Comparative analyses of histone posttranslational modifications have shown that candidate distal enhancer elements, as defined by chromatin features, predate the origin of bilaterian animals8,15,16, whereas such enhancers are absent in the closest unicellular relatives of animals17. However, it is still unclear whether distal regulation in early-branching metazoans is mediated by physical interactions with gene promoters or linked to the existence of insulated gene regulatory landscapes.

To investigate the origins of animal gene regulation, here we comparatively studied chromatin architecture at subkilobase resolution in non-bilaterian animal lineages and their closest unicellular relatives of animals (Fig. 1). This includes the two phyla proposed as the sister group to all other animals9,18: ctenophores, which are mostly pelagic, marine predators that swim using ciliated comb cells and have complex nerve nets19,20; and sponges, which are sessile, benthic organisms that filter-feed using collared choanocyte cells8,21. We also examined placozoans, which are millimetre-sized, flat animals that feed on microbial mats by gliding using ciliary movement and mucus secretion, controlled by peptidergic secretory cells22, and cnidarians, the sister group to bilaterians that includes jellyfishes, corals and anemones23. Finally, we studied three unicellular relatives of animals, known as unicellular holozoans: ichthyosporeans, which are osmotrophic unicellular eukaryotes that reproduce through multinucleated coenocytes24; filastereans, which are heterotrophic protists with complex life cycles, including aggregative multicellular stages17,25 and choanoflagellates, which are heterotrophic flagellates that show both single-cell and colonial forms and are the closest living relatives to animals26. The comparative analysis of chromatin maps across these lineages allows us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of genome regulation in animals.

Top right and below, Micro-C interaction maps of specific genomic regions (S. arctica, chr. 2: 3400000–3700000, bin 1 kb; C. owczarzaki, chr. 01: 3660000–3800000, bin 400 bp; S. rosetta, chr. 21: 800000–1100000, bin 800 bp; M. leidyi, chr. 8: 15500000–15700000, bin 400 bp; E. muelleri, Emue22: 2200000–2400000, bin 800 bp; T. adhaerens, TadhH1_4: 3880000–4180000, bin 800 bp; N. vectensis, NC_064040.1: 11650000–12000000, bin 1 kb; D. melanogaster, chr. 3L: 20480000–20820000, bin 800 bp; and H. sapiens, chr. 12: 69000000–71000000, bin 5 kb), showing examples of insulation boundaries or chromatin loops. All interaction maps were balanced using ICE normalization.

We used Micro-C11,12 to map genome-wide chromatin contacts at single-nucleosome resolution in representatives of non-bilaterian animal lineages (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Text 1): the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi19,20, the sponge Ephydatia muelleri21, the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens22 and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis23. As outgroup species, we studied chromatin architecture in three unicellular holozoans: the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma arctica24, unicellular filasterean amoeba Capsaspora owczarzaki17,25 and the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta26. We also compared our chromatin maps with existing datasets from two bilaterians: Drosophila melanogaster27 and Homo sapiens12. To analyse our chromatin contact experiments, we first resequenced de novo and assembled to chromosome-scale the genomes of M. leidyi, E. muelleri and C. owczarzaki using a combination of Nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technology) long-read sequencing and Micro-C data (Extended Data Fig. 2). For S. arctica, S. rosetta and T. adhaerens, we rescaffolded existing genomes22,24,26 to chromosome level using Micro-C data. In addition, to interpret the observed contact features, we generated genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing or ATAC-seq), chromatin modifications (chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq) for H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1) and gene expression (RNA sequencing or RNA-seq), or used published datasets when available (Supplementary Table 2). We integrated three-dimensional (3D) chromatin data with linear chromatin marks to systematically compare genome architectural features at different resolutions3,4,7 (compartmentalization, insulation and chromatin looping) and across phylogenetically distant species with diverse genome sizes, gene densities and transposable element content (Fig. 1a).

We first analysed global chromosomal compartmentalization, which results from the spatial segregation of distinct chromatin states genome-wide (active, A; inactive, B) and is influenced by histone marks, DNA methylation and gene transcription, among other phenomena28,29. As such, compartmentalization is often considered an intrinsic biophysical property of the chromatin driven by phase separation30,31. To compare the degree of self-affinity and segregation between major chromatin compartments, we defined A/B compartment limits in each species. We then calculated the intensity of compartmentalization in genomic bins with compartment A and B interaction frequency in the top 20th percentile (Fig. 2a). Compartmentalization strength in each species was quantified as the ratio of homotypic (AA, BB) to heterotypic (AB) interactions (Fig. 2b). The relative resolutions were obtained by partitioning genomes into equal number of bins across species (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), but the differences between species remained consistent regardless of the number of bins used (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we assigned an intermediate compartment (I) to regions with weak spatial separation (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d).

a, Saddle plots showing contact interactions between A and B compartments in each species, organized by eigenvector ranking. To obtain the distance-normalized matrix, the ratio of observed-over expected interactions is calculated, followed by eigenvector decomposition. The eigenvectors are oriented and sorted from the lowest (B compartment) to the highest (A compartment) values. The bins of the interaction matrix then reordered according to the rank of the eigenvector. The observed (O) and expected (E) values are averaged to create a saddle plot. The top 20% of the interaction values were used to calculate the compartment strength values shown on the saddle plots.

Our analysis revealed that, with exception of M. leidyi, animal genomes were globally segregated into transcriptionally active, gene-dense compartments and transcriptionally inactive, transposable element-rich compartments, similar to what is observed in bilaterian animals (Extended Data Fig. 3d). In these species, we detected a strong separation of A and B compartments in saddle plots (Fig. 2a) and the compartment strength values above 1.8 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, these compartments encompass relatively large contiguous regions across the genome (Extended Data Fig. 3b). By contrast, unicellular holozoans and M. leidyi did not show strong separation of large A and B compartments (Fig. 2a,b), similar to what is observed in yeast32 and other protists33. The absence of large-scale chromatin compartments in M. leidyi is unusual among animals, although it has been previously reported in certain species34. This lack of compartmentalization may be due to the absence of constitutively silenced regions across different cell types. Overall, our results indicate that A/B chromosomal compartmentalization is a phylogenetically conserved feature across animal genomes.

We next characterized small-scale chromosomal features across species by defining spatial insulation boundaries between neighbouring loci. The boundary elements that partition genome into domains can arise from active transcription, silenced repetitive regions or binding of sequence-specific architectural proteins at insulator or tethering elements5,27,35,36. Thus, our first goal was to identify the occurrence of insulation boundaries in each species (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 4), and then classify these points into different regulatory or structural features (domain boundaries, gene bodies, regulatory loops and so on) (Fig. 2e). To this end, we calculated insulation scores for each species, representing the difference in contact frequencies between each genomic bin and its neighbouring bins. We used different resolutions and sliding window sizes (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) and, for each species, we selected the resolution and two window sizes that yielded the maximal insulation signal, indicating the strongest partitioning of the genome into isolated structural and functional domains. The median distance between successive identified boundary elements varied between 6.4 kilobases (kb) in S. rosetta and 190 kb in H. sapiens, yet the median number of genes per interval was consistently similar across species, with two to four genes (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

The presence of self-interacting domains, contiguous regions of the genome with enriched interactions, was assessed by examining the average pile-up plots between insulation boundaries (Fig. 2c). We observed weak contact enrichment between pairs of insulated boundaries in unicellular holozoans and E. muelleri. In M. leidyi, boundary elements were tethered through strong focal contacts and without intradomain interactions, contrary to what would be expected within topologically associating domains (TADs)3. By contrast, D. melanogaster showed intradomain enrichment without focal contacts, in agreement with previously reported domains37. T. adhaerens and N. vectensis showed a certain degree of self-affinity within insulated neighbourhoods, as well as focal point enrichment (Fig. 2c). The degree of insulation of genomic regions could be quantified from the distribution of genome-wide insulation scores (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4c). M. leidyi, T. adhaerens, N. vectensis, H. sapiens and S. arctica genomes contained strong boundary elements in comparison with E. muelleri and, especially, the weakly insulated genomes of C. owczarzaki and S. rosetta (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4c).

After identifying insulation points, we investigated the genomic features associated with these boundaries (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4d). We first assigned insulation boundaries to annotated chromatin loops, followed by the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes not involved in chromatin looping and then accessible chromatin regions that may represent other regulatory elements. Remaining boundaries were assigned to A/B compartment limits. This analysis revealed that most insulation boundaries in unicellular holozoans and E. muelleri were associated with active TSSs (Fig. 2e), suggesting that active transcription is the main factor defining insulation in these species37. By contrast, many insulation boundaries could be assigned to chromatin loop anchors in M. leidyi (77%; compared to 78% in H. sapiens human embryonic stem cells) and in T. adhaerens (38%), whereas in N. vectensis, we identified 166 chromatin loops that represented only 1.6% of insulation boundaries. The number of chromatin loops in M. leidyi (4,261) and T. adhaerens (3,065) was much higher than those found in N. vectensis (166) and D. melanogaster (313)27, despite their similar genome sizes and gene densities (Fig. 1a). Loop sizes were comparable in these four species (median 21–28 kb), but much smaller than in H. sapiens (median 140 kb) with a genome 15–30 times larger (Fig. 2f). To further characterize these distal contacts, we examined genome-wide H3K4me3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 to classify many of the identified loop anchor sites as promoter-like elements (Fig. 2g). In M. leidyi and N. vectensis, chromatin loops predominantly occurred between promoters and enhancers (77 and 69%, respectively), similar to H. sapiens (63%). By contrast, 79% of loops in T. adhaerens connected promoters to other promoters, similarly to what is observed in D. melanogaster (49%)38. Our results show that enhancer–promoter and promoter–promoter long-range chromatin loops are shared between bilaterians and early-branching animal lineages, and possibly date back to the origin of animal multicellularity.

In unicellular holozoans, we did not observe any spatial contact patterns indicative of chromatin loops. However, manual inspection revealed a few regions enriched in distal contacts. For example, in S. arctica, we could identify 296 self-interacting insulated domains that also contact each other (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). These regions were depleted of active histone marks and were enriched in transposable elements, probably representing repressed chromatin domains that cosegregate (Extended Data Fig. 5c). In S. rosetta, there were 183 distally interacting regions that contained lowly expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e) and were enriched in H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 or lacked profiled marks (Extended Data Fig. 5f). These may also represent repressed regions39, albeit they do not form well-defined domains like in S. arctica. In C. owczarzaki, we observed a plaid pattern indicative of chromatin microcompartments (Extended Data Fig. 5g), reflecting the spatial cosegregation of active promoters of highly transcribed genes with a strong H3K4me3 signal (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). These microcompartment contacts form a regional small-scale checkerboard pattern with alternating loci of high and low interactions. Furthermore, we also detected high-frequency contact domains over gene bodies of highly expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 5j).

In the sponge E. muelleri, we identified local interactions perpendicular to the main diagonal, and visually reminiscent to fountains observed in mouse, zebrafish and C. elegans40 (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Manual inspection further revealed 84 focal contacts between distal genomic loci (Extended Data Fig. 6c), including gene promoters interacting with other regions showing promoter or enhancer-like chromatin signatures (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). These weak distal interactions occurred between extended genomic regions, in contrast to the point-to-point contacts typical of chromatin loops (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Although chromatin loops were absent in E. muelleri, we identified 243 distal cis-regulatory elements, consistent with findings in other sponge species15. These elements were characterized by chromatin accessibility, with surrounding regions showing high H3K4me1 and low H3K4me3 signals, and were mostly intergenic but close to annotated TSS (median 3.8 kb) (Extended Data Fig. 6f). This distance-to-TSS distribution was similar to that of annotated enhancer elements in M. leidyi, T. adhaerens, N. vectensis and D. melanogaster that do not form loops (median 5.6 kb, compared to 31 kb in loop-forming enhancers) (Extended Data Fig. 6f), suggesting that sponges' enhancer elements might function by proximity without the need for stable looping41.

Genome folding in the cnidarian N. vectensis was characterized by the presence of chromatin loops, as well as weakly insulated self-interacting domains (Extended Data Fig. 7). We identified 166 chromatin loops forming both promoter–promoter and promoter–enhancer contacts, and with some loops spanning nearly 1 megabase (Mb) (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Chromatin loops have also been reported in the hydrozoan Hydra vulgaris42, suggesting they are a conserved feature in cnidarians. Notably, some of the identified chromatin loops in N. vectensis showed a one-sided stripe pattern similar to those observed in other species, which are generated by cohesin extrusion43. Moreover, we identified an enriched GTGT motif (FC = 327, P = 1 × 10−40) present in 32% of loop anchors (Extended Data Fig. 7d). This motif resembles sequences with G-quadruplex-forming potential44, which have been shown to stabilize enhancer–promoter interactions in other species45. Beyond chromatin loops, we also observed self-interacting domains in N. vectensis (Extended Data Fig. 7e). The insulation boundaries of these domains were enriched for the YY1 motif (FC = 9,016, P = 1 × 10−87) (Extended Data Fig. 7f), which is known to mediate chromatin interactions35,45. These regions represent high-frequency contacts within the same gene regulatory landscape, but are not stabilized by chromatin loops as in vertebrate TADs3, nor are they as strongly insulated as the domains defined by insulator elements in D. melanogaster27.

Our high-resolution chromatin contract maps revealed a complex 3D genome organization in the placozoan T. adhaerens, characterized by many loop contacts forming 3D interaction hubs (Fig. 3a). To confirm this observation, we profiled chromatin contacts in a distantly related placozoan species, Cladtertia collaboinventa, which showed a very similar pattern (Fig. 3a). Most of these interactions are promoter–promoter hubs (n = 2,413 for T. adhaerens and n = 3,239 for C. collaboinventa) (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Notably, 7–10% of chromatin contacts (n = 241 for T. adhaerens, n = 394 for C. collaboinventa) connected promoters with intronic or intergenic enhancer regions (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), revealing the presence of distal cis-regulatory elements in placozoans.

Each heatmap scale starts at zero.

We identified 321 promoter hub regions in the T. adhaerens genome and 331 in C. collaboinventa, involving 1,695 and 2,191 genes, respectively, with a median of four promoters in each hub in T. adhaerens and five in C. collaboinventa. To further reconstruct the 3D organization of these hubs, we used METALoci to calculate spatial correlation between genome folding and epigenetic (ATAC, H3K4me3 ChIP) or genomic (exon annotation) features (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8c). This analysis revealed a nested structure where accessible promoter regions were central to the 3D interactions tightly clustered in space (ATAC-seq in Fig. 3b), whereas gene bodies and the first nucleosome (H3K4me3) occupied more peripheral locations (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, genes within spatial promoter hubs were linearly grouped along the genome, resembling the arrangement of housekeeping genes observed in mouse embryonic stem cells46. Alternatively, these structures could be associated with active transcription and the formation of micro-compartmentalized RNA polymerase II-driven transcription hotspots47.

Notably, not all collinear genes formed promoter hubs. Following this observation, we categorized genes into three groups based on their spatial and epigenetic organization (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). This includes group 1 genes (GP1, n = 2,978 in T. adhaerens, n = 3,973 in C. collaboinventa) that had both ATAC and H3K4me3 peaks and formed chromatin loops, with an average interaction strength in aggregate peak analysis (APA) of 1.32, indicating the enrichment of Micro-C signal at loop anchors. Group 2 genes (GP2: n = 3,681 in T. adhaerens, n = 3,119 in C. collaboinventa) also showed ATAC and H3K4me3 peaks, but lacked strong distal contacts (APA = 1.12). Last, group 3 genes (GP3: n = 3,851 in T. adhaerens, n = 4,238 in C. collaboinventa) had neither chromatin loops (APA = 0.968) nor active chromatin marks (Fig. 3c). On average, GP1 genes showed a stronger H3K4me3 ChIP–seq signal and higher expression levels compared to genes in GP2 and GP3 (Extended Data Fig. 8d) and were associated with housekeeping functions, including intracellular trafficking, translation and messenger RNA processing (Extended Data Fig. 8f). By contrast, GP3 genes were enriched in cell type-specific functions related to peptidergic cells (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h), potentially explaining the lack of chromatin features in our bulk epigenomic experiments.

To understand what distinguishes placozoan GP1 genes, we analysed loop anchor sequences in both species using genomic sequences as background. We identified an enriched motif at chromatin loop anchor regions in both placozoan species (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 8i,j) and found that GP1 promoters frequently contained insertions of Mutator DNA transposable elements (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8e), with the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequence of this transposon containing the identified sequence motif. To further explore this association, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including all intact Mutator TIR sequences in four placozoan species (Extended Data Fig. 8k and Supplementary Data 1). This analysis revealed a Mutator family shared across species and with consensus TIR sequences resembling the motif found in chromatin loops anchors (Extended Data Fig. 8k). The connection between chromatin loops and the Mutator transposable element suggests a potential evolutionary and functional relationship. One possibility is that an architectural protein in placozoans evolved to recognize the sequence motif within the Mutator TIRs, leading to ‘domestication' of these sites as regulatory elements. Alternatively, the presence of the motif and Mutator TIR sequences may indicate targeted integration of Mutator transposons into promoter regions of highly expressed genes. Overall, our analyses showed that roughly one-third of T. adhaerens and C. collaboinventa genes are part of promoter hubs mediated by chromatin loops and that these contacts are associated with the presence of conserved Mutator DNA transposons harbouring a specific sequence motif.

The physical architecture of M. leidyi genome is dominated by thousands of chromatin loops (n = 4,261) (Fig. 4a), primarily connecting promoter and enhancer elements (61%), as well as enhancer to enhancer regions (16%) (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). In total, we identified 916 gene promoters participating in chromatin loops, with each promoter contacting between one (50%) and up to 15 enhancers (Fig. 4b). These enhancers are mainly located in intronic (69%) and intergenic (24%) regions at one to eight genes from the contacted promoters. We also observed the accumulation of cohesin at loop anchor sites using ChIP–seq against SMC1 cohesin subunit (Extended Data Fig. 9c). To assess whether these features are conserved across ctenophores, we profiled chromatin contacts, albeit at lower resolution, in the cydippid ctenophore Hormiphora californensis (Extended Data Fig. 9d), which diverged from the lobate ctenophore M. leidyi roughly 180 million years ago9. At the sampled resolution, we detected 239 strong chromatin loops in H. californensis. In both ctenophores, genes involved in chromatin loop formation showed higher expression (Extended Data Fig. 9e).

To investigate whether the chromatin loops in ctenophores are formed in a sequence-specific manner, we searched for the enriched motif in loop anchors of both species, using GC-normalized genomic random sequences as a background. We identified GC-rich motif (FC = 8,522; P = 1 × 10−497) that was present in over 75% of loop anchors (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9f) and at both promoter (79%) and enhancer sites (74%) involved in chromatin loops (Extended Data Fig. 9g). In addition, this motif was found in an extra 3,348 gene promoters (21% of all genes) with no chromatin loops detected (Extended Data Fig. 9g,h).

As the identified GC-rich motif contains two CpG dinucleotides, we examined DNA methylation using long-read Nanopore sequencing data. The overall methylation level in M. leidyi was low (6.8%), in agreement with previous reports using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing48. However, at loop anchor sites motifs showed low cytosine methylation, whereas motif occurrences outside loop anchor points showed high methylation (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9i). Thus, we propose that DNA methylation of this GC-rich motif serves as a regulatory mechanism of loop formation in M. leidyi, potentially controlling the binding of an unknown, methylation-sensitive architectural DNA-binding factor, similar to mechanisms described for CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and other transcription factors49.

The presence of DNA-binding proteins was further supported by the ATAC-seq footprint profile at motif regions in loop anchors (Extended Data Fig. 9j). To identify these potential architectural proteins, we profiled the chromatin-bound proteome of M. leidyi (Fig. 4e). We then selected the most abundant zf-C2H2 domain-containing proteins and analysed their DNA-binding specificity using DAP-seq, as zf-C2H2 factors are often associated with chromatin looping in other species2,5,35,50. This analysis identified two proteins, named here CTEP1 (Ctenophore-specific Tethering Protein 1) and CTEP2, which overlapped with 80% of detected loop anchor regions and showed strong affinity for the same GC-rich motif we had previously identified (Extended Data Fig. 9k–m). Moreover, DAP-seq confirmed that the binding of both proteins was inhibited at sites with high DNA methylation (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 9k,m). Thus, we conclude that CTEP1 and CTEP2 bind unmethylated GC-rich motif sites at chromatin loops. Notably, these proteins are conserved across ctenophore species (Extended Data Fig. 9n and Supplementary Table 3), but are absent from genomes of other metazoans.

Finally, we analysed evolutionary conservation of the sequences at the loop anchor points. To this end, we calculated genome-wide conservation scores from alignments of M. leidyi genome with three other ctenophore species (Bolinopsis microptera9, Pleurobrachia bachei20 and H. californensis51). Chromatin loop anchors, both at intronic and intergenic regions, showed higher sequence conservation compared to other introns or random genomic regions, respectively (Fig. 4g). The promoters of genes involved in distal contacts showed lower conservation score compared to other promoters (Fig. 4g), with conservation levels similar to those of random intergenic regions. Moreover, these promoters had a high frequency of transposable element integrations and elevated DNA methylation (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9o). Furthermore, we found that genes located within enhancer–promoter loop regions in M. leidyi have higher syntenic conservation across ctenophore species compared to other genomic regions of similar size (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9p). Overall, the conservation of loop anchor regions across ctenophore species and the increased syntenic linkage of genes suggest that gene positioning is constrained by genome architecture. These findings indicate that the distal chromatin contacts identified in M. leidyi represent an evolutionary conserved mechanism of genome regulation present in both lobate and cydippid ctenophores.

Genome architecture is the result of both physicochemical and regulatory processes3,4,31. In unicellular organisms, chromatin contact patterns are shaped by the polymer nature of the chromatin fibre32 and by gene transcriptional states52. For example, gene body contact domains are observed in highly transcribed genes in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe52, and in Arabidopsis thaliana53. Also, insulation boundaries resulting from highly transcribed genes in divergent orientations are described in dinoflagellate genomes33. In unicellular holozoans, we observed similar insulation patterns around TSSs, but without evidence of further regulatory features or sequence-specific determinants associated with insulation boundaries. We also found cosegregating inactive chromatin regions in the large genome of S. arctica, and to a lesser extent in S. rosetta39. By contrast, these structures are absent in unicellular organisms such as C. owczarzaki or S. cerevisiae, which both have gene-dense genomes without heterochromatic regions.

In bilaterian species, extra chromatin structures involved in gene regulation have been observed, often mediated by architectural proteins binding to specific sequences2,5,35,50. These include discrete chromatin loops between cis-regulatory elements and promoters, mediated by tethering elements27, as well as insulated gene regulatory landscapes, such as loop TADs bounded by convergent CTCF sites in vertebrates3. Notably, TAD-like domain structures can also result from the passive cosegregation of active versus inactive chromatin states37,54, rather than being determined by sequence-specific insulation elements. Examples of these are Polycomb bodies55 and other heterochromatic compartment domains28,29. In early-branching animals we did not identify loop-bound TADs or any evidence of sequence-defined insulated TADs. However, we did detect chromatin loops spanning tens of kilobases and linking distal cis-regulatory elements and promoters in cnidarians, ctenophores and placozoans. In the case of ctenophores, thousands of chromatin loops link enhancers and promoters, showing that distal loops can be extremely frequent even in small genomes (roughly 200 Mb). Another example is the thousands of chromatin loops in placozoans, with even smaller genomes (roughly 100 Mb). Both placozoans and ctenophores complex looping architectures are associated with transposable elements. Although the causal relationship between transposable elements and chromatin loops is unclear, this observation suggests that complex 3D genome architectures might be influenced by lineage-specific transposable element invasion histories56.

The mechanisms and factors responsible for loop formation in non-bilaterians and most invertebrates remain unknown7. The zf-C2H2 protein CTCF is the main architectural protein in vertebrates and is conserved across bilaterians. In annelids it has been associated to open chromatin regions57 and in cephalopods it defines TAD boundaries58. Given that CTCF is absent in non-bilaterians36, other factors, possibly from the zf-C2H2 family (Extended Data Fig. 9q), might be involved in the formation of these loops. In fact, a variety of architectural proteins other than CTCF have been described in Drosophila, many of which are zf-C2H2 proteins with restricted phylogenetic distributions such as the insect-specific CP190 factor2,50,59. Similarly, we identified two ctenophore-specific zf-C2H2 proteins (CTEP1 and CTEP2) associated with loop anchor regions in M. leidyi. It is possible that other, yet unidentified, lineage-specific zf-C2H2 proteins contribute to chromatin architecture in different animal lineages.

Globally, our findings suggest an evolutionary scenario (Fig. 5) in which chromatin compartment domains defined by transcriptional states28 (but lacking sequence-specific insulation or tethering elements) were present in the unicellular ancestor of animals, as seen in extant unicellular holozoans. At the origin of animals, distal cis-regulatory elements evolved, requiring sequence-determined, stable chromatin looping mechanisms to link these enhancers with gene promoters (at least at certain distances41). This added an extra layer of regulatory complexity to cell type-specific gene regulation. The origin of this distal gene regulation would also explain the existence of regulatory-linked genomic regions showing conserved synteny60, as observed in ctenophore regions between loop anchor points. Moreover, domains insulated by sequence elements probably originated at the root of bilaterian animals, as they are observed in vertebrates, insects and probably spiralians57,58. In the specific case of vertebrates these domains are formed by a mechanism of CTCF-dependent loop extrusion so far not observed in any other lineage7, which further exemplifies the potential diversity of mechanisms involved in chromatin architecture across metazoans. Future extended taxon sampling will further refine this evolutionary scenario and help solve open questions such as whether there are conserved or lineage-specific factors involved in the establishment of chromatin loops across animals, how dynamic these structures are in development and across cell types or when did sequence-determined, insulated TADs first emerged in animal evolution.

S. arctica coenocytic culture was grown in marine broth (Difco, 3704 g l−1) at 12 °C in 25 cm2 flasks. Cells were passaged every 7 days using a 1:100 dilution. To synchronize cells in the G1/early S phase, an 8-day old culture was treated with 200 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. H8627) for 18 h in the presence of 0.3% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Synchronized cells were pelleted at 2,000g for 5 min at 12 °C, washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free artificial sea water (CMFSW) (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 450 mM NaCl, 9 mM KCl, 33 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM NaHCO3) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were then reconstituted in CMFSW and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. 28906) for 10 min under vacuum. The crosslinking reaction was quenched with 128 mM glycine for 5 min in the vacuum desiccator, followed by a 15 min incubation on ice. Cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 10 min at 2,000g, washed once with CMFSW, reconstituted in CMFSW to the concentration of 2 M ml−1 and crosslinked with 3 mM DSG (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. A35392) for 40 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel. The reaction was quenched with 400 mM glycine for 5 min. Double-crosslinked cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 2,000g and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

C. owczarzaki strain ATCC30864 was maintained in axenic culture at 23 °C in the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) medium 1034 (modified PYNFH medium) in 25 cm2 flasks. For subculture, filopodial cells were passaged every 2–3 days using a dilution of 1:100. Before collection, filopodial cells were synchronized in G1 or early S phase by treating a filopodial culture of 70–80% confluency with 100 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. H8627) for 18 h (ref. 61). Synchronized cells were scraped off the surface and pelleted at 2,200g for 5 min at room temperature. Collected cells were crosslinked as described in ref. 62. Briefly, cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. 28906) in PBS for 10 min on a rotating wheel at room temperature. The crosslinking reaction was quenched with 128 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature followed by extra incubation on ice for 15 min. The crosslinked cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 10 min at 2,000g and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were diluted in PBS to the concentration of 2 M ml−1 and also crosslinked with 3 mM DSG (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. A35392) for 40 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel. The crosslinking was quenched with 400 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 2,000g and flash-frozen in aliquots of 2 million cells.

S. rosetta was cocultured with Echinicola pacifica bacteria in artificial sea water supplemented with 20% cereal grass media (CGM3) at 23 °C. To synchronize the cell culture in the G1 or early S phase, cells from a 3-day-old culture were pelleted at 2,000g for 10 min and diluted in 4% CGM3 in artificial sea water to the concentration of 300,000 cells per ml. Cells were treated with 0.05 mM aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. 178273) in the presence of 0.3% DMSO. After 18 h of incubation, cells, including chain colonies, fast and slow swimmers, were pelleted at 2,000g for 15 min. To remove bacteria from the choanoflagellate culture, collected cells reconstituted in 1 ml of culture media were passed through a Ficoll layer (1.6% Ficoll (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. F5415), 0.5 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 15 mM MgCl2, 1% artificial sea water) by centrifugation at 1,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted choanoflagellate cells were then double-crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in CMFSW and 3 mM DSG in CMFSW as described above for C. owczarzaki. The crosslinked cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 2,000g and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

E. muelleri sponges gemmules were hatched and grown for 1 week in Strekal's media63 in 150 × 25 mm culture dishes (Corning, catalogue no. 353025). To isolate phagocytic choanocyte cell population, specimens were fed for 10 min with 0.5 µm fluorescent carboxylate-modified FluoSpheres (Invitrogen, catalogue no. F8813) added to Strekal's media to final 0.02% concentration (1:100 dilution of stock 2% FluoSpheres slurry)64. Sponges were washed once with Strekal's media, and 1% formaldehyde solution in Strekal's media was added to crosslink specimens for 10 min at room temperature with occasional mixing. To quench formaldehyde, 128 mM glycine was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and 15 min on ice. Crosslinked sponge specimens were washed twice with ice-cold Strekal's media. Roughly 80 specimens were transferred in 5 ml of the Strekal's media and dissociated by trituration until all tissue was removed from the gemmule husks (roughly ten trituration passages). The dissociated cell suspension was filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer, and cells were diluted to 2 M ml−1 concentration. The second crosslinking was performed with 3 mM DSG (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. 20593) in Strekal's media for 40 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel. The reaction was quenched with 400 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Crosslinked cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 2,000g, and then resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold Strekal's media with 2 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. 62249). Choanocytes were isolated using a BD FACS Aria II sorter with BD FACSDiva v.6.1.3 (BD Biosciences) as cells showing both FluoSphere fluorescence and Hoechst nuclei staining. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) profiles were analysed with FlowJo v.10.7 (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

M. leidyi specimens were kept in 300-ml glass beakers with 5–10 individuals at 21 °C in artificial sea water (Red Sea, catalogue no. R11055) with a salinity of 27 ppt. Ctenophores were fed daily with a mixture of living rotifers (Brachionus sp.) and brine shrimps (Artemia salina). The water was exchanged once a week. For all experiments, adult lobate animals were starved for 2 days before collection. To dissociate animal tissue, roughly five adult animals (10 mm long) were transferred into CMFSW and washed twice to exchange the buffer. Animal tissue was dissociated into single cells in 5 ml of fresh CMFSW by triturating every 2 min for a total of 10 min. The efficiency of tissue dissociation was monitored under the microscope. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer and diluted to 2 M ml−1 for the subsequent formaldehyde crosslinking. Cells were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde in CMFSW for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 128 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature and 15 min on ice. Crosslinked cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 10 min at 2,000g, washed once with CMFSW and resuspended to 2 M ml−1 for a second crosslinking with 3 mM DSG in CMFSW. The crosslinking reaction was stopped after 40 min of incubation at room temperature on a rotating wheel with 400 mM glycine for 5 min. The crosslinked cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 2,000g.

H. californensis specimens from the first generation (F1) of a laboratory-reared culture at the Monterey Bay Aquarium (USA) were flash-frozen and pulverized in liquid nitrogen. Extracted cells and nuclei were filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 2,000g. Cells were double-crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in CMFSW and 3 mM DSG in CMFSW as described for M. leidyi.

T. adhaerens and C. collaboinventa colonies were grown in 200 × 30 mm glass Petri dishes at 21 °C in artificial sea water (Red Sea, catalogue no. R11055) with a salinity of 33 ppt. Placozoans were fed once a week with unicellular algae (Pyrenomonas sp.), the water was exchanged every second week. To prepare single-cell suspension, roughly 500 animals were collected, washed twice with CMFSW and resuspended in 1 ml of CMFSW supplemented with 2 mM EDTA. Animal tissue was triturated every 2 min for a total of 10 min at room temperature. The efficiency of dissociation was monitored under the microscope. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer, diluted to 2 M ml−1 and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in CMFSW for 10 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel. The reaction was quenched with 128 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature and 15 min on ice. Cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 10 min at 2,000g, washed once with CMFSW and resuspended in 3 mM DSG in CMFSW for a second crosslinking. After 40 min of incubation at room temperature on a rotating wheel, 400 mM glycine was added to stop the reaction and cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 2,000g.

N. vectensis NvElav1::mOrange transgenic line65 was maintained in one-third artificial sea water (Red Sea, catalogue no. R11055) with salinity of 14 ppt. To isolate NvElav1::mOrange positive cells, 1.5–2-month-old animals starved for 1 day before the experiment were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in Ca2+/Mg2+-free one-third sea water (one-third CMF: 17 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 167 mM NaCl, 9 mM NaHCO3, 3.3 mM KCl) for 10 min under vacuum. The crosslinking reaction was stopped by adding 128 mM glycine and incubating the tissue under vacuum for 5 min, followed by a 15 min incubation on ice. The crosslinked tissue was dissociated into single cells by incubating the tissue with 10 mg ml−1 of Protease XIV (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. P5147) in one-third CMF and 1 mM CaCl2 for 5 min at 24 °C triturating the tissue every 1 min. The digested tissue was pelleted at 800g for 5 min, reconstituted in one-third CMF supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and 2 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. 62249), and the trituration continued for another 5–10 min. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer, and neurons were isolated using a BD FACS Aria II as cells showing both the mOrange signal and Hoechst nuclei staining (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Isolated NvElav1::mOrange positive cells were also crosslinked with 3 mM DSG for 40 min at room temperature.

Micro-C libraries were prepared as previously described11,12 with the following modification. Double-crosslinked cells (2 million cells per sample) with 1% formaldehyde and 3 mM DSG were permeabilized with 500 µl of MB1 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.2% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail) for 20 min on ice with occasional trituration. Cells were pelleted at 4,500g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with MB1 buffer. To digest chromatin to a 80% monomers to 20% dimer and oligomers nucleosome ratio, an appropriate amount of MNase (Takara Bio, catalogue no. 2910a) was added (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with mixing at 850 rpm. The digestion reaction was stopped with 4 mM EGTA (pH 8.0) followed by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min without agitation. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold MB2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA) and pelleted at 4,500g for 5 min at 4 °C. Next, to repair the fragment ends after MNase digestion, pelleted cells were resuspended in the repair reaction mix (5 µl of 10× NEBuffer 2.1, 34 µl of nuclease-free water, 1 µl of 100 mM ATP, 2.5 µl of 100 mM DTT) supplemented with 2.5 µl of 10 U µl−1 T4 PNK (NEB, catalogue no. M0201). After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C with 850 rpm agitation, 5 µl of 5 U µl−1 Klenow Fragment (NEB, catalogue no. M0210) was added to generate 3′–5′ overhangs in the absence of dNTPs for a subsequent incorporation of biotin-labelled dNTPs. The reaction mixture was incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C at 850 rpm. To biotinylate DNA fragment ends, the mixture of dNTPs was added to the reaction mix (2.5 µl of 10× T4 DNA Ligase buffer, 11.875 µl of nuclease-free water, 5 µl of 1 mM Biotin-dATP (Jena Bioscience, catalogue no. NU-835-BIO14), 5 µl of 1 mM Biotin-dCTP (Jena Bioscience, catalogue no. NU-809-BIOX), 0.5 µl of a mixture of 10 mM dTTP and dGTP, 0.125 µl of 20 mg ml−1 BSA). After 45 min of incubation at room temperature with interval mixing at 850 rpm, the reaction was stopped with 30 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) followed by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min without agitation. The chromatin from lysed cells and nuclei was pelleted at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with MB3 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2). Finally, the chromatin was resuspended in 1,200 µl of proximity ligation mix (920 µl of nuclease-free water, 120 µl of 10× T4 DNA Ligase buffer, 100 µl of 10% Triton X-100, 12 µl of 20 mg ml−1 BSA, 36 µl of 50% PEG 4000, 12 µl of 5 U µl−1 T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, catalogue no. EL0012)) and incubated at room temperature for at least 2.5 h. To remove biotin from unligated ends, pelleted chromatin was treated with 2 µl of 100 U µl−1 Exonuclease III (NEB, catalogue no. M0206) for 5 min at 37 °C and agitation 850 rpm. Then, chromatin was decrosslinked and deproteinased overnight at 65 °C at 850 rpm in the presence of 350 mM NaCl, 1% SDS and 1 mg ml−1 proteinase K (Roche, catalogue no. 3115879001). The DNA was purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, catalogue no. D4014) and eluted in 50 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Next, biotinylated proximity ligated DNA fragments were captured with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin (Life Technologies, catalogue no. 65602). DNA ends were prepared for adapter ligation and dA-tailed using NEBNext End repair/dA-tailing mix (NEB, catalogue no. E7546). The Y-shaped Illumina adapters were ligated with NEBNext Ultra II Ligation Module (NEB, catalogue no. E7595S), and the final library was amplified using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix (NEB, catalogue no. M0541). The final libraries were double-size selected with Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter, catalogue no. A63881) resulting in libraries ranging from 350 to 750 bp in length. The detailed Micro-C stepwise protocol is reported in Supplementary Text 1.

Genomic DNA (gDNA) from C. owczarzaki (Cowc) strain ATCC30864 was extracted with Blood & Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 13323). The library was constructed by the use of Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore, catalogue no. SQK-LSK109) and NEBNext Companion Module (NEB, catalogue no. E7180), and sequenced with the R9.4.1 Flow Cell set on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore). We obtained 4.3 M reads with an estimated Oxford Nanopore N50 of 5.4 kb.

E. muelleri gDNA was isolated using the Nanobind Tissue (Circulomics, catalogue no. NB-900-701-01) from 177 mg of frozen tissue of clonal juvenile sponges hatched from overwintering cysts (gemmules). Gemmules were obtained from the head tank of the Kapoor Tunnel (Sooke Reservoir), part of the drinking water system of the city of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada21. Short DNA fragments of less than 10 kb were removed with Short Read Eliminator Kit (Circulomics, catalogue no. SS-100-101-01). gDNA was quantified with a Qubit fluorometer and sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore using a PromethION flow cell (R9.4), producing 5.31 million reads with an estimated Oxford Nanopore N50 of 18.97 kb.

To reduce the level of heterozygosity during the assembly of M. leidyi genome (below), an animal culture was established from a single individual through self-fertilization. High molecular weight DNA was isolated from 5–8 animals (3–5 cm) starved for 24 h before flash-freezing. Frozen tissues were powdered with mortar and pestle, dissolved in 10 ml of urea extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 7 M Urea, 312.5 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% w/v N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) as described in ref. 66 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature on a rocking platform 20 rpm. gDNA was then purified twice with a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mixture pH 7.7–8.3 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. 77617), precipitated with 0.7 volume of 100% isopropanol and subsequently washed twice with 70% ethanol. Finally, the isolated DNA was subjected to another round of purification with Nanobind Tissue kit (Circulomics, catalogue no. NB-900-701-01), followed by short-read elimination with the Short Read Eliminator Kit (Circulomics, catalogue no. SS-100-101-01). Sequencing was performed on Oxford Nanopore using PromethION flow cell (R9.4). We obtained 4.54 million reads with an estimated Oxford Nanopore N50 of 36.84 kb.

ATAC-seq libraries from M. leidyi and from sorted choanocytes of E. muelleri were prepared using Omni-ATAC protocol as described previously67. Briefly, two M. leidyi adult specimens were dissociated using CMFSW with 0.25% α-Chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. C8946). To isolate nuclei, dissociated cells were transferred into cold hypotonic ATAC lysis buffer adjusted for marine animals (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 35 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% NP-40, 0.01% digitonin, 70 µM Pitstop (Abcam, AB1206875MG)). Cell lysis was stopped after 2 min by adding marine ATAC wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 35 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA). Nuclei were then pelleted and resuspended in cold PBS buffer with 0.8 M Sorbitol. We used 50,000 nuclei per each tagmentation reaction.

To sort choanocytes of E. muelleri, 7 days posthatching sponges were fed with 0.5 µm fluorescent carboxylate-modified FluoSpheres (Invitrogen, catalogue no. F8813). After 10 min of incubation, sponges were washed twice with Strekal's media, collected and dissociated for 15 min at 28 °C using Protease XIV (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. P5147) in Strekal's media and 1 mM CaCl2. Cells were pelleted at 800g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended in Strekal's media with 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Further dissociation and trituration of sponge tissue continued for another 15 min at room temperature. Cells were filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer, stained with 2 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 and sorted using FACS. Sorted cells were lysed for 3 min in ATAC lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween-40, 0.01% digitonin). For each tagmentation reaction we used 100,000 nuclei. ATAC-seq libraries were prepared as described previously67 and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 using High-Output 75 cycles.

For S. arctica, C. owczarzaki, S. rosetta, M. leidyi, E. muellleri, T. adhaerens, C. collaboinventa and N. vectensis, double-crosslinked cells, as above, were washed with PBS, resuspended in 500 µl of cell lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors cocktail) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in bead beating buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors cocktail), and then transferred to 0.2 ml tubes containing acid-washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, G8772). Cells were lysed by vortexing five times for 30 s. The supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml sonication tube, SDS was added to 0.6% and samples were sonicated 3–5 cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off in a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) to generate 200–300 bp fragments. Chromatin was diluted with 5 volumes of dilution buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 140 mM NaCl), centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C before use.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described68 with the following modifications. Briefly, for each species 100 ng of chromatin was used for immunoprecipitation. The pool of chromatin was incubated for 14–16 h at 4 °C with 5 µl (1:50 dilution) of anti-H3K4me1 (Cell Signaling, catalogue no. 5326), 6 µl (3.4 µg) of anti-H3K4me2 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab32356), 2.5 µl (1:100 dilution) of anti-H3K4me3 (Millipore, catalogue no. 07-473), 5 µl (5 µg) of anti-SMC1 (Thermo Fisher, A300-055A) or 2 µl (2 µg) of anti-H3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab1791) and recovered using a 1:1 mix of Protein A (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. 16-661) and Protein G (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. 16-662) magnetic beads. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed, reverse crosslinked for 3 h at 68 °C, deproteinased and then purified using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, catalogue no. A63881). Final libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ChIP–seq libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer using High-Output 75 cycles.

Single-cell libraries were prepared from freshly dissociated and sorted choanocytes of E. muelleri as previously described8. To collect cells for MARS-seq libraries, 7 days posthatching, sponges were fed with 0.5 µm fluorescent carboxylate-modified FluoSpheres (Invitrogen, catalogue no. F8813). Animal tissues were dissociated and prepared for sorting as described above for ATAC-seq. Dissociated cells were sorted through FACS into four 384-well MARS-seq plates. In total, 1,536 single-cell libraries were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using High-Output 75 cycles.

Chromatin proteomics samples were prepared as previously descibed69 with minor modifications. Briefly, double-crosslinked cells of M. leidyi (1 million per replicate) were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 2% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) and incubated for 10 min. Next, before adding DNA-binding beads (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 37002D), cell lysate was mixed with 1 ml of 2-propanol. The beads were separated on a magnet and the supernatant was saved as the unbound control. The beads were washed using 1 ml of wash buffer (1:1 lysis buffer to 2-propanol ratio), transferred to a 1.5-ml sonication tube and washed again with 1 ml of 80% ethanol. The chromatin was then eluted in 200 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche, catalogue no. 04693132001) and sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico at 4 °C for 3 cycles (30 s ON, 30 s OFF). To remove RNA-binding proteins, RNase A (Roche, catalogue no. 10109142001) was added to the sonicated samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C with agitation in a thermomixer. Afterwards, chromatin was re-bound to the beads by adding 250 µl of lysis buffer, vortexing and then sequentially adding 300 µl of 2-propanol. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 80% ethanol, and proteins were digested on the beads using trypsin (Promega, catalogue no. V5111) and LysC (NEB, catalogue no. P8109S).

Samples were analysed using an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Proxeon)). Peptides were loaded directly onto the analytical column and were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a 50-cm column with an inner diameter of 75 μm, packed with 2-μm C18 particles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. ES903).

Chromatographic gradients started at 95% buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 5% buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) with a flow rate of 300 nl min−1 and gradually increased to 25% buffer B and 75% A in 52 min and then to 40% buffer B and 60% A in 8 min. After each analysis, the column was washed for 10 min with 100% buffer B.

The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode with nanospray voltage set at 2.4 kV and source temperature at 305 °C. The acquisition was performed in data-dependent acquisition mode and full mass spectrometry scans with one micro-scan at resolution of 120,000 were used over a mass range of m/z 350–1,400 with detection in the Orbitrap mass analyser. Automatic gain control was set to ‘standard' and injection time to ‘auto'. In each cycle of data-dependent acquisition analysis, following each survey scan, the most intense ions above a threshold ion count of 10,000 were selected for fragmentation. The number of selected precursor ions for fragmentation was determined by the ‘Top Speed' acquisition algorithm and a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. Fragment ion spectra were produced by means of high-energy collision dissociation at normalized collision energy of 28% and they were acquired in the ion trap mass analyser. Automatic gain control and injection time were set to ‘Standard' and ‘Dynamic', respectively, and an isolation window of 1.4 m/z was used. Digested bovine serum albumin (NEB, catalogue no. P8108S) was analysed between each sample to avoid sample carryover and to assure stability of the instrument, and Qcloud70 was used to control instrument longitudinal performance during the project.

Acquired spectra were analysed using the Proteome Discoverer software suite (v.2.5, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Mascot search engine (v.2.6, Matrix Science71). The data were searches against M. leidyi database and a list of common contaminants (16,042 entries)72 as well as all the corresponding decoy entries. For the peptide identification a precursor ion mass tolerance of 7 ppm was used for the MS1 level, trypsin was chosen as enzyme and up to three missed cleavages were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da for MS2 spectra. Oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation were used as variable modifications whereas carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as a fixed modification. False discovery rate in peptide identification was set to a maximum of 1%.

Peptide quantification data were retrieved from the ‘Precursor ions quantifier' node from Proteome Discoverer (v.2.5) using 2-ppm mass tolerance for the peptide extracted ion current. The obtained values were used to calculate protein fold-changes and their corresponding P value and adjusted P values.

The DNA-binding domains of candidate zf-C2H2 proteins were cloned from complementary DNA (cDNA) library of M. leidyi into the pIX-HALO vector using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB, catalogue no. E2621). The obtained HALO-fusion constructs were translated using the TnT SP6High-Yield Wheat Germ Protein Expression System (Promega, catalogue no. L3260). Next, an adapter-ligated DNA library was prepared from native gDNA of M. leidyi using NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA library prep kit (NEB, catalogue no. E7805) or PCR amplified gDNA. The binding to HALO-zf-C2H2 fusion proteins and recovery of adapter-ligated gDNA libraries was performed as described in ref. 73. The generated DAP-seq libraries were sequenced in paired-end mode on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using High-Output 75 cycles.

We made preliminary genome assemblies of C. owczarzaki from Oxford Nanopore reads basecalled by Guppy v.6.0.1 using NextDenovo v.2.5.0 (ref. 74), Flye v.2.9.0 (ref. 75) and NECAT v.0.0.1 (ref. 76), which produced 20, 141 and 56 contigs including the mitochondrial genome, respectively. For the Flye assembly, we only used 5,000 bp or longer reads. We then integrated the three assemblies by manually comparing them to each other, with a help of reciprocal large-scale alignments generated with minimap2 (ref. 77). The integrated assembly was polished with the Nanopore reads using Flye ten times, and with Illumina reads78 using HyPo79 twice. A chromosome-scale duplication, which was in the end included in chromosome 15 after the 3D assembly (Extended Data Fig. 2d), was temporarily removed before annotating the genome. Finally, we manually inspected the whole assembly sequence together with the mapped Illumina data, Nanopore data and the previous Sanger sequence data25, and navigated them on the Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV)80 to find and fix errors occurred during the consensus calling. We also manually phased chimeric haplotypes for some genes using the long reads. In total, 7,937 nucleotides were manually inserted or deleted at 430 sites and 1,193 nucleotides were substituted at 1,081 sites.

We produced two new genome assemblies for E. muelleri and M. leidyi. In both cases, we used Oxford Nanopore reads after base call correction using Guppy v.5.0.17 (using the dna_r9.4.1_450bps_sup_prom.cfg configuration the super-accurate base calling model, and a filtering reads with min_qscore=10). Then, we used two different long-read assemblers (Flye v.2.9-b1768, ref. 75 and Shasta v.0.8.0, ref. 81) and various assembly strategies (filtering by read length at 0, 10 and 50 kb), and selected the best resulting draft assemblies for each species. To that end, we evaluated the contiguity (measured using the contig N50), completeness and occurrence of uncollapsed haplotypes for each draft (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Contiguity was evaluated using total assembly length and contig N50. Completeness was measured with the fraction of conserved orthologues recovered by BUSCO v.5.1.2 (ref. 82) (using the genome mode and the metazoa_odb10) and the fraction of mappable genes from the original assemblies (mapped using Liftoff v.1.6.1, ref. 83). The presence of uncollapsed haplotypes was assessed with the distribution of per-base sequencing depths, calculated using the pbcstat utility in purge_dups v.1.2.5 (ref. 84) (for which we remapped the input reads to the assembly with minimap2 2.18-r1015 (ref. 77), using the -x map-ont preset for long-read mapping) (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f).

The best drafts for each species were produced using the following parameter combinations: (1) for E. muelleri, we used the Shasta assembler with the Nanopore configuration (--config Nanopore-Oct2021 flag), without filtering by read length (estimated sequencing depth roughly 100×) and (2) for M. leidyi, we used Flye with reads filtered at 50 kb (estimated sequencing depth roughly 150×), the raw Nanopore read configuration (--nano-raw flag) and an estimated total assembly size of 200 Mb.

Then, we used purge_dups to collapse putative uncollapsed haplotypes in each assembly, in the following manner: (1) we split the assembly into contigs with the split_fa utility; (2) we aligned the genome to itself with minimap2 and the -x asm5 preset; (3) we used the read alignments to the unsplit assembly (produced with minimap2 -x map-ont) to obtain the sequencing depth histogram and calculate coverage cutoffs with pbcstat and calcuts, respectively; (4) we used these cutoffs and the mapped reads to remove haplotigs and overlaps for the draft, with purge_dups proper and using two rounds of alignment chaining (-2 flag) and finally (5) we reevaluated the assembly quality using per-base sequencing depth distributions (above) and reductions in the fraction of duplicated BUSCO orthologues.

To obtain chromosome-level genome assemblies, generated Micro-C libraries were mapped to de novo draft genome assemblies (C. owczarzaki, E. muelleri and M. leidyi) or current genome assemblies (T. adhaerens ASM15027v1, ref. 22, S. arctica24, S. rosetta GCA_000188695.1, ref. 26, C. collaboinventa85) using Juicer v.1.6 (ref. 86) with an option -p assembly. Proximity ligation alignments were used by 3D de novo assembly pipeline87 to order and orient available contigs into chromosomes with the following parameters: S. arctica -r 3 --editor-repeat-coverage 10, C. owczarzaki -r 0 --editor-repeat-coverage 4, S. rosetta -r 3 --editor-repeat-coverage 2, E. muelleri -r 2 --editor-repeat-coverage 10, M. leidyi -r 2 -i 1000 --editor-repeat-coverage 2, T. adhaerens -r 3 --editor-repeat-coverage 2 and C. collaboinventa -r 3 --editor-repeat-coverage 2. The resulting assemblies were manually reviewed and corrected with Juicebox Assembly Tools88 (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f). Finally, chromosome-level genome assemblies were polished with Medaka (v.1.5.0) to correct possible sequence errors such as indels and mismatches, as follows: (1) first, we mapped the Nanopore reads to the chromosome-level assembly using the minimap2-based mini_align utility; (2) we then used Medaka consensus to obtain consensus sequences, specifying a batch size of 200 (--batch 200 flag) and the r941_prom_sup_g507 configuration (--model flag) and (3) we merged the consensus and variant calls for all chromosomes into a polished assembly using Medaka stitch.

To annotate the C. owczarzaki genome, we did not mask the repeats because the intergenic regions are very small25 and, thus, masking only increased annotation failure on duplicated genes. We used BRAKER2 (ref. 89) with OrthoDB90 protein sequence collections as hint data, as well as with RNA-seq data from a previous study61. The three preliminary annotations, evidenced by metazoan proteins, protozoan proteins and RNA-seq data, were combined with TSEBRA91, giving rise to 9,069 annotated transcripts. Finally, we manually searched and fixed wrong annotations by navigating the assembly on IGV80, comparing the combined annotation with the three preliminary annotations together with the mapped RNA-seq data. By this careful inspection, we modified or newly annotated 1,871 transcripts including alternatively spliced ones. Compared to the previously published proteome25 (v.2), only 4,076 out of 8,792 proteins (including alternatively spliced ones) had completely matched sequences to the those predicted in this study, allowing simple amino acid mismatches probably accounting for polymorphisms.

To annotate M. leidyi genome we first downloaded developmental Illumina RNA-seq samples (GSE93977), trimmed them with fastp and built a de novo Trinity assembly, which was mapped to the genome using gmap92. The RNA-seq was also directly mapped to genome using HISAT2 (ref. 93) with the –dta parameter, and genome-based transcriptomes were built for each sample using StringTie94. Merged mapped RNA-seq samples were then used to find high-quality intron junctions using Portcullis. The combination of Trinity, StringTie and Portcullis intron junctions were then fed to Mikado for transcript selection. The best resulting gene models based on mapping to UniProt were then used to train an Augustus model for M. leidyi. Augustus was used for an ab initio gene prediction, using exonic hints from Mikado, intron hints from Portcullis and coding sequence hints from a MetaEuk95 run with query fasta files combining proteins from H. californensis and UniProt. Mikado transcripts and Augustus gene models were then merged using EVidenceModeler (scores of 10 for Mikado transcripts and 2 for Augustus gene models). The resulting gene models were updated with PASA96 to incorporate the untranslated regions from the Mikado transcripts.

To annotate S. arctica, S. rosetta, E. muelleri, T. adhaerens and C. collaboinventa genome assemblies, gene models from previous assemblies were mapped onto new coordinates using Liftoff (v.1.6.1)83 with -overlap 1 -flank 1 options.

Repetitive sequences and transposable elements were annotated using EDTA (v.2.1.0)97 with the following parameters: --sensitive 1 --anno 1 (Extended Data Fig. 2g). For H. sapiens, we used RepeatMasker (v.open-4-0-3) annotation of GRCh38 genome released by UCSC.

The fast5 files obtained from the PromethION were used as input for Megalodon (v.2.5), with the Remora model dna_r9.4.1_e8 sup for 5hmc_5mc modification only on CG dinucleotides. We then built bigwig files using the bedGraphToBigWig tool from UCSC. The Megalodon CG methylation calls were compared to previously published Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing remapped to the new reference genomes using Bismark (SRR8346013 and SRR10356110)21,48. Both data sources were congruent, yet Nanopore had deeper and broader coverage, we used Megalodon methylation data for subsequent analysis.

Micro-C data were processed using the 4D Nucleome processing pipeline98. Briefly, raw reads were mapped to the reference genome using bwa mem (v.0.7.17-r1188) with the -SP5M option. The mapped reads were sorted and filtered with pairtools (v.0.3.0)99. Pairs that mapped within a 2-bp distance from each other were considered duplicates. We also discarded reads mapping within the distance of 200 bp, which eliminates self-ligated pairs and reads mapping to adjacent nucleosomes. Only uniquely mapping pairs and 5′ most unique alignments of multiple ligations pairs were aggregated into 200-bp bin contact matrices and multiresolution .cool or .hic files (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Contact matrices were normalized with cooler (v.0.8.11)100 using the iterative correction and eigenvector (ICE) balancing method101 for .cool files or with Juicer tools86 using Knight–Ruiz balancing102 for .hic files. All contact heatmaps were visualized with either Cooltools (v.0.5.1)103 or Coolbox (v.0.3.8)104 and genome assembly heatmaps were visualized using HiGlass105.

Reproducibility between replicates was estimated using the stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC) implemented in HiCRep106 at resolutions of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 kb (Extended Data Fig. 1f). The SCC scores were averaged across chromosomes. Biological replicates with SCC score estimated above 0.7 at resolutions equivalent to roughly 20,000 bins per species genome (resolution of 10 kb for S. arctica, 1 kb for C. owczarzaki, 2 kb for S. rosetta, 10 kb for E. muelleri, 10 kb for M. leidyi, 5 kb for H. californensis, 5 kb for T. adhaerens, 5 kb for C. collaboinventa and 10 kb for N. vectensis) were pooled to obtain final chromatin interaction matrices. Technical replicates were first merged, deduplicated and only then combined into the final contact maps.

The decay of the average contact frequency over genomic distance from 1 kb to 100 Mb was calculated using Cooltools (v.0.5.1)103. The decay curves were calculated for each chromosome separately, and then averaged across chromosomes (Extended Data Fig. 1g).

Compartment analysis was performed on observed-over-expected contact maps at resolutions equivalent to 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 bins per species genome (Extended Data Fig. 3a) using Cooltools eigs-cis103. We visually examined calculated eigenvectors, and, for each organism, the E1 vector corresponded to the compartmentalization pattern of contact maps. Active (A) and inactive (B) compartment types were assigned by GC content (for all species except C. owczarzaki) or H3K4me3 chromatin signal for C. owczarzaki, such that higher GC regions or positively correlated with H3K4me3 signal regions correspond to A compartment. Saddle plots were generated using the Cooltools saddle module. Specifically, the eigenvectors were sorted from lowest to highest value and combined into 40 groups according to their eigenvector value. The first (bottom 2.5% E1 values) and last (top 2.5% E1 values) groups were ignored to exclude potential outliers. The observed-over-expected value of the remaining 38 groups was averaged across all bins and chromosomes and visualized as saddle plots.

Compartment strength was calculated as the ratio of homotypic (AA + BB) over heterotypic (AB + BA) compartment contacts. We choose the top 20% of observed-over-expected values for both homotypic and heterotypic interactions. To assess the error in estimating compartment strength, we compared the compartments strength across different resolutions as well as performed visual inspection of the contact maps (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The latter showed varying degrees of accuracy in identifying compartment types between species, with the algorithm performing particularly poorly on M. leidyi due to the lack of well-defined chromatin compartmentalization in this species in our sample. Therefore, we assigned an extra intermediate compartment I to the intermediate eigenvalues close to zero. To that end, we modelled the genome-wide eigenvalues distribution as a Gaussian mixture with three components using the normalmixEM function from the mixtools R package (v.2.0.0) as described107. The B–I and I–A thresholds were defined as intersection points between components (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

To characterize the distribution of genomic features in the A, I and B compartments, we calculated cumulative H3K4me3 chromatin signals and RNA-seq expression values for each compartment region. Furthermore, we estimated the percentage of bases annotated as transposable elements or coding gene regions within these compartments. All the values are presented as −log2(1 − the value's quantile). Thus, a normalized value of six means that the coverage is in the upper 1–2−6 quantile, that is, in the upper 1/64th of the distribution (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

To compute the insulation profiles, we first determined the optimal resolution and window sizes for a target genome. To that end, we calculated insulation scores using Cooltools insulation module103 at resolutions roughly equivalent to 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 and 400,000 genomic bins per species genome with a sliding window for each resolution that is ×5, ×10 and ×25 the applied resolution (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The resolution and two window sizes with maximum average insulation scores were considered optimal because they reflected the strongest partitioning of genomes into isolated domains. Insulation boundaries located within two bins of unmappable genomic region were removed.

Identified insulation boundaries were categorized into strong and weak using the peak prominence of their boundary strength distributions (Li threshold) as implemented in the Cooltools insulation score module. Strong boundaries were further annotated with overlapping genomic features that fall within one bin of the annotated feature from the insulation boundary. For example, if compartment boundaries were called at the resolution 5 kb, then the maximum distance to the closest insulation boundary is ±10 kb.

To estimate internal interactions within contact domains, rescaled pile-ups were generated using coolpup.py108. Contact domains were defined as valleys between two strongly insulated regions, which were not further from each other than 100 kb.

Chromatin loops were identified using SIP v.1.6.1 (ref. 109) on KR-normalized contact matrices. In M. leidyi, the SIP peak caller was applied with the following parameters: -norm KR -g 3.0 -min 2.0 -max 2.0 -mat 5000 -d 10 -res 400 -sat 0.01 -t 2000 -nbZero 6 -factor 4 -fdr 0.05 -isDroso false. For T. adhaerens, chromatin loops were called with the following parameters: -norm KR -g 5.0 -min 4.0 -max 4.0 -mat 5000 -d 20 -res 100 -sat 0.01 -t 2000 -nbZero 6 -factor 4 -fdr 0.05 -isDroso false; for C. collaboinventa: -norm VC_SQRT -g 1.5 -min 3.0 -max 3.0 -mat 5000 -d 20 -res 500 -sat 0.01 -t 2000 -nbZero 6 -factor 2 -fdr 0.05 -isDroso false; for H. californensis: -norm KR -g 2.5 -min 3.0 -max 3.0 -mat 5000 -d 10 -res 1000 -sat 0.01 -t 2000 -nbZero 6 -factor 4 -fdr 0.05 -isDroso false. Identified loops were then filtered based on APSscore, removing high-intensity signals outside the normal distribution of APSscore values. This threshold ensured accurate removal of false positive regions that corresponded to structural genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or assembly artefacts. For H. californensis, we kept only annotated loops with values greater than ten. Chromatin loops in N. vectensis and focal chromatin contacts in E. muelleri were annotated manually.

Each loop anchor was assigned a promoter or enhancer identity based on their epigenetic signature. We calculated quantile normalized counts per million (CPM) coverage of H3K4me3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 ChIP signals in 1-kb (T. adhaerens, C. collaboinventa, N. vectensis), 2-kb (M. leidyi, E. muelleri, D. melanogaster) or 10-kb (H. sapiens) windows from a centre of a loop anchor.

METALoci110 (v.0.3.0) analysis was applied to explore the spatial distribution and autocorrelation of epigenetic signal in T. adhaerens contact maps. For each region of interest at 800 bp resolution, the top 20% pairs of contacts were used to create a two-dimensional graph layout by means of the Kamada–Kawai algorithm111 (Fig. 3b, top left panel) using the ‘metaloci layout' with default parameters. Next, the signal of interest (H3K4me3 ChIP, ATAC, genic exon annotation) measured in the 800-bp genomic bin was mapped onto the built graph layout using ‘metaloci lm' with default parameters. Spatial and epigenetic signals were embedded into Voronoi diagrams for enhanced visualization as a Gaudí plot (Extended Data Fig. 8c), and the local Moran's index (LMI) analysis112,113 was applied for each bin of the Gaudí plot.

According to LMI analysis, each bin is assigned to one of the four distinct groups, called LMI quadrants, based on the signal value in a bin and average signal value in its neighbourhood. If a bin and its neighbourhood have similar amounts of signal (low or high), then this bin is assigned to a low–low (blue) or high–high (red) quadrant. If a bin and its neighbourhood have different amounts of signal, then the bin is assigned to a low–high (cyan) or high–low (orange) quadrants, respectively. Significantly colocalized bins according to LMI, in which a P value is obtained using a permutation test, are highlighted by colour in the LMI scatterplots (Extended Data Fig. 8c,j, left panels). An analogous colouring scheme is applied to the Voronoi diagrams of the Gaudí plots. Hence, the highlighted blue and red bins on a Gaudí plot represent bins in which the signal is significantly colocalized in the space. Thus, ATAC-seq, H3K4me3 and motif score signals are significantly enriched inside the nested focal contacts (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8c), whereas exons are significantly enriched outside loop contacts (Fig. 3b). METALoci code is available at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/3DGenomes/METALoci).

Loop anchor regions of M. leidyi (n = 8,523) and H. californensis (n = 478) were scanned for enriched motifs with HOMER114 in de novo motif discovery mode. As background sequences, we used random genomic regions of equivalent size and GC content (n = 38,810 in M. leidyi and n = 49,097 in H. californensis). For motif enrichment analysis in T. adhaerens (n = 3,557) and C. collaboinventa (n = 4,037), we scanned loop anchor regions using random genomic sequences of equivalent size (n = 32,004 in T. adhaerens and n = 36,178 in C. collaboinventa) as background. Loop anchor regions of N. vectensis (n = 327) were scanned for enriched motif using random genomic sequences (n = 45,268) of equivalent size and GC content as background. In addition, we used ATAC-seq accessible neuronal promoter regions (n = 22,961) as background to scan for enriched motifs in genomic regions that overlap ATAC-seq peaks located at the non-loop insulation boundaries (n = 9,016). To annotate genomic regions with identified motifs, we used the monaLisa package115, selecting percentile threshold of motif scores by comparing the motif score distributions in the target regions with genome-wide motif score distributions (Extended Data Figs. 7d,f, 8i and 9f).

We evaluated the degree of sequence conservation of the M. leidyi genome by comparing it to other ctenophores (B. microptera, P. bachei and Hormiphora californiensis). To that end, we first aligned all genomes to each other using Cactus v.2.6.4 (ref. 116), following a progressive approach guided by the species trees of ctenophores, namely: ((M. leidyi, B. microptera), (H. californiensis, P. bachei)). Second, we used the hal2maf utility from the HAL toolkit v.2.2 (ref. 117) to create MAF (multiple alignment format) alignments of each chromosome, using M. leidyi as reference. To identify conserved regions in these genomes, we used the rphast v.1.6.1 implementation of the Phast toolkit118, as follows: (1) we used phyloFit119 to create an initial null model of neutral change based on the fourfold degenerate codon positions of each genome's coding regions, using a general reversible nucleotide transition matrix and the predefined species tree; (2) we used phastCons to optimize this model using the expectation–maximization procedure, re-estimating transition probabilities and tree parameters at each step (the optimization step was performed using only the longest chromosome in each genome).

We evaluated the degree of syntenic conservation of the loop regions in M. leidyi compared to the other ctenophore genomes, and compared it to that of length-matched regions not involved in loops. To that end, we first identified orthologous genes across the four ctenophore species (M. leidyi, B. microptera, P. bachei and H. californensis) using Broccoli v.1.2 (ref. 120) to obtain orthologous gene pairs (step 4), using predicted peptide sequences as input (longest isoform per gene only). Within Broccoli, we used the maximum-likelihood gene tree inference algorithm (based on IQ-TREE121) and set a k-mer length of 10,000 to avoid the removal of paralogous sequences from the analysis. Second, we mapped pairs of loop anchor regions from M. leidyi (2,353 pairs of promoter–enhancer and 99 promoter–promoter loops, n = 2,452 in total) to their closest overlapping genes, and used these genes and their orthologs as anchors to map these regions to the other ctenophore genomes. In parallel, we randomly selected length-matched, non-loop overlapping regions from the M. leidyi genome to compare their synteny conservation with that of loop regions (using the randomizeRegions function in the regioneR R package122 to select 3× background regions, n = 7,356). Then, for each pair of species, we evaluated the synteny conservation of the foreground (loop) and background regions (random non-loops) from the point of view of the flanking synteny-anchoring genes, using two different metrics: (1) the fraction of shared orthologous genes between the flanking genes across all regions in the foreground and background sets (testing the significance of the difference using a χ2 test for given probabilities) and (2) the distributions of per-region shared orthologs (tested using the one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction).

We used previously published datasets of ATAC-seq for C. owczarzaki17, S. rosetta39, T. adhaerens123, C. collaboinventa123, D. melanogaster124 and H. sapiens125 as well as newly generated datasets for N. vectensis, M. leidyi and E. muelleri. Sequenced reads were demultiplexed and converted to fastq files using bcl2fastq v.2.20 Illumina. Raw reads were filtered and trimmed with Trimmomatic (v.0.39)126 before mapping to the reference genome with bwa mem (v.0.7.17-r1188) and duplicates were marked with bamsormadup from biobambam2 (https://github.com/gt1/biobambam2). Using deeptools alignmentSieve aligned reads were filtered and shifted with -ATACshift, which corresponds to mate reads being shifted +4 and −5 bp for positive and negative strands, respectively. To generate nucleosome-position data tracks, nucleosome-free and nucleosome-bound regions were defined using the following length thresholds 0–120 and 150–240 bp, respectively. ATAC peaks were called with MACS2 (ref. 127) on shifted nucleosome-free regions. Footrpint ATAC score was calculated using TOBIAS v.0.13.3 (ref. 128).

We analysed publicly available dataset for D. melanogaster129 and H. sapiens130 and 34 newly generated ChIP–seq datasets as described below. Raw reads after removal of 3′-adapters and quality filtering with Trimmomatic (v.0.39)126 were aligned to the reference genome with bwa mem (v.0.7.17-r1188). Duplicated reads were marked with bamsormadup (https://github.com/gt1/biobambam2), and peaks were called using MACS2 (v.2.2.6)127. Aggregated density plots were visualized with deeptools (v.3.1.3)131.

Raw reads from amplified and native gDNA fragments bound by HALO-zf-C2H2 protein fusions were analysed as described for ChIP–seq. Motif enrichment analysis was performed using HOMER114 in de novo motif discovery mode for MACS2 identified narrow peaks resized to 300 bp (for CTEP1 n = 14,638; for CTEP2 n = 10,615). GC- and size-normalized random genomic regions were used as background (for CTEP1 n = 25,964; for CTEP2 n = 30,744).

We used previously published datasets of bulk poly-A enriched RNA-seq for S. arctica132, C. owczarzaki61, S. rosetta39, D. melanogaster124 and H. sapiens133 (Supplementary Table 2). To process data, raw reads were aligned to the reference genome using STAR (v.020201)134 in --quantMode to estimate the number of read counts per gene. In downstream analysis, gene counts were reported as −log2(1 − gene counts quantile).

Single-cell MARS-seq libraries generated previously8,135 were aligned to new reference genomes of E. muelleri (GCA_049114765.1), M. leidyi (GCA_048537945.1) and N. vectensis (GCA_932526225.1) using Liftoff or de novo annotated gene models. To improve single-cell RNA-seq quantification, gene annotations for E. muelleri and M. leidyi have been extended using GeneExt136. Briefly, MARS-seq alignment files have been subsampled to 100 M reads and MACS2 (ref. 127) was used to call peaks using default parameters. Intergenic peaks were filtered based on the 20th percentile of the genic peak coverage and each gene was extended to the most distant peak within 5,000 nucleotides. Metacell and clustering analyses were performed as previously described8. The single-cell expression atlas for T. adhaerens was obtained from a previously published dataset123.

All public datasets used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2. ATAC-seq, ChIP–seq and RNA-seq datasets were analysed as described above.

a, Overview of the input material for Micro-C experiments, library preparation strategy, and sequencing statistics in each species. The D. melanogaster dataset27 was subsampled to match the coverage of generated Micro-C maps in this study. b, Top, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) profile of crosslinked phagocytic choanocytes from E. muelleri labelled by feeding sponges with fluorescent microspheres. Only cells positive for nuclei Hoechst 33342 staining together with fluorescent beads were sorted. The sorted cell population (P3) was selected using sequential gating strategy through P1 and P2. Right, fluorescent microscopy image of sorted choanocytes, where PH stands for phase contrast, nuclei are in blue, FluoSpheres beads are in green. Scale bar (top right corner) is 50 µm. Below, the sequential FACS gating strategy (P1 - P3) to sort mOrange::NvElav+ neuronal cells (P4) from the N. vectensis transgenic line65. Wild type animals lacking the mOrange fluorescent protein were used to verify the gating strategy. The FACS sorting experiment data for E. muelleri and N. vectensis are representative of at least 6 independent experiments. c, The quality of chromatin digestion with MNase and followed proximity ligation was assessed with High sensitivity D5000 ScreenTapes using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation systems. The optimal chromatin fragmentation with Mnase results in up to 80% mononucleosomes profile. d, Barplots showing the percentage of reads mapped to the genome of each species. e, Barplots illustrating the distibution of intrachromosomal (cis) and interchromosomal (trans) interactions in each replicate experiment. The percentage of trans-contacts observed is species-specific but can be influenced by several factors: (i) the type of nuclear organization, such as Rabl-like configuration or the presence of chromosome territories, (ii) a high chromosome count, as seen in S. arctica and S. rosetta, (iii) and the reduction in nuclear diameter during the growth of coenocytes in S. arctica. f, Heatmap showing pairwise similarity scores between biological and technical replicates calculated as the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC). Below, SCC scores were estimated for a range of resolutions of 1 Kb, 2 Kb, 5 Kb, 10 Kb, 25 Kb, and 50 Kb. Differences in pairwise comparisons between experimental replicates are shown as mean ± s.d. The number of replicates per species as in (d-e). g, Top, cis-decay plots showing the rate of decay of contact frequency over genomic distance. The contact probability is averaged over all chromosomes. For C. owczarzaki, samples obtained from mitotic (blue) and synchronised G1/S stage (in orange) show different contact frequency behavior at short (below 10 Kb) and long (over 1 Mb) genomic distances. Bottom, log-derivative of cis-decay plots that predicts the folding of DNA into genomic structures and their size, most commonly chromatin loops, which tend to be the dominant micro-scale contacts. The first pronounced peak and dip at log-derivative cis-decay plots (highlighted in grey) in M. leidyi is observed at the scale from 10 Kb to 100 Kb. In H. sapiens, the peak size (highlighted in grey) ranges from 100 Kb to 1 Mb, which in both cases correspond to the average loop sizes in each species.

a, Genome assembly strategy. b, Genome assembly statistics. BUSCO completeness score was calculated using genome mode or protein mode against metazoan BUSCO dataset for all species except unicellular holozoans, where eukaryotic dataset was used. c, Chromosome-level re-assembly of S. arctica, S. rosetta, T. adhaerens and C. collaboinventa genomes using Micro-C data resulting in total of 27, 36, 6 and 6 chromosomes, respectively. Both S. arctica and S. rosetta posses genome-wide telomere clustering, whereas placozoans display strong interchromosomal compartmentalization signal. d, Left, genome-wide Micro-C contact map showing the chromosome-level assembly of C. owczarzaki. C. owczarzaki exhibit increased interactions between telomeres and between centromeres, suggesting Rabl-like chromosome configuration138. Right, chromosomal rearrangements in C. owczarzaki. Visual inspection of chromatin interaction maps revealed heterozygous deletions on C. owczarzaki chromosome 2, which is also confirmed by the uneven distribution of anti-H3 ChIP-seq coverage. In addition, one arm of the chromosome 13 exhibits genome-wide increase in the interaction frequency with other chromosomes, as well as two-fold coverage of H3 ChIP-seq, suggesting the gain of a chromosome arm pair. Finally, chromosome 15 v shares one arm with chromosome 15 and appears to be whole-arm translocation. e, Same as (d) for M. leidyi. The presence of uncollapsed haplotypes was estimated by distribution of per-base sequencing depth (left). Chromosomes in M. leidyi exhibit telomere clustering as well as increased intrachromosomal interactions similar to chromosome territories. f, Same as (d) for E. muelleri genome assembly with chromosome organisation similar to chromosome territories. g, Repeat content for each assembled genome, annotated using EDTA97.

a, Table translating relative resolutions of contact maps that were used to calculate compartmentalisation signal into base-pair resolutions. b, Example genomic regions showing eigenvector coefficients E1 and compartment annotation into A (active, red), B (inactive, blue) and I (intermediate, yellow). c, Density plots showing genome-wide distribution of E1 eigenvalues and the relative abundance of each defined compartments (stacked barplot on top). Compartments were defined using fitting of Gaussian mixture with three components (k = 3). A Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was computed for the specified mixture (bottom plot) (see Method section). d, Association between chromatin compartments and different genomic features calculated per genomic bin at a relative resolution of 20,000 bins per genome, as in (a). The proportion of features in each compartment category follows the classification as in (c). The boxplots indicate the relative signal (measured as genome-wide quantiles) of the different features in the genomic bins belonging to each compartment category (active, intermediate, inactive). The mean value of distributions is shown as the center line on the boxplots, with interquartile range (IQR) as the box limits and whiskers extending to 1.5x IQR.

a, Insulation score profiles aligned at insulation boundary regions. Insulation score profiles were calculated for multiple resolutions with window sizes corresponding to 5x, 10x and 25x the chosen resolution. For example, for 400 bp resolution, we used window sizes of 2,000 bp (5*bin), 4,000 bp (10*bin), and 10,000 bp (25*bin). Parameters showing two strongest average insulation scores were considered optimal. For each of our studied species, an example contact map region with calculated insulation profile is shown. b, Left, overlap between regions annotated as strong boundaries using strategy described in this paper (see Method section) and previously published datasets12,27. c, Left, distribution of boundary strength values per species. Insulation boundaries (marked in blue) were selected using Li threshold as implemented in cooltools103. Middle, distribution of linear distances (Kb) between successive boundaries, with the number of examined region between boundaries indicated. Right, boxplots showing the number of genes located between insulation boundaries (same number of examined regions as in the previous plot). Boxplots center line shows the median value, with box limits indicating the IQR and whiskers as 1.5x IQR. d, Epigenetic, structural and gene features associated to insulation boundaries in each species. Note that a boundary can be annotated with multiple features (e.g. TSS, ATAC and H3K4me3 peaks).

a, Example genomic regions in S. arctica illustrating the co-segregation of inactive chromatin regions. The interacting regions, highlighted in grey, fold into chromatin domains that exhibit local compartmentalised interactions. b, The manually annotated 296 compartment domains have a median size of 18 Kb. Middle, the observed long-distance interactions within the domains display a local checkerboard pattern, where contacts are enriched within certain set of loci, while contacts between them are depleted. To quantify the contact distribution, we calculated the sum of ICE (iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition)-normalized contacts within the segregated regions and their flanking regions (30 Kb) at a resolution of 2,800 bp, across the size range of 50 Kb to 5 Mb. The contact interaction pattern observed over the silenced regions showed a reduced interaction frequency across the region body compared to flanking loci. This interaction pattern is typical for checkerboard compartmentalisation, in contrast to loop interactions, which manifest as local peaks in interaction frequencies. Right, genes located within the compartment domains are lowly expressed or silenced (*** p-value < 2.2e−16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Boxplots center line shows the median value, with box limits indicating the IQR and whiskers as 1.5x IQR. c, Distribution of epigenetic signals across compartment domains. The regions within the annotated domains were located within the inactive B compartment and were enriched in transposable elements, predominantly Gypsy LTRs, which accounted for 63% of the total TEs in these regions. d, Size distribution of manually annotated 183 contact regions in S. rosetta that harbour lowly expressed genes (*** p-value = 4.8e−6, Wilcoxon rank sum test), boxplots as in (b). e, Example genomic regions in S. rosetta forming distal interactions. f, Same as (c) for S. rosetta. The interacting regions show weak enrichment in H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 signals compared to random genomic regions. g, Same as (e) for C. owczarzaki. h, Distal contacts in C. owczarzaki connect promoter regions of highly expressed genes (*** p-value = 5.3e−12, Wilcoxon rank sum test), boxplots as in (b). i, Distal contacts in C. owczarzaki are indicative of micro-compartmentalisation signal because of the characteristic alternating contact pattern and the decreased cumulative interactions in the promoter regions of the target genes compared to the concentration typically seen in chromatin loops annotated in T. adhaerens, M. leidyi, N. vectensis, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens. To quantify the distribution of contact interactions around TSS-TES sites, we calculated and compared the sum of ICE (iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition)-normalized contacts at species-specific resolutions (400 bp for C. owczarzaki, T. adhaerens and D. melanogaster, 500 bp for N. vectensis, 800 bp for M. leidyi and 5 Kb for H. sapiens). To eliminate confounding signals from distal compartmentalisation pattern or other long-distance interaction patterns, the sum of considered interactions was restricted to contacts that fall within the range size of annotated loops or interacting regions (4–100 Kb for C. owczarzaki, T. adhaerens, 5–250 Kb for D. melanogaster, 10–360 Kb for N. vectensis, 5–150 Kb for M. leidyi and 50–1,060 Kb for H. sapiens). To calculate the average distribution of interaction contacts around the TSS-TES sites we used the function stackup form the pybbi package version 0.4.0 (https://github.com/nvictus/pybbi). The TSS-TES regions were rescaled into 50 bins with flanking regions of 10 Kb for each species except H. sapiens with 100 Kb flanking regions. Additionally, we flipped the TSS-TES regions and their corresponding flanking regions for negative-stranded genes. Notice that in C. owczarzaki, the sum of interactions around the TSS was lower than average interactions within the gene body. This is due to a small-scale local checkerboard pattern, where regions between interaction loci showed low contact frequency. As a result, cumulative interactions at promoters were even lower than average background signal and signal over gene bodies. In contrast, in other examined species, including T. adhaerens, M. leidyi, N. vectensis, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens, where chromatin loops connected examined promoter regions to cis-regulatory elements, the contact frequency at loop anchor regions was enriched and higher than the average across gene bodies. These differences highlight distinct modes of chromatin organization of C. owczarzaki with other species. j, In C. owczarzaki, a subset of highly expressed genes (274) exhibit increased interaction frequencies between TSS and TES forming gene body interaction domains.

a, Example E. muelleri genomic regions showing contact patterns perpendicular to the diagonal of the Micro-C matrix and visually resembling flares139, jets140, or fountains40,141. b, Aggregated contact strength around the midpoints of flare regions. Random genomic regions anchored at the TSS of expression-matched genes were used as a control. Boxplots center line shows the median value, with box limits indicating the IQR and whiskers as 1.5x IQR. c, Example E. muelleri genomic regions showing distal interactions connecting promoter and enhancer-like anchor regions. Unlike typical chromatin loops, the preferential contact interactions in E. muelleri are diffuse and do not form a conspicuous dot contact pattern. d, A total of 84 manually annotated focal contacts connecting distal regulatory elements were classified as enhancers or promoters based on their H3K4me3 to H3K4me1 ratio. e, Aggregate plots demonstrating contact enrichment within rescaled contact regions, compared to random genomic regions anchored at TSS of expression-matched genes on one side and distance-matched random points on the other side. Boxplot limits are as in (b). f, Non-promoter cis-regulatory elements were identified based on chromatin state, defined by low H3K4me3 and high H3K4me1 enrichment around regions of accessible chromatin. The plots illustrate the distribution of these elements and their proximity to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) or other contact anchors within loop-forming enhancers. Notice the distance-to-TSS distribution of E. muelleri enhancer-like elements is similar to that of enhancers that do not form stable loops in other species.

a, Example genomic region in N. vectensis showing chromatin loop contacts with loop anchors highlighted in grey. b, Loop anchor regions were classified as promoter-side if characterized by high H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal levels and low H3K4me2 or low H3K4me1 signal. Enhancer-side loop anchors were defined as regions with low H3K4me3 and high H3K4me2 or H3K4me1. c, Most loop anchors retained their original classification, regardless of whether the H3K4me3/H3K4me2 or H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio was used. For N. vectensis, the ratio of H3K4me3/H3K4me1 outperformed H3K4me3/H3K4me2 in classifying loop anchors, as most of the disputed loops anchors annotated as promoters with H3K4me3/H3K4me2 were predominantly located in intronic and intergenic regions (pie chart). d, Left, aggregated contact strength of chromatin loop interactions, showing the overall intensity and frequency of chromatin contacts across loop anchor points. Right, loop anchors in N. vectensis show GTGT-motif enrichment (FC = 327, p-value = 1e−40) compared to GC-normalised background genomic regions. e, Genomic regions in N. vectensis displaying non-loop self-interacting domains. f, Same as (d), but for regions between insulation boundaries that also harbour self-interacting domains. Right, motif enrichment analysis was focused on accessible chromatin regions at the insulation boundaries. Accessible promoter regions in neuronal Elav+ cells were used as the background for comparison.

a, Annotation of chromatin loop anchors with promoter and enhancer chromatin signatures for T. adhaerens and C. collaboinventa. Loop anchors annotated as enhancers were mostly located within promoter regions of other genes. To resolve this ambiguity, such loop anchors were classified as promoters based on their genomic context. b, Example contact map regions depicting promoter-enhancer distal interactions highlighted in grey in syntenic regions of placozoans. c, Local Moran's Index scatterplot visualises assignment of genomic bins to four distinct groups: High-High (HH), where examined signal (ATAC or H3K4me3) spatially co-localises in a neighbourhood of other bins with high signal; Low-Low (LL) bin has low examined signal and located in a neighbourhood of bins with low signal; when bin and its neighbourhood have different levels of signal, then the bin is assigned to Low-High (LH) or High-Low (HL) quadrants. Statistically significant values are in solid colors. Right panel illustrates intensity of examined signal layered over the two-dimensional Kamada-Kawai representation of top 20% contact interactions. p-values and r-values (Pearson correlation coefficients) were determined using a one-sided permutation test. A linear least-squares regression was then performed between z-scores of ATAC or H3K4me3 values and the signal's spatial lag. The 95% confidence interval of the regression is shown as a grey shadow. d, Boxplots showing relative gene expression (RNA-seq) and peak intensity (H3K4me3) at promoter regions of genes from GP1, GP2, and GP3 groups. For each pairwise comparison for both T. adhaerens (GP1: n = 2,978; GP2: n = 3,681; GP3; n = 3,851) and C. collaboinventa (GP1: n = 3,973; GP2: n = 3,119; GP3: n = 4,238), *** indicates p-values below 2.22e−16, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Boxplots center line shows the median value, with box limits indicating the IQR and whiskers as 1.5x IQR. e, Left, heatmaps showing CPM normalised ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq coverage, motif scores and Mutator transposable element density within 5 Kb of the TSSs of GP1, GP2, and GP3 genes in C. collaboinventa. Each heatmap scale starts at zero. Middle, aggregate peak analysis displaying the contact strength between gene promoters within each annotated group. Right: Genes in C. collaboinventa from various gene groups, classified based on the presence of chromatin loops and their epigenetic states, demonstrate overlap with orthologous genes from GP1, GP2, and GP3 in T. adhaerens. f, GO-term enrichment analysis of GP1 genes with p-values determined using Fisher's exact test. g, Barplots showing the cell type (from previously published dataset123) in which genes belonging to each group are maximally expressed. Only variable genes (with a fold-change higher than 1.8) are included. h, Scatterplot showing total gene expression (x-axis) versus gene expression variability (y-axis) across cell types. i, Distribution of motif scores in loop anchor regions compared to the genome-wide background. C. collaboinventa harbour similar motif to T. adhaerens (similarity score = 0.93) in 60% of annotated loop anchor regions. j, Local Moran's Index scatterplot and Gaudí plots demonstrate spatial co-localisation of sequence motif identified in promoters of GP1 genes of T. adhaerens (motif score above 80th percentile). Statistically significant values are calculated as in (c). k, Schematic phylogenetic tree of TIR sequences of Mutator DNA transposons from four placozoan species (Trichoplax adhaerens, Trichoplax sp. H2, Hoilungia hongkongensis, Cladtertia collaboinventa). Placozoan Mutator DNA TIRs can be classified into 5 clades with consensus sequences. The similarity score between the TIR consensus sequence and the sequence motif in GP1 promoters is indicated. Pie charts shows the proportion of Mutator transposons harbouring the consensus TIR sequences.

a, Scatter plot showing the normalised H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 ChIP-seq coverage in 2 Kb region around loop anchor. b, Comparison of loop anchor annotation using either H3K4me3/H3K4me2 or H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratios. For M. leidyi, H3K4me3/H3K4me2 ratio were more effective in annotating loop anchors, as many loop anchors classified as promoters using H3K4me3/H3K4me1 were found within intergenic or intronic regions (pie chart). The discrepancy is attributed to the high background noise observed in the H3K4me1 ChIP-seq signal. c, Normalised coverage for different chromatin features around loop anchors classified as promoters and enhancers. d, Genomic regions in H. californensis showing chromatin loops. In total, we annotated 239 chromatin loops, with 51% of loop anchors located within intronic or intergenic regions. High-resolution chromatin maps are expected to significantly increase the number of reported loops in H. californensis. e, Boxplots showing the total expression in scRNA-seq data8 for M. leidyi or RNA-seq data51 for C. californensis of genes with a loop anchor at their promoter regions, in their introns (enhancer sites), and genes not involved in distal chromatin interactions (outside loops). *** stands for p-value < 2.22e−16 of two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Boxplots center line shows the median value, with box limits indicating the IQR and whiskers as 1.5x IQR. f, Motif score distributions at loop anchors (max score in 2,000 bp window around the center of a loop anchor) compared to genomic background. In H. californensis, we detected similar to M. leidyi GC-rich motif (similarity score = 0.96) enriched in 38% of loop anchors. g, Fraction of loop anchor sites containing the identified GC-rich motif at promoter sites (in orange), at enhancer sites (green) or at the promoters of genes not involved in chromatin loops (cyan). h, Scatterplot showing total gene expression (x-axis) versus gene expression variability (y-axis) across cell types, highlighting genes with their promoter involved in chromatin loops (orange) and also genes containing the GC-rich motif in their promoters but not involved in loops (cyan). These motif-containing genes without detected loops showed lower and more variable expression across cell types than genes with detected loops, suggesting the former could be forming loops in low-abundance cell types that we are unable to detect in bulk Micro-C experiments. i, DNA methylation levels at GC-motif sites located at chromatin loops (left) compared to methylation levels in motif occurrences outside detected chromatin loops (right). j, Bias-corrected ATAC footprint profiles centered around motifs located at loop anchors. k, Distribution of CTEP1 and CTEP2 bound DAP-seq peaks across genomic regions with varying DNA methylation levels and within annotated loop anchors. Below, the number of DAP-seq peaks containing the identified GC-rich motif. l, Number of loop anchor regions that contain CTEP1 and CTEP2 DAP-seq peaks. m, DAP-seq quantile normalized CPM coverage around GC-rich motif from CTEP2 binding assay using native genomic DNA fragments or unmethylated PCR amplified genomic DNA. CTEP2 as well as CTEP1 (Fig. 4f) exhibited higher affinity for the unmethylated GC-rich motif. n, Multiple sequence alignments of CTEP1 and CTEP2 genes were performed against the dataset of 358 metazoan genomes (Supplementary Table 3). The significant hits against CTEP proteins, exhibiting sequence identity above 50%, were found exclusively within ctenophores. o, Left, boxplots showing the number of transposable element insertions per promoter region of genes involved in chromatin loops compare to genes that are outside loops (*** indicates p-value < 2.22e−16, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). Right, barplots showing the fraction of promoters in loops containing TE insertions compared to promoters not involved in loops and random genomic regions. Over 90% of promoter regions involved in distal interactions harbour insertion of DNA transposon. Additionally, promoters in loops have higher frequency of insertions of LTR and Unknown type transposons. Boxplot limits as in (e). p, Syntenic conservation within M. leidyi chromatin loops compared to Pleurobrachia bachei or Bolinopsis microptera. Left, barplot showing the fraction of conserved orthologs in all alignable genomic regions across ctenophore species (chi-squared test for given probabilities). Right, boxplot showing the fraction of shared orthologs between individual genomic regions within chromatin loops (P. bachei: n = 105; B. microptera: n = 332) versus in random genomic regions of similar size (P. bachei: n = 198; B. microptera: n = 945). p-value significance was calculated using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Boxplot limits as in (e). q, Number of predicted genes with zf-C2H2 protein domain in the different species studied included in this study.

Metrics details

The brain is closely attuned to visceral signals from the body's internal environment, as evidenced by the numerous associations between neural, hemodynamic and peripheral physiological signals. Here we show that a major mode of these brain–body cofluctuations can be captured by a single spatiotemporal pattern. Across several independent samples, as well as single-echo and multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition sequences, we identify widespread cofluctuations in the low-frequency range (0.01–0.1 Hz) between resting-state global fMRI signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, and a host of peripheral autonomic signals spanning cardiovascular, pulmonary, exocrine and smooth muscle systems. The same brain–body cofluctuations observed at rest are elicited by cued deep breathing and intermittent sensory stimuli, as well as spontaneous phasic EEG events during sleep. Furthermore, we show that the spatial structure of global fMRI signals is maintained under experimental suppression of end-tidal carbon dioxide variations, suggesting that respiratory-driven fluctuations in arterial CO2 accompanying arousal cannot fully explain the origin of these signals in the brain. These findings suggest that the global fMRI signal is a substantial component of the arousal response governed by the autonomic nervous system.

Metrics details

Iron catalyses the oxidation of lipids in biological membranes and promotes a form of cell death called ferroptosis1. Defining where this chemistry occurs in the cell can inform the design of drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis in various disease-relevant settings. Genetic approaches have revealed suppressors of ferroptosis2,3,4; by contrast, small molecules can provide spatiotemporal control of the chemistry at work5. Here we show that the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 exerts cytoprotective effects by inactivating iron in lysosomes. We also show that the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 initiates membrane lipid oxidation in lysosomes. We designed a small-molecule activator of lysosomal iron—fentomycin-1—to induce the oxidative degradation of phospholipids and ultimately ferroptosis. Fentomycin-1 is able to kill iron-rich CD44high primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which can promote metastasis and fuel drug tolerance. In such cells, iron regulates cell adaptation6,7 while conferring vulnerability to ferroptosis8,9. Sarcoma cells exposed to sublethal doses of fentomycin-1 acquire a ferroptosis-resistant cell state characterized by the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the activation of a membrane-damage response. This phospholipid degrader can eradicate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells in vitro and reduces intranodal tumour growth in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Together, these results show that control of iron reactivity confers therapeutic benefits, establish lysosomal iron as a druggable target and highlight the value of targeting cell states10.

Iron reacts with peroxides to produce oxygen-centred radicals. In the cell, such a process can initiate and propagate a radical chain reaction that leads to oxidized organic products, a chemistry broadly defined as the Fenton reaction11. Chemically reactive lipids in biological membranes are ideal substrates for such reactions and have been implicated in ferroptosis12. The accumulation of damaged phospholipids can eventually cause the loss of membrane integrity together with altered organelle functions and the release of various types of chemical entities in the cell, which can induce further cellular defects and cell death. Ferroptosis involves distinct organelles13, including peroxisomes14, mitochondria15, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)16 and lysosomes8,17. However, it is currently unclear whether individual organelles contribute to ferroptosis through impaired cell signalling, metabolism and biosynthesis of specific biomolecules or whether membrane lipids of these compartments are also direct substrates for iron-mediated oxidation that leads to cell death. Cancer cells have been shown to require functional lysosomes to undergo ferroptosis17. This finding highlights the importance of cellular iron import and lends support for the idea that iron has a role in promoting cell death. Pharmacological inhibition of iron trafficking from lysosomes promotes the oxidation of lysosomal membrane lipids8,18, which indicates that a redox-active pool of iron in this organelle can trigger ferroptosis. Synthetic endoperoxides, surrogates of peroxidized lipids with a propensity to accumulate in the ER, can induce ferroptosis, which suggests that lipid peroxidation can propagate through this organelle19. However, it is currently unclear where iron-mediated oxidation of membrane lipids is first initiated in the cell before propagating through other proximal membrane lipids.

We set out to identify the subcellular sites of action of liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), a small molecule that protects cells against death induced through the inactivation of ferroptosis suppressors20. We labelled a clickable alkyne-containing analogue of Lip-1 (named cLip-1) using in-cell click chemistry and performed fluorescence microscopy21 in various cell lines. The results revealed lysosomal accumulation in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, in primary cells of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), in lung and colon circulating tumour cells and in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–f). Notably, labelled cLip-1 was detected only in the endolysosomal compartment, even at a concentration higher than the effective dose. This result supports the notion that Lip-1 exerts its anti-ferroptotic activity in this organelle. In vivo, cLip-1 increased the survival of mice in which acute renal failure was induced through genetic deletion of Gpx4, which encodes the ferroptosis suppressor glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)2 (Fig. 1b). Labelling cLip-1 in mouse tissues revealed its accumulation in the kidney, colocalizing with a lysosomal marker in renal proximal tubules (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1g). In vitro, cLip-1 prevented the oxidation of membrane lipids and protected cells against the effects of genetic depletion of Gpx4 or pharmacological inhibition of GPX4 with RSL3, thereby recapitulating the biological activity of Lip-1 (Extended Data Fig. 1h–j). These data validate cLip-1 as a suitable surrogate of Lip-1 to investigate ferroptosis.

The tight iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) protects cells against erastin-induced ferroptosis5. By contrast, Lip-1 exhibits radical-trapping antioxidant (RTA) properties in vitro22. However, unlike most RTAs that inhibit ferroptosis, such as α-tocopherol, Lip-1 does not follow the general trend of many ferroptosis suppressors, whereby RTA activity is closely correlated with ferroptosis inhibition23. This result suggests that other properties of Lip-1 contribute to its anti-ferroptotic effects. In cancer cells, iron can be internalized by endocytosis6,24 and regulates cell-state transitions and cell proliferation6,25. Because cLip-1 accumulates in lysosomes and contains nitrogen atoms susceptible to interactions with iron, we investigated the possibility that its ferroptosis inhibition properties can result from iron inactivation in this organelle. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy indicated that Lip-1 interacts with iron(III) with stoichiometries of 1:1 and 2:1 (Fig. 1d). Titrating Lip-1 with iron(III) chloride induced signal broadening together with a shift downfield of signals of the protons adjacent to nitrogen atoms of Lip-1, which indicated the occurrence of coordination with the nitrogen lone pairs with the Lewis acid. By contrast, the proton signals of naphthalene, which was used as an internal control as it lacks heteroatoms, remained unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 1k). Moreover, adding a Brønsted acid to Lip-1 induced distinct shifts downfield of the proton signals, which indicated protonation of the nitrogen atoms (Fig. 1e). Notably, line broadening of the proton signals was observed only in the presence of the paramagnetic metal (Extended Data Fig. 1l–n). Furthermore, the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a solution of iron(III) and Lip-1 did not fully displace iron from Lip-1, as shown by chemical shifts that recapitulated the effects of Lewis and Brønsted acids. These data indicate that the binding of Lip-1 to iron can take place under acidic conditions, such as those found in lysosomes. The addition of sodium hydroxide restored the chemical shifts of unbound Lip-1, a result that demonstrates the reversible nature of Lip-1 interactions with iron (Extended Data Fig. 1o). Molecular modelling using discrete Fourier transform computation produced several possible binding modes between iron and Lip-1, including bimolecular tetrahedral iron complexes involving the piperidine, amidine and aniline functions of Lip-1 (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Information).

Cyclic voltammetry, which is used to quantify the redox potential of metals in solution26, indicated that Lip-1 and DFO alter the redox properties of iron (Fig. 1g). As controls, we investigated two other synthetic analogues of Lip-1: metcLip-1 and alcLip-1. In metcLip-1, aromatic amines are methylated, which adversely affected RTA activity. By contrast, alcLip-1 is an aliphatic analogue with amines that have a higher negative logarithmic acid dissociation constant (pKa) value compared with their aromatic counterparts. This analogue was expected to be fully protonated at neutral pH and therefore to exhibit a reduced propensity to enter cells and to accumulate in lysosomes (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Labelling of metcLip-1 in cells revealed a similar staining pattern to that of labelled cLip-1, showing colocalization with a lysosomal marker. By contrast, labelled alcLip-1 showed weak fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Cyclic voltammetry results further indicated that metcLip-1 altered the redox potential of iron to a greater extent than alcLip-1 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Consistently, metcLip-1 protected cells against RSL3-induced oxidation of membrane lipids more potently than alcLip-1 (Extended Data Fig. 2d), and neither metcLip-1 nor alcLip-1 exhibited RTA properties in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2e). In-cell labelling of an alkyne-containing derivative of DFO (cDFO)6 also revealed lysosomal signals, which provided support for the pro-ferroptotic activity of iron in this organelle (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Signals of cDFO were also found in the cell nucleus, which partially explains the toxicity of this iron chelator and its distinct associated phenotype compared with other iron-interacting small molecules, including Lip-1.

In a cell-free system, Lip-1 reduced the fluorescence of an iron(III)-specific fluorescent probe in the presence of iron(III)27 (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Treatment of cells with hydroxychloroquine or bafilomycin-A1, which increase the lysosomal pH and prevent iron(III) unloading from its endocytic carriers, led to reduced pools of chelatable cellular iron(III) and reactive lysosomal iron(II), as measured using specific fluorescent probes27,28. These treatments also protected cells against RSL3-induced oxidation of membrane lipids in cancer cells (Fig. 1h–j and Extended Data Fig. 2h–j). Comparable results were obtained with Lip-1, which was consistent with the direct interactions of this compound with lysosomal iron (Fig. 1h–j and Extended Data Fig. 2h–j). After treatment with RSL3 for 1 h, oxidation of membrane lipids was predominantly detected in lysosomes, as assessed through Liperfluo and Bodipy 665/676 fluorescence levels (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Figs. 2k and 3a). By contrast, treatment with RSL3 for 4 h led to a staining pattern of oxidized membrane lipids that colocalized mainly with a fluorescently labelled biological marker of the ER (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Our data suggest that initiation of the radical chain reaction takes place early in the endolysosomal compartment, where redox-active iron can be found8. This radical chain reaction can then propagate to membrane lipids of other organelles in the vicinity, including the ER. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of cells with well-established ferroptosis inducers led to a depletion of glutathione and increased levels of oxygen-centred radicals in lysosomes (Extended Data Fig. 3c–e). Together, these data indicate that lysosomal iron has a central role in the induction of ferroptosis.

Cancer cells that have acquired a drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cell state are vulnerable to ferroptosis8,29,30. DTP cancer cells are characterized by high expression of the iron-uptake protein CD44, a cell membrane glycoprotein that is internalized by endocytosis and is used as a marker of cancer cell stemness and metastasis6,31. Thus, these cells exhibit upregulated iron uptake, which leads to increased cellular iron levels that in turn promote the activity of iron-dependent demethylases6. This process activates specific epigenetic and transcriptional programs that underlie cell-state transitions and the acquisition of a DTP phenotype6. Thus, lysosomal iron has emerged as a druggable target to promote ferroptosis in a cell-state-dependent manner9. With this in mind and the knowledge that lysosomal iron can trigger the oxidation of membrane lipids8, we designed a small molecule to target lipids at the plasma membrane and to activate iron(II) in lysosomes upon endocytosis. Such a compound would exploit nearby reactive membrane lipids as substrates for oxidation. To this end, we synthesized a bifunctional compound composed of the fluorescent lipophilic natural product marmycin and the synthetic Chen–White ligand, which we named fentomycin-1 (Fento-1) (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). Marmycin accumulates at the plasma membrane and is internalized by endocytosis32, whereas the Chen–White ligand is commonly used in chemical synthesis to oxidize organic substrates by activating iron(II)33. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide and under mild acidic aqueous conditions, such as those found in lysosomes, the Chen–White iron catalyst is thought to form a reactive iron-oxo species33. Like hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals, this intermediate can abstract a hydrogen atom from organic substrates, including saturated ones, to produce reactive carbon-centred radicals and subsequently oxidation products. Fento-1 is therefore reminiscent of a bifunctional small molecule that is able to induce proximity de novo between a catalyst and nucleic acids or proteins to promote degradation34,35. We proposed that by exploiting the abundant amount of reactive iron(II) in DTP cancer cells6,7,8, such a bifunctional molecule would form an active catalyst in the cell to promote the oxidative degradation of lysosomal membrane lipids and ultimately trigger ferroptosis.

Source data

In a cell-free system, Fento-1 enhanced the iron-induced oxidation of a liposome-forming unsaturated phospholipid under experimental conditions comparable to that found in lysosomes. That is, acidic pH, the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a water-soluble iron(II) salt (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). Notably, iron promoted oxidation of the phospholipid bilayer in the presence of hydrogen peroxide without enzymes, which therefore supports the idea that such a process occurs in the cell. The intrinsic fluorescence of Fento-1 revealed its localization at the plasma membrane when experiments were conducted at a low temperature to reduce endocytic flux (Extended Data Fig. 5a), thereby recapitulating the photophysical properties of the parental natural product. By contrast, at a physiological temperature, which enables endocytosis to take place, Fento-1 and marmycin were detected in the endolysosomal compartment (Fig. 2c). Chemical labelling of a clickable alkyne-containing Chen–White ligand (cCW) revealed weak pan-cellular staining (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4f), which suggested that the untethered ligand does not specifically accumulate in the endolysosomal compartment. Moreover, Fento-1 did not predominantly target other organelles (Extended Data Fig. 5b). This small molecule induced the oxidation of membrane phospholipids and reduced cell viability in several human and mouse cancer cell lines and primary cells, whereas the effects of cCW and marmycin were marginal (Extended Data Fig. 5c–e). Mass-spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics revealed that Fento-1 induced the oxidation of phospholipids in several cell lines to a greater extent than well-established ferroptosis inducers under these conditions (Extended Data Fig. 5f,g, Supplementary Information and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Analyses of lysosomes isolated from HT-1080 cells treated with Fento-1 for 1 h confirmed the oxidation of associated phospholipids at this early time point (Extended Data Fig. 5h, Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 4). Consistent with the oxidation of membrane phospholipids, sublethal doses of Fento-1 increased levels of ferroptosis suppressors in HT-1080 cells, including GPX4, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and the cystine–glutamate antiporter (composed of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2) (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5i). Quantitative proteomics revealed that cells treated with sublethal doses of Fento-1 for 48 h promoted the upregulation of ferroptosis1,36 and lysosome-associated proteins, including ferroptosis suppressors and lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), respectively, a result that provides support for the role of lysosomes in ferroptosis induction (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Cells were also characterized by the downregulation of iron homeostasis-associated proteins, including the iron-uptake protein CD44 and the iron-storage protein ferritin. These cells also exhibited increased levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2), which are characteristic of cellular iron depletion37. Sublethal doses of Fento-1 promoted the downregulation of mesenchymal markers, which have been linked to the acquisition of cancer cell states refractory to standard-of-care treatments38. Last, these cells exhibited upregulation of other transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell states, such as SOX4 and SOX13, as well as epithelial markers. These data indicate that the effects of Fento-1 treatment on HT-1080 cells, which are of mesenchymal origin, are due to the acquisition of a distinct cell state that resembles that of epithelial cells typically sensitive to standard antiproliferative treatments. This result also suggests that cancer cells can adapt to Fento-1 exposure and develop a ferroptosis-tolerant cell state. That is, cells treated with a low dose of Fento-1 exhibit sustained viability and a distinct phenotype due to cellular adaptation rather than clonal selection38. Western blot analyses further corroborated the proteomic data (Extended Data Fig. 5j). Furthermore, increased levels of GPX4 were detected in lysosome-enriched fractions isolated from HT-1080 cells treated with Fento-1 (Fig. 2f).

Oxidation of membrane phospholipids induced by Fento-1 was reduced by the lipophilic RTA α-tocopherol, the iron chelator deferiprone and Lip-1 (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 5k, Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 7). Furthermore, treatment with Fento-1 induced the production of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (Extended Data Fig. 5l), a result indicative of peroxidation and the breakdown of phospholipids that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids39. Notably, 4-HNE can cause cellular damage, and its production is a hallmark of ferroptosis40. Treatment with Fento-1 also led to increased levels of lysophospholipids and glycerol, further indicating the degradation of oxidized phospholipids (Fig. 2h, Extended Data Fig. 5m, Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 8). This result, together with the upregulation of lipid metabolism after treatment with Fento-1 (Fig. 2e), suggests that oxidized membrane lipids trigger a membrane-damage response41. Cell death induced by Fento-1 was antagonized by well-established ferroptosis inhibitors, which included iron chelators and RTAs, but not by apoptosis or necroptosis inhibitors (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 6a–f). Notably, Fento-1 exhibited a residual toxicity that ferroptosis inhibitors could not fully overcome, which reflects the potency of Fento-1. α-Tocopherol did not prevent lysosome targeting with Fento-1, which indicated that this ferroptosis inhibitor exerts its protective activity by acting as a RTA in membrane lipids and not by competing for interaction at the plasma membrane (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Fento-1 was synthetically lethal after cotreatment with GPX4 inhibitors, and cell viability was rescued by Lip-1 (Extended Data Fig. 6h), a result that further confirmed the pro-ferroptotic activity of Fento-1. Finally, knocking down ferroptosis suppressors sensitized cells to Fento-1, whereas knocking down Cd44 conferred a protective effect (Extended Data Fig. 6i). Consistently, knocking down Cd44 partially protected cells against oxidation of membrane lipids, whereas genetic suppression of the canonical iron endocytosis pathway involving TFR1 was less effective (Extended Data Fig. 6j). This result confirms the role of CD44 as the main effector of iron uptake in the mesenchymal state of cancer cells6.

We next explored the activity of structural variants of Fento-1 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Fento-2, which contains a longer linker between marmycin and the Chen–White ligand, exhibited a lower potency against PDAC and sarcoma cells than Fento-1. This result supports the notion that Fento-1 exerts its activity by promoting proximity between a reactive iron catalyst and membrane lipids (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). We also replaced marmycin with cholesterol, an apolar natural product that can intercalate between phospholipids at the plasma membrane42 and has a role in the mesenchymal state of cancer cells43, potentially at the plasma membrane. This modification led to the non-fluorescent analogue Fento-3, which exhibited a potency comparable to that of Fento-1. Together, these analogues illustrate the versatile nature of this strategy (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). As a control, replacing the apolar scaffold with a more polar moiety, such as morpholine, produced Fento-4, which was biologically inactive (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Finally, replacing the Chen–White ligand with the structurally more hindered Nordlander–Costas44 iron-activating ligand produced Fento-5, which exhibited similar cytotoxic and membrane-lipid-oxidation properties to those of Fento-1, albeit with a delayed cell-death response. This result reflects the distinct reactivity of the iron catalyst towards organic substrates45 (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Together, these data indicate that pharmacological activation of lysosomal iron can trigger ferroptosis.

Next, we investigated the effect of lysosomal iron activation in disease-relevant models. To this end, we quantified the iron content of primary tumour tissues of distinct cancer types, including human PDAC, various human sarcoma subtypes and a mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis. These cancer tissues were chosen for their refractory nature to standard-of-care treatments and their capacity to form metastases, which contribute to poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, these indications have been shown to be vulnerable to ferroptosis8,29,30,46.

Total iron content was higher in cancer tissues of PDAC, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), angiosarcoma, liposarcoma and an epithelioid sarcoma compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues, as measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Moreover, the cellular iron load was higher in subpopulations of cancer cells with high CD44 expression (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8b). Cells from freshly dissociated human primary PDAC and sarcoma tissues showed higher levels of redox-active lysosomal iron(II) in the CD44high subpopulations of cancer cells than their CD44low counterparts (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8c). This result is consistent with previous findings showing that CD44 mediates iron endocytosis in cancer cells that have acquired a DTP phenotype6. In cells obtained from freshly dissociated human primary tumours, Fento-1 induced oxidation and lipolysis of membrane phospholipids, an effect that was antagonized by ferroptosis inhibitors (Fig. 3d Extended Data Fig. 8d–g, Supplementary Information and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Fento-1 also reduced the number of CD44high cells in dissociated human PDAC and UPS, and this effect was antagonized by ferroptosis inhibitors (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8h,i).

In primary PDAC cells and human PDAC-derived organoids, Fento-1 decreased cell viability more potently than standard-of-care drugs (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b) and synergized with these drugs in several primary cancer cells of human PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). In a colony-formation assay, Fento-1 eradicated DTP of triple-negative breast cancer SUM159 cells overexpressing CD44 that survived treatment with doxorubicin (Fig. 3f). In line with this, Fento-1 was more potent against HT-1080 cells that were treated with low doses of doxorubicin for a prolonged period of time (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Under these conditions, HT-1080 cells adopted a distinct morphology and were characterized by increased levels of CD44 and ferritin together with upregulated mesenchymal markers (Extended Data Fig. 9f–h). These data suggest that cells exposed to doxorubicin increase CD44 to promote iron uptake and adopt a more mesenchymal phenotype to escape the doxorubicin-sensitive state. This adaptation leads to higher vulnerability to ferroptosis and sensitivity to Fento-1. Conversely, HT-1080 cells exposed to low doses of Fento-1 exhibited reduced CD44 and ferritin levels together with downregulated mesenchymal markers, which indicated that these cells adapt to lysosomal iron targeting (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 9g, i).

Regional lymph-node cancer lesions are predictors of distant metastases and mortality, and metastasizing cells are protected against ferroptosis in the lymph47. Measurements in mice showed that total iron levels in lymph fluid were lower than in blood and serum (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Thus, we evaluated the effect of Fento-1 on the viability of cancer cells directly in the lymphatics. To this end, we used the 4T1 immunocompetent mouse model of spontaneous triple-negative breast cancer metastases in Balb/c mice. Quantification of iron in cells isolated from intranodal 4T1 tumours showed a higher iron load in CD44high cancer cells than in CD44low subpopulations (Fig. 3g). These CD44high cells also exhibited a higher iron(II) redox activity in lysosomes (Extended Data Fig. 10b). When mice with intranodal 4T1 tumours were treated with Fento-1 (intralymphatic administration every other day), the mice showed reduced tumour growth, increased tumour-size-based survival end points and no adverse effects on body weight (Fig. 3h,i and Extended Data Fig. 10c–e). Further analyses of residual tumours indicated that Fento-1 induced oxidation of membrane lipids and the production of lysophospholipids, which affected preferentially CD44high over CD44low cancer-cell subpopulations (Fig. 3j,k, Extended Data Fig. 10f, Supplementary Information and Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). Together, these data show that Fento-1 induces ferroptosis in vivo by exploiting the higher abundance of lysosomal iron(II) in CD44high cancer-cell subpopulations.

Ferroptosis is a form of cell death resulting from the uncontrolled oxidation of membrane lipids. Where and how it is initiated in the cell remained unclear. Iron can react with hydroperoxides to initiate or propagate a radical chain reaction independently of enzymes. The lysosomal compartment is a crucial regulator of cellular iron homeostasis6,24,48, and its acidic nature, together with the presence of reactive iron and hydrogen peroxide, provide an ideal chemical environment to catalyse the oxidation of membrane phospholipids (Fig. 4a). Specific cancer-cell subpopulations upregulate the iron-uptake protein CD44 to promote oxidative demethylation of repressive chromatin marks and to unlock the expression of genes that regulate cell-state transitions involved in cancer progression6. Thus, although higher iron levels enable these cells to acquire a DTP profile, this characteristic also inexorably confers vulnerability to ferroptosis6,9 (Fig. 4b). The fact that CD44 also marks development, self-renewal, wound healing and immune-cell activation suggests that lysosomal iron also contributes to the induction of ferroptosis in these biological settings. Enhancing the redox activity of lysosomal iron through genetic interventions to eradicate cancer cells is challenging. Here we developed a phospholipid degrader that takes advantage of the higher iron load of specific cancer-cell subpopulations to induce ferroptosis by activating lysosomal iron(II) (Fig. 4a). Sublethal doses of this degrader triggered the acquisition of a ferroptosis-resistant cell state, which partially recapitulated features of epithelial cells (Fig. 4b). This result highlights the value of combining cell-state-specific drugs to treat cancer. The anticancer drug doxorubicin can induce damage to genomic DNA in proliferating cells, which, if unrepaired, triggers apoptosis49. Conversely, the ferroptosis-resistant cell state, which is characterized by the upregulation of ferroptosis suppressors, epoxide hydrolases, phospholipases and by increased lipid metabolism (Fig. 2d), can arise as a result of cells being able to efficiently repair damaged membranes.

a, Iron is internalized by endocytosis. Lysosomal iron catalyses the production of oxygen-centred radicals from hydroperoxides under acidic conditions. These radicals can abstract a hydrogen from reactive phospholipids to produce carbon-centred radicals, which leads to oxidation products and ferroptosis. Inactivation of lysosomal iron protects cells against iron-redox chemistry. Activation of lysosomal iron triggers the oxidation of membrane lipids and ferroptosis.

This study shows that fine-tuning the redox activity of lysosomal iron provides control over membrane lipid oxidation, thereby supporting the idea that lysosomal iron is a trigger of ferroptosis. This knowledge can now inform the design of ferroptosis modulators. Fento-1 exhibits a distinct chemotype to investigate ferroptosis and provides a conceptual framework to target DTP cancer cells38.

Starting materials were purchased at the highest commercial quality and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Anhydrous solvents were obtained by passing the degassed solvents through molecular sieves and activated alumina columns. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using aluminium plates coated with silica gel or neutral aluminium oxide from Merck (60 F254). TLC plates were visualized by UV or by treatment with a ninhydrin, ceric ammonium molybdate or potassium permanganate solution and heating. Reaction products were purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh, Macherey Nagel) or aluminium oxide (activated neutral, Sigma-Aldrich) using a CombiFlash NextGen System and a preparative HPLC Quaternary Gradient 2545 equipped with a photodiode array detector 2998 (Waters) fitted with a reverse-phase column (XBridge BEH C18 OBD prep column 5 μm, 30 × 150 mm). NMR spectroscopy was performed using Bruker 400 or 500 MHz instruments. Spectra were run in methanol-d4, dimethylsulfoxide-d6, methylene chloride-d2 or chloroform-d at 298 K or 310 K as indicated. 1H chemical shifts δ are expressed in ppm using the residual non-deuterated solvent as an internal standard, and the coupling constants J are specified in Hz. The following abbreviations are used: bs, broad singlet; s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; ddd, doublet of doublet of doublets; dt, doublet of triplets; dq, doublet of quadruplets; q, quadruplet; t, triplet; td, triplet of doublets, quint., quintet; and m, multiplet. 13C chemical shifts δ are expressed in ppm using the residual non-deuterated solvent as an internal standard. The purity of the final compounds was determined to be >98% by UPLC–MS. Low-resolution mass spectra were recorded using a Waters Acquity H-class equipped with a photodiode array detector and a SQ Detector 2 (UPLC-MS) fitted with a reverse-phase column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm). High-resolution MS spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Plus equipped with a Robotic TriVersa NanoMate Advion. Procedures for the synthesis of small molecules are detailed in the Supplementary Information.

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer at 310 K using Bruker Topspin (v.4.1.4) software and analysed using MestRenova (v.5.0.1-35756) or Bruker Topspin (v.4.1.4) software, and chemical shifts δ are expressed in ppm using the residual non-deuterated solvent signals as an internal standard. All the solutions were prepared in methanol-d4. For recordings of 1H NMR spectra of Lip-1 titrated with FeCl3 before the addition of TFA or sodium deuteroxide, 0.1–1 eq. of a solution of FeCl3 (Alfa Aesar, 12357, 2 µl, 145 mM) was added to a solution of Lip-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML1414, 1 mg in 600 µl). Then, a solution of TFA (Sigma-Aldrich, T6508, lot STBG1988V, 20 µl, 3 eq. 438 mM) or a solution of sodium deuteroxide (Eurisotop, D076Y, lot R2621, 1 µl) was added. For recordings of 1H NMR spectra of Lip-1 and naphthalene titrated with FeCl3, 0–1 eq. of a solution of FeCl3 (3 µl, 97 mM) was added over a solution of Lip-1 (1 mg in 500 µl) and naphthalene (Sigma-Aldrich, 147141, 1 eq., 100 µl, 28.9 mM). After each addition, the solution was stirred for few seconds and NMR spectra were recorded.

Cyclic voltammetry26 experiments were performed with a three-electrode cell. A saturated calomel electrode was used as reference, a steady glassy carbon electrode of diameter 3 mm was selected as the working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter-electrode. All cyclic voltammograms were recorded at room temperature with a μ-autolab III from Metrohm using Nova software (v.2.1) with a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1. HPLC-grade acetonitrile and methanol were used for recordings. For all experiments, nBu4NBF4 in acetonitrile (0.1 M, 32.9 mg ml–1 stock solution) was used. A 10 ml of a stock solution of 1 mM FeCl3 was prepared with 500 µl of 20 mM FeCl3 solution in milliQ water and 9.5 ml acetonitrile. Then, 5 µl (0.2 eq.) of a 40 mM stock solution of DFO, Lip-1, metcLip-1 (in-house) or alcLip-1 (in-house, solubilized in acetonitrile or methanol) was added to 1 ml of 1 mM FeCl3 solution until 1.0 eq. was reached. After each addition, the solution was stirred for few seconds and voltammograms were recorded.

All structures were optimized using the Gaussian 16 (ref. 50) set of programs at the BHLYP/SVP level for all atoms (sextet spin state for iron(III) complexes) (Gaussian 16, revision C.01). Thermal correction to the Gibbs free energy was computed at 310.15 K. Single points at the UMP2/SVP level were performed using the SMD solvation model (methanol). The results presented are ΔG310 in kcal mol–1.

A solution of RPE (in-house, 10 mM) in DMSO was diluted with a solution of acetonitrile–acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 5, 2:1, v/v) to reach a concentration of 10 µM. In a 96-well plate, three solutions of RPE (100 µl, 10 mM) and 10, 20 or 50 eq. of Lip-1 (in-house 1, 2 or 5 µl of 10 mM stock solution in methanol, respectively) were prepared and the solutions were mixed several times. Then, 10 eq. FeCl3 (1.0 µl of stock solution in acetonitrile–acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 5, 2:1, v/v)) was added to each solution and mixed again. Spectra were recorded with a fluorimeter (Tecan spark 10 M) (λex = 510 nm, λem = 540–700 nm) using SoftMax Pro 7.1 GxP software. UPLC-grade acetonitrile and methanol as well as milliQ water were used.

A conical centrifuge tube (15 ml) was charged with unilamellar liposomes of egg phosphatidylcholine (0.4 ml of a 20 mM suspension in PBS, 100 nm average diameter), 134 ml of a 12 mM solution of (E)-1,2-bis((2-methyldecan-2-yl)oxy)diazene (Cayman, 32742) in ethanol and PBS (7.46 ml of 12 mM at pH 7.4) and vortexed. STY-Bodipy (3.8 μl of a 1.74 mM solution in DMSO) was then added and the suspension vortexed once. The liposome–initiator–dye mixture was transferred to a reservoir, and using a 300 μl multichannel pipette, a 96-well plate (black, Nunc) was charged with the mixture (295 μl per well). Test compounds (5 μl of a 0.24 mM solution in acetonitrile) were added to bring the final volume to 300 μl. The contents of the wells were manually mixed using a multichannel pipette and then mixed in a microplate reader for 1 min at 37 °C, after which the oxidation of STY-Bodipy was monitored by fluorescence (λex/λem = 488/518 nm) overnight. Data were collected using Agilent BioTek Gen5 software (v.3.08.01).

HT-1080 cells, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Dissociated human and mouse tumour cells and 4T1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with GlutaMAX (Gibco, 61870010) and 10% FBS (Eurobio Scientific, CVFSVF00-01). HT-1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 61965059) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10270-106) and penicillin–streptomycin (BioWhittaker/Lonza, DE17-602E). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM–GlutaMAX supplemented with pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31966021) and supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 15140148). FC1242 and FC1245 mouse pancreatic cancer cells, 4a cells and human pancreatic hMIA-2D cells were a gift from the Tuveson laboratory (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and were cultured in DMEM–GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin. Primary human pancreatic PDAC024T, PDAC030T, PDAC053T, PDAC054T, PDAC084T, PDAC090T and PDAC211T cells were grown in serum-free ductal medium DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 10565018) supplemented with 0.61 g in 500 ml nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, 3376), 2.50 g in 500 ml glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, G6152), 1:200 ITS+ (Corning, 354352), 1:20 Nu-serum IV (Corning, 355104), 100 ng ml–1 cholera toxin, 1 µM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, D4902), 50 nM 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (Sigma-Aldrich, T6397) and penicillin–streptomycin). Fresh bovine pituitary extract (Gibco, 13028-014, 22.7 ng ml–1) and 50 ng ml–1 animal-free recombinant human EGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AF-100-15-1MG) were added to new medium when cells were split or plated. SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham F12, GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31765035), NEAA (Gibco, 11140050), antibiotic–antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15240062), insulin (Humalog, Cip: 3400934142680), hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, H0888-10G) and 5% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A5256701). Primary lung circulating tumour cells (Celprogen, 36107-34CTC, lot 219411, sex: female) and primary colon circulating tumour cells (Celprogen, 36112-39CTC, lot 20188, sex: female) were grown using stem cell complete medium (Celprogen, M36102-29PS) until the third passage. Circulating cancer cells were grown in stem cell ECM T75-flasks (Celprogen, E77002-07-T75). Pfa1 cells were cultured using DMEM high glucose and 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.

Tumour samples were collected from patients after surgery. Tumour samples were from patients with PDAC, UPS, liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma or PDAC liver metastasis. Tumours were dissociated using a human tumour dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-095-929) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, tumours were cut into small pieces (1–5 mm), put into the enzyme mix in RPMI and dissociated using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (Miltenyi) with the appropriate gentleMACS program (37C_h_TDK). Per tumour sample, 9.4 ml RPMI medium was used with the corresponding enzyme concentration according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse tumour samples were dissociated using a mouse tumour dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-096-730) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tumours were cut into small pieces (1–5 mm), put into the enzyme mix in RPMI and dissociated using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (Miltenyi) with the appropriate gentleMACS program (37C_m_TDK). Subsequently, the dissociated tumour suspension was applied to a MACS SmartStrainer (30 µm) (Miltenyi). Samples were diluted with 1× PBS and centrifuged at 300g. The cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI (with 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin), and cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Entek). The total population of dissociated cells is denoted as dissociated tumour cells, whereas the subpopulation corresponding to cancer cells from tumours by negative selection (see the section ‘Flow cytometry') is denoted as dissociated tumour cancer cells.

These models were originally derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The PDX fragments designated for cell culture were processed in a biosafety chamber. After mincing to small pieces, they were treated with collagenase type V (Sigma-Aldrich, C9263) and trypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25200-056) and suspended in DMEM supplemented with 1% w/w penicillin–streptomycin and 10% FBS. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in serum-free ductal medium adapted from previous protocols51 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Amplified cells were stored in liquid nitrogen. Cells were weaned from antibiotics for more than 48 h before testing. This protocol was used to establish the cells designated as PDAC024T, PDAC030T, PDAC053T, PDAC054T, PDAC084T, PDAC090T and PDAC211T.

Xenograft-derived pancreatic organoid (XDPO) models were originally derived from PDX models. Xenografts were split into several small pieces and processed in a biosafety chamber. After mincing to small pieces, they were treated using a human tumour dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-095-929). Undigested pellets were digested with accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1110501) at 37 °C for 30 min. The pancreatic tissue slurry was transferred to a 100 μm tissue strainer and then placed into a 12-well plate coated with 150 μl GFR Matrigel (Corning, 354230). The samples were cultured in pancreatic organoid feeding medium, which consisted of advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15630056), 1× GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050087), penicillin–streptomycin, 100 ng ml–1 animal-free recombinant human FGF10 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 500-P151G-50UG), 50 ng ml–1 animal-free recombinant human EGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AF-100-15-1MG), 100 ng ml–1 recombinant human noggin (Bio-Techne, 6057-NG), WNT3A-conditioned medium (30% v/v), RSPO1-conditioned medium (10% v/v), 10 nM human gastrin 1 (Sigma-Aldrich, SCP0152), 10 mM nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, N0636), 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, A9165), 1× B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17504001), 500 nM A83-01 (Tocris, 2939/10) and 10.5 μM Y27632 (Tocris, 1254/1). The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and the medium was changed every 3–4 days. This procedure was used to generate the XDPOs PDAC009T, PDAC003T, PDAC117T and PDAC372T.

For chemosensitivity profiling, XDPOs were plated into 96-well plates and then subjected to incrementally increasing concentrations of drugs. Cell viability was measured 72 h after treatment using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega, G9683). Doubling times of XDPO viability for vehicle-treated conditions were calculated on days 0 and 3. The ratio of day 3 over day 0 corresponded to the replication rate (RR) of the cells at 72 h. Doubling times were calculated using the formula 72 × 2/RR. Fluorescence and luminescence values were quantified using a Tristar LB941 plate reader (Berthold Technologies). Each experiment was performed at least three times with at least three replicates.

PDAC053T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. RSL3 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML2234, 0.1, 0.5, 2 and 10 μM) was added together with Lip-1 (1 µM), cLip-1 (1 µM), alcLip-1 (10 µM) or metcLip-1 (10 µM) on the following day. After 24 h, the medium was recovered and cells were trypsinized. Cells were collected, pelleted along with the recovered medium and washed with 1× PBS. Next, 100 μl of 1× Annexin-V binding buffer containing Annexin-V and propidium iodide was added according to the manufacturer's protocol (Annexin-V flow cytometry kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, V13242). 1× PBS buffer containing 10% FBS and EDTA (0.1% v/v) was added for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed using an AttuneTM NxT flow cytometer and data were analysed using FlowJo.

PDAC053T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. The following day, cells were transfected with siRNA as detailed in the section ‘RNA interference'. Medium was replaced 6 h after transfection. Three days after transfection, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of Fento-1 for 6 h. Cell death was analysed using Annexin-V AF488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A13201) and Sytox blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S34857). Flow cytometry was performed using an AttuneTM NxT flow cytometer and data were analysed using FlowJo.

LDH release was measured using a Cytotoxicity detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich, 11644793001) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a 96-well plate. Cell viability was assessed using a CellTiterGlo 2.0 (Promega, G9241) or CellTiter blue (Promega, G8081) kit according to the manufacturer's protocol in a 96-well plate. In brief, 4,000 cells (HT-1080, PDAC053T or 4T1) were seeded per well in clear-bottom and darkened 96-well plates (Greiner, 655090, lot E23063EG) 24 h before the experiment. Cells were then pretreated for 2 h with Lip-1 (10 µM), cLip-1 (10 µM), ferrostatin-1 (SML0583, 10 µM), DFO (Sigma-Aldrich, D9533, 100 µM), deferasirox (Cayman chemical, 16753, 10 µM), deferiprone (Sigma-Aldrich, Y0001976, 100 µM), α-tocopherol (100 µM), vitamin K3 (Sigma-Aldrich, M5625-25G, 10 µM), Z-VAD-FMK (Enzo Life Sciences, ALX-260-020-M005, 50 µM) or necrostatin-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, N9037, 20 µM). Subsequently, Fento-1 (10 µM, 6 h) was added. For dose–response measurements, cells were treated with varying amounts of the respective molecule for the time indicated. Samples were processed as detailed in the manufacturer's protocols and data were recorded on a SpectraMax ID3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). For standard-of-care cell-viability measurements, cells were plated at 2,000 cells per well 24 h before the experiment. Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of Fento-1, irinotecan (Sigma-Aldrich, I1406), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; Alfa Aesar, A13456-06) or oxaliplatin (Bio-Techne, 2623) for 72 h.

Cells were plated in a 96-well plate, incubated for 24 h and then pretreated with Lip-1 (1 µM) for 10 min before treatment with vehicle control or Fento-1 for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was carefully removed and 50 μl serum-free medium and 50 μl MTT solution (Cayman Chemical, 21795) were added per well. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, the solution was removed and 100 μl DMSO was added per well. The plate was covered and shaken on an orbital shaker for 15 min before reading the absorbance on a plate reader (OD = 590). For RSL3 treatment, Pfa1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2,000 cells per well) and cultured overnight. The following day, cells were treated with RSL3 (500 nM) and the indicated small molecules in serial dilution. For 4-OH-TAM treatment, Pfa1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (500 cells per well) with 4-OH-TAM (1 μM) and a dilution series of the indicated compounds. After 24 h (for RSL3) or 72 h (for 4-OH TAM) incubation, cell viability was assessed using resazurin as a cell-viability indicator. Fluorescence intensity was measured at λex/λem = 540/590 nm using a SpectraMax iD5 microplate reader with SoftMax Pro v.7 software (Molecular Devices) after 4 h of incubation in standard cell culture medium containing 0.004% resazurin.

The effect of sublethal doses of Fento-1 together with RSL3 or ML210 on cell viability was assessed using the Alamar blue assay. To determine cell viability, 3,000 HT-1080 or MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with standard medium (10% FBS  and  1% penicillin–streptomycin) around 20 h before treatment. Cells were pretreated with 0.5 µM Fento-1 and/or 0.5 µM Lip-1 for 1 h. After 48 h of RSL3 or ML210 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0521-5MG) treatment, a cell-viability assay was performed. Alamar blue solution was made by dissolving 0.5 g resazurin sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, 263-718-5) in 100 ml sterile PBS and sterile filtrated through a 0.22 µm filter. After 2 h of incubation, viability was assessed by measuring the fluorescence using a 540 ± 20 nm excitation filter and a 590 ± 20 nm emission filter on a Spark microplate reader (Tecan).

Kinetics of cell death were collected using an IncuCyte bioimaging platform (Essen). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3,000 cells per well) 1 day before treatment. Cells were treated with Fento-1 in combination with Lip-1 (0.5 µM) in FluoroBrite DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific A1896701). Four images per well were captured every hour, analysed and data were averaged. Cell death was measured on the basis of the incorporation of DRAQ7 (0.1 µM, Cell Signaling, 7406S). Data were collected as count of DRAQ7-positive cells per total number of cells in each condition.

About 2 × 106 HT-1080 cells were plated in T75 flasks 24 h before adding doxorubicin (Clinisciences, HY-15142, 25 nM). Flasks were washed with 1× PBS buffer, and medium containing doxorubicin (25 nM) was replaced every 3–4 days. After 30 days of treatment with doxorubicin, 4,000 cells were plated in 96-well plates per well to assess cell viability after treatment with Fento-1.

About 1 × 106 SUM159 cells were plated in 10 cm dishes in complete growth medium. Seeded cells were treated with doxorubicin at the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) concentration (150 nM). After 72 h, cells were washed and treated with Fento-1 (5 µM, 72 h) or 0.2% DMSO without drug. After 72 h, cells were washed, and the treatment was replaced with complete growth medium. After 10–15 days, cells were washed, fixed and stained with acetic acid and methanol (1:7) and 1% Coomassie blue 1 h at room temperature. The number of colonies with >100 cells was counted using a SCAN1200 colony counter (Interscience).

Cells were plated in 96-well plates (5,000 cells per well). After 12 h, cells were treated with 5-FU (Selleckchem, S1209, 5 µM), gemcitabine (Selleckchem, S1714, 1 µM), oxaliplatin (Selleckchem, S1224, 20 µM), paclitaxel (Selleckchem, S1150, 0.1 µM) or SN-38 (Selleckchem, S4908, 0.1 µM) alone or in combination with Fento-1 (1.5 µM) for 72 h. Cell viability was estimated after the addition of PrestoBlue (Life Technologies, A13261) for 2 h following the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the existence of a synergistic effect on cell proliferation or cell viability between standard-of-care drugs and Fento-1, we used the software SynergyFinder. For the analysis of this effect, the ZIP score was used as a model for calculating synergy52.

Mice were kept under standard conditions with water and food ad libitum and in a controlled environment (22 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity, 12 h light–dark cycle). For animal studies, C57BL6/J mice were randomized into separate cages. Mice aged 12–24 weeks and sex-matched were used for all experiments. For the survival cohort study, Rosa26-creERT2;Gpx4f/f mice were intraperitoneally treated with tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, T2859, 2 mg per day dissolved in Myglyol 812) on days 0 and 1 for deletion of Gpx4 in the whole body except in the brain2. From day 2, cLip-1 (in-house, 10 mg per kg per day dissolved in 1× PBS containing 20% PEG400 and 5% Solutol HS15) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered to the mice each day until the completion of the survival study. For histochemistry analyses, Rosa26-creERT2;Gpx4f/f mice treated with intraperitoneal tamoxifen injection (2 mg per day on days 0 and 1) were used. On day 7, cLip-1 (in-house, 10 and 100 mg kg–1) or vehicle was intraperitoneally injected into the mice. At 1 h after the injection, mice were euthanized, and the kidney and liver samples were processed as described in the section ‘Small-molecule labelling using click chemistry'.

Balb/c mice (25-week-old females) were purchased from Charles River and housed at the CRCM animal core facility and randomized into separate cages. Mice aged 12–24 weeks and sex-matched were used for all experiments. Mice were housed under sterile conditions with sterilized food and water provided ad libitum and maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle and 22 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity. Mice were not subjected to any procedures before collection of lymph, blood and serum.

For lymph sample collection, 30 min before the beginning of the experiment, buprenorphine (Buprecare), an analgesic, was administered by intraperitoneal injection (0.5 mg kg–1). Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine–xylazine combination (ketamine 100 mg kg–1 (Imalgène) and xylazine 10  mg kg–1 (Rompum); 20 µl g–1). After cutaneous and peritoneal incisions, the lymph in the intestinal lymph trunk53 was collected using a glass capillary. Lymph samples were placed in cryotubes, frozen at −20 °C and stored at −80 °C.

For blood and serum sample collection, after lymph collection, we performed a terminal cardiac puncture (23 G needle with a 1–2 ml syringe) by thoracotomy to collect a large volume of blood without anticoagulants. Next, 100–200 µl of the blood sample was placed in a vial, frozen at −20 °C and stored at −80 °C. The rest of the blood sample was left to stand at room temperature for 30 min, then centrifuged at 2,000g for 15 min. The supernatant (serum) was collected in a vial, frozen at −20 °C and stored at −80 °C.

HT-1080 cells were grown in 148 cm2 round dishes at 70% confluence and treated with Fento-1 (1 µM, 48 h). Whole-cell extracts were collected and then centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed 3× with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed using lysis buffer (8 M urea, 200 mM sodium bicarbonate and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 000000011697498001)). Lysis was achieved by incubating on a rotating wheel at 25 r.p.m. for 45 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant that contained total protein was used for quantitative global proteomic analysis. In brief, 30 µg total protein cell lysate was reduced by incubating with 5 mM dithiothreitol at 57 °C for 30 min and then alkylated with iodoacetamide (10 mM, 30 min) at room temperature in the dark. Trypsin/LysC (Promega) was added at 1:100 (w/w) enzyme to substrate. Digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C. Samples were then loaded onto custom-made C18 StageTips (AttractSPE Disk Bio C18-100.47.20, Affinisep) for desalting. Peptides were eluted using a ratio of 40:60 acetonitrile and H2O + 0.1% formic acid and vacuum concentrated to dryness with a SpeedVac. Peptides were reconstituted in 0.3% TFA before liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).

LC was performed with a Vanquish Neo LC system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, interfaced by a Nanospray Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were injected onto a C18 column (75 µm inner diameter × 50 cm double nanoViper PepMap Neo, 2 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) regulated at 50 °C and separated with a linear gradient from 100% buffer A (100% H2O  and  0.1% formic acid) to 28% buffer B (100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl min–1 over 104 min. The instrument was operated in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode. MS full scans were recorded on the Orbitrap mass analyser in centroid mode for ranges 380–980 m/z with a resolution of 240,000, a normalized automatic gain control (AGC) target set at 500% and a maximum injection time of 5 ms. The DIAs in the Astral analyser were performed in centroid mode for a mass range of 380–980 m/z with a window width of 2 Da (without overlap), a maximum injection time of 3 ms and a normalized AGC target of 500% after fragmentation using higher-energy collisional dissociation (25% normalized collision energy).

For identification, the data were searched against the Homo sapiens (UP000005640) UniProt database using Spectronaut (v.18.7 or v.19; Biognosys) by directDIA + analysis using default search settings. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethyl was set as a fixed modification, and amino-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. The resulting files were further processed using myProMS (v.3.10; https://github.com/bioinfo-pf-curie/myproms)54. For protein quantification, XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions (TopN matching) with missed cleavages and carbamidomethylation were allowed. Median and scale normalization at the peptide level was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biologically independent replicate (n = 5). To evaluate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and a two-sided t-test was applied on the fold change estimated by the model. The P values were then adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg false-discovery rate procedure. The MS proteomics raw data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium through the PRIDE partner repository55.

Mouse breast cancer cells (4T1) were transplanted into 6–8-week-old female Balb/c mice (syngeneic with the 4T1 model). Mice were housed at the Harvard Medical School animal core facility and randomized into separate cages. Mice were housed under sterile conditions with sterilized food and water provided ad libitum and maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle and 22 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity. To perform injections into lymph nodes, the lymphatics were first traced by injecting 2% Evans Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, E2129) into the foot pedal 5 min before performing intranodal injections. After injecting Evans Blue dye, the mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane and a small (5–10 mm) incision was made in the region of the right popliteal lymph node. The lymph node was located on the basis of Evans Blue staining, immobilized with forceps, and 1–2 × 104 cells suspended in 1× PBS were injected in a volume of 10 μl into the popliteal lymph node using a 27 G Hamilton syringe. Injection into the lymph node was confirmed by visible swelling of the lymph node. The incision was closed using surgical glue (3M VetBond Tissue Adhesive, 1469SB) and the mice were closely monitored for signs of pain or distress. Once tumours were palpable in at least 75% of the mice (approximately 1 week after injection), 10 μl Fento-1 (0.003 mg per animal) or vehicle was delivered intralymphatically into the tumour-bearing lymph node every other day until the experimental end point. Intranodal tumour diameters were measured 3 times per week with calipers until any tumour in the mouse cohort reached 2.0 cm in its largest diameter, which was the predetermined experimental end point for these experiments. For all experiments, this maximum permitted tumour diameter was not exceeded. At that point, all mice in the cohort were euthanized, per approved protocols, for analyses of intranodal tumour diameter, tumour mass and other parameters. At the experimental endpoint, data on tumour formation were collected in a manner blinded to sample identity or treatment. For survival-curve determinations, tumour-sized-based survival rate methods were applied, with 1.5 cm as the recommended predetermined survival rate per ethically acceptable cut-off values for determining therapeutic efficacy in mouse studies56. Tumour sizes were measured in two dimensions, length (x axis) and width (y axis), with the x axis conventionally defined as the longest axis of the tumour. Tumour sizes are represented as tumour diameter (cm) or tumour volume (cm3), as extrapolated by 0.5 × length × width2, as indicated for each in vivo experiment. Tumour samples were frozen in 10% DMSO in FBS (1 °C min–1 until –80 °C) for subsequent cellular analyses. No formal randomization techniques were used. However, animals were allocated randomly to treatment groups and specimens were processed in an arbitrary order. For all experiments, mice were kept on a normal chow diet and fed ad libitum.

Cells were plated on coverslips and treated as indicated. Bodipy 665/676 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, B3932, 10 µM, 45 min), LysoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L12492, 100 nM, 45 min), DND-189 LysoSensor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L7535, 100 nM, 1 h), Liperfluo (Dojindo, L248, 1 µM, 1 h) and SQSS (in-house, 50 nM, 1 h) were added to live cells before fixation. For colocalization studies, cells were treated with Fento-1 (1 µM, 1 h) or marmycin (in-house, 1 µM, 1 h) at the indicated temperature 16 h after transduction. At 16 h after transduction the BacMam-transduced cells were treated with RSL3 (1 µM) for 15 min or for 3 h 15 min and then treated with Bodipy 665/676 for 45 min to give the final time points of 1 h and 4 h. For colocalization of lipid peroxides with lysosomes, cells were treated with RSL3 (1 µM) and either Bodipy 665/676 and DND-189 LysoSensor or Liperfluo and LysoTracker Deep Red for 1 h. To assess the fluorescence intensity of Fento-1 in the presence of α-tocopherol, cells were pretreated with α-tocopherol (Sigma-Aldrich, PHR1031, 100 µM, 2 h) and then with Fento-1 (1 µM). Cells were then washed 3 times with 1× PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 12 min and then washed 3 times with 1× PBS. For antibody staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 5 min and washed 3 times with 1× PBS. Subsequently, cells were blocked in 2% BSA (Euromedex, 04-100-812-E), 0.2% Tween-20 and 1× PBS (blocking buffer) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the relevant antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times with 1× PBS and were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. Finally, coverslips were washed 3 times with 1× PBS and mounted using Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200-10). Bodipy 665/676 and Liperfluo-treated cells were fixed using ice-cold reagents and placed at 4 °C immediately after mounting on coverslips and imaged. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Deltavision real-time microscope (Applied Precision), a thunder microscope (Leica) or an Apotome Weiss microscope with Deltavision imaging software, Thunder Leica image acquisition software or Apotome Zeiss Imaging software, respectively. A ×40/1.4NA, ×60/1.4NA or ×100/1.4NA objective was used for acquisitions, and all images were acquired as z stacks. Images were deconvoluted using SoftWorx (ratio conservative, 15 iterations, Applied Precision) and processed with Fiji 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52n. Images were taken in black and white and colouring was applied with Fiji. Fluorescence intensity is displayed as arbitrary units and is not comparable between different panels. Colocalization quantification was calculated using Fiji 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52n. Nuclei were detected using DAPI or Hoechst fluorescence as indicated.

Bright-field images were acquired using a CKX41 microscope (Olympus) and cellSens Entry imaging software (Olympus).

Cells on coverslips were treated as indicated with cDFO (in-house, 100 µM, 15 min), cLip-1 (in-house, 1 µM, 1 h or 2 h), metcLip-1 (in-house, 10 µM, 1 h), alcLip-1 (in-house, 10 µM, 1 h) or cCW (1 µM, 1 h), then fixed and permeabilized as indicated in the section ‘Fluorescence imaging'. LysoTracker Deep Red was added to live cells for 45 min before fixation. The click reaction cocktail was prepared using a Click-iT EdU Imaging kit (Invitrogen, C10337) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In a typical experiment, we mixed 50 μl of 10× Click-iT reaction buffer with 20 μl CuSO4 solution, 1 μl Alexa-Fluor-azide, 50 μl reaction buffer additive (sodium ascorbate) and 379 µl ultrapure water to reach a final volume of 500 μl. Coverslips were incubated with the click reaction cocktail in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, then washed 3 times with 1× PBS. Immunofluorescence imaging was then performed as described in the section ‘Fluorescence imaging'.

Kidney and liver tissue samples collected from cLip-1-treated mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS overnight at 4 °C. Fixed tissues were incubated in 10% sucrose in 1× PBS for 30 min and then incubated in 20% sucrose in 1× PBS at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by embedding in OCT mounting compound (TissueTek, Sakura) on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Frozen tissues were cut into 5-µm-thick sections using a Cryostat Microm HM 560 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at −30 °C. Tissue sections were post-fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 10 min and subsequently incubated with 100% acetone for 10 min at −20 °C. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (1× PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min. The specimens were labelled using a click reaction as described above. For costaining with a lysosomal marker, the click-labelled specimens were incubated with anti-LAMP1 or antibody diluted in 1× PBS containing 10% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were incubated with secondary antibody in 1× PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342 staining, and slides were mounted in Aqua/PolyMount (Polysciences). Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (DS-Qi2, Nikon) or a confocal microscope (LSM880, Carl Zeiss) and the corresponding appropriate filter sets for fluorophores.

Cells were treated as indicated and then washed with 1× PBS. Proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer containing benzonase (VWR, 70664-3, 1:100). Extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, heated at 94 °C for 10 min and quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein lysates were resolved by SDS–PAGE electrophoresis (Invitrogen sure-lock system and Nu-PAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris precast gels). In a typical experiment, 10–20 µg of total protein extract were loaded per lane in 2× Laemmli buffer containing bromophenol blue. On each gel, a size marker was run: 3 µl PageRuler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 26616) or 3 µl PageRuler plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 26620) and 17 µl 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Protran 0.45 μm) using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) using 1× NuPage transfer buffer (Invitrogen, NP00061) with 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat skimmed milk powder (Régilait) in 0.1% Tween-20 and 1× PBS for 20 min. Membranes were cut at the appropriate marker size to enable the probing of several antibodies on the same membrane. Blots were then probed with the relevant primary antibodies in 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20 and 1× PBS or in 5% non-fat skimmed milk powder in 0.1% Tween-20 and 1× PBS at 4 °C overnight with gentle motion in a hand-sealed transparent plastic bag. Membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween-20 and 1× PBS 3 times and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) in 5% non-fat skimmed milk powder (Régilait) in 0.1% Tween-20 and 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times with 0.1% Tween-20 and 1× PBS. Antigens were detected using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580) and SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34096) chemiluminescent detection kits. Signals were recorded using a Fusion Solo S Imaging System (Vilber) with FusionCapt Advance software. Images were processed using Fiji 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52n software. Full scans of blots are provided in the Supplementary Information.

PDAC053T cells were seeded in 4-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well 24 h before the experiment in 1 ml cell culture medium. Cells were then transduced with CellLight Lysosomes-GFP, BacMam 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10596), CellLight ER-GFP, BacMam 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10590) or CellLight Mitochondria-GFP, BacMam 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10600) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 70 µl BacMam reagent was added to the medium and mixed. Cells were incubated for 16 h.

Cells were plated 24 h before the experiments. Cells were transfected with the specified siRNA using jetPRIME (Polyplus, 114-15) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 100 nM siRNA. In brief, PDAC053T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well and transfected 24 h later. The medium was replaced after 6 h. Analysis was performed 72 h after transfection. Suitable siRNAs were designed by Dharmacon for specific downregulation of target genes. siRNA sequences are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS. For antibody staining, cells were incubated with Fc block (Human TruStain FcX, BioLegend, 422302, 1:20) for 15 min, then incubated with antibodies in ice-cold 10% FBS, 1× PBS, 2 mM EDTA for 20 min at 4 °C and then washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in 10% FBS, 1× PBS and 2 mM EDTA before analysis using a BD LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer with FACS DIVA software (v.9.0.1).

PDAC053T and HT-1080 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. On the next day, Lip-1 (10 µM), hydroxychloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich, H0915, 100 µM) or bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich, B1793, 75 nM) was added to PDAC053T cells for 1 h and to HT-1080 cells for 30 min. For PDAC053T cells, after 30 min of treatment with compounds, RPE27 (in-house, 40 µM) or HMRhoNox-M28 (in-house, 1 μM) probes were added for 30 min. For HT-1080 cells, after 15 min of treatment with compounds, RPE27 (in-house, 40 µM) or HMRhoNox-M28 (in-house, 1 μM) probes were added and left for 15 min. After incubation with the iron probes, the medium was removed and cells were washed with 1× PBS once before trypsinization. Cells were collected, pelleted, washed with 1× PBS and finally 200 µl of 1× PBS buffer containing 10% FBS and EDTA (0.1% v/v) was added. Data were recorded on a BD LSR Fortessa X-20.

PDAC053T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at the density of 1 × 105 cells per well.

After 1 h, the medium was removed and cells were washed with 1× PBS twice before trypsinization. Cells were collected, pelleted, washed with 1× PBS and finally 250  µl of 1× PBS buffer containing 10% FBS and EDTA (0.1% v/v) was added for flow cytometry. PDAC053T, HT-1080 and 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. On the next day, cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 (75 nM) and hydroxychloroquine (10 µM) for 2 h before adding RSL3 (200 nM for PDAC053T and HT-1080, 500 nM for 4T1). After 1 h, cells were treated with Bodipy-C11 581/591 (4 µM) for an additional 1 h. The medium was removed and cells were washed with 1× PBS twice before trypsinization.

Typically, 2 × 105 dissociated human tissue cells were incubated in medium (RPMI 1610, 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin) with HMRhoNox-M28 (in-house, 1 μM, 1 h). Lysosomal iron content of human tumour samples and healthy adjacent tissues was analysed with the following antibody and stain panel: DAPI (0.1 µg ml–1), CD3-BV510 (BioLegend, 317332), CD31-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, 303118), CD44-AF647 (Novus Biologicals, NB500-481AF647), CD45-BV785 (BioLegend, 304048), CD163-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (BioLegend, 326512), FAP-AF700 (R&D Systems, FAB3715N) and TFR1-APC-AF750 (Beckman Coulter, A89313). The live tumour cancer cells corresponded to DAPI–CD45–CD31–FAP– cells. Data were recorded on a BD LSRFortessa X-20 or AttuneTM NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Typically, 2 × 105 dissociated tumour cells were incubated in medium (RPMI 1610, 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin) with Fento-1 (in-house, 1 µM, 24 h). Cells were pretreated with Lip-1 (1 µM), cLip-1 (in-house, 1  µM), α-tocopherol (100 µM) or deferiprone (100 µM) for 2 h. α-Tocopherol was kept pure under inert atmosphere, and a fresh stock solution was prepared throughout the study before each experiment.

The live tumour cells corresponded to Sytox blue–CD45–CD31–FAP– cells. Data were recorded on an AttuneTM NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For flow cytometry analyses of CD44 levels in mouse 4T1 tumours, typically, 2 × 105 dissociated tumour cells were used per condition. Freshly dissociated cells were stained using the following antibody and stain panel: Sytox blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S34857, 1 µM), CD31-BV605 (BioLegend, 102427), CD44-AF647 (BioLegend, 103018), CD45-BV510 (BioLegend, 103138) and MHCII-APC/Cyanine7 (BioLegend, 107628).

Sorting of human cells was performed using the following antibodies: CD31-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, 303118), CD44-AF647 (Novus Biologicals, NB500-481AF647) and CD45-BV785 (BioLegend, 304048). The sorted cells corresponded to CD45–CD31–CD44+ cells and CD45–CD31–CD44– cells, which were isolated on a FACSAria Fusion (BD) using FACS DIVA (v.9.0.1). ICP-MS experiments were conducted using CD44high and CD44low tumour cells as described in the section ‘ICP-MS'. Sorting of mouse cells was performed using the following antibodies: CD44-AF647 (BioLegend, 103018) and MHCII-APC/Cyanine7 (BioLegend, 107628). The sorted cells corresponded to MHCII+CD44high cells and MHCII+CD44low cells. Sorted cells were centrifuged at 300g and cell pellets were processed for subsequent applications.

Glass vials equipped with Teflon septa were cleaned with nitric acid 65% (VWR, Suprapur, 1.00441.0250), washed with ultrapure water (Sigma-Aldrich, 1012620500) and dried. Cells were collected and washed twice with 1× PBS. Cells were then counted using an automated cell counter (Entek) and transferred in 200 µl 1× PBS or ultrapure water to the cleaned glass vials. The same volume of 1× PBS or ultrapure water was transferred into separate vials for background subtraction, at least in duplicate per experiment. For tissue samples, a small piece of about 1 mm3 was transferred into a clean preweighed vial. Samples were lyophilized using a freeze dryer (Christ, 2-4 LDplus). Vials with tissue samples were subsequently weighed to determine the tissue dry weight. Samples were then mixed with nitric acid 65% and heated at 80 °C overnight in the same glass vials closed with a lid carrying a Teflon septum. Samples were then cooled to room temperature and diluted with ultrapure water to a final concentration of 0.475 N nitric acid and transferred to metal-free centrifuge vials (VWR, 89049-172) for subsequent MS analyses. Amounts of metal were measured using an Agilent 7900 ICP-QMS in low-resolution mode, taking natural isotope distribution into account. Sample introduction was achieved with a micronebulizer (MicroMist, 0.2 ml min–1) through a Scott spray chamber. Isotopes were measured using a collision–reaction interface with helium gas (5 ml min–1) to remove polyatomic interferences. Scandium and indium internal standards were injected after inline mixing with the samples to control the absence of signal drift and matrix effects. A mix of certified standards was measured at concentrations spanning those of the samples to convert count measurements to concentrations in the solution. Values were normalized against cell number or tissue dry weight.

Liposomal structures were prepared using the traditional lipid film hydration method. In brief, 100 μl of a stock solution (1 mg ml–1 chloroform) of 18:1 (Δ9-cis) PC (DOPC, Avanti Polar Lipids) was dissolved in 400 μl chloroform and transferred into a round-bottom flask. The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator for 15 min at 200 r.p.m. in a water bath at 37 °C. Afterwards, the lipid film was dried with a vacuum pump overnight. The sample was hydrated with 1 ml of 0.1 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and vortexed every 5 min for 20 min. Liposomes were extruded by passing the suspension through 2 polycarbonate membranes (pore size 0.2 mm) 20 times. For the control experiment, 200 μl of the liposome solution was added into an Eppendorf tube and heated at 37 °C with agitation at 800 r.p.m. Then, 5 μl of an aqueous solution of iron(II) triflate (1.4 mg in 1.5 ml) and 13 μl of 0.1 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5) were added. At t = 0 min 13 μl of an aqueous solution of H2O2 (10 μl H2O2 (30%) in 1 ml) was added. For the Fento-1 experiment, 200 μl of the liposome solution was added to an Eppendorf tube and heated at 37 °C at 800 r.p.m. Then, 13 μl of a 1 mM solution of Fento-1 in DMSO and 5 μl of an aqueous solution of iron(II) triflate (1.4 mg in 1.5 ml) were added. At t = 0 min, 13 μl of an aqueous solution of H2O2 (10 μl H2O2 (30%) in 1 ml) was added. DOPC oxidation was recorded with a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advion Biosciences) as detailed in the section ‘MS-based lipidomics'. Samples were injected at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 7 h and 24 h reaction times.

HT-1080 cells were treated with Fento-1 (10 µM) for 1 h, and lysosome-enriched fractions were isolated using a Lysosome Isolation kit (Abcam, ab234047) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 2 × 107 cells were washed and centrifuged at 600g for 10 min and the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended in lysosome isolation buffer, vortexed and incubated on ice for 2 min. Complete cell disruption was obtained using a dounce homogenizer. After adding lysosome enrichment buffer, the homogenate was centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to the top of a discontinuous gradient density and an ultracentrifugation at 145,000g for 2 h at 4 °C was performed. The lysosome-enriched fraction was present in the top 10% of the gradient volume. For MS-based lipidomics, the lysosomal fraction was mixed with 2 volumes of 1× PBS, vortexed and centrifuged at 18,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, 200 µl of 150 mM sodium bicarbonate was added to the pellet and the sample was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lipidomic analyses were performed on these flash-frozen samples. For western blot analyses, the protein content of the lysosomal-enriched gradient supernatant was quantified using a Qbit 1 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a protein quantification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33212). Equal total protein amounts of total cell extracts and lysosome-enriched extracts were loaded for comparison for western blot analyses.

For comparison of ferroptosis inducers, HT-1080 cells were treated with Fento-1 (in house, 1 µM), erastin (10 µM), RSL3 (100 nM) or iFSP1 (10 µM, Sigma-Aldrich, SML2749) for 24 h. For cotreatment with ferroptosis inhibitors, HT-1080 cells were pretreated with α-tocopherol (100 µM), deferiprone (100 µM) or Lip-1 (10 µM) for 2 h, and then with Fento-1 (1 µM) for 24 h. Dissociated human tumour samples were pretreated with 100 µM α-tocopherol and then with 1 µM Fento-1 for 24 h. PDAC053T cells were treated with 1 µM Fento-1 for 6 h or 24 h. Dissociated mouse tumour samples were counted and processed directly after dissociation and pretreated with α-tocopherol (100 µM) for 2 h and then with Fento-1 (1 µM, 24 h). Cells were subsequently washed with 1× PBS and then with 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Cells were then resuspended in 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The solutions were centrifuged at 12,000 r.p.m. for 10 min and the supernatant was removed. Next, 200 µl of 150 mM sodium bicarbonate was added to the pellet and samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lipidomic analyses were performed on the same day for all technical and biological replicates for a given dataset. For lipidomic analyses, 200 µl cell lysate was spiked with 1.64 μl internal standard lipid mixture containing 300 pmol phosphatidylcholine (PC) 17:0-17:0, 50 pmol phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 17:0-17:0, 50 pmol phosphatidylinositol (PI) 16:0-16:0, 50 pmol phosphatidylserine (PS) 17:0-17:0, 30 pmol phosphatidic acid (PA) 17:0-17:0, 30 pmol phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 30 pmol lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 12:0, 30 pmol lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) 17:1, 30 pmol lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) 17:1 and 30 pmol lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 17:0 and subjected to lipid extraction at 4 °C as previously described57. In brief, the sample was extracted with 1 ml chloroform and methanol (10:1) for 2 h at 4 °C with vigorous shaking in a thermomixer (1,000 r.p.m.). The lower organic phase was collected and dried in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. The remaining aqueous phase was re-extracted with 1 ml chloroform and methanol (2:1) for 1 h at the same temperature and shaking conditions. The lower organic phase was collected and evaporated in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. Lipid extracts were dissolved in 100 μl infusion mixture consisting of 7.5 mM ammonium acetate dissolved in propanol, chloroform and methanol (4:1:2 (v/v/v)). For the in vitro liposome experiments, 1 µl of each reaction mixture taken at different time points was added to 100 μl infusion mixture consisting of 7.5 mM ammonium acetate dissolved in propanol, chloroform and methanol (4:1:2 (v/v/v)) containing 300 pmol PC 17:0-17:0. Samples were analysed by direct infusion in a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advion Biosciences). In brief, 5 µl of sample was infused with the gas pressure and voltage set to 1.25 psi and 0.95 kV, respectively. PC and oxidized PC (PCOx) were detected in the 10:1 extract by positive-ion mode FTMS as protonated adducts by scanning m/z = 580–1,000 Da, at Rm/z = 200 = 280,000 with lock mass activated at a common background (m/z = 680.48022) for 30 s. Every scan is the average of 2 microscans, and the AGC was set to 106 and the maximum ion injection time (IT) was set to 50 ms. PE, oxidized PE (PEOx) and LPE were detected as deprotonated adducts and LPC were detected as acetate adducts in the 10:1 extract by negative-ion mode FTMS by scanning m/z = 420–1,050 Da, at Rm/z = 200 = 280,000 with lock mass activated at a common background (m/z = 529.46262) for 30 s. Every scan is the average of 2 microscans, AGC was set to 106 and the maximum ion IT was set to 50 ms. PI, oxidized PI (PIOx), PS, oxidized PS (PSOx), lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) were detected in the 2:1 extract, by negative-ion mode FTMS as deprotonated ions by scanning m/z = 400–1,100 Da, at Rm/z = 200 = 280,000 with lock mass activated at a common background (m/z = 529.46262) for 30 s. Every scan is the average of 2 microscans, the AGC was set to 106 and the maximum ion IT was set to 50 ms. Annotation of the oxidized phospholipids only details the number of additional oxygen atoms and double bonds present in a given mass and it can potentially refer to several different structures with the same monoisotopic mass. All data were acquired in centroid mode. All lipidomic data were analysed with the lipid identification software LipidXplorer (v.1.2.8; http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R8). Tolerance for MS and identification was set to 2 ppm. Data were normalized against internal standards and total input to the respective lipid species. Lipidomic data were clustered using a correlation distance and Ward linkage, and represented as heat maps of normalized values.

HT-1080 cells were treated with Fento-1 (in-house, 1 or 2 µM, 24 h). Glycerol was quantified using a Glycerol-glo assay (Promega, J3150) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the assay was performed in a 96-well plate and 4,000 cells were plated per well 24 h before the experiment. A standard curve was prepared for each biological experiment and three technical replicates were performed for each condition and each biological replicate. Luminescence signals were recorded using a SpectraMax ID3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Data were exported and analysed using Excel (Microsoft) and Prism software.

Illustrations were created using Fiji 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52n, Prism 10.0.3 and Adobe Illustrator 26.0.2. Illustrations in Figs. 2b and  4 were created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).

Results are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. or s.d. as indicated. For box plots, boxes represent the interquartile range and median, and whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values. Prism (v.10.0.3) software was used to calculate P values using a two-sided Mann–Whitney test, two-sided unpaired t-test, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post-test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or Mantel–Cox log-rank test as indicated. Prism (v.10.0.3) software was used to generate graphical representations of quantifications unless stated otherwise. Sample sizes (n) are indicated in the figure legends and were not predetermined. A minimum of n = 3 independent experiments were performed as a standard, and sample sizes were increased in more complex experiments to ensure reproducibility. Exact P values are indicated in the figures.

Metrics details

Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer1. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses2. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants (* represents ‘any'), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2–(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway.

The canonical RAS protein family consists of three members: HRAS, NRAS and KRAS. Their activity is regulated by binding to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP), corresponding to structural changes in the switch regions and resulting in inactive or active states, respectively. In the GTP-bound active state, RAS proteins form productive interactions with effector proteins, most importantly RAF family members, leading to downstream activation of the MAPK signalling pathway3. The RAS–RAF–MAPK axis controls cell proliferation and is constitutively activated by mutations at different levels of the pathway in most human cancers. Mutations of RAS proteins take place with relatively high frequency at positions 12, 13 and 61, with isoform-biased and tissue-biased patterns. Although KRAS proteins are most frequently mutated on G12 (more than 80%), Q61 mutations are the most common activating event for NRAS (more than 60%), with near exclusivity in NRAS-mutant melanoma (more than 85%)4. After BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations are the second-largest subset of melanoma (20–30% of all cases, corresponding to 50,000 new cases each year in the United States and Europe alone), but there are no targeted therapies approved for this patient population, currently representing a large unmet medical need5. All RAS oncogenic mutations promote a shift towards a higher prevalence of the RAS active state by disrupting GTP hydrolysis, but the extent varies, depending on the specific mutation. These differences can be explained by different biochemical properties (differences in intrinsic hydrolysis rates or nucleotide exchange rates) and conformations that favour effector binding to various degrees and that overall may result in a differential interactome and/or strength of downstream signalling6. Targeting specific RAS-mutant addictions or co-dependencies may represent an alternative to the development of agents that directly engage mutated RAS, although so far, a paucity of such targets has emerged, with no related therapeutics. SHOC2 is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) adaptor protein that is part of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C (SMP) holophosphatase complex, which dephosphorylates RAF at S259 (ref. 7), a critical event that allows RAS–GTP to signal through RAF proteins8. Accordingly, SHOC2 has been causally linked to common RAS–MAPK-driven pathological processes such as cancer and RASopathies9. The structural characterization of the SMP complex10,11,12,13 prompted us to speculate whether the SMP might represent a new therapeutic target for these conditions. In cancer settings, MRAS expression seems to be dispensable for the survival of RAS-mutant cell lines in which SHOC2 is essential, leading to the hypothesis that MRAS is substituted by oncogenic canonical RAS proteins in the SMP14 (https://depmap.org/portal/). However, there is currently no structural evidence for a direct interaction of SHOC2 with canonical RAS proteins, or indications that this complex is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance.

We set out to investigate genetic dependencies associated to three of the most common RAS hotspot mutations, G12C, G12D and Q61R, and to the specific isoforms KRAS and NRAS, using IL3-deprived Ba/F3, a well-established cell line, to model RTK/RAS/MAPK oncogenic addiction in the absence of other confounding background mutations (Fig. 1a). Six isogenic Ba/F3 Cas9-expressing cell lines were engineered to express either KRAS or NRAS mutated on G12C, G12D or Q61R (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Mutant- and isoform-selective growth dependency was confirmed following treatment with available KRAS(G12C) (adagrasib)- or KRAS(G12D) (MRTX1133)-selective inhibitors (Fig. 1b). A genome-wide lentiviral sgRNA library was then used to interrogate the RAS isogenic set for growth dependencies (Fig. 1c). The NRAS(G12C)-expressing line was excluded from the screen, given the rarity of this oncogenic event in human cancer (less than 0.1% of AACR GENIE cases15). Each screen consistently retrieved a small subset of hits, with pan-lethal genes and tumour-suppressor genes scoring across all five cell models as growth suppressors or growth enhancers, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Although a small number of hits was found to be associated with different G12 mutations (G12D or G12C) or RAS isoform (KRAS or NRAS) (Extended Data Fig. 1c), principal component analysis (PCA) indicated a separation that was mainly isoform agnostic and driven by the mutation Q61R or G12C/D (Fig. 1d; PC1 on the x axis). Notably, among the selective G12C/D hits were IGF1R, PTPN11, SHC1 and SOS1, which encode proteins involved in promoting RAS–GTP status (Fig. 1f,g). These findings are consistent with the biochemical properties of RAS(G12C/D), which, unlike RAS(Q61R), retain intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity and rely on upstream RTK input to maintain a constant GTP-active state (Fig. 1g). Leveraging available pharmacological agents targeting IGFR (IGF1R), SHP2 (PTPN11) and SOS1, we validated a higher overall sensitivity of NRAS/KRAS(G12C/D)-expressing cell lines to upstream pathway inhibition through these nodes than for NRAS/KRAS(Q61R)-expressing models (Fig. 1h), indicating deeper MAPK-signalling suppression (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Interestingly, in the case of SOS1 inhibitor treatment, only KRAS(G12C) clearly differentiated from Q61R models, suggesting potential SOS1 compensatory mechanisms in G12D settings. The most important hit retrieved from the screen in NRAS/KRAS(Q61R)-expressing models was SHOC2 (Fig. 1d–f). SHOC2 is a component of the SMP holophosphatase complex and a positive regulator of the RAS–MAPK pathway7. As far as we are aware, no selective pharmacological agents against SHOC2 have yet been described, so we performed sgRNA-mediated SHOC2 knockout, which resulted in more-profound lethality in NRAS/KRAS(Q61)-mutant than in NRAS/KRAS(G12)-mutant Ba/F3 cell lines (Fig. 1i). A further KRAS(Q61H) Ba/F3 line, representing the most-frequent oncogenic mutation on codon 61 of KRAS4, exhibited the same level of dependency to SHOC2 as did Q61R-mutant lines, indicating that these findings are mutant specific and isoform agnostic. Because cancers that have RASQ61* mutations are still largely unaddressed therapeutically, we focused our further investigations on SHOC2.

To verify the relevance of the Ba/F3 screen results for human cancer, we analysed the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) dataset (https://depmap.org/portal/) encompassing gene-dependency scores in more than 1,000 cancer cell lines. As for the Ba/F3 screen, we focused on GTP–GDP cycling HRAS/NRAS/KRAS(G12C/D) versus non-cycling Q61* mutants and looked for selective dependencies associated with each of these groups. Because KRAS is preferentially mutated on codon 12, whereas most NRAS mutations occur on codon 61, the top dependencies returned for G12C/D-expressing and for Q61*-expressing models were KRAS and NRAS, respectively. Beyond that, only a few other significant hits were retrieved: GRB2 and PTPN11 for the G12C/D lines and, notably, SHOC2 for Q61* lines (Fig. 2a,b). Thus, unbiased analysis also identified proteins influencing RAS GDP–GTP cycling, such as GRB2 and SHP2 (PTPN11) to be important for the survival of RAS(G12C/D) models, whereas SHOC2 scored significantly in RAS(Q61*) models, confirming the findings in Ba/F3 cells. Most SHOC2-sensitive models were of cutaneous melanoma (Fig. 2b), a cancer in which NRAS(Q61*) represents a genetically distinct subset of patients comprising about 25% of all melanoma cases and for which no targeted therapies have yet been approved5. To validate the SHOC2 dependency in RAS(Q61*) settings, we knocked down (KD) SHOC2, using inducible short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in nine different cell lines. As controls, we included a non-targeting shRNA (shNT) and an shRNA targeting NRAS or KRAS as a benchmark and to control for pathway dependency. In all NRAS(Q61*) mutants, but not in BRAF(V600E) mutants, melanoma models of SHOC2 KD blunted cell proliferation in colony formation assays (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a) and resulted in MAPK pathway inhibition, as measured by reduced pERK and pMEK levels (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2b), and reduced DUSP5, SPRY4 and EGR1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2e). Similar results were obtained in non-melanoma NRAS(Q61*)-mutant and KRAS(Q61*)-mutant cell models, indicating that the effects observed following SHOC2 KD are not lineage or RAS isoform specific (Fig. 2c,e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Next, we performed in vivo efficacy studies with two different NRAS(Q61*) melanoma xenograft models (MUGMEL2 and IPC298) and found that induced reduction of SHOC2 expression severely impaired tumour growth (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2d). Notably, in both in vitro and in vivo datasets, the extent of the changes produced on cell viability and on RAS/MAPK modulation following SHOC2 KD were similar to those produced by the knockdown of the driver oncogene, NRAS/KRAS mutants. Tumour transcriptome analysis from the efficacy studies revealed a strong correlation and comparable extent of modulation of gene expression between SHOC2 KD and NRAS KD, particularly across RAS/MAPK-regulated genes (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified biological processes related to RAS/MAPK signalling or reflective of cell-cycle or cell-death modulation (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Overall, genetic co-dependencies and target-validation datasets indicate that SHOC2 is crucial for RAS(Q61)-signalling and is a potential therapeutic opportunity in this space.

By using biophysical methods, we and others have previously reported the incorporation of mutant RAS into the SMP complex in place of MRAS which is dispensable for cancer cell survival10,11,12,13. Because the functional relevance of such interactions remains unclear, we aimed to interrogate this with the identification of pharmacological agents that act as protein–protein interaction (PPI) breakers. First, we investigated whether SHOC2 and mutant RAS can form a stable binary interaction in vitro, despite the highly cooperative nature of the ternary SMP assembly16. We did in vitro complex-formation experiments with sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation incubating SHOC2 with either wild-type or Q61R-mutated variants of either NRAS or KRAS proteins. When wild-type NRAS and KRAS were GDP loaded, the proteins were unable to form a larger complex with SHOC2, whereas constitutively GTP-loaded Q61R-mutated forms produced a species with high sedimentation coefficients, consistent with a binary SHOC2–RAS complex accompanied by depletion of both monomeric populations (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). We confirmed the binary interaction of SHOC2 with either NRAS(Q61R) and KRAS(Q61R) proteins using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as an orthogonal method and calculated their affinities with KD values of 11 µM and 12 µM, respectively (Extended Data Table 1). RAS proteins had to be in the active state to make measurable interactions, either loaded with GTP (which was only feasible for mutants with strongly impaired intrinsic hydrolysis) or loaded with non-hydrolysable GTP analogues (GMP–PNP), allowing for cross-comparison of all RAS mutants. Interestingly, under the same assay conditions (GMP–PNP loading), KRAS(G12C), KRAS(G12D) and NRAS(G12D) proteins showed weaker binding to SHOC2, similar to that of the NRAS or KRAS wild-type proteins, whereas KRAS(Q61L) behaved similarly to RAS(Q61R) mutants (a KD of approximately 8 µM). This affinity ranking is consistent with the cancer dependency data presented above and offers further mechanistic insights into the preferential requirement for SHOC2 in RAS(Q61)-mutant cell models, in addition to the foundational observation that such mutants in cells are in a persistent GTP-bound state, which is a fundamental requirement for SHOC2 recruitment to the RAS–PP1 complex10. The observation that low KD values are obtained in GTP versus the GMP–PNP state for the Q61R mutants further highlights the importance of the active state for the binary interaction and hints at a potentially tighter binding of the G12 mutants in a cellular context. To gain a deeper understanding of the SHOC2–NRAS(Q61R) interaction, we determined an X-ray co-structure at 2.53 Å resolution (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Table 2). NRAS(Q61R) interacts with the concave surface of the SHOC2 solenoid in a region previously identified in SMP complexes. Similar to the MRAS–SHOC2 interaction, NRAS(Q61R) leverages residues in the switch 1 (SWI) and switch 2 (SWII) regions to engage SHOC2 residues within LRR 1–9. Four salt bridges, six intermolecular hydrogen bonds and key areas of hydrophobic interactions around NRAS M67 and I34 stabilize the protein–protein interaction. The overall conformation of NRAS(Q61R) aligns with that of MRAS within SMP, including the active SWI–SWII pose. However, we now find that the RAS molecule pivots around the SWI–SHOC2 contact area, resulting in the backbone of SWII residing closer to the SHOC2 interface than in the ternary SMP complex (Fig. 3c). We observed several hydrogen bonds originating in SWI or SWII that are enabled by the increased proximity of SWII and parts of SWI to SHOC2 (Fig. 3d). The NRAS SWI makes multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with four arginine residues of LRR 3–8 of SHOC2 (Arg177, 223, 288 and 292). Furthermore, the oncogenic mutation NRAS R61 forms a direct hydrogen bond with SHOC2 T264, unlike the corresponding R71 of MRAS, which coordinates water molecules to interact with the N265 and S287 of SHOC2. An isoform-dependent difference in an adjacent residue (NRAS Y64 or MRAS F74) may also contribute, through the tyrosine-enabled hydrogen bond to SHOC2 N265. The adjacent NRAS E63 also mediates a hydrogen bond with SHOC2 T242 and enforces the R61 conformation by means of an intramolecular salt bridge. Overall, key interaction residues and surfaces for the NRAS(Q61R)–SHOC2 binary PPI are largely conserved when compared with the MRAS-containing ternary complex. Thus, we reasoned that identification of chemical matter binding to the RAS-interacting region of SHOC2 should allow for the disruption of any SHOC2–RAS interaction, preventing holophosphatase complex formation. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence demonstrate a stable binary interaction, mutation and nucleotide state dependent, between SHOC2 and the oncogenic NRAS Q61R. These findings prompted us to investigate whether targeting this interface can interfere with SHOC2–RAS function.

Ligandability assessment shows that the surface of SHOC2 is mostly flat and the RAS PPI site on its concave side is the sole hydrophobic patch (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Methods). The patch, however, has a limited buried surface, several charged residues and flexible side chains, yielding an overall moderate ligandability prediction based on the CAVIAR descriptors17. To enable high-throughput screening approaches, we established a robust and sensitive time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based competitive binding assay between SHOC2 and GTP-loaded NRAS(Q61R) (details in Methods) and tested around 320,000 small molecules from the Novartis screening deck. The screen yielded 3,353 primary hits (hit rate at 1.05% obtained with a cut-off at 25% competitive effect for hit calling), 881 of which could be confirmed by dose–response curves with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 0.2 µM to 100 µM. The hits were further assessed for direct SHOC2 binding by SPR. From this validation, we identified compound 1 (a diastereomeric mixture at carboxylic acid) as an NRAS(Q61R) competitive binder with single-digit micromolar affinity to SHOC2 (Table 1; TR-FRET IC50 = 6.19 µM; SPR KD = 7.89 µM). Protein-observed 2D NMR experiments provided further orthogonal validation, with chemical shift perturbations at SHOC2 M173 and M219 (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Separation of the diastereomeric mixture of 1 resulted in single isomers 2 and 3, which showed differentiation in the TR-FRET assay (Table 1). To guide our compound optimization, we did another unbiased screen of macrocyclic peptides to map the ligandable pockets on SHOC2 (details in Methods). We identified and validated peptide 4 as a sub-micromolar SHOC2 binder and disruptor of the SHOC2–NRAS(Q61R) interaction (Table 1). With this higher-affinity binder in hand, we obtained an X-ray co-crystal structure with SHOC2 at 1.72 Å resolution (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Table 2). In agreement with the ligandability analysis, peptide 4 occupies the only putative ligandable cavity identified on SHOC2 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 3e). The peptide makes several hydrophobic interactions but also specific polar interactions, such as salt bridges (with R177, R200 and R223) and hydrogen bonds (with D175, E155 and Q269; Extended Data Fig. 3e). The peptide is in the vicinity of M173 and M219, which showed chemical shift perturbations in 2D NMR by compound 1, so we inferred that compound 1 and peptide 4 occupy the same binding patch. Informed by the carboxylic acid interactions of peptide 4 with the side chains of R223 and Q269 (Extended Data Fig. 3f), we explored the structure–activity relationship of compounds 1–3 with a deconstruction of the biaryl moiety while keeping the carboxylic acid moiety, leading to the enantiomers (S)-5 and (R)-5. With the sub-micromolar SHOC2 binder (R)-5 in hand, we could determine the first, to our knowledge, X-ray co-crystal structure of SHOC2 complexed with a small molecule. The structure confirmed experimentally the overlapping binding sites of peptide 4, (R)-5 and NRAS(Q61R) in the preferred ligandable pocket (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Methods). The carboxylic acid moiety of compound (R)-5 interacts with R223 and Q269, and the benzo[d]oxazol-2(3H)-one moiety is caged thoroughly in the protein surface, satisfying several hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4b). Because compound (R)-5 carries a suboptimal non-productive linker and shows chemical instability, we next aimed to redesign the central part of the molecule. This led to compound 6, which has a more ligand-efficient simplified linker and 10-fold higher potency in the SPR and TR-FRET assays (Fig. 4c and Table 1). To validate the binding specificity of compound 6, guided by the X-ray co-crystal structure of (R)-5, we designed a SHOC2 mutant that is resistant to compound 6. We introduced a Gly-to-Ala mutation at position 290 in the putative binding site, reasoning that the side chain of A290 should clash with compound 6 but not interfere with either SHOC2 folding or the RAS interaction (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Direct measurements using differential scanning fluorimetry assay (DSF) confirmed the protein folding of the SHOC2 G290A mutant (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The interaction with NRAS(Q61R) was confirmed by SPR (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Conversely, the single amino acid change was sufficient to fully abolish compound 6 activity in a TR-FRET-based SHOC2(G290A)–NRAS(Q61R) binding assay. The interaction could still be disrupted by untagged wild-type SHOC2, confirming the sensitivity of the assay (Extended Data Fig. 4d). As another tool to control for compound 6-specific activity, we synthetized its enantiomer, compound 7, which showed impaired activity on the SHOC2(WT)–NRAS(Q61R) PPI despite having similar physicochemical properties (Table 1). In summary, parallel hit-finding campaigns on peptides and small molecules followed by structure-based optimization enabled the identification of compound 6 as a potent SHOC2–RAS PPI disruptor suitable for cellular characterization.

Source Data

In cells, compound 6 was first tested in a PPI NanoBiT-based assay, in which it induced selective displacement of the SHOC2(WT)–NRAS(Q61mut) interaction, consistent with in vitro TR-FRET data (Fig. 4d). A noticeable shift in compound 6 activity was observed when transitioning from in vitro to cell-based studies. This difference can be reasonably attributed to the suboptimal ability of the compound to permeate cells, as measured in the MDCK-LE permeability assay (Table 1). Importantly, no activity was measured with either compound 6 in the SHOC2(G290A)–NRAS(Q61mut) NanoBiT assay or with compound 7 in the SHOC2(WT)–NRAS(Q61mut) NanoBiT assay (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). Next, we tested compound 6 in therapeutically relevant NRAS(Q61mut) melanoma cells, finding that it induced dose-dependent inhibition of RAS oncogenic signalling through a decrease in MEK and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4e). Notably, this effect was sustained over time and was specific to RAS(mut) settings, because BRAF(mut) melanoma cells treated under the same conditions did not show any pERK or pMEK inhibition (Fig. 4f). RAS–GTP loading was found to be unaffected by compound 6 treatment in either cell model (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Interestingly, increased levels of inhibited CRAF (phospho-S259), reflective of diminished SMP activity, were observed following SHOC2–NRAS PPI disruption with compound 6, which was consistent with pERK inhibition (Fig. 4g). To gain a broader overview of compound 6 activity, we performed global transcriptome analysis of NRAS(Q61R) cells treated with compounds 6 and 7 (Extended Data Fig. 4g). SHOC2 inhibition by compound 6 led to a dose-dependent and time-dependent modulation of RAS/MAPK-associated genes, such as DUSP4, DUSP5, EGR1, SPRY4 and FOSL1 (Fig. 4i), and identification of gene signatures commonly associated with the use of RAS/MAPK inhibitors, indicating changes in this pathway, as well as in processes relating to the cell cycle, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammation and metabolism (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Under the same treatment conditions, compound 7 produced no significant changes in the transcriptome of NRAS(Q61R) cells, indicating compound 6-specific activity (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). Next, we investigated the effects of SHOC2 pharmacological inhibition in 3D proliferation assays. Twice-a-week treatment with compound 6 suppressed the cell proliferation of RAS(Q61L), but not of BRAF(V600E), melanoma cell lines (Fig. 4h). Finally, we used compound 6 to investigate pharmacologically SHOC2 dependency in different RAS mutant and wild-type conditions. As a control, compound 7 was used and found to be inert in all cell models tested (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Conversely, acute SHOC2 inhibition with compound 6 downregulated MAPK signalling in all RAS mutant settings, including Q61L, G12D and G12C mutant conditions (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Furthermore, the introduction of inducible SHOC2 knockdown using shRNAs produced similar results to the treatment with compound 6 in these specific cell models (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Interestingly, SHOC2 inhibition caused only minor effects on MAPK signalling in EGFRΔex19 cells used as surrogates for conditions with wild-type RAS in a highly active state, and had no detectable effect in wild-type RTK/RAS or BRAF(V600E) mutant cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Next, we investigated the effect of compound 6 on the proliferation of cell models suitable for 3D growth. Prolonged inhibition of SHOC2 resulted in anti-proliferative effects across all RAS mutant models but none in any of the wild-type RAS settings, including a condition of RAS-induced active state (in EGFRΔex19 cells). Notably, in the RAS mutant set, the highest SHOC2 dependency was observed in Q61-mutant conditions, with G12D and G12C next (Extended Data Fig. 5e). These findings are consistent with previous results in Ba/F3 isogenic models (Fig. 1i). Altogether, we observed that SHOC2 regulates MAPK signalling in conditions of high RAS activity (GTP binding). The extent of cell-proliferation dependency is determined by the degree of intrinsically sustained level of this active state (with Q61* having a greater impact than G12D/C), because this is the primary factor determining SHOC2 interaction with RAS.

Taken together, our data provide to our knowledge the first preclinical demonstration, from genetic evidence to tool-compound discovery, that targeting the SHOC2–RAS interaction represents an actionable therapeutic modality in RAS-mutant cancers, orthogonal to RAS-focused approaches.

The RAS-targeting agents currently in the clinic have resistance mechanisms that hinder long-lasting anti-tumour responses18,19. The early adaptive mechanisms described until now involve increased RAS protein levels and activation20,21, underlining the need for orthogonal approaches to RAS-centric therapies to drive deeper and longer-lasting anti-tumour responses. Previous studies have shown that oncogenic RAS mutations are not all equal in terms of biochemical properties and strength of signalling, implying that RAS dependencies are better studied at a mutant-specific level. To this end, RAS-mutant isogenic cell panels have been used for characterization purposes22,23,24. Here we performed the first, to our knowledge, unbiased genome-wide gene-inactivation screen in a RAS-mutant isogenic set that led to the identification of mutant-specific dependencies for G12C/D and Q61R mutated codons. Some of the dependencies identified for G12 mutants, namely SOS1, SHP2 and IGFR1, are pharmacologically actionable, so we could demonstrate with the respective inhibitors a RAS(G12*) preferential killing over RAS(Q61*). Interestingly, such results find confirmation and further support the rationale for therapeutic approaches using agents targeting SOS1, SHP2 and RTKs in KRAS(G12C)-mutant cancers. Conversely, NRAS(Q61*), which represents the predominant RAS oncogenic alteration in melanoma, thyroid cancer and haematological malignancies, remains an indication space that has been less-successfully explored by targeted therapies. RAF inhibitors have shown preferential activity in RAS(Q61*) settings, both preclinically and in the clinic25,26, yet they have fallen short of producing long-term benefits in NRAS(Q61*) melanoma patients, as single agents and in combination with MEK inhibitors, probably because they have a narrow therapeutic index that limits efficacious dosing26,27,28. These outcomes were foreshadowed by preclinical studies using GEM models, for which depletion of genes in canonical RAS/MAPK resulted in early lethality29. The emerging pan-RAS inhibitor under clinical evaluation showed promising tumour responses but also safety flags characteristic of MAPK inhibitors and therefore might eventually have the same limitation. Furthermore, most advanced pan-RAF agents, such as belvarafenib and LXH254, showed non-uniform inhibition across the three RAF isoforms (CRAF > BRAF > ARAF), which can also contribute to the lack of sustained responses and the emergence of resistance in the clinic26,30. SHOC2, as part of the SMP complex, acts as a pan-RAF activator with dephosphorylating activity towards all three RAF isoforms7, and its depletion in adult mice is well tolerated31. Interestingly, SHOC2, but none of the individual RAF isoforms, scored well in RAS(Q61*) settings in our Ba/F3 screen, highlighting how SHOC2 represents an interesting bottleneck, capturing the isoform redundancy present at RAS and RAF levels. Follow-up analysis of cancer cell-lines dependencies and direct in vitro and in vivo genetic validation confirmed SHOC2 dependency in RAS(Q61*)-driven tumours with effects on a par with RAS targeting, providing the proof of concept for a new RAS-orthogonal therapeutic opportunity. Previous studies have provided structural insights for the SMP complex, opening attractive drug-discovery opportunities9,32,33. However, unlike SHOC2, MRAS expression is dispensable for cancer sustenance in RAS(Q61*) models, indicating that SMP might not be the right complex to target in this context. Unfortunately, no structure of SKP (with KRAS), SHP (with HRAS) or SNP (with NRAS) has been determined so far. Targeting the SK/H/NP complex at one of the binary interfaces should generally prevent cooperative ternary-complex formation, but studies have inconsistently reported the stability of the binary complex permutations. Furthermore, PP1C forms numerous interactions outside the SMP through protein regions overlapping with the SHOC2 and MRAS binding sites34, so targeting the PP1C–SHOC2 or PP1C–MRAS interface from the PP1C side will probably result in off-target effects. This leaves the SHOC2–RAS interface as an attractive option, and our results provide evidence for an underreported stable SHOC2–RAS(Q61*) binary interaction measured by several orthogonal assays and detailed by a high-resolution X-ray co-structure. Crucially, we confirmed that, despite small structural rearrangements, the surface of SHOC2 that engages RAS remains essentially unchanged. Taken together, these findings support a strategy of pursuing SHOC2 binders at the RAS interface site, leveraging the stable SHOC2–RAS interaction as a key tool for efficient identification of preferred molecular binders to SHOC2. Thus, the biological results showed potential for targeting SHOC2 in NRAS(Q61*) contexts and the solved structures offer the mechanistic validation and means for drug discovery. Despite growing interest in this target, no small molecules that bind to SHOC2 have yet been reported. Even more broadly, although several LRR-containing proteins have relevant roles in disease, no direct-LRR low-molecular-weight binders have been successfully developed, highlighting the unprecedented nature of these targets. Despite the challenging landscape of SHOC2's protein surface, we were able to identify and validate a small-molecule SHOC2 binder that could be further optimized towards higher ligand efficiency. Optimization was guided by structural knowledge from X-ray co-crystal structures of the cyclic peptide 4 and small molecule (R)-5, which led to the more-potent small molecule 6 with consistent biochemical, biophysical and cellular activity providing an attractive rational and structure-based entry to drug discovery. The current ligand-efficient and soluble chemotype offers a clear path for a compound-optimization strategy focusing on the improvement of cellular and pharmacokinetic properties to enable future in vivo studies. Overall, our SHOC2 tool molecule and its in-depth characterization opens a path to new therapeutic possibilities in the disease field of altered RAS/MAPK signalling. In principle, SHOC2-targeting agents should display activity in conditions in which RAS proteins (including MRAS) are persistently GTP loaded and used, for instance to treat RASopathies. In preclinical cancer studies, SHOC2 depletion synergizes with agents causing, as a secondary effect, RAS–GTP induction, such as MEK31,35 or KRAS(G12C) inhibitors19,36. In the clinic, positive selection of RAS(Q61*) mutations (including on MRAS) have emerged as a putative resistance mechanism in patients treated with KRAS(G12C) inhibitors18,19. Finally, increased SMP activity has been also causally linked to YAP-mediated adaptive resistance to KRAS(G12C) inhibition37. Collectively, these reports highlight the potential for SHOC2-targeted therapies beyond NRAS(Q61*) melanoma, in RASopathies or in other cancers as a combination partner. Future thorough integrated efficacy and safety studies will be essential to establish whether these avenues might lead to therapeutic benefits.

The mouse Ba/F3 parental cell line was obtained from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 2003. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1940 GlutaMAX medium (ThermoFisher, 61870-036) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Corning, 35-015-CV), 2 mM sodium pyruvate (BioConcept Amimed, 5-60F00-H), 10 mM HEPES (BioConcept, 5-31F00-H) and 5 ng ml−1 recombinant murine IL-3 (Life Technologies, PMC0035). Derived Ba/F3 KRAS and NRAS mutants have been cultured in IL-3 withdrawal. Mel Juso, IPC298 and SKMEL30 cell lines were obtained from the DMSZ.

The HepG2 was maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Corning, 35-015-CV). All cell lines were cultured according to the standard instructions provided by the suppliers (DSMZ, CellBank Australia, ATCC, Invitrogen, RIKEN and NCI).

Stable lines expressing SHOC2, NRAS non-targeting shRNAs were generated by lentiviral infection. The lentivirus production was performed first using HEK293FT cells. Cells were seeded in T175 cell-culture flasks and transfected with 12 µg pVPR-Gag-Pol, 4.8 µg pMD2-VSV-G and 1 µg of a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA using Mirus TransIT (Mirus, MIR2700). The virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered using 0.45-µm syringe filters 48 h later and was subsequently used for transduction of cancerous cell lines. Then, 24 h after infection, cells were selected with puromycin (Sigma, P9620).

The shRNA Dox-inducible constructs were generated by cloning shRNA into a pLKO-tetON-puro backbone (Addgene, 21915) using AgeI or EcoRI restriction sites. The target sequences for the different shRNAs are shRNA SHOC2-169012 (GCTTGAGTCACCATGAGTAGT), shRNA SHOC2-169009 (CTGACTCTCTTGATAACTTGA), shRNA NRAS (CCATGAGAGACCAATACATGA) and shRNA non-targeting (GGATAATGGTGATTGAGATGG).

Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, pelleted and snap frozen at −80 °C. Whole-cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with a PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Sigma, 4906845001) and cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Sigma, 4693159001).

Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23225). Samples were normalized for protein content, denatured by the addition of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad, 1610747) and boiling for 5 min, and then loaded on Criterion TGX 4–15% Precast gel (Bio-Rad, 5671085). Proteins were transferred to Trans-Blot Turbo Midi Nitrocellulose Transfer Packs membrane (Bio-Rad, 1704159) using the Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad, 1704150). All membranes were blocked with 5% milk (Sigma, 70166) and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Immunoblots were imaged using the FUSION FX7 imaging system (VILBER), and densitometry analysis was done using its integrated quantification software.

All antibodies were commercially sourced and used according to manufacturer instructions. NRAS antibody was purchased from Calbiochem (ref. OP25). RAS antibody was purchased from Abcam (Ab108602). SHOC2 (53600), Phospho-c-Raf Ser259 (9421), GFP (2956), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), Thr202/Tyr204 (4370), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (9102), phospho-MEK1/2 Ser217/221 (9154), phospho-Akt Thr308 (9275), phospho-Akt Ser473 (9271), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein Ser235/236 (2211), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein Ser240/244 (Ref. 2215), phospho-IGF-I receptor β Tyr1131 (3021), IGF-I receptor β (9750), Cas9 HRP conjugate (97982), HRP-linked mouse IgG (7076) and HRP-linked rabbit IgG (7074) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The FLAG HRP conjugate (A8592), vinculin (V9131) and α-tubulin (T6199) antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Levels of active GTP-loaded RAS were determined using a RAS activation assay biochem kit (Cytoskeleton, BK008). Mel Juso and A347 cells were treated with 30 µM of compound 6 or an equivalent volume of DMSO for 2 h and 4 h. Cells were lysed following the manufacturer's instructions. Pull-down was performed with 400 µg of lysate mixed with 30 µl of Raf-RBD beads and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C before western blots.

Murine Ba/F3 cells were primarily transduced with a lentiviral Cas9 construct expression pNGx_CMV_FLAG-Cas9. Cas9-positive cells were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunoblotting. Ba/F3-Cas9 cells were subsequently stably transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) EGFP-T2A-FLAG -KRAS G12C, G12D, Q61R, Q61H or NRAS G12C, G12D and Q61R. All Ba/F3 transfections were done by electroporation. For each transfection, 2 million cells were collected, pelleted and washed in PBS without Mg2+ or Ca2+. Washed cells were then resuspended in 100 µl of buffer R per sample and distributed to each DNA dilution containing 10 µg of related plasmid. Following the manufacturer's instructions, electroporation was done using a NEON station set-up of 1635 V, 20 ms, 1 pulse for each sample. Cells were then left to recover overnight in six-well plates filled with pre-warmed media. Then, 48 h after electroporation, the medium was replaced with selection medium containing 600 µg ml−1 neomycin for Ba/F3-Cas9 and 600 µg ml−1 neomycin and 20 µg ml−1 blasticidin for all KRAS- or NRAS-expressing mutants. During generation, cells were kept in the presence of 5 ng ml−1 recombinant IL-3. Validation of the KRAS- or NRAS-expressing lines was done following IL-3 withdrawal, to ensure the dependency of the cells on oncogene expression.

In the genome-wide isogenic screen, each of the previously engineered murine Ba/F3 cells expressing Cas9 and a single mutation in either KRAS (G12C, G12D, Q61R or Q61H) or NRAS (G12C, G12D or Q61R), as well as the control line Ba/F3 wt-Cas9, were expanded in the relevant medium and infected with either pool 1 or pool 2 of the murine genome-wide sgRNA library (Cellecta mCRISPR v.1 pool1 and pool2)38. Then, 24 h after infection, selection with 1 µg ml−1 puromycin occurred. Ba/F3 cells expressing Cas9 and Ba/F3 transduced with the KRAS or NRAS mutants were passaged in medium supplemented (or depleted) with recombinant murine IL-3. Next, 14 days after infection, the surviving cells were subjected to sample collection (duplicates) and genomic DNA preparation for deep sequencing. Raw sequencing reads were aligned using Bowtie39 with no mismatches allowed and counts were generated. Differential sgRNA representation was calculated using the DESeq2 package40. For gene-based hit calling, the sgRNAs were ranked by the robust z-score, and the statistical significance was calculated for each gene enriched towards higher rank (RSA up) and lower rank (RSA down) using the Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) algorithm41.

The previously engineered murine Ba/F3 cell line expressing Cas9 and a single mutation in either KRAS (G12C, G12D, Q61R or Q61H) or NRAS (G12C, G12D or Q61R) were infected with either non-targeting/control sgRNA (5′ CRISPR RNA sequence: GCGAGGTATTCGGCTCCGCG) or SHOC2 sgRNA (5′ CRISPR RNA sequence: CAGGCCAAGGCGATTTAAAC). After one day of antibiotic selection, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in growth medium. The viability of the cells was assessed two days after seeding by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G7572), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To evaluate screening hits in DepMap, Ceres scores from release 22Q2 were downloaded from the DepMap portal (https://depmap.org/portal/) and mean scores for each gene were calculated between cell lines bearing aberrations in G12 versus Q61 residues of HRAS, KRAS and NRAS. Statistics were calculated using t-tests corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Cells were seeded in six-well plates and allowed to attach overnight in growth medium. They were then treated with 100 ng ml−1 doxycycline hydrochloride (Fisher Bioreagent, BP26535) for 10–15 d. During the assay, the cell medium was renewed every three days with doxycycline. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 20% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed with water and stained with crystal violet for 30 min. The cells were then washed with water, dried and scanned. Crystal violet was then dissolved in 10% acetic acidic for 15 min. The solution was diluted 1:4 in acetic acidic and transferred to a 96-well plate in triplicate for quantification. The absorbance was read at a wavelength of 590 nm with a plate reader (BertholdTech Mithras).

Cells were seeded (in sextuplicate) in ultralow attachment microplates from Corning (384-well plate, transparent round bottom, 3830) in growth medium containing 10% FCS, then centrifuged for 3 min at 200g and allowed to form spheroids or aggregates for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 30 µM of compound 6 or DMSO and transferred in an Incucyte SX5 live-cell analysis system (Satorius, Essen Bioscience), placed inside a conventional tissue-culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The aggregates or spheroids were imaged every six hours for three weeks at a magnification of ×10. During the whole assay, the growth medium containing DMSO or compounds was renewed twice per week. Images were analysed using the Incucyte Spheroid Analysis Software Module (Sartorius, Essen Bioscience, 9600-0019) in which virtual masks were created to delineate the spheroids. The area of each spheroid for each time point was generated. The radius and the volume of the spheroids were calculated from the spheroid area (radius = √(area/π); volume = 4/3 × π × radius3). The volume data were normalized to the initial volume of each spheroid.

Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen Rneasy kit (Qiagen, 74104) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using Quantitec PCR MasterMix multiplex (Qiagen, 204643) on a QuantStudio 6 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Each qPCR reaction was performed in triplicate, using 10 ng RNA per reaction. The results were analysed using the 2 − ΔΔCt method and standardized with Actin B. All specific qPCR primers were purchased from Invitrogen (TaqMan assay): SHOC2 (Hs00201309_m1), NRAS (Hs00180035_m1), SPRY4 (Hs00229610_m1), EGFR1 (Hs00152928_m1), DUSP5 (Hs00244839_m1) and DUSP6 (Hs01044001_m1).

Total RNA from cell lines or tumours was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Minikit. Sequencing was done using the NovaSeq 6000 platform (2 × 101 base pair reads). For the IPC-298 cell line, Illumina NovaSeq control software v.1.6.0, RTA v.3.4.4, BCL2FASTQ v.2.20.0.422 and FASTQC v.0.11.7 were used. For the Mel Juso cell line, Illumina NovaSeq control software v.1.8.1, RTA v.3.4.4, BCL2FASTQ v.2.20.0.422 and FASTQC v.0.11.9 were used. Transcript alignment and quantification were performed using PISCES v.2018.04.112 and referenced to the hg38 human genome. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (ref. 40). In the IPC-298 cell line, for each of the four shRNAs (two shRNA targeting SHOC2, one shRNA targeting NRAS and one non-targeting shRNA), doxycycline treatment was contrasted with no doxycycline. Pre-ranked gene-set enrichment analysis was performed for each contrast using the R package fgsea with signed P-values (sign(log2(FC)) × –log10(P-value)) as ranks. Tested gene sets were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). The following pathways were tested for enrichment: MEK_UP.V1_UP, KRAS_SIGNALING_DN, EGFR_UP.V1_UP, KEGG_CELL_CYCLE, HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS and HALLMARK_G2M, and FDR corrected P-values were calculated. Differential expression analysis for compound treatments 6 and 7 at 4 h and at 24 h at concentrations of 30 µM and 100 µM in the Mel Juso cell line was performed using the R package edgeR. Each compound × time × concentration group was contrasted with a matched control. Gene-set enrichment was calculated as described above on all Hallmark pathways, and FDR correction to P-values was calculated. Figures and fgsea analysis were created with R v.4.1.0 using the R packages fgsea v.1.18.0, ggplot2 v.3.3.6, cowplot v.1.1.1 and ggpubr v.0.4.0.

Xenograft studies were performed at Novartis and strictly adhered to Novartis BioMedical Research Animal Care and Use Committee protocols and regulations. Studies were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of Basel Stadt, Switzerland, and are in strict adherence to the Swiss Federal Animal Welfare Act and Ordinance. Mice were kept under optimal hygiene conditions in individually ventilated cages under 12 h:12 h dark:light conditions and controlled temperature (20–24 °C) and humidity (45–65%) with access to sterilized food and water ad libitum. Subcutaneous tumours were induced by injecting cells in HBSS containing 50% BD matrigel in the flank of female athymic Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu-homozygous nude mice (Charles River; MugMel2_shNT, MugMel2_shNRAS, MugMel2_shSHOC2, 6 × 106) or female and male C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid mice (Taconic; IPC298_shNT, IPC298_shNRAS, IPC298_shSHOC2 (169009) and IPC298_shSHOC2 (169012); 10 × 106). To induce shRNA KD, animals received either daily doxycycline treatments (Sigma Aldrich; 25 mg kg−1, once a day, orally) or were fed ad libitum with doxycycline-spiked food (Sigma Aldrich; 625 mg per kg diet). For efficacy studies, doxycycline treatment was started when the average tumour size reached approximately 200–300 mm3. Tumour size was measured twice weekly by calipers, and body weights were recorded twice weekly. Tumour size was calculated using the formula (length × width2) × π/6 mm3. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Animals were killed at the relevant time point, after 2–3 weeks of treatment. Tumour samples for biomarker analyses were collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at −80 °C until further processing.

DNA sequence coding for the G domains of different RAS variants (amino acids 1–169) were inserted in a plasmid that allowed protein expression in Escherichia coli under control of the T7 promoter. For biotinylated proteins, BirA ligase was coexpressed with the gene of interest in the presence of 1 mM biotin. Expression was induced by 0.5 mM IPTG and performed at 18 °C overnight. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 2 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and 40 U ml−1 Turbonuclease (Sigma)). Cells were lysed with high-pressure homogenizer (Avestin Emulsiflex C3) and the lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 40,000g for 40 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysate was loaded on Ni-Sepharose HP (Cytiva). Beads were washed and the protein was eluted with a 5–200 mM imidazole gradient in IMAC buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP and 10% glycerol). The fusion-tag of the eluted protein was cleaved overnight at 4 °C by either His-tagged HRV 3C or TEV protease. Cleaved protein was reloaded onto the Ni-NTA resin (reverse-IMAC step) and flow-through containing the target protein was collected. The protein was concentrated with a 10 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration system (Millipore) and loaded on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg size-exclusion column pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM TCEP). Fractions containing the protein of interested were pooled, concentrated with a 10 kDa molecular-weight cut-off ultrafiltration system and snap frozen. Nucleotide exchange was performed by incubating the RAS proteins during 1 h at room temperature with a 24-fold molar excess of nucleotide (either GMPPNP (Jena Bioscience) or GDP (Sigma)) in the presence of 25 mM EDTA. The mixture buffer was then exchanged using a PD-10 column (Cytiva) against nucleotide loading buffer (40 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 mM ZnCl2). A fresh 24-fold molar excess of nucleotide was again added. Then, 10 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was added to samples containing GMP=PNP. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, MgCl2 was added to a concentration of 30 mM.

DNA sequences coding for different SHOC2 variants (for avi-tagged, also SHOC2 amino acids 93–582; for His-tagged, SHOC2 FL and G290A) were inserted in a plasmid that enabled generation of recombinant baculovirus according to the Bac-to-Bac system from Invitrogen. After virus addition to SF21 insect cells, expression was performed during 96 h at 27 °C. For biotinylated proteins, BirA ligase was coexpressed with the gene of interest in the presence of 1 mM biotin. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and 40 U ml−1 TurboNuclease (Sigma)). Cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 40,000g for 40 min at 4 °C. Clarified extract was loaded on a HisTrap HP 5 ml column (Cytiva). The column was washed and the protein was eluted with a 20–300 mM imidazole gradient in IMAC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol). Eluted protein was dialysed against dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP and 10% glycerol) and cleaved overnight at 4 °C by His-tagged HRV 3C protease. Cleaved protein was reloaded on a HisTrap column (reverse-IMAC step) and the flow-through containing the target protein was collected. The protein was concentrated with a 30 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration system (Millipore) and loaded on a Superdex 200 pg size-exclusion column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 10% glycerol). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, concentrated using an ultrafiltration system and snap frozen. For assays requiring the poly-histidine tag, protein samples were prepared omitting the HRV 3C cleavage and reverse-IMAC steps.

The sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method was used for crystallization of all SHOC2 complexes. SHOC2–NRAS Q61R co-complex crystals were obtained by mixing NRAS Q61R (1–168) and SHOC2 (80–582) in a 1:1.2 molar ratio at a 15 mg ml−1 final concentration. The protein mixture solution was mixed 1:1 with 0.2 µl of well solution (0.1 M Hepes pH 7 and 15% PEG 4000) and incubated at room temperature. Crystals were cryoprotected using the crystallization solution with the addition of 20% glycerol followed by flash-freezing directly into liquid nitrogen. The SHOC2 peptide crystals were obtained by first incubating SHOC2 80–582 and peptide in a 1:1.5 ratio at a final concentration of 14 mg ml−1 SHOC2. Next, 50 mM stock of peptide in DMSO was mixed with the protein solution in storage buffer resulting in 0.65% DMSO in the protein–ligand solution. This solution was mixed, incubated briefly and then mixed 1:1 with well solution (0.05 M Hepes pH 7.5, 35% v/v pentaerythritol propoxylate 5/4 PO/OH (PP 5/4 PO/OH) and 0.2 M KCl) and incubated at 4 °C. Crystals were cryoprotected by adding 2 µl of well solution supplemented with 20% glycerol and 325 µM peptide in 0.65% DMSO directly onto the existing drop. Crystals were then collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

To produce the maximum quantity of high-quality crystals for micro-seeding, we manually refined the original condition for production of SHOC2–peptide crystals. A gradient of pH/buffering agent versus PP 5/4 PO/OH concentration (15–40% v/v PP 5/4 PO/OH; pH range of 5.5–9 with 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 5.5, 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 50 mM HEPES pH 6.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5 and 50 mM Bicine pH 9.0) in a 24-well plate was set with identical protein and ligand conditions in a 2 µl drop. One condition (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl and 40% PP 5/4 PO/OH) resulted in many large crystals. To produce micro-seeds for apo SHOC2 (amino acids 80-582), we first confirmed that crystals with the new condition diffracted in the same space group by collecting two crystals without further cryoprotection and collecting data in an identical way to the original structure. Wells containing many of these crystals were collected for micro-seeding by adding 10 µl of well solution onto the 2 µl drop. After gentle mixing with a pipette, the solution was aspirated into a microtube containing a seed bead (Hampton research, HR2-320). Next, 40 μl of well solution was used to further dilute the solution in the same tube. Following the manufacturer's instructions, the tube was vortexed for 3 min to break up the crystals. Then, 450 µl of well solution was added to further dilute the microseeds. Serial dilutions of this stock (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1,000) were produced using well solution and each dilution was used as the well solution and mixed 1:1 with a stock of SHOC2 80-582 (14 mg ml−1) in a 24-well plate. Multiple dilutions of seed stock yielded usable crystals, and the 1:1,000 was selected for collection without further cryoprotection. Data collection and molecular replacement using an identical workflow revealed an apo SHOC2 structure with one copy of SHOC2 in the asymmetric unit similar to the SHOC2–peptide structure (data not shown). Because the crystal contacts in the P212121 space group allowed more room for ligand binding at the SHOC2 binding site, we soaked solutions of (R)-5 into these SHOC2 apo crystals to obtain a suitable dataset.

All spectra were acquired at a temperature of 310 K using a 600-MHz Bruker Avance NEO equipped with a QCI cryo-probe. SOFAST-HMQC42 spectra of 13C methyl methionine-labelled SHOC2 (80–582) were acquired in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and 10% D2O with 11.1 μM DSS at a protein concentration of 35 μM. Data were processed using NMRPipe43:

The dissociation constant for binding of compound 1 to SHOC2(80–582) was estimated by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the observed differences in chemical shift (Δδobs Hz) between the ligand-free form (δfree) and the ligand-bound form (δobs) at multiple ligand concentrations. The following relationship was used:

where Δδmax is a fitted parameter that corresponds to δfree − δbound and δbound is the estimated shift (Hz) of the fully bound state, PT is the total protein concentration and LT is the total the ligand concentration.

Resonance assignments for M173 and M219 were made by mutagenesis. M173 was mutated to Ala and M219 was mutated to Ala. Isotope labelling of SHOC2 was achieved by adding 1 g l−1 l-methionine (methyl-13C) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CLM-206-1) to ESF921 Delta Series methionine-deficient medium (Expression Systems, 96-200). SF21 cells were grown to a density of 8 × 106 cells per ml in ESF921 (Expression Systems, 96-001-01). These cells were then diluted to a density of 0.8 × 106 cells per ml by adding sterile ESF921Delta Series methionine-deficient medium supplemented with 1 g l−1 l-methionine (methyl-13C) and grown for 3-4 d until a density of 8 × 106 cells per ml was reached. Cells were again diluted to a density of 0.8 × 106 cells per ml using ESF921Delta Series methionine-deficient medium. On the day before infection, cells were diluted to a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml into a final volume of 6 l of ESF921Delta Series methionine-deficient medium supplemented with 1 g l−1 l-methionine (methyl-13C) (split between two 5-l shaker flasks) and allowed to grow to a density of 1.7 × 106 to 1.8 × 106 cells per ml (18–24 h). Cells were then infected with 10 ml P2 virus per litre of culture; protein expression then proceeded for 3 d at 27 °C. Each sample was purified as described for unlabelled SHOC2(80–582). For NMR experiments, the protein was gel filtrated into 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 10% D2O and used at a final protein concentration of 35 µM. A SOFAST-HMQC for each mutant was then compared with the spectrum of wild-type SHOC2(80–582) to determine the assignment of each methionine.

The sedimentation-velocity experiments were done as described previously10. In brief, samples were dialysed into analytical ultracentrifugation buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP and 5 µM GMP-PNP), loaded into dual-sector centrifuge cells with 1.2-cm centre pieces and sapphire windows, and these were then loaded into an AN-50 Ti rotor and allowed to equilibrate to 20 °C for 2 h before the start of high-speed sedimentation at 42,000 rpm. Data collected at 280 nm were examined with c(s) analysis41 (SEDFIT v.5.01b). Results in the form of a c(s) plot were visualized using Gussi44.

C-terminally avi-tagged and biotinylated Shoc2 (80–582) and full-length Shoc2 were immobilized on a Streptavidin-coated sensorchip (Cytiva, BR-1005-31). For immobilization, 1 µg ml−1 Shoc2-avi was injected with a flow rate of 10 µl min−1 for 10 min at 22 °C chip temperature in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 0.1% Tween20. Sensor-chip equilibration was carried out with immobilization buffer until a stable baseline level was achieved. After immobilization, injections of 50 µM biotin solution (50 µl min−1 for 60 s) was done to reduce unspecific binding. The running buffer was 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.1% Tween20 and 2% DMSO. Experiments were done at 22 °C using a flow rate of 50 µl min−1 (contact time 60 s and dissociation time 90 s). Compounds were assessed at 12 concentrations of a 1:2.5 serial dilution series of the compounds. The stock compound dose response was prepared by diluting compounds in 100% DMSO. From the DMSO stock dilution series, dilution was done in running buffer without DMSO (1:50) to the final concentration and injected. DMSO solvent correction was used to correct for bulk effect. A serial dilution of an in-house identified low-molecular-weight binder was included in each run to confirm sensitivity between experiments. Also, a fixed concentration of this binder was injected between test compounds to assess the stability of the signal throughout the run. All SPR analyses were run on a Biacore 8k instrument. Data were processed using Biacore insight evaluation software v.4.0.8.20368. The raw data were double referenced, that is, the response of the measuring flow cell was corrected for the response of the reference flow cell, and in a second step the response of a blank injection was subtracted. Outlier sensorgrams were removed if necessary. The sensorgrams were fitted by applying a 1:1 binding model to calculate kinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants when possible. Rmax was set at global, whereas RI was set as constant (or fitted globally if needed). Data were processed individually for each run. The generated values were used to calculate average values and standard deviations of the binding constants.

Ligand affinities were determined by SPR using a Biacore 8k device (GE Healthcare). C-terminally avi-tagged and biotinylated RAS constructs were immobilized on a Streptavidin-coated sensorchip (Cytiva, BR-1005-31). For the immobilization, 0.04 µg ml−1 RAS-avi were injected with a flow rate of 10 µl min−1 for 10 min at a 22 °C chip temperature in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 µM nucleotide (GMP-PNP, GDP or GTP, depending on the loading state of the RAS proteins assessed), 1 mM TCEP and 0.1% Tween20. Sensor-chip equilibration was carried out with immobilization buffer until a stable baseline level was achieved. After immobilization, one injection of 50 µM biotin solution (50 µl min−1, 60 s) was carried out to reduce unspecific binding. The running buffer was the same as the immobilization buffer. Experiments were carried out at 22 °C using a flow rate of 25 µl min−1 (contact time 60 s, dissociation time 250 s). Untagged recombinant Shoc2(80–582) or full-length Shoc2 was tested in a 1:2.5 serial dilution series with a maximum concentration of 25 µM prepared in running buffer. All SPR analyses were run on a Biacore 8k instrument. Data were processed using Biacore insight evaluation software v.4.0.8.20368. The raw data were double referenced, that is, the response of the measuring flow cell was corrected for the response of the reference flow cell, and in a second step, the response of a blank injection was subtracted. Outlier sensorgrams were removed if necessary. The sensorgrams were fitted by applying a 1:1 binding model to calculate kinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants when possible. Rmax was set at global, whereas RI was set as constant. Data were processed individually for each run. The generated values were used to calculate average values and standard deviations of the respective binding constants. In the same run, only one loading state (GDP, GMP-PNP or GTP) was assessed and the respective nucleotide was supplemented in the immobilization/running buffer.

Protein–compound interactions interfering with Shoc2 binding to NRAS Q61R:GTP were detected and quantified using a sensitive TR-FRET-based competitive-binding assay with a europium-labelled anti-His antibody (Eu-aHisAb, Lance Eu W1024 anti-6× His, PerkinElmer) and a Cy5-streptavidin conjugate (Cy5-SA; GE Healthcare/Amersham, PA45001). Separate pre-incubations of N-terminally His-tagged recombinant human full-length SHOC2 (amino acids 1–582) with Eu-aHisAb, and C-terminally avi-tagged biotinylated recombinant human NRAS Q61R:GTP (amino acids 1–169) with Cy5-SA were carried out for 30 min. The test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and added to the solution containing the full-length SHOC2/Eu-aHisAb by means of a TTP LabTech Mosquito or a LabCyte ECHO555 pipettor. After 60 min of incubation, the NRASQ61R:GTP/Cy5-SA solution was added using a Fritz Gyger AG CERTUS pipettor. After another incubation of 60 min, the assay plates were measured using a PHERAStar FSX (BMG Labtech, Germany) microtitre plate reader equipped with dual-wavelength detection (europium excitation at 337 nm, europium emission at 620 nm and Cy5 emission at 665 nm). The final assay concentrations were: 10 nM His–SHOC2 full length, 50 nM NRASQ61R:GTP-avi, 0.25 nM Eu-aHisAb and 12.5 nM Cy5-SA. The final compound concentration for high-throughput screening at a single concentration was 31.25 µM and up to 300 µM during compound concentration, resulting in a final concentration of 0.9% DMSO for the high-throughput screen and 3% for compound characterization, respectively. The preincubation and the following measurements were conducted in assay buffer comprising 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 µM GTP, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.005% (w/v) Tween-20 and 0.005% (w/v) BSA, adjusted to pH 7.0. All solutions were handled at room temperature (22 °C).

The EC50 value was calculated from the plot of the percentage of protein saturation versus the test-compound concentration by a logistics fit according to:

where y is the percentage saturation value at the test compound concentration, x. A1 is the lowest saturation value (0%) and A2 is the maximum saturation value (100%). The exponent, p, is the Hill coefficient.

To confirm the specificity of the disruption between SHOC2 and RAS, TR-FRET using a resistant mutant, SHOC2(G290A), was set up. The protocol followed the same process as described above, using His-tagged full-length SHOC2(G290A) and NRAS(Q61R):GTP. The assay buffer was identical to the one used in the SHOC2–NRAS(Q61R) TR-FRET assay. Final concentrations were 5 nM SHOC2(G290A), 20 nM NRAS(Q61R), 0.25 nM Eu-aHisab, 5 nM Cy5-SA and 3% DMSO. Because the TR-FRET for the SHOC2 mutant used protein concentrations below the KD determined by SPR (Fig. 4c), the assay remained sensitive for the assessment of displacement despite the potentially higher affinity of the mutant SHOC2 protein than RAS. This was also demonstrated by displacement by untagged wild-type SHOC2, resulting in a similar IC50 in both the TR-FRETs with wild-type SHOC2 and SHOC2(G290A) (Fig. 4d).

SHOC2 was diluted in a final volume of 10 μl of 1 μM final concentration in reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 1 mM TCEP, 150 mM NaCl and 10× Sypro Orange (Invitrogen, stock 5000×). Triplicate wells were assessed for each protein. After a 30-min incubation, DSF measurements were carried out using an Opus qPCR thermal cycler (BioRad), with a ramping of 0.5 °C min−1. Evaluation of the melting temperatures was done using BioRad analysis software.

Two independent mRNA display selections were performed using an internal mRNA library encoding for 10-mer to 14-mer thioether cyclized peptides45,46,47. The coding region of the peptide library was designed as follows. The 5′ initiator AUG codon, encoding for the N-terminal chloroacetylated amino acid, was followed by 8–12 fully randomized positions comprising of trimer oligonucleotide mixtures. The trimer oligonucleotide pool included one distinct codon for every amino acid except for Met and Cys. The degenerate region was followed by a TGT encoding for the C-terminal Cys, enabling cyclization. At the 3′ end, there was a sequence encoding for the fixed spacer peptide sequence (GSGGSG) followed by an amber stop codon (TAG). The in vitro translation system was reprogrammed through Flexizyme-mediated genetic-code reprogramming, as previously described46,47. In brief, N-chloroacetyl l-Phe was used in place of the initiator methionine. Applying this reprogrammed translation system to the mRNA template afforded a 10-to-14-amino acid thioether-linked macrocyclic peptide library with each peptide containing a C-terminal Gly–Ser linker. Starting with an initial round containing less than 1013 unique cyclic peptides, SHOC2-specific binders were enriched using the leucine-rich repeat domain of SHOC2(93–582) with a biotinylated C-terminal Avi-tag immobilized onto streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. Nonspecific binders were removed using the streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads only, and the binding stringency was increased in latter rounds through longer incubation times and/or wash steps. Two parallel selections cycles were performed with either low (150 mM NaCl) or high (300 mM NaCl) salt concentrations. In this way, the samples were subjected to buffer exchange by small desalting columns after in vitro translation and reverse transcription. All selection rounds were submitted for NGS to obtain the enriched peptide sequences. Following analysis, about ten different sequences were picked for chemical synthesis, but peptide 4 was found only in the panning with the higher salt concentration (300 mM NaCl) and showed a rather low enrichment of about 2% of all sequences, with a maximum in round 6 before applying the harsher washing procedure.

The HEK 293T cells used to generate the SHOC2–NRAS(Q61K)mut NanoBiT were obtained from ATCC or DMSZ and are part of the Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), validated as previously described48. Cells were cultivated in DMEM growth medium (Gibco, DMEM high-glucose 4.5 g l−1, 1-26F01-I) supplemented with 1% stable l-glutamine (BioConcept, 5-10K50-H), 1% sodium pyruvate (BioConcept, 5-60F00-H) and 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Corning, 35-015-CF). The cells were stably transfected and monoclonal populations of cells were isolated by performing a standard limiting dilution procedure for the following SmBiT/LgBiT combinations: SHOC2–SmBiT full length/LgBiT–NRAS(Q61K)mut full length, SmBiT fused to LgBiT with a 128-amino acid linker in between as a control, to assess off target of the tested compounds. LgBiT–NRAS(Q61K) expression levels were determined by western blot using an anti-LgBiT antibody (Promega, N7100). SHOC2–SmBiT levels were determined by western blot using an anti-SHOC2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 53600).

Compound stock solution was prepared in DMSO/H2O (90:10) by the compound hub at Novartis Pharma AG. Compounds were tested with a seven-point or eight-point serial dilution 1:3 with a starting concentration of 30 µM.

To assess protein–protein interactions in cells using NanoBiT technology49, HEK 293T SHOC2–SmBiT–LgBIT–NRAS(Q61K), HEK 293T SmBiT–128-amino acid–LgBiT cells were cultured in DMEM growth media. Cells were passaged by centrifugation in the respective culture media and split into fresh media at a ratio of 1:20 twice week. Before the NanoBiT cell-based immunoassay, 20,000 cells, were seeded in 100 µl of complete growth medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS per well of a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher 96-well, flat-bottom microplate, 136102). Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. After incubation, cells were treated using an HP300 dispenser with increasing concentrations of compound, seven-point serial dilution 1:3 starting from 30 µM to 40 nM as the lowest concentration for 4 h. After incubation, the medium was replaced by 60 µl of Opti-MEM w/o Phenol red (Gibco, 11058), adding 15 µl of NanoGlo Live substrate (Promega, N2012) diluted 1:60 in Opti-MEM w/o Phenol red. Plates were mixed on an orbital shaker for 5 min and incubated for an extra 10 min at room temperature. Detection of luminescence signal intensity was performed using a Pherastar FSX (BMG Labtech). Absolute qualified AC50 values were analysed using the standard Novartis in-house assay data analysis software (Helios software application, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, unpublished) using the methods described50,51,52,53,54. With regard to the experiment with the SHOC2(G290A) mutant, HEK 293T cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. In the following days, cells were transfected with SHOC2(Gly290)–Ala-SmBiT and LgBiT–NRAS(Q61K) and incubated again overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated using an HP300 dispenser with increasing concentrations of compound, seven-point serial dilution 1:3 starting from 10 µM to 40 nM as the lowest concentration for 4 h. After incubation, 25 µl of NanoGlo Live substrate (Promega, N2012) diluted 1:60 in Opti-MEM w/o Phenol red was added. Plates were mixed on an orbital shaker for 5 min and incubated for an extra 10 min at room temperature. Detection of luminescence signal intensity was performed using a Pherastar FSX (BMG Labtech).

Unless otherwise noted, all commercially available chemicals and solvents were used as received. Solvents for peptide synthesis and purifications were of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade or higher. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, VWR or eMolecules.

Analytical ultra-high-performance liquid chromotography–mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC. Method A: column, CORTECS C18, 2.7 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm at 80 °C; eluent A, water + 0.05% HCOOH + 3.75 mM NH4OAc; eluent B, isopropanol + 0.05% HCOOH; gradient, 5–50% B in 1.4 min, 50–98% in 0.3 min; flow, 1.0 ml min−1.

a, Protein–protein interaction interface between SHOC2 (green cartoons) and NRAS (orange). b, A single ligandable site (pink surface) in SHOC2 is located at the SHOC2–RAS interface. c, Peptide 4 (blue surface) identified by an unbiased screen binds at the same site at the PPI interface. d, Low-molecular-weight compound (R)-5 (yellow surface) overlaps in the same binding site. e, Atomistic overlap of peptide 4 (blue sticks) and compound (R)-5 (yellow sticks) in their binding site. Although the peptide is larger and extends further towards the N-terminal part of SHOC2, it overlaps with the low-molecular-weight compound interface. Key contacts are preserved between the peptide and the low-molecular-weight compounds. f, Highlight of the key carbolic acid of Asp11 of peptide 4 and compound (R)-5 exhibiting a similar salt bridge to R223 and hydrogen bond to Q269. g, Highlight of key greasy interactions between Phe10 and Val13 of peptide 4 and the chloro-biphenyl group of compound (R)-5 extending hydrophobic contacts with the alkyl parts of the side chains of E311, R288, N265, T242 and D244. The 3D structure of apo SHOC2 does not exhibit conventional buried cavities that could host a small molecule. Although relatively large pockets can be found at the SHOC2–PP1CA and SHOC2–MRAS interaction interfaces12, the surface of apo SHOC2 is rather flat. However, there is a hydrophobic patch on the concave side of SHOC2, at the PPI with RAS. This patch has a limited buried surface of 236 Å3, an average hydrophobicity of 34% and an overall ligandability estimated to be moderate17 (PDB code: 7YTG). The main hydrophobic residues of the pocket are the side chains of Met219 and Thr242 and the alkyl chains of Asn265, Arg288, Glu311 and Asn313; and the backbone of residues Leu220, Leu243, Leu266, Leu289, Gly290 and Leu312. Polar residues lining the pocket are the side-chain terminal groups of Ser221, Arg223, Asp244, Asp267, Gln269, Arg288, Arg292, Glu311 and Asp313. Key residues shaping the binding site are long and flexible side chains that are free to move (three Arg and one Glu). Seven charged amino acids are defining the electrostatics and polarity of the binding site. Altogether, the limited ‘buriedness' and hydrophobicity of this binding site, combined with the flexibility of the key amino acid side chains forming it, and the numerous formal charges in this pocket, make it particularly challenging for the development of potent low-molecular-weight binders. No other ligandable cavity can be characterized in the existing crystal structures of SHOC2, making it an arduous target for the development of inhibitors.

All experiments were repeated three or more times independently, unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, with similar results.

X-axis represents scoring while y-axis represents statistics (see CRISPR screen analysis in Methods). Non-significant genes (Abs Q < 2 and RSA > −2) are depicted as density plot to avoid overplotting. c, Dot-plot representing screening results of selected hits for the labelled subgroups. Colors represent Q scoring and dot sizes represent statistical significance (RSA). d, Immunoblot analysis and relative quantifications of Ba/F3 isogenic models subjected to treatment with indicated inhibitors. Image representative of two independent immunoblots.

Source Data

a, Images of colony formation assays (representative of three independent experiments) quantified in Fig. 1c portraying multiple cell models transduced with dox-inducible shRNAs under DMSO (−) or dox (+) growing conditions. b, c, Lysates from UACC257 (b) and Calu6 (c) cell models transduced with the indicated dox-inducible shRNAs treated with DMSO (−) or dox (+) were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. A representative image of two independent experiments is shown. d, IPC298 xenografts growth with or without dox induction of indicated shRNAs. Dox treatment was performed when tumors reached the size of approximately 200 mm3 as indicated by the dotted lines (mean ± s.e.m., n  = 8-10 mice per group as indicated in the figure). Significance is determined using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test (ns=not significant, *p < 0.05; ****p < 0.0001). e, RT-qPCR mRNA analysis of MUGMEL2 tumors (at endpoint) for the indicated genes (shNT = non-targeting shRNA; veh = vehicle treated; DOX = doxycycline treated; mean ± s.d., n = 6 mice per group. Significance is determined using a two tailed unpaired t-test (***p = 0.0006, ****p < 0.0001). f, Gene set enrichment in knock-down responses quantified with RNA-seq. Displayed are normalized enrichment scores computed with R fgsea and FDR adjusted p-values.

Source Data

a, Sedimentation velocity profiles expressed as c/s distribution plots; SHOC2 (light blue) and KRAS (grey) alone display lower sedimentation coefficients (S). When KRASQ61R loaded with GTP is mixed with SHOC2 a species with larger S value is obtained (orange) indicating a binary complex. b, The interaction surface between NRASQ61R (orange cartoon-surface) and a portion of the concave surface of SHOC2 (green cartoon) is highly coincident with the sole ligandable region of the SHOC2 surface (pink surface). c, HMQC 2D NMR spectra of 13C methyl methionine labelled SHOC2(80-582) at 35 μM with increasing concentrations of compound 1; chemical shift perturbations observed at M173 and M219. d, Determination of dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of compound 1 to SHOC2(80-582) from observed differences in chemical shifts. e, Surface representation of the Peptide 4/SHOC2 interaction. Peptide 4 adopts a conformation that is stabilized by intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and leverages hydrophobic and charged residues on the SHOC2 surface. f, Peptide 4 produces a key interaction by coordinating the aspartic acid carboxylic acid to SHOC2 R177, an interaction leveraged by compound (R)-5.

Source Data

a, SHOC2 interacting with either NRASQ61R or compound (R)-5, highlighting SHOC2 G290A (yellow density) clashing with (R)-5, but not with NRASQ61R b, DSF assay showing no significant difference in Tm between SHOC2 WT and SHOC2 G290A. Y and X-axis show the fluorescence intensity derivative and temperature measured (°C) respectively. c, SHOC2 G290A binds NRASQ61R in vitro, measured by SPR. d, SHOC2 G290A is insensitive to compound 6 mediated RASQ61R-displacement in vitro, measured by TR-FRET. Comparison with SHOC2 WT is shown. Compound 7 is inactive on SHOC2 G290A and ~100-fold less active on SHOC2 WT. Assay sensitivity demonstrated with untagged SHOC2, resulting in PPI disruption with similar IC50 in both SHOC2 WT and G290A conditions (n = 2 technical replicates).

Solar geoengineering research involves investigating ways to ‘dim' the Sun's rays in an effort to cool Earth's temperatures. Credit: Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty

The United Kingdom's high-risk research agency will fund £56.8 million (US$75 million) worth of projects in the controversial area of geoengineering — manipulating Earth's environment to avert negative effects of climate change. The 21 projects include small-scale outdoor experiments that will attempt to thicken Arctic sea ice and to brighten clouds so that they reflect more sunlight. The hope is that successful technologies could one day contribute to efforts to prevent the planet from passing dangerous climate tipping points.

Supported by the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) as part of its five-year Exploring Climate Cooling programme, the projects are among the most significant geoengineering experiments funded by a government.

The research has the potential to be beneficial, but must be undertaken cautiously, says Peter Frumhoff, a science-policy adviser at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. “I am strongly supportive of responsible research on solar geoengineering and other climate interventions,” he says.

The funding package is the latest from ARIA, which was established in 2023 by the UK government and is modelled on the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. With an £800-million budget, it funds high-risk, high-reward research into technologies that could have major consequences for humanity, including artificial intelligence and neurotechnology.

Another such area identified by ARIA was geoengineering, says Mark Symes, an electrochemist at the University of Glasgow, UK, who leads the Exploring Climate Cooling programme.

Symes says the programme's goal is not to find ways to replace more accepted approaches to tackling climate change, such as reducing carbon emissions. Instead, he says, geoengineering could be useful to prevent the world reaching certain tipping points that might occur before emissions reductions can have an effect. That could include “the collapse of circulations in the North Atlantic driven by the runaway melting of the Greenland ice sheet”, he says.

But even as climate change continues unabated, the concept is controversial: last year, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, cancelled a project that would have introduced particles into the atmosphere in an effort to ‘dim' the Sun after an outcry in Sweden, where the experiment was to take place.

Wary of such concerns, ARIA is taking a cautious approach. “We want to keep this research in the public domain,” says Piers Forster, a climate-change scientist at the University of Leeds, UK, who chairs a committee that will monitor ARIA's climate-cooling projects. “We want it to be transparent for everyone.”

The 21 projects were selected through a competitive application process, which received about 120 proposals.

These fall into five research categories: studying ways to thicken ice sheets; assessing whether marine clouds could be brightened to offset damage to coral reefs; understanding how cirrus clouds warm the climate; looking at whether materials could be released into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight; and theoretical work on whether a sunshade deployed in space could cool portions of Earth's surface.

Five projects involve the most controversial area of geoengineering — outdoor experiments that interact with the environment. Frumhoff says that “building trust will be essential” in conducting such research. “I would be opposed to outdoor experiments being funded by any nation that isn't aggressively and seriously reducing its own emissions,” he says.

The stratospheric experiment — which is among the first outdoor solar-geoengineering experiment to receive government funding — will involve using balloons to carry materials such as limestone and dolomite dust into the stratosphere, to a height of about 15–50 kilometres, to see how they respond to the conditions. No particles will be released into the stratosphere, says ARIA.

Shaun Fitzgerald at the Centre for Climate Repair in Cambridge, UK, leads one of the ice projects. His team will conduct small-scale experiments in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and in Canada to pump water from beneath ice sheets and spread it on top, covering up to one square kilometre in area, to see whether such a method could thicken Earth's diminishing ice sheets.

“We're going to see whether we've actually been able to grow more sea ice in the Arctic winter,” says Fitzgerald. Early results from work that Fitzgerald's team did last year, before receiving ARIA funding, showed ice growth of “about half a metre”, he says.

Julienne Stroeve, a sea-ice researcher at University College London, isn't sure how effective this method would be in preventing widespread sea-ice loss. “I do not think this is feasible at any real scale needed,” she says, noting that the impact on local ecosystems is also unclear. ARIA says that Fitzgerald's experiment will be scaled up only if it is deemed to be “ecologically sound”.

Amazon has developed a new warehouse robot that uses touch to rummage around shelves to find the right product to ship to customers.

The robot, called Vulcan, is a meaningful step toward making robots less sausage-fingered compared to human beings. Honing robots' tactile abilities further may allow them to take on more fulfillment and manufacturing work in the years ahead.

Aaron Parness, Amazon's director of robotics AI who led the development of Vulcan, explains that touch sensing helps the robot push items around on a shelf and identify what it's after. “When you're trying to stow [or pick] items in one of these pods, you can't really do that task without making contact with the other items,” he says.

The Vulcan system consists of a conventional robotic arm with a custom spatula-like appendage for poking into a shelf and a sucker for grabbing items to pull them out.

Vulcan has sensors on several of its joints that allow the robot to detect the edges and contours of items. Parness says that machine learning is key to making sense of the sensor signals and also forms part of the algorithmic loop that controls how a robot takes actions. “The special sauce we have is the software interpretation of the force torque and how we wrap those into our control loop and into our motion plans,” he says.

Amazon revealed Vulcan at a fulfillment center in Hamburg, Germany, today. The company says the robot is already working at this facility and another in Spokane, Washington.

The new robots will work on the same line as human pickers and will aim to spare them from back-aching work by grasping more items from shelves that are high up or down low. Items that the robot decides it cannot find will be reassigned to human workers.

“Amazon stores many different products in bins, so rummaging is necessary to pull out a specific object to fill an order,” says Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Until now this has been very difficult, so I'm curious to see the new system.”

Goldberg says that research on robotic touch sensing has advanced in recent years, with numerous groups working on joint and surface sensing. But he added that robots have some way to go before they can match the tactile abilities of flesh-and-blood workers. “The human sense of touch is extremely sensitive and complex, with a huge dynamic range,” Goldberg says. “Robots are progressing rapidly but I'd be surprised to see human-equivalent [skin] sensors in the next five-to-10 years.”

Even so, Vulcan should help automate more of the work currently done by humans inside Amazon's vast empire of fulfillment centers. The company has ramped up automation in recent years with AI-infused robots capable of grabbing and transporting packages and packed boxes. Stowing and retrieving items from shelves is one of the more challenging jobs for robots to do, and it is heavily dependent on human labor.

Parness says he does not foresee robots taking on all of the work done inside Amazon's fulfillment centers. “We don't really believe in 100 percent automation, or lights out fulfillment,” he says. “We can get to 75 percent and have robots working alongside our employees, and the sum would be greater” than either working alone.

Increased use of robots may raise concerns around automation eliminating human jobs. Some economic studies show that robots can eliminate jobs, while others point to a more complex picture, with automation both replacing workers and creating new roles as productivity increases. Amazon's robot rollout has seen some new jobs created including ones that involve assisting robots when they get confused or stuck.

Parness says that Amazon plans to give other robots similar sensing capabilities to Vulcan, which should improve their abilities. The company may be cooking up new AI algorithms that make its robots smarter, too, having acquired the team behind a startup called Covariant that was developing AI foundation models for industrial machines. As WIRED revealed last year, other startups such as Physical Intelligence are looking to build AI models that make robots much smarter. Adding touch-sensor data to the training mix could perhaps help speed things up.

Bringing more manufacturing back to US shores, including the iPhone assembly work that Trump seems so keen on would surely require greater use of robots—especially systems with the touchy-feely skills needed to manipulate small, intricate components.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Startup Has Created AI-Powered Signing Avatars for the Deaf","https://www.wired.com/story/silence-speaks-deaf-ai-signing/","Wed, 07 May 2025 13:39:49 GMT","

More than 70 million deaf or hard-of-hearing people globally use sign language, but there's an acute shortage of interpreters. Silence Speaks is a British startup that wants to bridge that gap with an AI-powered sign language avatar capable of translating text to sign language.

Communication problems can be devastating and isolating for the deaf, especially in environments with background noise and crosstalk. It's often impossible for deaf and hard-of-hearing folks to follow conversations in train stations, hospitals, school classrooms, and busy offices. Even people with cochlear implants pick up only a few words from each sentence and can struggle with tone.

Developed by and for the deaf community, Silence Speaks can accurately translate text into British Sign Language (BSL). There are more than 150,000 BSL users in the UK. The model was trained with datasets covering regional dialects, contextual language, and emotional tone to power an AI-generated avatar that goes beyond simple direct translation to convey intent and emotion.

WIRED has a policy of not sharing a story with a company before publication, but we sent an edited version of this piece to Silence Speaks so that the company could generate an AI avatar based on me for a sample video. There were no changes to the text.

With a background at Vodafone pioneering AI architecture for chatbots, Silence Speaks CEO Pavan Madduru founded the company just over three years ago. He got the idea after spending time with an engineer friend who was deaf. When the two traveled together, Madduru saw how the lack of sign language support made life difficult for his friend and resolved to tackle the problem.

He hired three full-stack engineers, all deaf sign language users, to begin work on translation technology to harness the growing potential of AI. When he started the project, the team tried converting sign language to text, hoping to enable real-time translation of any sign language to any other sign language. But this proved trickier than expected.

While American Sign Language (ASL) is widely used in the US, BSL is quite different, and there are more than 200 sign languages around the world. Silence Speaks started with BSL but soon realized that regional slang and accents extend to sign language and impact signing speed. During the trial, they discovered signers in Edinburgh were 50 percent faster than folks in Southampton or Birmingham.

After a rethink, Madduru and his team approached the problem differently, developing technology capable of translating text into BSL and ASL. The current version runs in the cloud and takes time to generate the signing from text input, but the company is working toward real-time on-device translation. Madduru suggests this is still at least a year away, partly because the team has set high standards for accuracy. But real-time sign translation could effectively give deaf folks an interpreter in their pocket.

A future version that can translate speech, text, and sign language in any direction is a truly tantalizing prospect. For now, the focus is to build a strong foundation, prove that the technology works, and show it has a role to play in immediately improving accessibility for the deaf. The platform includes built-in captioning functionality for deaf users who don't sign or are still learning sign language.

Silence Speaks is getting a huge lift with Transport for London—the agency responsible for more than 250 stations and all the Metro lines in the UK's capital. It plans to roll out the Silence Speaks AI-powered sign language avatar to make trains more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing by offering visual displays for train announcements. People can also scan QR codes on their phones to get sign language videos with the latest information.

A greeting cards company also employs Silence Speaks technology to create birthday and other event cards. Each card contains a QR code that the recipient can scan to stream a special signed video message on their phone.

One of the cool things about the tech is that licensees can create their own characters to serve as signing AI avatars. Characters can be photorealistic or cartoonish. For this article, I submitted a single photograph to create my avatar for the videos. While AI usually struggles with hands, my digits look perfect for accurate signing, but my face is downright weird (weirder than usual). My kids find it creepy, but it's not a million miles away, and companies will likely spend longer refining their chosen characters. There is even scope to use popular characters like Spider-Man or Wonder Woman as sign interpreters.

Silence Speaks has been gaining momentum ahead of another investment round. Chloe Smith, former secretary of state for Science, Innovation, and Technology, who led the 2022 legislation to recognize British Sign Language in UK law, has joined as chair of the company's board.

“People who use sign language can often be excluded, and that's wrong,” she tells WIRED. “We hope that our app will help deaf communities and hearing communities to communicate better together.”

One of the main applications is for the deaf and hard of hearing in the workplace, where accessibility can be challenging. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People reports that 85 percent of deaf professionals have suffered workplace exclusion. Smith is also president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the leading professional body for HR and people development in the UK. She suggests that technology like Silence Speaks has a huge role to play in breaking down barriers and extending the frontier of inclusion.

Education is another sector crying out for better accessibility. There are around 50,000 deaf kids in the UK education system, and the vast majority of them attend mainstream schools where resources are stretched. Without proper support, these kids are in danger of being left behind, but few schools will provide a sign interpreter, and where they do it's often only for part of the time. This technology could massively improve classrooms for signing kids.

Silence Speaks isn't the only new technology targeting the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. As smart glasses start to take off, we have seen companies like XRAI attempt to subtitle life for the deaf and hard of hearing, and Nuance now offers audio glasses with built-in microphones and speakers to amplify sound and act as hearing aids. Google showed off augmented reality glasses in 2024 that provided real-time captioning on the glasses while speaking to another person, and even Apple's popular AirPods Pro 2 got a free update in 2024 that enabled hearing aid functionality to boost certain frequencies. Different people will prefer different approaches, and there's no reason these technologies can't coexist.

As Silence Speaks develops its technology, authenticity is key, something everyone at the company mentions when I speak with them. The involvement of deaf engineers, deaf communities, and linguists in the design is central to the company as it seeks to provide an intuitive system that feels authentic to users, and that's not always the case with this kind of technology.

On a crisp Saturday in March, beneath a canopy of pixelated cherry blossoms, two avatars stood in front of a digital altar crafted from shimmering quartz blocks and flickering redstone torches. They were surrounded by a sprawling Minecraft village, complete with custom-coded NPCs reciting lore about the couple's decade-long digital courtship. Nearby, pixelated foxes darted between guests—each one logged in from across the world, dressed in custom skins as forest druids and rogue mages. After the vows (typed and read aloud on Discord), guests dispersed for side quests, scavenger hunts, and an enchanted maze culminating in a virtual fireworks show. This wasn't a rehearsal for an in-person wedding—this was the wedding.

Welcome to the new frontier of love: the hyper-niche internet wedding.

Over the past decade, virtual weddings emerged as a necessity—Zoom ceremonies during Covid-19 lockdowns, livestreams for distant relatives, even robotic proxies for international couples facing visa issues. But what's happening now is different. More couples are choosing to host their ceremonies in the very digital spaces where they first met, bonded, and built their lives. Not as a compromise, but as a celebration of who they are—and the communities that shaped them. As such, platforms like Minecraft, Discord, and VRChat have become unconventional yet meaningful venues. These aren't stopgap solutions; they're deliberate, deeply personal choices.

These digital ceremonies often incorporate interactive elements: virtual scavenger hunts, themed quests, and personalized avatars. Guests might receive digital invitations embedded with augmented reality features, allowing them to experience a 3D animation of the couple's journey together. One couple, who met in a Discord server dedicated to indie game development, tells WIRED they hosted their wedding within that same server, complete with custom emoji, bot-generated confetti, and a playlist curated by fellow server members.

The appeal isn't just about novelty. For many, it's about authenticity and accessibility. Virtual weddings can be more inclusive, allowing friends and family from around the globe to attend without the constraints of travel. They also offer a canvas for creativity, enabling couples to design experiences that reflect their unique stories and shared interests. It's not uncommon to hear vows referencing video game lore or to see ring exchanges coded into emotes or Discord bots.

Sarah Nguyen, 24, from Portland, Oregon, and Jamie Patel, 25, from Leicester, England, met when they were 13 years old on a Minecraft role-play server. What started as a random team-up to build a tavern in a medieval village turned into years of collaboration. “We'd log on almost every day after school,” Nguyen tells WIRED. “Sometimes we'd just build or farm; sometimes we'd write whole stories for our characters. It was this creative outlet that became our friendship and then something more.”

By the time they were 18, Nguyen and Patel had developed their own shared Minecraft world—a sprawling, custom-coded fantasy realm where their avatars led an epic saga as rulers of a magical kingdom. “We didn't just game together,” Patel says. “We were world-building, storytelling, living inside this universe we made.

When Patel proposed last year, it happened, fittingly, in Minecraft. He designed a secret quest line for Nguyen's character, culminating in a mountaintop scene where an NPC delivered his proposal via in-game dialog. “He knew I'd say yes before I even reached the end,” Nguyen says, laughing.

“We've lived apart our whole relationship. That world is where we live together.”

So when it came time to plan their wedding, Minecraft wasn't just a nostalgic choice—it was inevitable. “It's the closest thing we have to a shared home,” Nguyen explains. “We've lived apart our whole relationship. That world is where we live together.” (The couple now lives together in Portland.)

Their virtual wedding included 15 custom NPCs recounting their love story, a cathedral constructed from sea lanterns and obsidian blocks, and a scavenger hunt where guests helped retrieve a “forgotten heirloom” to unlock the altar. Around 50 friends and family attended, logging in from eight countries. “We had some older relatives watch via Twitch since they weren't gamers,” Patel says.

While some guests were skeptical at first, both families ultimately embraced it. “My parents loved that it was so personal,” Nguyen says. “They didn't really understand Minecraft, but they understood that this was us.”

The whole event cost around $300, mostly for custom skin commissions, server hosting, and paying a designer to help with scripting the NPCs and quests. “Way cheaper than a real-world venue,” Patel says. “And no seating charts.”

They also held a small in-person dinner a few weeks later for local relatives, but for them, the Minecraft ceremony was “the real wedding.”

In the Roblox metaverse, Ashley Rivera, 27, from San Diego, and Luna Kim, 26, from Seoul, held their wedding inside a pastel castle floating among digital clouds. The couple met five years ago in a Roblox fashion design community, bonding over a shared love of avatar styling, digital art, and hyperpop playlists. “We'd spend hours just designing outfits together,” Kim says. “It wasn't just about dressing up—it was about creating little versions of ourselves and dreaming up lives for them.”

Though they had never played Roblox competitively, they were deeply embedded in its social and creative subcultures. “We met most of our friends there,” Rivera says. “It's where we threw birthday parties, hosted art shows, organized karaoke nights. It was our town square.”

When Kim proposed last summer, it happened inside a Roblox “fashion show” they'd built together. “She walked an avatar down the runway holding a giant neon ring,” Rivera says. “And I just started sobbing.”

Their wedding reflected that same playful spirit. Guests arrived as anime-style avatars dressed in themed looks—cottagecore, fairy, or postapocalyptic chic. Instead of a cocktail hour, guests completed an obstacle course Kim designed. Instead of a DJ, they programmed a scripted dance party synced to their favorite hyperpop tracks.

“It was chaotic but perfect,” Kim says. “We wanted it to feel like a game, not a ceremony.”

Their families were supportive, if bemused. “My grandma thought Roblox was a new church,” Rivera says, laughing. “But my little cousins were obsessed.” They also hosted an IRL brunch with family a month later.

The entire virtual event cost them about $500, mainly spent on custom avatar assets and hiring a Roblox developer to script the venue and activities. “We had way more freedom than a real-world venue would allow,” Rivera says. “And no clean-up after.”

Though both couples admitted to some early fears about being judged, they found their communities overwhelmingly supportive. “People think it's weird until they see how beautiful and personal it actually is,” Rivera says. “We weren't trying to replace weddings. We were just making one that felt true to us.”

Jessica Hu, 34, an ordained officiant based in Chicago, has made a name for herself as a “digital celebrant,” specializing in ceremonies across Twitch, Discord, and VRChat. Since launching her virtual wedding services in 2020, she has officiated over 40 ceremonies in online spaces.

“It's easy to dismiss it as novelty,” Hu says. “But these weddings are deeply sacred. I've had couples exchange vows using emoji reactions. I've had Discord bots cue the processional music. I've seen Twitch chats cry in real time.”

For many, Hu says, these ceremonies aren't just an alternative to real-life weddings—they're more accessible, more creative, and more authentic. “I've worked with queer couples whose families wouldn't attend a physical wedding, or couples in countries where their identities aren't recognized. In virtual space, they can be surrounded by love, on their own terms.”

for the wedding industry at large, the interest in custom digital weddings opens up new possibilities. Event planning companies are starting to offer digital packages. For instance, Wedfuly specializes in virtual wedding services, providing equipment and professional support to livestream ceremonies with multi-angle coverage and interactive features. Designers are creating custom skins and virtual fashion. Tech developers are building plug-ins and mods specifically for ceremonies in platforms like Minecraft or VRChat. A cottage industry is emerging around this demand, one that merges code with creativity, UX with intimacy.

There's also a broader cultural resonance: These weddings speak to a generation raised on fandom, internet-native humor, and platforms where the line between creator and consumer is blurred. They're not looking for a one-size-fits-all fairy tale—they want a love story they cowrite.

So no, the church bells aren't going silent anytime soon. But in the background, you might hear something else: the swell of a custom-coded orchestral track, the soft ping of an emoji reaction, or the laughter of guests navigating a post-ceremony quest.

Nearly a decade ago, Nike's Vaporfly 4% ushered in running's “super shoe” era. With its big-rebound super foam midsole and carbon plate, boasting 4 percent efficiency gains, that shoe's revolutionary design triggered a running shoe arms race as rival brands adapted the formula for themselves. That battle is still raging, and now Puma wants in, with the Fast-R Nitro Elite 3—a hi-tech shoe that it says delivers the biggest gains yet.

It's a bold claim, but Puma is so confident that it offered WIRED access to its testing facility, allowing us to compare the Nitro Elite 3 against other running shoe brands. To make things interesting, we decided to compare it with the elite racer's favorite, the $250 Adidas Adios Pro 4, as well as a mid-priced daily running shoe, the $140 Asics Novablast 5.

The results were pretty surprising. And if you're about to push for a marathon PR, you'll definitely want to read on.

The impact of a good running shoe can't be underestimated. With records—both on road and track—tumbling in recent years, World Athletics was forced to change its footwear rules in 2020, limiting the stack height of road race competition shoes to a maximum of 40mm and a single carbon plate.

But those limitations haven't stifled the gains. Every brand still works within the World Athletics constraints trying to produce the next game-changing shoe, it's just now the designers have fewer levers to pull.

They can still tweak the properties of the gas-injected foams for cushioning, compression, resilience and energy return. Or fine-tune the stiffness, length, geometry and position of the carbon fibre plate to enhance the leverage.

The test subjects, from left to right: Adidas Adios Pro 4, Asics Novablast 5 and the Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3.

Recent shoes, like the Adidas Adios Pro 4, have experimented with the position and curvature—or the rockering—of the midsoles in a bid to roll runners into a more efficient gait.

Weight saving is a top priority, too. Studies show that for every 100 grams (about 3.5 oz) shaved off your shoe, running economy improves by approximately 1 percent. The hunt is always on for lighter foams, ways to cut unnecessary material from the midsole, plate and outsole. Stripped-back uppers also play a part with minimal heel collars, thin tongues and barely-there mesh.

Whether you're targeting a sub-3 or sub-5 hour marathon, the lure of the promised performance gains is strong. However, the effectiveness of carbon shoes varies significantly from shoe to shoe, and runner to runner.

Research indicates that while some runners experience improvements in running economy with new footwear tech, others see minimal benefits or even a decline in performance. Individual biomechanics, running speed, and adaptation to the shoe's design all play a significant role. The key is finding the shoe that you respond to.

The mixed results mean we've not seen any rival claims to compete with Nike's original 4% stamp. Until now.

Puma says the new Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 not only unlocks efficiency gains that outperform any other shoe on the shelves right now. But it's also a running shoe all runners respond to.

It sticks with the classic super-shoe recipe: a high-rebound, nitrogen-injected foam, a full length carbon plate, incredibly lightweight uppers and a very thin layer of outsole rubber. But in some ways it cuts a unique shape with a decoupled midsole, a steep heel cutaway that saves weight and an extended carbon plate that lips out at the front for additional leverage.

The changes from the Puma Fast-R2 to the Fast-R3 are subtle, but Puma promises they make a difference. Zeroing in on the details that unlocked the improved efficiency required a new design approach inspired by Formula 1's digital prototyping. Nowadays, tweaks to F1 cars are often modelled virtually, rather than physically on the track. Puma essentially applied a similar digital modelling approach to its running shoe development.

“We 3D recorded the foot strike of 15 athletes running, then used a computer to average them out and turn them into one,” says Todd Falker, product lead for running at Puma. “We could then take that digital foot strike and watch how the foot of all the runners interacted with the digital shoe.”

Romain Girard, VP of innovation at Puma adds more. “We replicated runner behavior in a 3D world, but the replication is 100 percent accurate. The way the shoe behaves in reality is exactly the same in the computer simulation.”

The technology not only allowed designers to identify parts of the shoe that weren't being used, for example 5.2 percent of the volume of the midsole foam had no impact. So that was cut. But it enabled designers to “test” 100s of different design permutations without having to go through the lengthy process of creating lots of physical prototypes to retest on runners.

“Usually you need to build one plate, a second plate, a third plate, and then you test them,” says Girard. “But we were able to test hundreds of plates and configurations digitally until we had a couple that were looking better, and then we had to make a decision.”

“We did this on a foam level, on a plate level, on traction level, on the feet level, so we could optimize the entire product from the second generation to the third.”

A closer look at the making of the Fast-R Nitro Elite 3.

This design process informed every detail of the new shoe, helping Puma cut 100 grams from the previous generation. The Puma Fast-R3 now weighs in at just 6.2 oz or 176 g in a US men's 9.5—one of the lightest running shoes going.

The super foam in the Puma shoe returns more energy, too—90 percent compared to 85 percent from the PEBA foam in the likes of the Nike Vaporfly.

“The product that you see here, is the first physical prototype that we built after this digital optimization,” says Girard.

“Basically what the computer said would work, works,” adds Falker.

It's got research to back it up, too. Once the Fast R-3 was finalized, Puma commissioned industry specialist Wouter Hoogkamer—the same person who wrote the original Nike Vaporfly 4% paper—to test the running efficiency benefits of its new shoe.

Hoogkamer's team put 15 volunteers, all of whom had run 5km in under 21 minutes (that's pretty quick, the average is closer to 30 minutes), in various leading carbon shoes, to test their running economy in a series of treadmill tests.

The results showed that on average, the Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 offered 3.5 percent efficiency gains over the Nike Alphafly 3 and the Adidas Adios Pro Evo 1. In fact, it offered improved running economy against every shoe on test, including its predecessor, the Fast-R2. But what's even more surprising, is that all of the 15 runners were their most efficient in the Fast-R3.

""The most striking result from this study was the consistency of the running economy improvements,” says Hoogkamer, who is also an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts. “For every single participant the numbers showed that running was easiest—requiring the least amount of metabolic energy—in the Fast-R 3.”

“We've never seen any other shoe beat this [the Fast-R 3] on any person in the lab, full stop. The least [response] has been about 2 percent,” adds Falker. “But on average, we're about 3.5 percent percent more efficient than the largest and second largest footwear brand's best shoes.”

Kieran gets to work with a running economy test in Puma's Nitro Lab.

Brands don't often invite close comparison with rival brands but numbers like those from Hoogkamer's study might explain why Puma threw open the lab doors for us to test it for ourselves.

The team at Puma's Nitro Lab put me through the same test used for Hoogkamer's study—something called a running economy test. This test is commonly used to benchmark the impact of running shoes on performance and measures oxygen usage to quantify the effort required to run at a given speed.

“The less oxygen you use, the lower your running economy and the better your running efficiency,” says Laura Healy, senior manager for research & sport science at Puma.

“Running economy savings can directly translate to running performance, meaning you can run faster for the same amount of energy. In theory, if we can make you more efficient with our shoes, we can make you faster.”

The Puma research team strapped me into an oxygen exchange mask, a bit like those often used for VO2 Max tests. After an obligatory Bane impersonation and a 10 minute warm-up on the treadmill, I was asked to maintain a series of 5 minute efforts, running around 10 seconds slower than my target marathon pace in each of my test shoes.

I ran twice in each one, reversing the order on the second set, with two minutes rest between each effort. During the runs, the team measured the amount of oxygen I used and carbon dioxide I output. The results from the two tests were then averaged and compared.

The results of Kieran's running economy test.

While I was secretly hoping my underdog, the mid-priced Novablast 5 might produce a shock win, from a subjective perspective, the Adidas and Puma shoes felt more efficient. I also felt more natural in the Puma shoe, but that was a much closer call.

My results followed the findings of the University of Massachusetts study. I was 4.9 percent less efficient in the non-plated Asics Novablast 5. I was also 2.23 percent less efficient in the carbon-plated Adidas Adios Pro 4.

In the world of elite, or indeed serious amateur, running, those are significant numbers. While the efficiency gains don't translate one-for-one into time savings, the efficiency improvements would mean a theoretical performance gain for a half marathon of close to a minute and half (from 1:22:00 to 1:20:37) or 3 minutes knocked off my marathon time (from 2:54:00 to 2:50:58).

Of course there's more to running a PR than the shoes you do it in but, with all other things in balance, those are big potential time savings.

Boosting efficiency on a treadmill in a lab is one thing, but it's another to reproduce that performance on the feet of real runners taking part in real runs. But early tests in the wild are certainly positive for Puma.

At the recent 2025 Boston Marathon and London Marathon, Puma put 180 runners in its Fast-R3, and more than a third of them beat their previous marathon records. That still means more didn't than did, of course, but it's notable that 38 runners beat their times by more than three minutes.

In a slightly less prestigious test, this WIRED guinea pig knocked 12 seconds off their 5km PR, running 17:41 at a London parkrun. I also put the Puma supershoes through my own, more thorough, real-world examination at the London Marathon.

The shoes undoubtedly worked, albeit maybe too well in the first half. I finished with a time of 2:58:57—that's 4 minutes slower than my marathon PR, but on a very hot day. Also, if you know anything about marathon pacing, you'll know it's a terrible idea to run a half marathon PR in the first half of the marathon. Which is exactly what I did. I also threw in a 10-mile and a 30KM PR in that mix. I can't prove it, but I think some of that was down to how strong I felt in the Puma shoes.

Looking closer at my stats, I held PR pace up to the 19th mile before dropping off. Even in the last 6 miles, the smooth, snappy feedback from the Fast-R3 helped me hang on when it looked like sub-3 might be lost.

I review a lot of the best running shoes, and I have no hesitation in saying the Puma Fast-R3 are the real deal. Light, punchy, propulsive and crucially comfortable over the full 26.2 miles, even when things aren't quite going according to plan. If you're chasing a PR, this shoe should be on your list to consider.

Marathon Venture Capital, a venture firm in Athens that prides itself on being “day one partners to Greek tech partners,” just closed its newest fund with €75 million in capital commitments, according to partner Panos Papadopoulos.

The vehicle brings the firm's total assets under management to €175 million — a meaningful amount for an 8-year-old, seed-stage investor in Greece and a reflection, too, of some sizable exits. Among them was the sale last year of Marathon's portfolio company Augmenta to CNH, a maker of farm machinery and construction equipment in a cash deal that valued Augmenta at $110 million. Marathon also sold some of its shares in Hack the Box, a cybersecurity upskilling and talent assessment platform, to the investment firm Carlyle in a secondary transaction.

We chatted with Papadopoulos ahead of an in-person sit-down with him as part of TechCrunch's first StrictlyVC evening in Athens on Thursday, May 8, a night that will also include a deep dive with Greece's prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. 

What we wanted to know — and what the central questions will be Thursday night — is why Greece, and why now?

Greece has historically seen less venture investment than other European countries. What, if anything, has changed locally that enabled you to raise a €75 million fund when global fundraising has become more challenging?

For starters, Marathon I is a top percentile performer globally in [realized returns]; we built a portfolio that captured the current zeitgeist well before, for example, AI-assisted scientific research, robotics, or defense became the norm.

What is your firm's thesis and how does this newest fund's thesis differ given the extended timeline we're seeing for exits globally?

We are backing founders who do something hard in important markets. It can be hard because it requires unique knowledge, like a research PhD, or high agency, meaning understanding of a regulated or overlooked industry like power grid management. And we're going to continue doubling down on our fast-growing community, which has been accumulating experience and expertise, along with ambition.

Greek startups have traditionally faced challenges scaling beyond the domestic market. How are you evaluating a company's international growth potential in this environment where capital efficiency matters more than rapid expansion?

I beg to differ. Greek startups leverage local talent to serve leading global customers and markets from day one. Across our portfolio there is virtually no revenue coming from the domestic market. But they are serving the best part of Fortune 500.

At the same time, capital efficiency and team grit are second nature to our community.

We're seeing fewer IPOs globally and extended holding periods for venture-backed companies. How did this affect your conversations with your limited partners about expected timelines and returns?

We don't need decacorns for our fund economics to work. We invest early on, maintain substantial equity positions, and keep our fund sizes small. These provide for various opportunities for meaningful returns, including secondaries and strategic M&A, well before an IPO. We did secondaries back in 2021 when most of the market was promising infinite holding times. In our culture, cash is king. It seems that many others forgot it.

Many European VCs are emphasizing deep tech and AI. Is Marathon taking a similar approach, or do you see different opportunities specific to the Greek ecosystem?

Of course we all are, but the definition of deep tech is stretched and means many different things to different people. We are not focusing on any specific sector per se — instead, we are focusing on people changing their sectors. We were perhaps the first generalist VC to invest in defense before the Ukraine war.

Greek founders have historically received less funding than counterparts in Berlin, Paris, or Stockholm. Are you seeing valuations for Greek startups that reflect this discount, and does this create opportunities for better returns?

In our experience, this is not about geography or price. We are backing founders in nonconsensus opportunities that most VCs would ignore. We move fast with conviction and we don't ask who else is investing. These might sound like table stakes; they still are not.

Given the challenging global exit environment, how are you advising your portfolio companies about strategic alternatives like secondary sales or acqui-hires?

We work with our portfolio companies toward default alive scenarios. Starting from there, all options are on the table. We see founders truly want to run their companies for the long term. We believe a secondary sale can actually help towards that, and most often we are supportive of such scenarios.

The EU has emphasized supporting startups through various funding mechanisms. How important is nondilutive capital from these sources to your portfolio companies compared to five years ago?

We welcome any such initiative. We advise, however, our portfolio founders not to waste time on non-market-related activities.

How has Greece's improved macroeconomic situation affected both your fundraising process and the quality of startups you're seeing?

It's always good when you are not making the press headlines, but what we do is less relevant to local macro. When it comes to the talent front, I would say truly based on naive empiricism that, if there is any correlation, that is inverse. Adversity is the mother of all invention.

Many American VCs have pulled back from European investments. Has this created more opportunities for local funds like Marathon, or has it made syndicating deals more challenging?

It is definitely a different market but also creates increased opportunity for European investors. I do not think the flood of capital in 2021 truly changed the opportunity for European companies. We must always count on ourselves and be aligned with founders for the long term.

Tech executives have long talked about how AI is going to revolutionize the advertising industry. In particular, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been quite vocal about how exactly he wants his company to lead the transformation.

Speaking onstage at Stripe's annual Sessions conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out his plans to automate the entire ad industry with a black-box, end-to-end AI ad tool.

A key component of such a product would entail putting thousands of AI-generated “test” ads in front of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads users, said Zuckerberg.

“The basic end goal here is any business can come to us, say what their objective is — we get new customers to do this thing, or sell these things — tell us how much they're willing to pay to achieve those results, connect their bank account, and then we just deliver as many results as we can,” he explained. “In a way, it's kind of like the ultimate business results machine. I think it'd be one of the most important and valuable AI systems that gets built.”

Zuckerberg first described this hypothetical machine on Ben Thompson's Stratechery podcast last week, and — if built as Zuckerberg envisions it — it would have huge implications for the ad industry. During his Sessions appearance, Zuckerberg posited that while creative ad agencies would continue to exist were Meta to deploy this AI, small businesses might not “have to start off with the creative” and Meta could simply handle all of their advertising operations.

In fact, Zuckerberg asserted during Sessions that Meta's ad tools, several of which have generative AI capabilities, are sophisticated enough already that the company doesn't even recommend that customers specify the demographics they'd like to target. Meta's tools can find interested users better than human marketers can, claimed Zuckerberg. The next logical step, he says, is trying to apply this data-driven optimization to the creative side.

“We're gonna be able to come up with, like, 4,000 different versions of your creative and just test them and figure out which one works best,” said Zuckerberg.

While this sort of solution may appeal to businesses, it's an open question as to what AI ad testing will do to Meta's platforms from a user experience point of view, considering they're already brimming with generative AI slop. 

Meta has experimented with AI-generated images and comments in feeds, as well as AI chatbots users can interact with. The company more recently launched a social portal and dedicated app that spotlights generative AI content. Now, it appears yet another category of generative AI — ads — is poised to gunk up Meta's social media ecosystem.

If it wasn't clear before that users are the product on Meta's platforms and advertisers the customers, it's about to become crystal. While testing AI-generated ads may deliver value for companies, it means users will have to suffer through yet more slop.

The ad industry isn't likely to take kindly to Zuckerberg's vision, either.

There's been significant backlash over the ethics of using generative AI in creative fields. In October 2024, more than 11,000 creators signed an open letter condemning the use of human-generated art to train AI systems. Creators have also filed lawsuits against companies developing AI art tools, such as Midjourney and Stability AI.

To be fair, there are just as many creators and advertising executives who believe AI tools won't threaten their livelihoods anytime soon. Johnny Hornby, founder of the ad agency The&Partnership, on Tuesday published an op-ed arguing that creating successful branding campaigns is still a uniquely human task.

In any event, it seems that Zuckerberg has a pretty clear idea of how he wants to automate the ad industry and fill Meta's feed with AI — whether ad agencies or users like it or not.

After hinting at a new AI-powered search experience during its recent earnings call, Netflix officially unveiled the feature at its tech and product event on Wednesday. 

This new search experience will utilize OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide users with a conversational discovery experience. Users can enter their preferences using natural phrases like “I want something funny and upbeat” or even more detailed requests, such as “I want something scary, but not too scary, and maybe a little bit funny, but not haha funny.”

The feature is set to roll out this week to iOS users as an opt-in beta. Some subscribers in Australia and New Zealand have already had access to it, as reported by Bloomberg last month.

Other streaming competitors are also leveraging generative AI for search. For instance, Amazon has an AI voice search experience on Fire TVs that responds to open-ended inquiries about TV shows and movies. A closer comparison is Tubi's  ChatGPT-powered search tool, which answered content-related questions and suggested movies based on a user's specific request.

However, Tubi later discontinued the feature, probably because of low adoption. It remains to be seen whether Netflix's new feature will face similar challenges.

Additionally, at the tech and product event, the company mentioned plans to use generative AI to update title cards in subscribers' preferred languages. 

Other features revealed on Wednesday include a short-form video feed for mobile users and a redesign of its TV homepage.

Cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike said on Wednesday that it would lay off 5% of its global workforce, which amounts to about 500 workers. 

In an 8-K filing, CrowdStrike said the layoffs were part of a “a strategic plan (the ‘Plan') to evolve its operations to yield greater efficiencies as the Company continues to scale its business with focus and discipline to meet its goal of $10 billion in ending [Annual Recurring Revenue].”

The company also said it was planning to “to hire in key strategic areas throughout its fiscal year ending January 31, 2026.”

“These changes position us to move faster, operate more efficiently, and continue our cybersecurity leadership,” company CEO George Kurtz said in a letter to employees, according to The Wall Street Journal.

On Sunday, CrowdStrike said in a press release that last year, it delivered a “record full year operating cash flow of $1.38 billion and record full year free cash flow of $1.07 billion.” 

Last year, Kurtz made a total of more than $46 million, according to the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions in the United States.

CrowdStrike became a household name in 2016 when it investigated the Democratic National Committee hack and attributed it to the Russian government. Last summer, the company made headlines for the wrong reasons — a faulty update to its software impacted 8.5 million Windows devices around the world and caused a massive outage all over the world, forcing airports to shut down and hindering airlines, banks, hotels, and other kinds of businesses.

Uber and Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide plan to expand a commercial robotaxi partnership and bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. The expansion comes five months after the two companies launched a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi. 

As part of that expansion, Uber will increase its investment into WeRide by $100 million, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing. WeRide said it expects the cash to come through by the second half of 2025. 

The companies said the expansion will include cities in Europe. Under the partnership, WeRide's robotaxi services are available through the Uber app. The relationship is similar to Uber's deal with Waymo, in which the ride-hailing company handles the network routing and fleet operations, while the autonomous vehicle company remains responsible for the AV tech.

Uber and WeRide, which went public on the Nasdaq in late October, operate together in Abu Dhabi and announced plans to add Dubai. In Abu Dhabi, they work with local Tawasul Transport to handle fleet operations. 

The additional 15 cities will focus on cities outside of China and the United States.

Uber has locked up more than 15 partnerships with a wide-range of autonomous vehicle technology companies over the past two years across ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. In the past two months, Uber has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility  Volkswagen, and Chinese self-driving firm Momenta.It's most high-profile partnership in the U.S. — and one that is commercially operating today — is with Waymo. The companies offer a Waymo on Uber service in Austin and are about to do the same in Atlanta.

This story was originally published May 5. It has been refreshed with Uber's capital commitment to WeRide.

Netflix announced on Wednesday that it's testing a short-form video feature, signaling that even a streaming giant with over 300 million subscribers is concerned about losing viewers' time spent on mobile to apps like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.

The company debuted the feature at its first-ever product and tech event, where it also revealed several other upcoming plans for the service. These plans include an AI-powered search tool, as well as a redesign of the TV homepage and improved real-time recommendations.

Netflix's new mobile-only vertical feed allows users to easily scroll through clips of its original titles. Within this feed, users can tap on buttons to watch the entire show or movie immediately, save it to their “My List,” or share it with friends. 

Of note is that the clips are curated from the “Today's Top Picks for You” section rather than being chosen from Netflix's entire library. This approach makes it specifically tailored to each user, ultimately encouraging viewers to watch the full shows.

The experiment rolls out globally in the coming weeks on iOS and Android devices. It'll appear for users as a tab on the in-app homepage. 

The introduction of this feature comes at a pivotal time, as competition among platforms for viewer attention intensifies. Audiences increasingly favor quick entertainment, leading to a shift in traditional viewing habits. As a result, even large players like Netflix are adapting to retain and attract subscribers. This also follows President Trump's second extension of the deadline for the TikTok ban.

The latest test follows a trend among other streaming services that are trying out similar features. Tubi had its entry into short-form video last year with its “Scenes” feature. More recently, Peacock launched curated vertical video playlists earlier this year that not only feature short clips from TV series and films but also sports and news content.

Netflix is no stranger to experimenting with short-form video content. In 2021, the platform rolled out a TikTok-inspired feature called “Fast Laughs,” which focused on funny clips. However, this new test aims to reach a broader audience beyond just comedy fans and will be more personalized.

In terms of Netflix's new homepage update, one small change implemented is that the shortcuts for “Search” and “My List” were moved to the top of the page, where they were previously located on the left-hand side, making them easier to access. 

Netflix also has new “callout” badges that help viewers discover titles. For example, if users are searching for the latest Emmy-winning content, these badges will be prominently displayed on the title cards featured on the homepage.

Additionally, Netflix improved its real-time recommendation system. Now when subscribers search for content, it considers factors such as the trailer a viewer recently watched or the actors they are looking up. For instance, if they give a thumbs-up to the popular TV series “Wednesday,” the system will quickly adjust their homepage to display similar recommended titles.

AI Copilot for accounting firms in Europe

AI will be the biggest revolution to accounting since the invention of double-entry bookkeeping in 1494. As the cost of intelligence trends towards zero, we will be able to handle accounting's unstructured data and language-based rules fully autonomously.

The consequence will be profound. Accounting is the source of truth on what happens in a business. It drives every investment, expansion and company survival. In the intelligence age, business owners with no financial expertise will get access to all the latent knowledge hidden in their books. Businesses will operate with a level of clarity, confidence, and speed that is almost unimaginable today.

Tabular is leading the charge. We are live in several of Germany's most forward-thinking accounting firms, automating the books of Sequoia-backed startups, family-owned restaurants, and 30-person wood manufacturers.

We are looking for an intense founding engineer who wants to build at the frontier.

Read more about our mission.

Tabular is building the AI Copilot for accounting. An acute labour shortage is forcing accounting firms to reject new clients. Still, accountants spend 90% of their time on manual tasks. This is a unique moment, because for the first time it has become possible to automate much of this work due to a step-change in AI.

We are a seed-stage startup and have raised $4.6m by investors like Y Combinator and LocalGlobe.

A novel concept that I haven't seen implemented properly yet, perhaps useful for AI coding agents, is that a sandbox can be forked at any point. Similar to how you can fork a PostgreSQL database, you can fork a sandbox, which creates an independent sandbox with all of the changes in it. Technically, I tried to implement this with checkpoint/restore using CRIU, but ran into some issues with nesting beyond 2 levels deep and custom user namespaces for security. And it was difficult to use get CRIU to work with Linux programs that use shared memory segments, and other Unixy things. I ended up switching to file system diffs and using reflinks on XFS to get some Copy-on-Write semantics.Features:* Automatic HTTPS with unique URL per sandbox (no need to deal with ingresses or exposing ports)* Static token auth or GitHub app auth* Built-in UI* Multi-tenant ready: each user gets their own network* List, download, and upload files into sandboxes* Fork sandboxes to create arbitrary depths of clonesIt's still in early stages, but it should be usable.

Adaptive production could transform how factories function. Businesses that embrace it can reinvent themselves and redefine the rules of competition.

In partnership withSiemens

Manufacturing is in a state of flux. From supply chain disruptions to rising costs, tougher environmental regulations, and a changing consumer market, the sector faces a series of competing challenges.

But a new way of operating offers a way to tackle complexities head-on: adaptive production hardwires flexibility and resilience into the enterprise, drawing on powerful tools like artificial intelligence, digital twins, and robotics. Taking automation a step further, adaptive production allows manufacturers to respond in real time to demand fluctuations, adapt to supply chain disruptions, and autonomously optimize operations. It also facilitates an unprecedented level of personalization and customization for regional markets.

The journey to adaptive production is not just about addressing today's pressures, like rising costs and supply chain disruptions—it's about positioning businesses for long-term success in a world of constant change. “In the coming years,” says Jana Kirchheim, director of manufacturing for Microsoft Germany, “I expect that new key technologies like copilots, small language models, high-performance computing, or the adaptive cloud approach will revolutionize the shop floor and accelerate industrial automation by enabling faster adjustments and re-programming for specific tasks.” These capabilities make adaptive production a transformative force, enhancing responsiveness and opening doors to systems with increasing autonomy—designed to complement human ingenuity rather than replace it.

These advances enable more than technical upgrades—they drive fundamental shifts in how manufacturers operate. John Hart, professor of mechanical engineering and director of MIT's Center for Advanced Production Technologies, explains that automation is “going from a rigid high-volume, low-mix focus”—where factories make large quantities of very few products—“to more flexible high-volume, high-mix, and low-volume, high-mix scenarios”—where many product types can be made in custom quantities. These new capabilities demand a fundamental shift in how value is created and captured.

A patient who types with his brain thanks to a Neuralink implant is using AI chatbots to speed things up.

Last November, Bradford G. Smith got a brain implant from Elon Musk's company Neuralink. The device, a set of thin wires attached to a computer about the thickness of a few quarters that sits in his skull, lets him use his thoughts to move a computer pointer on a screen. 

And by last week he was ready to reveal it in a post on X.

“I am the 3rd person in the world to receive the @Neuralink brain implant. 1st with ALS. 1st Nonverbal. I am typing this with my brain. It is my primary communication,” he wrote. “Ask me anything! I will answer at least all verified users!”

Smith's case is drawing interest because he's not only communicating via a brain implant but also getting help from Grok, Musk's AI chatbot, which is suggesting how Smith can add to conversations and drafted some of the replies he posted to X. 

The generative AI is speeding up the rate at which he can communicate, but it also raises questions about who is really talking—him or Musk's software. 

“There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The promise of brain-computer interface is that if you can combine it with AI, it can be much faster,” says Eran Klein, a neurologist at the University of Washington who studies the ethics of brain implants. 

More volunteers will get Elon Musk's brain implant, but don't expect a product soon.

Smith is a Mormon with three kids who learned he had ALS after a shoulder injury he sustained in a church dodgeball game wouldn't heal. As the disease progressed, he lost the ability to move anything except his eyes, and he was no longer able to speak. When his lungs stopped pumping, he made the decision to stay alive with a breathing tube.

Starting in 2024, he began trying to get accepted into Neuralink's implant study via “a campaign of shameless self-promotion,” he told his local paper in Arizona: “I really wanted this.”

The day before his surgery, Musk himself appeared on a mobile phone screen to wish Smith well. “I hope this is a game changer for you and your family,” Musk said, according to a video of the call.

“I am so excited to get this in my head,” Smith replied, typing out an answer using a device that tracks his eye movement. This was the technology he'd previously used to communicate, albeit slowly.

Smith was about to get brain surgery, but Musk's virtual appearance foretold a greater transformation. Smith's brain was about to be inducted into a much larger technology and media ecosystem—one of whose goals, the billionaire has said, is to achieve a “symbiosis” of humans and AI.

Consider what unfolded on April 27, the day Smith  announced on X that he'd received the brain implant and wanted to take questions. One of the first came from “Adrian Dittmann,” an account often suspected of being Musk's alter ego.

Dittmann: “Congrats! Can you describe how it feels to type and interact with technology overall using the Neuralink?”

Smith: “Hey Adrian, it's Brad—typing this straight from my brain! It feels wild, like I'm a cyborg from a sci-fi movie, moving a cursor just by thinking about it. At first, it was a struggle—my cursor acted like a drunk mouse, barely hitting targets, but after weeks of training with imagined hand and jaw movements, it clicked, almost like riding a bike.”

Another user, noting the smooth wording and punctuation (a long dash is a special character, used frequently by AIs but not as often by human posters), asked whether the reply had been written by AI. 

Smith didn't answer on X. But in a message to MIT Technology Review, he confirmed he'd used Grok to draft answers after he gave the chatbot notes he'd been taking on his progress. “I asked Grok to use that text to give full answers to the questions,” Smith emailed us. “I am responsible for the content, but I used AI to draft.”

The exchange on X in many ways seems like an almost surreal example of cross-marketing. After all, Smith was posting from a Musk implant, with the help of a Musk AI, on a Musk media platform and in reply to a famous Musk fanboy, if not actually the “alt” of the richest person in the world. So it's fair to ask: Where does Smith end and Musk's ecosystem begin? 

That's a question drawing attention from neuro-ethicists, who say Smith's case highlights key issues about the prospect that brain implants and AI will one day merge.

What's amazing, of course, is that Smith can steer a pointer with his brain well enough to text with his wife at home and answer our emails. Since he'd only been semi-famous for a few days, he told us, he didn't want to opine too much on philosophical questions about the authenticity of his AI-assisted posts. “I don't want to wade in over my head,” he said. “I leave it for experts to argue about that!”

The eye tracker Smith previously used to type required low light and worked only indoors. “I was basically Batman stuck in a dark room,” he explained in a video he posted to X. The implant lets him type in brighter spaces—even outdoors—and quite a bit faster.

The thin wires implanted in his brain listen to neurons. Because their signals are faint, they need to be amplified, filtered, and sampled to extract the most important features—which are sent from his brain to a MacBook via radio and then processed further to let him move the computer pointer.

With control over this pointer, Smith types using an app. But various AI technologies are helping him express himself more naturally and quickly. One is a service from a startup called ElevenLabs, which created a copy of his voice from some recordings he'd made when he was healthy. The “voice clone” can read his written words aloud in a way that sounds like him. (The service is already used by other ALS patients who don't have implants.) 

Researchers have been studying how ALS patients feel about the idea of aids like language assistants. In 2022, Klein interviewed 51 people with ALS and found a range of different opinions. 

Some people are exacting, like a librarian who felt everything she communicated had to be her words. Others are easygoing—an entertainer felt it would be more important to keep up with a fast-moving conversation. 

In the video Smith posted online, he said Neuralink engineers had started using language models including ChatGPT and Grok to serve up a selection of relevant replies to questions, as well as options for things he could say in conversations going on around him. One example that he outlined: “My friend asked me for ideas for his girlfriend who loves horses. I chose the option that told him in my voice to get her a bouquet of carrots. What a creative and funny idea.” 

These aren't really his thoughts, but they will do—since brain-clicking once in a menu of choices is much faster than typing out a complete answer, which can take minutes. 

Smith told us he wants to take things a step further. He says he has an idea for a more “personal” large language model that “trains on my past writing and answers with my opinions and style.”  He told MIT Technology Review that he's looking for someone willing to create it for him: “If you know of anyone who wants to help me, let me know.”

 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

We're starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us—but there's still a lot we don't know.

If you had the opportunity to know your odds of developing Alzheimer's in the not-too-distant future, would you take it? And how might the knowledge change you? Research this week is among the first to try answering that second question.

Scientists in Israel and the U.S. conducted the study, which surveyed hundreds of people before and after they received a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan to assess their Alzheimer's risk status. Regardless of whether they tested positive or negative for increased Alzheimer's risk, their mental health remained stable. That said, people did become less motivated to maintain healthy lifestyle habits that could reduce their dementia risk, the study found.

Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, currently affecting over 7 million Americans. There is still some debate over how Alzheimer's develops, but one of its defining characteristics is a build-up of amyloid beta plaques in the brain (plaques being the hardy clumps of a misfolded form of amyloid beta).

This buildup starts to happen years, even decades, before someone shows the first symptoms of Alzheimer's, and a specific type of PET scan can eventually spot the build-up. The test alone doesn't confirm whether someone has or will develop Alzheimer's, but it can rule out the condition (at least in the near future), and is currently an important tool for diagnosing and monitoring the potential risk of Alzheimer's.

Shingles Vaccine Offers Hope Against Dementia

There has been some research looking at how people are affected by knowing their Alzheimer's risk, but these studies have typically been small or involved people who might already be seeking potential experimental treatments for Alzheimer's, according to the researchers (certain inherited mutations all but guarantee a person will develop early-onset Alzheimer's). They wanted to see how a relatively large group of cognitively healthy people in particular would respond to learning their risk from PET scans.

They recruited 199 healthy people aged 40 and older who had a family history of Alzheimer's for their study. Before the PET scan, the volunteers were surveyed about their current mental health, how worried they were about their memory, and how motivated they were about adopting or maintaining healthy habits thought to reduce dementia risk, such as exercising regularly. Six months after their test, they were asked the same questions.

People whose scans ruled out an immediate risk of Alzheimer's, the researchers found, experienced noticeable improvements in their overall levels of depression, anxiety, and memory concerns. Meanwhile, people with a confirmed risk of Alzheimer's experienced less anxiety and didn't become more depressed or more worried about their memory than before. Both groups, however, reported feeling less motivated to stick to their healthy habits.

“Our findings suggest no psychological harm in elevated and non-elevated [amyloid beta] PET scan status disclosure,” the authors wrote in their paper, published Wednesday in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia.

Can a Drug Prevent Alzheimer's Disease Decades Before It Happens?

The findings are especially relevant since we might be on the brink of a breakthrough in treating Alzheimer's. Several anti-amyloid drugs have been approved in recent years that can clear plaque from the brain and potentially slow down the progression of cognitive decline. These drugs are only modestly effective, but scientists are working on newer drugs or methods that could boost the potency of these treatments. Another promising approach might come from giving high-risk individuals anti-amyloid medications many years before they would be expected to show symptoms.

If early preventative treatment can work as hoped, it's possible that PET scans will become a common screening tool for Alzheimer's, the researchers say. That means understanding how people will react to their results is important, especially if we want to further reduce their risk. Even if today's medicine can't stop Alzheimer's from happening, for instance, studies have estimated up to 45% of cases are tied to lifestyle habits that we can change for the better. So finding a way to keep people motivated to stay healthy will be vital for Alzheimer's prevention moving forward.

“The decrease in motivation to implement lifestyle changes after the disclosure of elevated or non-elevated [amyloid beta] status warns against false reassurance during the disclosure process,” the researchers wrote.

In other words, learning about your Alzheimer's risk shouldn't be the end of the road. Regardless of your status, there's a lot you can do to keep your aging brain and body in relatively good shape, from regular cardio to getting certain vaccines. And someday soon, there might be even more tools available to ward off dementia.

Our laptops can handle a lot all by themselves, yes. But if you're working at just your laptop, you're severely limiting yourself. What's considered a big laptop is like 17 inches, yet monitors pretty much start at 10 inches larger than that nowadays. Then you have the super wide, 4K displays for even more field of view. Maybe you do a lot of typing at your desk and you'd prefer having a tactile mechanical keyboard. On-board speakers for your laptop not loud enough? Gotta plug in speakers too. Then we have microphones, headphones, maybe even a drawing tablet for the artists out there. And all those need to be plugged in but you just have the one USB port on your laptop.

See at Amazon

Well, that's why you need a good docking station. This one from Anker has everything you could possibly need in one hub. Plus, Amazon currently has it marked down 26% for a limited time. That brings the price from $190 to just $140, saving you $50.

This Anker docking station is a single cable solution so you can avoid a messy desk and tangled wires. Just plug your laptop in with the USB-C cable to connect to all of your accessories at your desk in one go while also charging your device.

It wouldn't be an Anker product without fantastic charging capabilities. This docking station is equipped with a 85W laptop-charging USB-C port. It's also got an 18W Power Delivery USB-C port. You can connect you laptop to the 85W port while you phone is charging off the 18W Power Delivery USB-C port to get simultaneous high-speed charging.

Beyond the charging ports, the Anker laptop docking stations houses a USB-C data port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 HDMI ports, a DisplayPort, an Ethernet port, SD/microSD card slots, a 3.5 mm AUX port, and a DC input. That means you can connect to three different monitors at once in 1080p at 60Hz.

The SD/microSD card slots are are wonderful additional for photographers. Most computers no longer have an SD card slot built in, meaning we need to rely on dongles that can get lost easily. SD/microSD card support right on the docking station means always having it at the ready.

Anker's USB-C 13-in-1 docking station is a marvelous addition to any desk for laptop users. And thanks to Amazon's ongoing sale, you can get the handy device for just $140. That's $50 off (-26%) from its usual price of $190.

Are you looking to get the most out of your new iPad? If you consider yourself an artist or are looking to expand yours horizons with a new skillset, the Apple Pencil Pro can take you there. Some might even consider you're only getting half of your iPad's functions without the pencil. It turns your tablet into a canvas. You can draw, sketch, color, take notes, mark up documents, and more. Well right now you can save 23% on the Apple Pencil Pro. That brings it's price down from $129 to just $99. Some quick napkin math with a regular pencil will tell you that will save you $30.

See at Amazon

The Apple Pencil Pro has both tilt and pressure sensitivity so you can simulate both the feeling of writing or drawing a real pencil as well as simulate the result. Painting, sketching, doodling, note-taking, any activity or task that you could do with pen and paper, you can now do with your iPad. It's much more satisfying to take on these sorts of actions with the Apple Pencil Pro than it is just using your finger. It's industry-leading low-latency will make each time you write or draw with the Apple Pencil Pro feel like the real thing.

If you've ever found yourself wishing for a second screen while working from a coffee shop, on a plane, or even at the kitchen table, you're not alone. Portable monitors are extremely convenient, even if you're just working from home. More real estate for all the things you need to do on your computer is always a good idea. And if you don't want to be tied to a traditional desk setup, that goes double. There's just one problem, though. Second monitors can be overpriced, or just not that great in general. That's why you won't want to miss out on this deal at Amazon.

The 15.6-inch MNN Portable Monitor is just $60 at Amazon, down from its usual price of $90. That's $30 off and a discount of 33%. That's an absolutely excellent price if you're looking to supplement a monitor you already have, and in fact is less than the price than a fancy dinner out.

See at Amazon

Plus, this monitor checks all the right boxes: it's lightweight, slim, easy to carry, and has full HD visuals perfect for when you're crunching spreadsheets or watching Netflix. Nearly 16 inches makes it the perfect size to act as a secondary screen next to your laptop without feeling too small or cramped. And because it uses an IPS panel, you'll get solid color accuracy and wide viewing angles without the potential for color weirdness.

You can just plug this monitor in and go, without a lengthy setup procedure. It includes two USB-C ports and a Mini HDMI port, so whether you're connecting to a MacBook, Windows laptop, Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, or even your phone, it's basically ready to go out of the box.

It also comes with a smart cover that doubles as a stand, so you don't need to bring a separate stand or prop it up awkwardly. The cover folds into position to give you multiple viewing angles depending on how and where you're using it. And while it doesn't have built-in speakers or touch features, it's a solid screen. And that's probably what you're looking for, anyway.

You aren't beating this monitor's price for just $60. It's an invaluable addition to a portable work station and an even better way to spruce up your desktop area at home. But if you're planning on buying it, be sure to do so quickly. There's no way they won't sell out at this price.

Foundation season two wrapped up in September 2023—a thrilling, thoroughly entertaining outing that improved upon season one in many ways. Will that trend continue for the third season of Apple TV+‘s Isaac Asimov adaptation? It seems highly likely considering the teaser and first-look images the streamer just shared, along with a premiere date: July 11.

Despite some behind-the-scenes duty-shifting that saw David S. Goyer stepping back as showrunner, though he's still very much involved with the series—as well as delays related to the 2023 Hollywood strikes and some budget concerns—season three still looks as large-scale and epic as the previous two.

Here's the official description for the season: “Set 152 years after the events of season two, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty's Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‘The Mule' whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It's anyone's guess who will win, who will lose, who will live and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.”

Jared Harris stars as Hari, with Lou Llobell as Gaal and Lee Pace as the middle-aged (and hottest, duh) Cleon. Laura Birn is the crafty android Demerzel; Cassian Bilton and Terrence Mann play the younger and older Cleons, respectively. Rowena King also returns as the legendary mathematician Kalle.

New characters in season three—necessary due to that time jump, as well as the fact that a lot of folks did not survive season two—will be played by Cherry Jones, Brandon P. Bell, Synnøve Karlsen, Cody Fern, Tómas Lemarquis, Alexander Siddig, and Troy Kotsur.

Pilou Asbæk, a fan favorite from Game of Thrones, is playing the terrifying Mule—introduced in season two as more of a shadowy future promise—which feels like perfect casting.

Here are some first-look season three images, including our pal the Mule:

 

Foundation returns Friday, July 11 to Apple TV+. It'll run 10 episode with a weekly rollout through September 12.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

The Drug Enforcement Administration has quietly ended its body camera program barely four years after it began, according to an internal email obtained by ProPublica.

On April 2, DEA headquarters emailed employees announcing that the program had been terminated effective the day before. The DEA has not publicly announced the policy change, but by early April, links to pages about body camera policies on the DEA's website were broken.

The email said the agency made the change to be “consistent” with a Trump executive order rescinding the 2022 requirement that all federal law enforcement agents use body cameras.

But at least two other federal law enforcement agencies within the Justice Department — the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — are still requiring body cameras, according to their spokespeople. The FBI referred questions about its body camera policy to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.

The DEA did not respond to questions about its decision to stop using the cameras, saying that the agency “does not comment on tools and techniques.” Reuters reported on the change as part of a story about budget cuts for law enforcement offices.

One former federal prosecutor expressed concern that the change would make life more difficult for DEA agents.

“The vast majority of times I viewed body camera footage is based on allegations from a defense attorney about what a cop did,” said David DeVillers, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. “And I would say 95% of the time it absolves the cop of wrongdoing.”

The Justice Department started requiring that its federal agents wear the devices in 2021 in the wake of the protests over George Floyd's death the previous summer.

“We welcome the addition of body worn cameras and appreciate the enhanced transparency and assurance they provide to the public and to law enforcement officers working hard to keep our communities safe and healthy,” then-DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a Sept. 1, 2021, press release announcing the use of the cameras.

In May 2022, then-President Joe Biden issued an executive order expanding the use of body cameras to all federal law enforcement officers.

In January, the incoming Trump administration rescinded that order, along with almost 100 others it considered “harmful.”

In early February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, was one of the first agencies to get rid of its body cameras. Subsequent videos show plainclothes immigration agents making arrests with no visible body cameras.

The DOJ wrote in a 2022 Office of Inspector General management report that the cameras were a “means of enhancing police accountability and the public's trust in law enforcement.” Studies have consistently shown that departments that use body cameras experience a drop in complaints against officers, according to the nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum, though it's not clear if the drop is due to improvements in officer behavior or to a decrease in frivolous complaints.

“Eliminating these videos is really taking away a tool that we've seen be of benefit to law enforcement practices,” said Cameron McEllhiney, executive director of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. “It's also a great teaching tool, besides keeping community members safe from the potential misconduct that could occur.”

The DOJ put a lot of money into the body camera initiative. In August of 2021, it awarded Axon, the company that dominates the body camera market, a $30.4 million contract for cameras and the software to handle the evidence they created. The contract, according to Axon, remains active. But only about one-sixth of it has been paid out, according to federal contracting data.

The most recent publicly available version of the DEA's body camera policy dates to December 2022. It only required agents to wear the devices when they were conducting preplanned arrests or searches and seizures that required a warrant. It also only required DEA officers to wear their body cameras when they were working within the United States.

Agents had 72 hours after the end of an operation to upload their video evidence, unless there was a shooting, in which case they were instructed to upload the video evidence as soon as possible. The policy laid out in detail how and by whom evidence from the cameras should be handled in the event officers used force, and it authorized the DEA to use the video evidence when investigating its own officers.

The DEA had planned to implement the policy in phases so that eventually its officers nationwide would be wearing the devices when serving warrants or carrying out planned arrests. In its 2025 fiscal year budget request to Congress, the agency asked for $15.8 million and 69 full time employees, including five attorneys, “to enable the DEA's phased implementation plan of nationwide use of Body Worn Cameras.”

Records obtained via Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington show that the Biden-era DOJ had an ambitious plan to capture agencywide metrics and data about the efficiency and use of body cameras by its law enforcement officers.

Laura Iheanachor, senior counsel at CREW, said that before federal law enforcement started wearing body cameras, several local police agencies had declined to participate in federal task forces because doing so would have forced their officers to remove their cameras.

“It's a protective measure for officers, for the public,” Iheanachor said. “And it allows state and federal law enforcement to work together in harmony.”

Ampere Computing on Tuesday quietly added several new processors to its AmpereOne family without a formal announcement or press briefings. The quiet release comes after the company was bought by Softbank. The new AmpereOne M CPUs feature a 12-channel DDR5 memory subsystem and are aimed at applications that require more memory capacity as well as bandwidth. The new CPUs feature from 96 to 192 cores and require new motherboards. 

The AmpereOne M CPU family uses a 7228-pin FCLGA socket and includes six processors with 96, 144, 160, and 192 single-threaded custom Armv8.6+ cores operating at up to 3.60 GHz and equipped with a 2MB L2 cache.

The processors also feature 64 MB of system level cache. The key feature of the new CPUs compared to their predecessors is their 12-channel memory subsystem, which supports a maximum of one DIMM per channel and up to 3TB of addressable DDR5-5600 capacity. The memory subsystem is ECC-protected using SECDED and Symbol ECC to make it suitable for cloud datacenter workloads. 

When it comes to power consumption, AmpereOne M processors consume up to 348W, and to keep their power consumption in check, these CPUs support a combination of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, adaptive voltage control, and fine-grained thermal sensors.

On the I/O front, the processor supports 96 PCIe 5.0 lanes with bifurcation capabilities down to x4 and has 24 device controllers to connect multiple accelerators, SSDs, network cards, and other high-performance components needed in AI and cloud deployments.

Ampere's AmpereOne M processors are still made on TSMC's N5 process technology, just like their predecessors, so the additional memory channels are indeed the key feature of the new CPUs. These processors can process up to 192 threads per socket, which is lower compared to AMD's 192-core EPYC 9965 CPUs, which support simultaneous multi-threading and therefore can process up to 384 threads simultaneously.

But perhaps, the purpose of AmpereOne M is not only to offer support for 3TB of memory for interested parties in the AI space, but rather to set the stage for the company's next-generation AmperOne MX processors that will feature 256 cores and 12 DDR5 memory channels. This upcoming CPU will be made on TSMC's N3 manufacturing process and therefore will add both features and performance efficiency to its list of advantages.

AMD warns that the U.S. export tariffs may hit its sales


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Late on Tuesday, AMD announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, posting its highest quarterly revenue ever. The company's results were driven by sales of expensive client and datacenter CPUs as well as improved sales of Instinct MI300-series AI accelerators. However, the company's gaming earnings dropped mainly due to the slowdown of console sales. But while the company's revenues in Q1 set records, AMD warned that the U.S. export tariffs may hit its sales by around $1.5 billion in 2025.

AMD posted a revenue of $7.438 billion for the first quarter of 2025, up 36% year-over-year. When it comes to earnings, this is the best quarter posted by AMD throughout its history. In fact, it is more than AMD earned for the whole year 2019. AMD's gross profit totaled $3.736 billion, whereas its net income achieved $709 million for the quarter (up a whopping 2,139% for the same quarter a year ago) as its gross margin hit 50%.

""We delivered an outstanding start to 2025 as year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter driven by strength in our core businesses and expanding data center and AI momentum,"" said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD chair and CEO. ""Despite the dynamic macro and regulatory environment, our first quarter results and second quarter outlook highlight the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and consistent execution positioning us well for strong growth in 2025.""

In the first quarter, AMD's Client and Gaming division generated $2.9 billion in revenue, reflecting a 28% increase compared to the same period last year. The Client subsegment contributed $2.3 billion, marking a 68% rise year-on-year, largely fueled by high interest in the latest generation of Ryzen AI processors and a product mix that included more premium parts (such as Ryzen 9000 X3D for desktops and Ryzen AI 300-series for laptops).



In contrast, revenue from the Gaming subsegment declined 30% to $647 million, mainly due to reduced contributions from AMD's semi-custom system-on-chips for Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation game consoles. Nonetheless, AMD expressed optimism about sales of its latest Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards for desktop PCs based on the RDNA 4 architecture.

AMD's Data Center division reported $3.7 billion in revenue in Q1 2025, reflecting a 57% rise compared to the same quarter last year. This sharp increase was primarily fueled by continued momentum in server processor, particularly the 5th Generation EPYC CPUs. Nonetheless, AMD says that sales of its Instinct MI300-series accelerators for AI also inreased. Specifically, AMD, highlighted new deployments of of its AI GPUs with Core42, Oracle, and Siemens.



AMD's Embedded products unit generated $823 million in the first quarter, a 3% decrease from the prior year. This decline reflected varied conditions across end markets, with some areas showing strength while others struggling. Specifically, the launch of the EPYC Embedded 9005 processors, which are being integrated into IBM's latest storage systems and Cisco's high-end network security appliances, positively affected performance of the division. In addition, AMD also began shipments of Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge SoCs. However, demand for other products was a mixed bag.

Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2025, AMD anticipates revenue to be around $7.4 billion ±$300 million. However, the company's profitability is expected to be impacted by a one-time $800 million inventory-related charge tied to the recently imposed U.S. export controls, which will lower the reported gross margin to around 43%. Without this adjustment, the gross margin would be around 54%.

A no-holds-barred fight between the current AMD and Intel flagship CPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Today, we'll put the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K in a heated contest to see which chip comes out on top. The best processor is not necessarily the one with the most number of cores or the highest clock speeds; rather, it is the one that fulfills your specific requirements and fits within your budget. Gamers do not necessarily require the highest-end chip to enjoy the latest AAA games, although having one wouldn't hurt. However, numerous compelling reasons exist for a consumer to seek to acquire a flagship processor.

You may be part of a small, elite crowd of enthusiastic gamers with the financial capacity to acquire the latest and greatest mainstream processor. Alternatively, you could be among the type of users who use their systems for more than just casual gaming, thereby warranting a more substantial investment in a processor that provides considerable processing power alongside exceptional gaming performance. The million-dollar question remains whether to choose between Intel or AMD, as both chipmakers have released highly compelling flagship processors in the current market.

AMD currently has two coexisting mainstream processor lineups in the retail market. The vanilla Ryzen 9000 (codename Granite Ridge) series was the inaugural launch, later followed by the Ryzen 9000X3D series, which incorporates AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, significantly enhancing gaming performance. Consequently, AMD has two flagship products: the Ryzen 9 9950X3D from the 3D V-Cache branch and the Ryzen 9 9950X from the main family. In contrast, Intel only has the Core Ultra 200S (codenamed Arrow Lake) series to compete against AMD, with the Core Ultra 9 285K as the singular leader of Intel's army.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D features Zen 5 execution cores and adheres to a conventional 16-core, 32-thread configuration. On the contrary, the Core Ultra 9 285K employs a hybrid design, integrating P-cores (Lion Cove) and E-cores (Skymont). Consequently, the Core Ultra 9 285K showcases a 24-core, 24-thread design. With Arrow Lake, Intel went with an approach without Hyper-Threading, so the Core Ultra 9 285K has fewer threads than the Ryzen 9 9950X3D.

Concerning clock speeds, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D exhibits a 16% greater base clock speed than the Core Ultra 9 285K. However, both processors possess identical boost clocks. For cache capacity, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is equipped with AMD's 3D V-Cache, providing a total cache of 144MB (16MB L2 + 128MB L3). On the other hand, the Core Ultra 9 285K is accompanied by a cache capacity of 76MB (36MB L2 + 40MB L3). Consequently, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has 3.2X more L3 cache, which is advantageous for gaming and specific workloads.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has a 36% greater TDP (Thermal Design Power) or, in Intel's case, PBP (Processor Base Power), than the Core Ultra 9 285K. Nevertheless, the latter features a 9% higher MTP (Maximum Turbo Power). Therefore, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has superior power efficiency to the Core Ultra 9 285K.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Core Ultra 9 285K support PCIe 5.0 connectivity and DDR5 memory. Both provide 24 high-speed PCIe 5.0 lanes to support the latest graphics cards and PCIe 5.0 SSDs. Regarding memory support, only the Core Ultra 9 285K has embraced CUDIMMs (Clocked Unbuffered Dual In-line Memory Modules), bumping the native supported frequency up to DDR5-6400. As far as conventional DIMMs are concerned, both support DDR5-5600.

Platform longevity favors the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, as the chip resides on the AM5 platform, which was launched in 2022 with AMD's commitment to providing support until 2027. On the other hand, the Core Ultra 9 285K uses the LGA1851 platform, which was released in 2024, but its life span is likely to be limited. There are indications that Intel may refresh Arrow Lake for LGA1851 before transitioning to the LGA1954 platform for forthcoming processors.

⭐ Winner: Tie

Specification-wise, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has a big L3 cache thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology and lower power consumption overall than the Core Ultra 9 285K. Another of AMD's strengths is the life expectancy of the AM5 platform, which is substantially higher than LGA1851. Investing in the platform now offers a ticket for future processor upgrades.

The LGA1851, in contrast, represents a fading platform. Arrow Lake may be the sole chip to utilize the LGA1851 platform, or possibly Arrow Lake Refresh, assuming the latest rumors are true. This is not particularly surprising, as the typical cadence for Intel sockets has consistently been two or three generations of chips, unlike AMD.

In LGA1851's defense, it is presently the sole platform that completely supports CUDIMMs. One advantage the Core Ultra 9 285K holds over the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is the possibility of leveraging CUDIMMs, such as high-speed memory DDR5-9200 and beyond. Nevertheless, considering the long life span of AM5, it is likely that full CUDIMM support will be introduced for AMD's platform in due course.

This article provides an overview of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Core Ultra 9 285K's performance metrics. We have also published in-depth individual reviews of these two CPUs, which you can refer to for more details. These graphs show the geometric mean of our gaming test results with these two CPUs at 1080p (1920x1080) resolution.

We paired both CPUs with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card to minimize potential bottlenecks. Testing at 1080p might seem irrelevant for such a powerful setup, but this resolution allows us to see the full potential of our CPUs in gaming.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D outperformed the Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming performance. This outcome was anticipated, as gaming performance is the former's most notable strength, attributable to the substantial L3 cache enabled by AMD's 3D V-Cache technology.

Cumulatively, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D yielded average frame rates that were 34% higher than those of the Core Ultra 9 285K throughout our testing suite of 16 games, utilizing a combination of High and Ultra graphical settings at 1080p. Furthermore, the AMD flagship demonstrated a 27% higher result in 1% Lows.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Core Ultra 9 285K hit the market at $699 and $620, respectively. The former presents 0.28 FPS per dollar, while the latter offers 0.23. Despite costing 13% more, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has more gaming value for your money. While the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has maintained its pricing, the Core Ultra 9 285K has dropped to $589, reaching 0.25.

⭐ Winner: AMD

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D is undoubtedly the better choice for gaming enthusiasts. While the Core Ultra 9 285K is a capable gaming processor, it falls short compared to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which is almost 35% faster in average frame rates and close to 30% faster in 1% Lows.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has consistently maintained a higher price point than the Core Ultra 9 285K. Notwithstanding the recent price reductions of the Core Ultra 9 285K, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D continues to provide better value in gaming.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D flaunts superior multi-threaded performance, but the contest is heated. The Zen 5 processor delivers a mere 3% higher multi-threaded performance than the Core Ultra 9 285K.

Looking at benchmarks individually, there are times when the Core Ultra 9 285K is substantially faster. For example, the Intel chip boasted 18% higher results in POV-Ray or 11% higher in HandBrake x265. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D also has its moments, such as in V-Ray 6, where it outperformed the Core Ultra 9 285K by 17%.

Intel continues to be the leader in single-threaded performance; however, the disparity has been narrowing, as evidenced by the current generation. The Core Ultra 9 285K achieved a 9% better single-threaded overall than the Ryzen 9 9950X3D.

The POV-Ray benchmark clearly favors the Core Ultra 9 285K, which significantly surpassed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D by an impressive 31%. Conversely, the performance delta between the two processors wasn't as big in other workloads.

⭐ Winner: Tie

There is no definitive victor in this comparison. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has higher multi-threaded performance relative to the Core Ultra 9 285K. Nevertheless, the disparity stands at merely 3%, a difference that may not be noteworthy across all workloads.

Meanwhile, the Core Ultra 9 285K is better at single-thread performance than the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, where the former exhibits a speed increase of 9% over the latter. It can be argued that a loss of 3% is more tolerable than a loss of 9%; this perspective holds validity when one prioritizes a chip for productivity purposes while overlooking gaming considerations.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K have unlocked multipliers and are ready for your manual overclocking endeavors. The quality of overclocking can vary significantly between processors, and currently, we do not possess a substantial number of samples from which to derive definitive conclusions. Our results are primarily based on our overclocking experiences with the single sample available in our lab.

In the context of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, we activated AMD's Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) functionality. For the PBO configuration, we utilized the 'advanced' and 'motherboard' power settings, accompanied by a 10X scalar adjustment and an increase of 200 MHz in the clock speed. Furthermore, we implemented a -15 all-core Curve Optimizer offset.

We've also experimented with Intel's latest '200S Boost' feature combined with some manual overclocking. But the long story short is that there isn't much practical headroom for performance gains with fabric overclocking. Intel also offers manual tuning for the P-cores and E-cores, though the actual performance gains are heavily weighted towards the latter.

⭐ Winner: Tie

Unlike the old Pentium, modern processors arrive with little headroom for serious overclocking with conventional cooling. It's a two-way street. On a positive note, you can rest easy at night knowing their chips are at or near their potential. However, on the downside, the art of extracting additional performance at no cost is slowly fading away.

On the contrary, the Core Ultra 9 285K reveals a higher power consumption during various workload scenarios. The Intel chip operates within a power range of 219W to 325W, whereas its AMD counterpart operates between 178W and 228W. Notably, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has a peak power consumption that is 30% lower than that of the Core Ultra 9 285K.

Most PCs rarely truly idle; users might leave various applications open on the desktop. There's also an 'active idle' use case wherein the user does a low-load activity, such as browsing the web or watching a YouTube video. To model this behavior, we created an active idle test (second slide) with two browser windows open (one with two tabs idling on a website and another window with a 4K YouTube video stream playing). We measure this level of activity across a 15-minute timespan.

The Core Ultra 9 285K has 30% lower idle power consumption than the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Furthermore, the Core Ultra 9 285 K's active idle power consumption during YouTube playback is particularly notable, as it consumes 39% less power.

The Core Ultra 9 285K was more power efficient in the Linpack workload, displaying a 5% lower watt-hour. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D excelled in the Cinebench 2024 workload, landing a 10% higher watts per point and a 13% lower watts per FPS in the HandBrake x265 test.

The ideal balance is performance at a reduced power consumption. To elaborate, the processor at the bottom right corner of the power efficiency charts represents the best chip in terms of efficiency. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D outperforms the Core Ultra 9 285K in multiple benchmarks.

⭐ Winner: AMD

The Core Ultra 9 285K wins at idle power consumption, but the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consumes less power under load. While both idle and average power consumption should be considered, the latter is ultimately more important since we typically use our systems under heavier use or in 'active idle' conditions rather than letting them truly idle for prolonged periods.

Furthermore, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has better power efficiency than the Core Ultra 9 285K. A power-efficient processor helps reduce system costs, including processor cooling and power supply capacity expenses. It also positively contributes to electricity savings.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D launched last month at $699. Since this processor recently came out of the oven, it's unrealistic to expect any price adjustments. Meanwhile, the Core Ultra 9 285K debuted at $620 in October 2024. Nowadays, you can find the flagship Arrow Lake chip at U.S. retailers for $589, 5% below the launch price.

Intel processors usually maintain their value until the next generation arrives. Therefore, it's unlikely that the Core Ultra 9 285K will officially get any cheaper. You may still find a retailer deal here or there.

To put things in perspective, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D's gaming performance is 34% higher than the Core Ultra 9 285K while being 19% more expensive. The Zen 5 part has a 3% multi-threaded advantage over the Core Ultra 9 285K, but the Intel chip does have up to 9% higher single-threaded performance, though.

⭐ Winner: AMD

At $699, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D may look like a scary investment. However, our results show that even with that hefty price tag, the 3D V-Cache flagship gives you more value for your money in gaming. The multi-threaded performance isn't shabby, but it does lose out to the Core Ultra 9 285K in single-threaded performance.

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D already looks good. However, its appeal will grow further when the pricing starts to decline, whether through official price reductions or retailer promotions during special events such as Black Friday.

The gaming performance of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D was never in doubt, particularly given that lower-tier Zen 5 components equipped with 3D V-Cache have already surpassed the Core Ultra 9 285K by massive margins. However, the more important question is whether the Ryzen 9 9950X3D possesses any appeal outside the gaming realm. The answer to this inquiry is yes.

In addition to being a great gaming processor, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D can double as a productivity monster, similar to the vanilla Ryzen 9 9950X. Thanks to the Zen 5 architecture and the 16-core, 32-thread configuration, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D has no issues tackling demanding workloads, as long as they benefit from multi-threading. Unfortunately, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D's single-threaded performance lags behind the Core Ultra 9 285K.

However, if you can overlook the Ryzen 9 9950X3D's single-threaded weakness, the Zen 5 chip is a fantastic all-around performer that's power efficient and offers support for the latest technology. And unlike the Core Ultra 9 285K, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D doesn't leave you feeling like you just bought an obsolete processor—at least for a couple of years.

Brings crash dump analysis into the AI era by integrating GitHub Copilot with WinDBG. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Software engineer Sven Scharmentke (AKA Svnscha) has shared a project that they say ""might change crash dump analysis forever."" The new contextual natural language conversational tool contrasts sharply with manually typing arcane commands into a terminal to analyze crash data, which is the established modus operandi of a professional software engineer, even in 2025. Svnscha goes on to assert that the new open-source tool, available as mcp-windbg on GitHub, can go deep. The AI runs a ""simply amazing"" array of WinDBG/CDB commands, boosting productivity and eradicating a once tedious task.

AI peddlers have developed large language models that initially targeted creative writing and have since moved to visual arts – graduating from hand-drawn style art and photorealistic creations to videos in recent times. AI has also made significant inroads into computer programming. However, most people want AI to leave the fun, creative stuff to humans and take the sting out of dull, soul-crushing, repetitive tasks. This seems to be where Svnscha's mcp-windbg might actually succeed.

In brief, the mcp-windbg tool enables AIs to interact with Microsoft's multipurpose debugger WinDBG. Its cunning skill is in giving LLMs the ability to execute debugger commands. And, even if you have swallowed the WinDBG manual, this AI will likely know debugger commands better than you. Copilot will probably also interpret assembly code, decode hexadecimal, traverse structures with symbols, and perform other tasks much better than you. You just have to ask the right questions.

Svnscha goes into some detail about their prior frustration in debugging crashes, the lightbulb moment to involve AI, and how the mcp-windbg tool works, all in a dedicated blog post. The software engineer humbly admits the 'hard part"" of this work was implementing the CDB (Microsoft's Command-Line Console Debugger) interaction layer, and this was done during a session ""vibe-coding with two coffees on a Saturday morning.""

However, the videos shared help encapsulate the leveraging of Copilot with CDB. There are two to watch on the linked blog, starting with a Crash Analysis and Automated Bugfix using Copilot, followed by an Automated Crash Dump Analysis of Multiple Crash Dump Files.

What you first see shows Svnscha installing mcp-windbg, then running a Windows app that crashes. Next, GitHub Copilot is fired up and asked to find the crash dump and fix the underlying code issue. ""The AI quickly identifies that the application crashed, explains which specific conditions led to the crash, and suggests a fix,"" says Svnscha.

The second video is similar but shows the tool analyzing multiple files simultaneously.

What this all means, in practical terms, is that mcp-windbg can enable natural language crash analysis, contextual debugging, and root cause identification. Svnscha believes this can be a game-changer for other software engineers, support, quality assurance, and anyone else who comes into contact with crash dumps.

""It's like going from hunting with a stone spear to using a guided missile,"" Svnscha not-too-humbly boasts. However, they remind those eyeing this new tool, that it isn't a magical coding cure-all and that a modicum of debugging knowledge is still required to make the most of what is basically a ""simple Python wrapper around CDB that relies on the LLM's WinDBG expertise.""

With the retail embargo lifting tomorrow, reviews of AMD's China-exclusive RX 9070 GRE have gone live. Hardware publication EXPreview has published its review of a custom model from XFX, providing us with insight into the card's performance and where it stands versus the competition. Positioned as an intermediary between the RX 9070 and the soon-to-launch RX 9060 XT, the RX 9070 GRE is a series of hits and misses. It trails the RTX 5070 in rasterization, and its pricing doesn't really add to its value versus AMD's own RX 9070. Around 10 days ago, the RX 9070 GRE unexpectedly became available for pre-order across major Chinese online stores. AMD later officially confirmed the card, but it is currently region-locked, with no word on when it might hit the global market. Under the hood, it carries a cut-down Navi 48 GPU wielding 3,072 Stream Processors (48 CUs) — roughly 25% fewer than the RX 9070 XT. It offers 12GB of GDDR6 memory at slower 18 Gbps speeds, but that is likely an artificial limitation. The GPU launched at 4,199 RMB ($575). For context, the RX 9070 and RTX 5070 both debuted at 4,499 RMB ($625). Saving $50 means you'll be missing out on exclusives, like RTX HDR, VSR, Smooth Motion, and MFG found on the RTX 5070, and the extra VRAM and compute power with the RX 9070 that can enable 4K gaming. The RX 9070 GRE does not have an MBA (Made By AMD) variant, similar to other RX 9070 GPUs. The model under review is the XFX RX 9070 GRE Snow Wolf, a pure-white card with a triple-fan cooler and dual 8-pin connectors. Internally, the card is equipped with 20 Gbps GDDR6 modules from Samsung, so you might be able to extract some performance gains by memory overclocking.Across a suite of games at 1440p, the RTX 5070 appears to be on average 5-10% faster than the RX 9070 GRE in raw rasterization performance. Based on our testing, we expected this to translate to a 15-20% performance gap versus the RX 9070, expanding to almost 30% versus the RX 9070 XT. The RX 9070 GRE easily outperforms the RTX 5060 Ti, which is expected with the price difference between the two. What's interesting is the raytracing performance, where the RX 9070 GRE appears to — surprisingly — keep pace with the RTX 5070 in a handful of titles.

Much of the same story repeats at 4K, where both GPUs are held down by the 12GB framebuffer. At idle, this specific RX 9070 GRE model draws 9.3W of power, jumping to 245W under load, with a peak of 317W. Once adjusted for global prices, the RX 9070 GRE's MSRP translates to roughly $500 (minus the 13% VAT). In a world where RDNA 4 GPUs were readily available, the RX 9070 GRE would've been another upsell for the RX 9070, which already acts as a stepping stone for the RX 9070 XT. That said, it's important to remember the RX 7900 GRE also launched with a steep $700 price tag in China before its global launch at $549. In any case, RX 9070 GRE GPUs, along with pre-built systems from System Integrators, will be available for purchase tomorrow in China.

Human life would be difficult to sustain without saliva. Its fundamental role in keeping the oral mucosa hydrated is essential for core functions such as swallowing, tasting, and speaking. However, recent research has revealed that saliva does far more than previously understood. Specific components may eventually serve as noninvasive biomarkers for a variety of diseases.

As with other bodily processes, the production and composition of saliva are regulated by intricate mechanisms under the control of the autonomic nervous system. The parasympathetic system stimulates the secretion of electrolytes and water via acetylcholine, while the sympathetic system regulates the release of salivary proteins through norepinephrine. External stimuli — such as smell, taste, and mastication — further influence both the volume and composition of saliva. For example, stimulated saliva contains significantly more bicarbonate but fewer proteins compared to resting saliva. Additional factors such as sex, age, time of day, medication use, and general health also affect salivary output and composition.

The moistening of the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal mucosa is essential for several vital functions. In addition to hydration, saliva contains cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that promote wound healing — often more rapidly than on skin. Among these, histatins are especially effective in accelerating tissue repair.

Saliva also plays a crucial role in innate immune defense. It contains a broad range of antimicrobial proteins and peptides — including myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and others — produced by salivary glands, oral epithelial cells, and immune cells, all of which contribute to protection against infection.

In dentistry, saliva is particularly valued for its protective effect against dental caries. Bicarbonate and phosphate ions help buffer oral pH, maintaining a range between 6.8 and 7.8. Salivary proteins bind calcium and phosphate, forming a supersaturated solution that supports the dynamic balance of enamel demineralization and remineralization — critical processes for caries prevention.

Saliva also rapidly forms a thin protein-rich layer on tooth surfaces known as the acquired pellicle. This layer protects enamel against calcium loss, mechanical abrasion, and erosion. Over time, bacterial colonization of the pellicle also influences the composition of the oral microbiome.

In recent years, research has increasingly focused on the potential of salivary components to serve as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Compared with blood sampling, saliva collection offers clear advantages: it is easier, less invasive, and more cost-effective. These features make it particularly useful in populations such as children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities.

Saliva contains a wide range of biologically active substances — including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, cytokines, and DNA/RNA fragments — that can reflect both local and systemic physiological processes. These biomarkers are being studied in connection with conditions ranging from periodontal disease and diabetes to neurological, psychiatric, and oncologic disorders.

In patients with diabetes mellitus, saliva can reveal metabolic changes, including glucose fluctuations, elevated HbA1c levels, and markers of oxidative stress. These salivary findings may also correlate with periodontal health status. Research has additionally identified alterations in lipid levels, melatonin, and total protein in the saliva of diabetic patients. In clinical dental settings, an unusual salivary profile may help flag cases of undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes — a condition known to increase the risk of periodontal disease. Timely, multidisciplinary management may therefore improve outcomes both systemically and dentally.

Psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and depression are also associated with measurable changes in salivary composition. Cortisol, a key biomarker of chronic stress, is frequently elevated in these populations. Altered levels of other markers, such as alpha-amylase and lysozyme, have also been detected in individuals with anxiety. These salivary biomarkers may provide insights into psychosomatic interactions and could support more comprehensive care strategies for patients with conditions such as bruxism or dental phobia.

Saliva has also shown promise in the early detection of malignancies, including both head and neck tumors and systemic cancers such as pancreatic and breast cancer. Tumor-associated biomarkers — such as specific antibodies, antigens, and gene mutations — can be identified in salivary samples. One molecule of particular interest is sialic acid, which is elevated in patients with certain cancers. In a recent study, Elgendi and colleagues presented a portable device capable of quantifying salivary sialic acid, yielding promising results for early breast cancer detection. This type of technology could potentially be used not only in oncology centers but also in primary care and dental practices.

These findings suggest that saliva analysis could play an important role in the future of diagnostic medicine. For dental professionals in particular, salivary diagnostics may offer a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patients, supporting clinical decision-making, and monitoring disease progression. In patients with periodontal disease, it may serve as a practical adjunct to traditional examination methods. The use of noninvasive, affordable rapid tests in everyday practice appears increasingly feasible — especially as integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to healthcare continue to gain importance.

Hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs), unlike oral contraceptives, were not linked with an increased risk for melasma in women with menorrhagia, this study found.

“The lack of a significant association between hIUDs and melasma incidence suggests that IUDs may be a better option for women concerned about dyspigmentation,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Debby Cheng, BA, Harvard Medical School, Boston, and was published online on April 24 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Dose-response relationships were not evaluated. Additional limitations included treatment adherence and potential misclassification of conditions.

Persistent hyperglycemia and elevated insulin resistance may increase the risk of worsening structural and functional cardiac damage in young individuals of mostly normal body mass index (BMI), with fat mass mediating two thirds of this association overall, and with women more adversely affected than men.

“The current findings further confirm that even healthy-looking adolescents and young adults who are mostly normal weight may be on a path toward cardiovascular diseases if they have high blood glucose and insulin resistance. Surprisingly, we observed that high blood sugar may aggressively damage females' hearts five times faster than males'; therefore, special attention should be paid to girls in terms of prevention,” the lead author said in a press release.

This study was led by Andrew O. Agbaje, Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. It was published online on April 28, 2025, in Diabetes Care.

The gold standard measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion, such as the clamp test, were unavailable, due to limited feasibility in this large epidemiological study. The findings may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups as participants were predominantly White individuals (96%). The observational nature of this study makes it challenging to establish causation, warranting further experimental studies.

ORLANDO, Fla. — For decades, patient package inserts for oral isotretinoin, the gold standard of treatment for severe acne, have advised that people avoid undergoing facial resurfacing treatments, including laser treatments, for at least 6 months after stopping the drug. 

The advice arose from concerns that this might increase the risk of scarring and delayed healing if lasers were used in combination. Dermatologists, in turn, worried about the legal risk of ignoring the advice and using lasers sooner. But many have since come to see waiting as unnecessary.

In 2017, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery published a consensus statement concluding that there is insufficient evidence supporting the packaging recommendation and that nonablative lasers and fractional devices can be safely used in patients taking isotretinoin or who have recently stopped treatment. Further, a 2024 randomized prospective split-face trial found that concurrent treatment with isotretinoin and fractional ablative carbon dioxide laser was associated with better scar outcomes than when laser therapy was delayed until 6 months after stopping isotretinoin. 

At the recent American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS) 2025 Annual Meeting, presenters offered additional evidence for the safe concurrent use of lasers and medications, including isotretinoin. Importantly, the studies enrolled people with darker skin tones, for whom laser procedures carry special concerns about hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, or worsening of scarring.

Timothy Holland, DO, dermatology resident at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, presented a small case study of three patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI, who were taking between 60 mg and 80 mg isotretinoin per day. Each underwent a series of four laser treatments for acne scars over 4 months during treatment. Laser treatment was administered on only one side of the face using a 1565-nm nonablative fractional laser.

“We used conservative treatment settings, and these were increased in a stepwise approach at every month of follow-up,” Holland said at the conference. Primary endpoints were new or worsening hyper- or hypopigmentation and scarring or worsening of existing scars. 

“Our results were great,” Holland said. “We did not see any adverse events for the treated side compared to the control side, and each patient described at least some improvement over isotretinoin.”

In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Holland explained that the results not only add to evidence supporting concurrent isotretinoin and laser treatment in patients of color but also help address a timing issue often seen in the military. “We have active-duty patients who might be at this duty station for a year but will deploy the next year and may not have access to a dermatologist. They would like us to start treating their acne scarring while they can,” he said.

Commenting at the conference about Holland's study, David Goldberg, MD, JD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said the results reflected a consensus. “Dr Khatri showed us almost 20 years ago that you can safely use an [810-nm diode] laser hair removal system within a month of stopping isotretinoin or even while they were on it,” he said, referring to a 2006 paper by Khalil Khatri, MD, New Hampshire–based dermatologist. “The evidence is there for all these nonablative devices, which is really what [Holland] showed.” 

Goldberg, who is also a lawyer, cautioned that in the event of a complication resulting in a lawsuit, plaintiff's attorneys may cite the package inserts for isotretinoin. Nonetheless, he said, “you will have no trouble finding an expert who will defend the fact that you used such a device because everybody's doing this.”

At the conference, Goldberg, too, presented evidence supporting the concurrent use of a laser treatment — in this case, a 1726-nm laser designed to treat acne — in people taking medications for moderate to severe acne. In that study, 125 patients aged 15-35 years (60% women) with Fitzpatrick skin types I-V received three laser treatments at monthly intervals followed by follow-up visitsthrough 2 years. 

Participants who were on an acne treatment regimen prior to the study were required to maintain the same dosage and routine for the first two treatments. Three were taking isotretinoin. Other participant regimens included oral antibiotics, steroids, and/or topical treatments. No unexpected adverse events from the laser treatments occurred among people taking medications or combinations of medications, Goldberg reported. 

Holland had no financial disclosures. Goldberg disclosed conducting contracted research for Cutera, the manufacturer of the 1726-nm laser used in his study.

 May 07, 2025  

Therapeutic advances over recent decades have significantly improved cure rates for pediatric cancers. However, this success has come with a growing concern: The emergence of second primary tumors in childhood cancer survivors.

A recent study led by Spanish researchers and published in Cancer Discovery shed new light on the molecular causes of these second tumors. The team identified lasting genomic changes — so-called mutational signatures — left by chemotherapy, which may play a role in the development of subsequent malignancies.

Although pediatric cancers — often referred to as developmental cancers — represent a small percentage of all cancer cases, they affect an estimated 400,000 children worldwide each year. The occurrence of two unrelated cancers in a single child is rare, but when it happens, understanding the underlying causes offers new insights into cancer initiation mechanisms. These findings could improve early diagnosis and inform future treatment and surveillance strategies in pediatric oncology.

The development of second tumors is influenced by several factors. These include the type and intensity of treatment received during the first cancer, as well as the age at initial diagnosis, genetic predisposition, and the biologic characteristics of the original tumor.

“Although we know that chemotherapy administered years earlier is associated with second tumor development, we cannot always determine whether it was caused directly by the mutagenic action of the drugs,” explained lead author Mònica Sánchez-Guixé, PhD. “What we do know is that these therapies increase the mutational burden in the child's body, which raises important questions about their long-term health impact.”

Although relatively rare, second malignancies represent a serious long-term complication of pediatric cancer treatment. According to recent clinical data and literature reviews, these second tumors tend to fall into two main categories: Hematologic neoplasms and solid tumors.

Among hematologic cancers, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes are the most commonly reported. These are strongly linked to prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy, particularly exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and alkylating agents. Lymphomas, both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin types, are also observed in survivors previously treated for other cancers.

In terms of solid tumors, the most frequently seen in childhood cancer survivors include breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and osteosarcomas. Other second cancers such as lung, colorectal, melanoma, and central nervous system tumors have also been documented, though less commonly. Less frequent still — but reported — are head and neck cancers, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and certain neuroendocrine tumors.

Using advanced whole genome sequencing techniques, the research team analyzed how second primary cancers developed in four pediatric patients previously treated for cancer.

Their findings pointed to three primary mechanisms underlying the development of second tumors in childhood:

The study highlighted that certain cytotoxic chemotherapies, especially platinum-based drugs and alkylating agents, leave behind distinct mutational signatures in non-tumor tissues. These alterations — including chromosomal deletions and translocations — can persist for years after treatment and significantly increase the risk for second malignancies.

In one of the cases studied, a child developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia 4 years after treatment for sarcoma. Genomic analysis revealed alterations consistent with chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. Across the cohort, chemotherapy-related mutational signatures were identified in approximately 25% of second tumors, particularly leukemias.

Importantly, the researchers found that the accumulation of these mutations in healthy tissues increased the risk for second neoplasms by 2.3 times. While a direct causal link cannot be established in all cases, the presence of treatment-specific genomic signatures suggests a meaningful role for prior therapy in the pathogenesis of second cancers.

Another major mechanism identified was a shared embryonic origin. In approximately 25% of cases, the two cancers were traced back to somatic mutations acquired during early fetal development — often before the fifth week of gestation. Genomic sequencing revealed shared alterations between the tumors, indicating they derived from the same early progenitor cell.

These cases suggest defects in DNA repair pathways or key tumor suppressor genes, such as RB1, may predispose some children to multiple cancers. One illustrative case involved a child who developed two distinct brain tumors, diagnosed 8 years apart, both arising from an early RB1 mutation.

The study underscored that approximately 75% of second tumors in children are attributable to either iatrogenic causes (treatment-induced) or embryologic factors. These findings are prompting oncologists and researchers to reconsider long-term surveillance strategies and treatment approaches for pediatric cancer survivors, particularly those with prolonged remission periods who later develop new malignancies.

In 50% of the cases analyzed, the second tumors did not share a genetic relationship with the primary tumor, indicating that they arose from independent mutational processes. In two of the four detailed cases, the tumors displayed distinct mutation profiles, likely acquired at different stages of prenatal development, particularly during organogenesis, and unrelated to prior cancer treatments.

These findings suggested that random DNA replication errors, unidentified environmental exposures, or inherited predispositions may contribute to the emergence of secondary neoplasms. The study authors proposed that early failures in DNA repair mechanisms could increase the likelihood of independent tumorigenic events.

This insight underscores the biologic complexity of pediatric cancer and highlights the importance of applying advanced genomic sequencing techniques to distinguish the origin and etiology of each tumor.

One of the study's most important contributions is the identification of temporal mutational signatures, enabling researchers to estimate the timing of tumor initiation using molecular clock analysis. This methodology provides new clarity on the sequence and origin of secondary malignancies.

In addition, the research identified mutations in key cancer-associated genes — including TP53, NF1, and ALK — which appear to act as shared risk factors across multiple cancer types. These discoveries open new possibilities for targeted and personalized therapies in pediatric oncology.

Although the study was based on cases from Spain, its conclusions are consistent with data from global registries, such as the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study in the United States, which reports similar patterns in the occurrence of second malignancies among childhood cancer survivors.

The research also highlighted several clinical challenges, including the urgent need to implement surveillance strategies tailored to individual mutational profiles. Such approaches aim to limit cumulative genetic damage and facilitate early detection of second cancers. Additionally, the study emphasized the potential of developing less mutagenic chemotherapies and using liquid biopsies to monitor posttreatment genomic evolution — advances that could significantly improve long-term outcomes for pediatric cancer survivors.

In a large cohort study, each additional blistering sunburn before the age of 15 years increased melanoma risk by approximately 3%, and the associated risk was not modified by personal sun sensitivity factors, such as eye and hair color.

“Our findings underscore the importance of photoprotection in all children and suggest that individuals who experience multiple blistering sunburns before age 15 years (regardless of other risk factors for melanoma) may benefit from enhanced skin cancer surveillance,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Jim Z. Mai, PhD, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. It was published online on April 24 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Over the next 25 years, the global prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is expected to grow by as much as 23%. Importantly, a majority of these cases are projected to occur in women. In the United States, an increased prevalence in women has also been reported.

Why, then, is COPD still considered a disease that mostly affects older men smokers?

“I think that we oversimplified COPD for many years as being a tobacco-related lung disease, and more men smoked tobacco,” said Jamie Garfield, MD, professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and pulmonologist at the Temple Lung Center in Philadelphia. “We saw it more in men because we were looking for it more in men.”

“While tobacco is one of the greatest risk factors for the development of the disease, today, there are people with COPD who never smoked cigarettes, the greatest proportion of whom are women,” said Garfield.

According to recent estimates, 1 in 4 people diagnosed with COPD had never smoked.

Overall, about 16 million people with COPD remain undiagnosed, and many appear to be women. As greater numbers of cases in women continue to emerge, greater recognition and diagnosis are essential.

Improving diagnosis in women means challenging common misconceptions around COPD presentation, most importantly, recognizing it as a disease that encompasses multiple and often mixed presentations vs one of two phenotypic traits: Pink puffers and blue bloaters, that are learned in medical school.

“Women tend to be younger when they present; perhaps this is part of the predilection of practitioners to diagnose asthma,” said Dawn L. DeMeo, MD, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. “They tend to have lower smoking histories, suggesting higher susceptibility. And they may manifest more shortness of breath.” In addition to shortness of breath, women are likely to report more exacerbations, added Meilan K. Han, MD, professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care at the University of Michigan Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

DeMeo underscored an important consideration for primary care specialists: Women tend to present with more (or more distinct) comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, which data have linked to COPD-related breathlessness.

Although the reasons underlying these distinct presentations are unclear, several theories have been proposed and explored.

“Women experience more rapid lung function decline over time, and some theories include the fact that their lungs and air sacs are smaller,” said Han, who is also a spokesperson for the American Lung Association, Chicago.

The rate of this decline also appears to accelerate during the menopausal transition, suggesting a hormonal component combined with other personal exposures, explained DeMeo. “The lung is very estrogen-sensitive,” she said, although the exact drivers are still in question.

Because diagnosis is often delayed or missed in women, they've historically presented with more advanced disease progression, resulting in a greater number of hospitalizations.

“Making a diagnosis of COPD early is the best thing we can do, regardless of the patient is a man or a woman,” said Garfield. “The diagnosis requires hearing the history and understanding the risk factors.”

Garfield said she asks all her patients to share more about where they were born, significant details about their birth (for example, being born prematurely), the activities they enjoyed as children, and where they traveled and when.

“Primary care doctors need to be asking patients to take them through their lifetimes, the things they do, their early- and late-life exposures, regardless if symptoms seem typical or atypical,” she advised.

In women especially, occupational exposures reveal important clues. For instance, biomass fuel for cooking and heating (most frequently observed in lower-to-middle income countries), air pollution, firewood burning or indoor smoke pollution, and regular exposure to chemicals, vapors, gas, dust, and fumes often drive COPD cases in women.

“There's data — although controversial — that would suggest that women with the same cigarette or environmental exposures as men are more likely to develop lung injury or chronic lung disease,” said Garfield.

Additionally, social determinants of health should be considered.

“We know that social determinants of health are such important drivers of lung health, for example, the intersectionality between COPD and poverty, food deserts,” DeMeo said, emphasizing that differences in presentation and severity vary not only by sex but also within groups of women.

Despite multiple but unique presentations in women, shortness of breath and frequent exacerbations are red flags that should have physicians automatically thinking of COPD.

It's equally important to consider the overlap between asthma and COPD, which can delay treatment and referral, Garfield noted.

“The key is spirometry,” said Han. “Studies suggest that women are less likely to get diagnosed with COPD and more likely to be diagnosed with asthma when doctors don't get spirometry. The opposite is also true; when doctors conduct spirometry, they tend to get it right.”

COPD costs the nation roughly $24 billion annually in direct and indirect medical costs, and that amount is expected to substantially increase within the next 5 years or so, according to Josie Cooper, executive director of the Alliance for Patient Access, a national nonprofit organization focused on policies related to patient access and patient-centered care, and head of the COPD Action Alliance, Washington, DC.

“It's also linked with a whole host of comorbid conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes,” said Cooper.

Primary care physicians are often the first point of contact for women with COPD and comorbidities. They are in the best position to not only select effective treatments or refer patients out to pulmonologists but also ensure that women who smoke are offered behavioral and pharmacological management, are fully vaccinated to prevent diseases that might cause exacerbations, and consider pulmonary rehabilitation, which can help control breathlessness and depression or anxiety.

Lack of awareness and understanding of how COPD presents and progresses in women has been a costly proposition for the medical community. The key is to catch and treat the disease as early as possible, tailor and personalize management, and recognize that COPD is more than a lifetime of tobacco smoking, especially in women.

Garfield and DeMeo reported no relevant financial relationships of interest. 

Han reported receiving personal fees from GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cipla, Chiesi, Novartis, Pulmonx, Teva, Verona, Merck, Mylan, Sanofi, Roche, Dev Pro, Aerogen, Polarion, Regeneron, Amgen, UpToDate, Altesa BioSciences, Owkin, Medscape, National Association of Colleges and Employers, MDBriefCase, Integrity, and Medwiz. She had received either in-kind research support or funds paid to the institution from the National Institutes of Health, Novartis, Sunovion, Nuvaira Inc., Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Gala Therapeutics, Biodesix, the COPD Foundation, and the American Lung Association. She had participated in Data and Safety Monitoring Boards for Novartis and Medtronic, with funds paid to the institution. She had received stock options from Meissa Vaccines and Altesa BioSciences.

Cooper reported that the Alliance for Patient Access receives financial support from AbbVie, Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Alnylam, Amgen, Amneal, ANI Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, Axsome Therapeutics Inc., Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, BridgeBio, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Glaukos, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson Healthcare Systems Inc., Lundbeck, Merck, Neurocrine Biosciences, Novavax, Novo Nordisk, Otsuka, Regeneron, Sage, Sanofi, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, Supernus, Teva, Vertex, Viatris, and Viridian.

When primary care providers are strapped for time, they could turn to an underutilized resource to help patients manage their diabetes: Pharmacists. Clinical pharmacists could be the key difference in helping patients manage their diabetes and maintain better control of their blood glucose levels.

A group of researchers recently found that a pharmacist-managed group achieved statistically significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1c) in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes over a 12-month period. 

As part of the study, which was published in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health, clinical pharmacists hired and trained by a retail pharmacy then operated within a value-based primary clinic under a collaborative practice agreement. The pharmacist served as the first point of contact for patients via in-person and telehealth visits.

“We're not replacing physicians here,” said Sashi Moodley, MD, MBA, chief medical officer of Walgreens and a co-author of the study. “We're supporting or augmenting.”

A number of other studies have also shown that pharmacist-led programs or interventions can help patients with type 2 diabetes achieve statistically significant reductions in A1C and make improvements in glycemic control.

Jodie Pepin, PharmD, a clinical pharmacist with Harbor Health in Austin, Texas, explained that pharmacists are well-suited for this role. Pharmacists are not diagnosticians, but they are experts in medication management and therapeutic use of medications.

“Pharmacists know the medications, and they can save you a lot of time,” she said.

Plus, pharmacists are also familiar with nonprescription medications and supplements that many people take and can provide guidance about potential interactions, added Leslie Helou, PharmD, senior vice president of Health Outcomes Strategy at MOBE.

Time is a precious resource in primary care. A 2022 study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine estimated that primary care providers would need roughly 27 hours per day to provide all the guideline-recommended care required by their patients, but team-based care could help.

In fact, advocates say time is a key advantage offered by a model that incorporates pharmacists into the management of patients with diabetes. The pharmacist usually has the ability to spend more time with patients than the average primary care physician (PCP).

As Pepin put it, “I'm not bound to seeing 25 patients per day or whatever quotas people are placed on.”

“What the pharmacist does is have more frequent touchpoints,” Moodley said. “It's a higher-touch model.”

Erika Horstmann, PharmD, head of Clinical Operations at Scriptology Health, agreed that patients with diabetes benefit from more frequent contact with healthcare professionals who can guide them. Many of them also suffer from other comorbidities, which may also require medications and management, and it can all feel overwhelming.

“People are just lost in the process,” said Horstmann.

With more frequent patient contact, the model can improve patient adherence.

According to Jodi Loyles, PharmD, executive director of Clinical Pharmacy and Quality at Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser Permanente includes clinical pharmacists in its care model, using a collaborative practice agreement. With prescriptive authority and expertise in medication management, pharmacists can manage medications for patients with diabetes, ensuring appropriate dosing and adherence to evidence-based guidelines.

Based on their own internal analyses, Kaiser Permanente has patient adherence rates to diabetes medications that are 20% higher than average, said Loyles.

Patients might initially be puzzled when they learn they'll be meeting with a clinical pharmacist to help manage their diabetes. Both primary care providers and pharmacists should explain the process and expectations to them at the outset.

“Then we have established a relationship, and they feel like they have an advocate to help them navigate the system a bit,” said Horstmann.

According to Daphne Smith Marsh, PharmD, a clinical assistant professor in UIC's Retzky College of Pharmacy, Chicago, patients typically respond positively to the opportunity to have frequent phone and in-person visits with a pharmacist to review their glucose measurements and get assistance with medication adjustments. Plus, some patients need some encouragement to make necessary lifestyle modifications.

“Person with diabetes value empowering language and support, particularly as daily management of diabetes is challenging,” she said.

Loyles also referred to positive feedback from patients.

“When I was working as a front-line pharmacist in a primary care clinic, I had many patients come back to me after our time together was done and they had achieved their care goals and tell me how much it changed their personal life and how they were able to manage their disease,” she said.

Pepin noted that she does both in-person and telehealth visits with her patients with diabetes. She can spend 40 minutes with them if they need that much time, and patients really seem to value the chance to have more time with a healthcare professional who can help them achieve their goals.

“Isn't that what everyone wants?” she said.

Moodley maintained that pharmacists are often underutilized. They could play a greater role in chronic disease management, working alongside PCPs and bringing their medication expertise to the table.

“We really need to start thinking more about how we incorporate pharmacists into our healthcare space,” he said, adding that reimbursement should also be a fundamental part of the discussion.

Currently, some primary care practices are set up as value-based care organizations that allow them to collaborate with a clinical pharmacist to help manage patients with diabetes. Value-based care practices are becoming increasingly common, however.

According to Lydia Nesemann, PharmD, senior vice president of Medication Therapy Management at Monogram Health, hiring a pharmacist to oversee medication therapy management is a feasible model for a value-based organization — and one that can be “an immense value-add for patients and providers alike.”

However, it will require making sure that the appropriate credentials and agreements are in place, as well as convincing leadership of the benefits.

“In general, organizations need to make a strong business case for this in-house function or role to exist,” said Nesemann.

And pharmacists can be expensive team members to add, said Horstmann.

She suggested that primary care practice leaders approach local independent pharmacies to discuss the possibility of a partnership, since they may have some flexibility. State pharmacy associations could also be potential resources for finding a partner, she added.

“Overall, the benefits go beyond just patients,” said Helou. “Providing clinical pharmacy services to your patients will not only benefit them by helping them achieve outcomes and more tightly manage their medication experiences … but it's also an added benefit to their providers and can help them improve their quality of life.”

Can the Same Model That Works for Rideshares and Food Delivery Help Address Nurse Shortages?","https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/uber-nurses-can-same-model-works-rideshares-and-food-2025a1000b17","Wed, 07 May 2025 09:17:49 GMT","



 

 May 07, 2025  

While many nurses work set schedules with occasional overtime, Martha Mendez, a registered nurse (RN) in El Centro, California, prefers a more flexible approach to patient care. It's the same way an Uber driver decides when they want to turn on their app and drive clients.

Mendez signs up for shifts days — and sometimes hours — in advance and works for multiple health systems to care for patients all over Southern California. She is one of a growing number of nurses who have joined the gig economy.

“After being in a traditional role for many years, I was looking for…more control over my career, my schedule, and my earnings,” Mendez told Medscape Medical News. “When I learned about the logistics of [gig work], it really caught my attention, and I gave it a shot.”

The use of contract or gig workers in healthcare grew 18% from 2014 to 2021, and up to 53% of nurses planned to take on more temporary nursing shifts. Nurses can register with platforms like Float Health, CareRev, ShiftMed, and Clipboard Health to choose shifts that fit their schedules.

The model, also known as per diem or float nursing, has been hailed as a potential solution to staffing shortages, allowing health systems to fill short-term staffing gaps and meet immediate patient needs.

“Every state has a nursing shortage…and that shortage is projected to increase,” said Katie Jett, DNP, RN, MSN, dean of the School of Nursing at Ponce Health Sciences University in St. Louis. “A lot of nurses don't want to work 12-hour shifts and mandatory overtime… [Gig work allows nurses] to book around their schedules or come in for a 4-hour shift, and that is very enticing.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, in Medscape's Nurse Career Satisfaction Report 2023,

Healthcare is struggling with nursing shortages, widespread burnout, and low job satisfaction, leaving health systems struggling to attract and retain nurses and fill shifts. Currently, 66% of healthcare facilities are not able to operate at full capacity due to staffing shortages.

The gig model, once limited to rideshare drivers and food deliveries, has entered healthcare.

Nurses choose a gig work platform and complete an onboarding process that often includes proof of licensure and certifications, background checks, and drug screens. Upon approval, platforms post open shifts, and nurses can claim those that match their credentials and specialties.

Mendez started picking up shifts through Float Health in 2022. She'd worked in hospital emergency rooms, medical-surgical units, and correctional facilities for more than a decade and loved being at the bedside but felt that working conditions, including mandatory overtime, were “unacceptable.”

At first, Mendez only picked up one or two shifts per month doing at-home infusions for patients and continued to work in her full-time nursing role. The option for a flexible schedule, one-on-one patient care, and higher pay led her to leave that staff role and make the switch to per diem nursing.

“There was no comparison [with pay]; I would absolutely give up a 12-hour shift to take a Float patient for a few hours,” she said. “But one of the biggest drivers is not money; it's being able to have the peace of mind that I have the balance to care for my family, not only financially, but to be there for them and offer the same care that I offer to others.”

Signing bonuses and improved compensation and benefits packages are common approaches to attracting nurses, but nurses also crave flexibility. The latest data show that 33% of nurses wanted to pick up shifts on an as-needed basis and cited the ability to work partial shifts and pick up additional work at different facilities as key areas of career interest.

The recognition that gig platforms account for a growing part of the healthcare workforce has led some health systems, including St. Louis-based Mercy Health, to create their own gig work platform.

In 2022, Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, launched Mercy Works on Demand, a cloud-based platform that enables nurses to pick up shifts. More than 50 nurses signed up for the 2022 pilot, including full-time school nurses who wanted to earn extra income and RNs who took time off to raise children but wanted to return to the bedside for a few hours per month. The internal float pool concept expanded to other hospitals within the Mercy system.

Bon Secours Mercy Health in Cincinnati followed with Andgo in 2024. The program sends text messages about available shifts and allows nurses to claim the gigs. Since going live, the hospital has seen an increase in the number of shifts picked up, resulting in decreased costs and safe patient care, according to Jodi Pahl, RN-BC, DNP, the system chief nursing officer of Workforce, Outcomes, and Experience of Care at Bon Secours Mercy Health.

Pahl points to the advantages of an internal model, citing consistent care from nurses trained within the organization and aligned with its culture and standards, adding, “These nurses are more engaged, adaptable, and cost-effective than gig workers, avoiding the high fees and variability associated with external staffing.”

Internal float pools also serve as a retention pipeline for future permanent hires.

The expanding gig work in healthcare has raised some concerns. A recent report from the Roosevelt Institute, New York City, called the model a “Wall Street takeover of US healthcare infrastructure” and warned that gig nursing platforms offer lower rates, fail to guarantee available shifts or offer certainty about the nature of the work, and fail to account for worker safety and patient well-being.

Jett is familiar with the concerns.

“We have to take it back to [patient] outcomes,” she said. “The literature is well documented that consistent care by knowledgeable nurses improves health outcomes for patients, so there's no doubt that you're more likely to get better care with a nurse that knows the unit, knows the policies, knows the procedures, has an orientation…that is the best for our patients.”

But she adds that burnout is also linked to lower patient safety, quality of care, and patient satisfaction.

There is also some debate about the fees paid to RNs who work on a per diem basis. The average rate for RNs picking up shifts through gig work apps is $59 per hour, according to the Roosevelt Institute report (compared with a median wage of $41.38 per hour), according to nurse.org. However, some apps have a bid-for-gigs model that allows health systems to hire nurses willing to work for the lowest rates. Jett called it “algorithmic wage discrimination” and noted that it can drive down rates for gig workers. In addition, nurses working as independent contractors may lack protections like sick leave and unemployment insurance.

Despite the criticisms — and the need for real solutions to address nursing shortages, burnout, and unsafe work environments — Jett believed gig work is “here to stay” in healthcare and encourages solutions that balance the needs of nurses, patients, and health systems.

“My hope is that there is a way to…provide flexibility and work-life balance and fair compensation to nurses,” she said. Gig work might be it.

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthor

 |  May 07, 2025  

In 2023, nearly 1 in 4 US adults were living with chronic pain, and 8.5% experienced pain severe enough to limit daily life or work activities. This is up from 20% and 6.9% in 2020, respectively, and reflects a broader upward trend over the past two decades.

Chronic pain — defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months — also exacts an enormous economic toll. Analyses of commercial claims data from over a million patients with chronic pain show an average annual cost of nearly $24,000 per patient. Nationally, the economic burden of managing patients with chronic pain totals more than $725 billion each year, without factoring in additional costs associated with missed work time and lost productivity.

Indeed, chronic pain is “the leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide, by a large margin,” Steven P. Cohen, MD, president-elect of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, told Medscape Medical News.

With more Americans living in pain than ever before and the condition increasingly linked to aging, chronic illness, and social stressors, Cohen and other experts are rethinking how chronic pain is managed.

Research and clinical practice should move beyond traditional models, they argued, to approaches that are more effective, sustainable, and multidisciplinary and aim not only to reduce pain but also to restore function and improve the quality of life.

There are three broad categories of pain: Nociceptive pain, which results from tissue damage like cuts, burns, or sprains; neuropathic pain, caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system, as seen in conditions like diabetic neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia; and nociplastic pain, which involves abnormal pain signal processing without clear tissue damage and includes conditions like fibromyalgia, migraine, and phantom limb pain.

David Clarke, MD, president of the Association for Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms and assistant director of the Center for Ethics at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon, prefers the term neuroplastic over nociplastic. Unlike pain stemming from structural damage, neuroplastic pain is generated by changes in brain circuitry and often linked to stress, trauma, or unprocessed emotions, he told Medscape Medical News.

“Patients know ‘plastic' means the capacity for change, so ‘neuroplastic' better conveys that there's hope for treatment,” he said. “This offers an explanation, based on neuroanatomy, showing what happens when the brain shifts to a neuroplastic state.”

A major factor driving the rise in chronic pain is the growing prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity, which have painful downstream effects, including diabetic neuropathy and orthopedic pain due to excessive weight on the hips, knees, and spine, Cohen said. Another driver is the frequency of chronic pain among cancer survivors, 20%-50% of whom experience chronic pain from either the cancer itself or secondary to surgical or treatment side effects.

The aging population is another major contributor to rising rates of chronic pain, noted Cohen, who is professor of anesthesiology, neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, and neurological surgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago. In fact, chronic pain has been called a “silent epidemic” in older adults.

David Copenhaver, MD, MPH, told Medscape Medical News that increasing employment demands may be driving stress that also contributes to chronic pain.

“The US has been called a ‘no-vacation nation' because our work hours have been increasing, without sufficient time for relaxation,” said Copenhaver, chief of pain medicine and professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine and Neurological Surgery at the University of California, Davis. The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation.

“For a long time, we understood the sensory component of pain, but we now know there's a cognitive component too,” Cohen added.

The interrelationship between depression and chronic pain is well established. A 2025 meta-analysis of 376 studies showed that about 40% of participants had depression and 40% had anxiety. Patients treated for chronic pain should be routinely screened for mental health conditions, the authors recommended.

For decades, the mainstay of chronic pain management relied heavily on pharmacologic treatments. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and — in more severe cases — opioids.

While these medications can provide relief, they often come with significant side effects, limited long-term efficacy, and, in the case of opioids, a risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, and death. As awareness of these limitations has grown, so has the push toward safer, more sustainable alternatives.

Recent clinical guidelines increasingly emphasize nonpharmacologic approaches as first-line treatments for chronic pain.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies as the preferred management strategies for chronic pain, citing their favorable benefit-risk profiles.

Similarly, the American College of Physicians advises starting with interventions such as physical therapy, exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mindfulness for conditions like low back pain.

The American College of Rheumatology also prioritizes lifestyle and mind-body therapies over medications for osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, underscoring a growing consensus around multidisciplinary, integrative care.

These guidelines reflect a growing recognition that chronic pain is not solely a physical condition — it also involves deeply rooted emotional and cognitive components. As a result, there is a new emphasis on psychological interventions as core elements of chronic pain management.

Psychological interventions including CBT, mindfulness-based approaches, and hypnotherapy are showing promise not only in improving coping and function but also in altering pain processing in the brain itself.

CBT is one of the most established techniques and works by helping patients reframe maladaptive thoughts and behaviors through cognitive restructuring and reappraisal. It addresses not only the emotional and behavioral responses to pain but also the lifestyle factors that may contribute to its persistence.

Biologically, it has been shown to increase the expression of endogenous opioid endorphins, reduce proinflammatory markers like interleukin 6, and modulate neural circuits involved in pain perception.

Other mind-body therapies also show promise. Hypnotherapy, for instance, induces a focused, altered state of consciousness that allows patients to reprocess the sensory and emotional components of pain while enhancing relaxation, coping skills, and self-efficacy.

Mindfulness-based approaches train patients to observe their pain with nonjudgmental awareness. This practice has been associated with changes in brain regions involved in pain processing, regulation of pain-related neurotransmitters, and modulation of the autonomic nervous system.

Neuroplastic recovery therapy (NRT) is a method used by Clarke and his colleagues that is rooted in the idea that some forms of chronic pain are generated within the brain itself, “analogous to phantom limb pain,” Clarke explained.

Some patients find it reassuring that their pain originates in the brain rather than in damaged physical structures, he added.

“We ask patients to shift attention to the brain and away from the body part that hurts,” he explained, “and [to] think about what life stressors from the present or past — including early childhood adverse experiences — might be responsible for those symptoms.” Next steps involve digging deeper into past traumas and screening for other contributing factors like depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress.

Some research has shown NRT to be superior to other approaches in providing relief from chronic pain. One study compared 12 weeks of NRT with either mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques or usual care. At 26 weeks, 63.6% of the NRT arm reported being pain-free vs 25.0% and 16.7% of mindfulness-based stress reduction technique and usual care groups, respectively.

Another study compared neuroplastic-oriented therapy known as emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) with CBT in older veterans with chronic pain. Overall, 63% of those in the EAET group had clinically significant posttreatment pain reduction vs just 17% of those in the CBT group.

While psychological therapies are a key piece of the puzzle, experts emphasize that no single intervention is sufficient for every patient. Chronic pain is a multifaceted condition that often requires a tailored, multidisciplinary approach.

Daniel Clauw, MD, professor of anesthesiology, medicine (rheumatology), and psychiatry at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, advocates for treatment plans that integrate patient education, lifestyle modifications, psychological support, management of comorbidities, and both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies.

Beyond psychosocial interventions, nonpharmacologic modalities such as physical exercise, improved sleep hygiene, chiropractic care, yoga, and tai chi also play a significant role.

These approaches aren't just adjunctive, Clauw said, they're supported by evidence demonstrating their ability to modulate nociceptive signaling, enhance descending pain inhibition, influence mood and emotional processing, promote neuroplasticity, and reduce central sensitization.

As interest in nonpharmacologic therapies continues to expand, neuromodulation has emerged as a distinct and rapidly advancing area within pain medicine. This approach encompasses noninvasive, minimally invasive, and surgical electrical therapies that aim to modify neural activity and alleviate pain.

In a recent review of chronic pain interventions, Cohen examined a range of neuromodulation techniques and emphasized the need for further research to determine their short- and long-term effectiveness, potential to reduce healthcare utilization, and the characteristics of patients most likely to benefit.

While device-based therapies aim to alter how pain signals are transmitted, researchers are also looking further upstream into the biology of pain itself for new therapeutic targets and the development of potential pharmacologic agents.

One particularly intriguing line of investigation in people with congenital insensitivity to pain may hold clues to unlocking novel, highly specific pain treatments, said Copenhaver.

Studying these individuals is exciting “because it helps uncover new molecular targets, particularly sodium channels, which sit on top of or within nerves that conduct pain signals.”

Copenhaver's lab is investigating agents that block pain-specific sodium channels. One of them is a toxin derived from South American tarantulas, with a high selectivity for human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7.

Other labs are pursuing similar targets, Copenhaver noted. One such example is suzetrigine, a selective inhibitor of a voltage-gated sodium channel called Na 1.8 expressed primarily in peripheral pain-sensing neurons and absent from the central nervous system, which may reduce its potential for addiction.

This first-in-class drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2025 for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain in adults.

“Suzetrigine is the first new pain medication to receive FDA approval in 25 years,” Cohen said. However, its arrival should be “greeted with cautious optimism” because pivotal studies may contain methodological flaws, including the choice of surgery (bunionectomy and abdominoplasty) and the restriction of timepoints to the first 48 hours post-surgery, he noted.

“These factors limit how much the findings can be generalized to more common and invasive surgeries, where postoperative pain persists longer,” Cohen said.

Suzetrigine is not currently approved for chronic pain, and its potential role in this setting remains unclear. In a study of suzetrigine for painful lumbosacral radiculopathy, the drug was not superior to placebo, but it does have “potential opioid-sparing properties and might be used together with opioids to reduce reliance on opioids,” he added.

Copenhaver is a recent speaker for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Cohen is anticipated to take on a consultant role with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clauw reported consulting for Aptinyx, Daiichi Sankyo, Intec, Lundbeck, Pfizer, Regeneron, Samumed, Teva, Theravance, Tonix, Virios, and Zynerba and receiving research funding from Aptinyx, Cerephex, and Pfizer. He reported being involved in litigation testifying against opioid manufacturers in the states of Oklahoma and Florida. Clarke declared having no relevant financial relationships; donating book royalties, speaking fees, consulting fees, and faculty salaries to the nonprofit organization (Association for Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms); and receiving no salary for his presidency at the organization.

Older adults who present to the emergency department (ED) with anaphylaxis may be more likely than younger adults to be hospitalized and to have medications or intravenous contrast as triggers, a study showed. Older patients also may be less likely to receive epinephrine from emergency medical services (EMS).

“Improved education is needed to enhance anaphylaxis recognition and timely epinephrine use in older adults,” the authors of the study wrote. “Given their higher risk of severe reactions, multidisciplinary guidelines should support proper outpatient follow-up and self-injectable epinephrine prescriptions after ED visits or hospitalization.”

Ronna L. Campbell, MD, PhD, with Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on April 22 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.

The study had a retrospective design, relied on electronic health records, and was conducted at a single tertiary center with a predominantly White population. 

The research was supported in part by the Mayo Clinic Summer Research Fellowship Program. Campbell declared consulting for Bryn Pharma. A coauthor reported receiving funding from federal agencies and Diagnostic Robotics.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injection and midurethral sling surgery yielded comparable symptom improvement in women with mixed stress-urgency urinary incontinence (MUI) at 6 months, a multicenter randomized study found. Surgery led to insignificantly better outcomes in the Mid-urethral Sling vs Botox A (MUSA) trial conducted by Heidi Harvie, MD, MBA, MSCE, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and colleagues.

“[Stress-urinary incontinence] SUI is most common, followed by MUI and [urgency urinary incontinence] UUI,” said Harvie. “In the United States, MUI affects an estimated 30% of women by 60 years of age. Women with urinary incontinence typically report that UUI is more bothersome than SUI, and the combination of both is more bothersome than either UUI or SUI alone.” Of the two, MUI is the more challenging to treat.

Published online in JAMA, the MUSA trial recruited 150 women (age, 27-87 [mean, 59] years; about 55% White) from seven clinical centers in the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). All had moderate to severe MUI with an average of seven leakage episodes per day and had not responded to conservative treatments, such as lifestyle changes and exercise, or oral medications.

From July 2020 to September 2022, participants were randomly assigned to receive either an intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U (focusing on the urgency component) or midurethral sling (focusing on the stress urgency component). Of these, 137 received treatment, with last follow-up in December 2023.

OnabotulinumtoxinA recipients could receive an additional injection between 3 and 6 months, and all participants could receive additional treatment (including crossover to the alternative intervention) between 6 and 12 months.

The primary outcome was a change from baseline in Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) scores (range, 0-300) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included a UDI change at 3 and 12 months, irritative and stress subscores of the UDI, urinary incontinence episodes, predictors of poor treatment response, quality of life, and global impression outcomes. In addition, adverse events, use of additional treatments, and cost-effectiveness were evaluated.

Both groups showed mean improvement in the UDI total score at 6 months with no significant difference in scores between groups.

Rates of surgical revision (1.5%), vaginal mesh exposure (2.9%), and short-term postprocedural urinary catheter use (11.8%) in the sling group were similar to those reported in other studies. In the onabotulinumtoxinA group, 2.8% required intermittent self-catheterization 2 weeks post-procedure.

“Midurethral sling surgery and onabotulinumtoxinA are both good options for improving MUI symptoms. However, these patients can be difficult to treat with one therapy,” Harvie told Medscape Medical News. She hopes the findings will potentially help inform treatment decisions and shared decision-making based on patient preference in partnership with clinician recommendations.

As for the economic side, her group is currently planning a cost-effectiveness analysis of the two approaches.

In an accompanying editorial on the study, obstetrician-gynecologist Brittany L. Roberts, MD, and colleagues at the Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, agreed that shared decision-making should ultimately guide therapeutic strategy. “Because 45% of patients had another therapy within a year, it underlines that mixed urinary incontinence is a chronic disease and may require new treatments over time,” they wrote. “Future studies should explore this concept and examine the impact on the utilization of healthcare resources and patient satisfaction.”

Roberts' group pointed out that the “clinical conundrum” of this mixed condition affects 1 in 4 women older than 65 years. “The personal and societal costs of incontinence are significant,” they wrote. By age 80, 20% will undergo surgery for SUI or MUI.

While physical and behavioral therapies improve both types, medications are standard treatment for urgency. “When conservative treatment fails, conventional guidance has been to treat the urgency before the stress component because anti-incontinence surgical procedures can worsen urgency incontinence and many urgency treatments are medical rather than surgical,” they wrote. Another strategy has been to treat whichever symptom is dominant.

Results from the Effects of Surgical Treatment Enhanced with Exercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence (ESTEEM) trial revealed that both groups, surgery with or without behavioral and physical therapy, reported improved urgency symptoms, findings substantiated in prior cohort studies.

“While the original hypothesis of ESTEEM was that treating both components of mixed urinary incontinence with behavioral and physical therapy plus sling would result in better patient outcomes, ESTEEM revealed that urgency symptoms can improve with the midurethral sling alone, challenging previously held beliefs about the impact of anti-incontinence surgeries worsening the urgency component of mixed incontinence,” Roberts and associates wrote.

They further pointed out that combined findings from MUSA and ESTEEM revealed that the pathophysiology of stress and urge incontinence are likely intertwined. “For example, both patients and clinicians have difficulty discerning which type of leakage patients have, particularly when the incontinence is severe.” With better diagnostic clarity on urgency and stress incontinence phenotypes, more specific advice maybe offered to individuals on what to treat first.

While the MUSA trial positioned both interventions in equipoise, they have significant differences. OnabotulinumtoxinA can be administered in the clinic or operating room and requires no incision but insertion of a cystoscope. Sling surgery is performed in the operating room and typically requires three small incisions. Slings are meant to be a permanent intervention, while onabotulinumtoxinA injection must be repeated as its effects wear off.

So why not perform a sling surgery and give onabotulinumtoxinA at the same time? A randomized trial of 78 patients posing this question found that compared with sling alone, combined therapy did not show greater symptom improvement at 3 months. Additionally, the combined therapy group engaged in more self-catheterization and had more urinary tract infections.

This study was sponsored by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s Office of Research on Women's Health. Harvie reported receiving grants from the NICHD and NIH. Several coauthors reported receiving similar grants from government and other research-funding bodies such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; being employed by the NIH; or receiving research grants, royalties, and consulting or advisory fees from private sector companies.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello, everyone. This is Dr Bishal Gyawali, from Queens University, Kingston, Canada, continuing with our Skills Lab series on how to interpret the clinical trial publication well. In the past few videos, we have discussed the methods section and we touched briefly on surrogate endpoints.

This is a pretty big topic, so we will continue discussing surrogate endpoints today.There is much confusion about surrogate endpoints. There are several questions that people ask about surrogate endpoints. In these videos, we're trying to answer those, but it may not be comprehensive. If you want to get a comprehensive understanding of almost all the questions regarding surrogate endpoints in oncology, I highly recommend you read this publication, which we have recently published and is open access.

Continuing with surrogate endpoints, we discussed in the last presentation about how to differentiate between prognostic and predictive surrogate endpoints. Today, let's talk about how we classify and define them. 

We classify them in different ways, and one of those ways is surrogate endpoints in the setting of early cancer drug trials, as in neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting trials, and in advanced-setting trials. Within the advanced setting, we have different types of surrogate endpoints, such as response rate, clinical response, partial response, and overall response rate, as well as progression-free survival. 

These are usually defined on the basis of criteria known as RECIST. RECIST stands for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and that's classically what almost every clinical trial uses to define the surrogate endpoints in the advanced setting.

First, let's talk about the goal of the RECIST criteria. Why was this developed in the first place? It was not developed to make therapeutic decisions or intended for drug approvals. The whole idea around RECIST was to help clinical trials define success or lack of success early on, without the need to wait for overall survival.The goal was to make those decisions about whether these should be tested in a phase 3, from a phase 2, and so on. You can read the RECIST publication in detail, but briefly, to classify under RECIST, you need a target lesion. There are conditions on what can classify as a target lesion and what cannot.

Progression of disease, or PD, is classically defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the maximum tumor diameters, with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or a development of a new lesion that was not there before, or death of the patient. Any of these will classify as disease progression, so we classically keep talking about progressive disease as a 20% increase in the size of the tumor. 

Complete response, as the name indicates, is complete disappearance of all lesions. Partial response is shrinkage in the sum of the maximum tumor diameters by at least 30%. Anything in between, meaning the tumor size has decreased less than 30%, or the tumor size has increased less than 20%, is called a stable disease. Anything in between disease progression and partial response is stable disease. 

Overall response rate, sometimes called objective response rate,isthe complete response rate plus the partial response rate, so the percentage of patients who had any response is the overall response rate. We also measure the duration of response, which is the duration after achieving response until the tumor starts to grow again. 

There are also some other, what I call make-believe, meaningless endpoints. For example, people talk about the clinical benefit rate, which is theoverall response rate plus the stable disease rate. The idea is that if the disease does not progress, then that's a clinical benefit. These do not correlate with any meaningful endpoint. People should not focus on the clinical benefit rate. 

Why we're defining this is to see why t hese surrogate endpoints do not necessarily correlate with overall survival or quality of life: (a) because these were not intended to be used as such; and (b) the way we define them is quite arbitrary. As you can see, there is nothing magical that happens at 20% progression or 30% shrinkage of the tumor.

You can imagine that if a person has a disease progression of 18% vs 22%, that's not going to cause any meaningful difference. A disease might grow by only 10%, but if it's at a sensitive location, such as intracranial, then it could lead to some symptoms. Not all disease progression events will be the same; therefore, they do not correlate with clinical endpoints. 

Now let's talk about the early cancer trial setting. In the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, we have endpoints such as disease-free survival, invasive disease-free survival, event-free survival, metastasis-free survival, relapse-free survival, andpathologic complete response. 

Pathologic complete response deserves a special mention because it's used more as a prognostic marker. It's not reliable as a predictive marker, but it's reliable as a prognostic marker. That means, irrespective of how you achieve pathologic complete response, you'll have a good prognosis. That does not necessarily mean that a drug that improves pathologic complete response will improve survival.

Event-free survival is basically disease-free survival, but in the neoadjuvant setting. Of course, it's not feasible to go through the definition of each and every endpoint here, so again, if you want to have a more comprehensive understanding, I refer you back to that publication where all these endpoints are defined. 

Another way of defining endpoints is that there can be response-based endpoints, such as the objective response, complete response, partial response, and pathologic complete response that we talked about, vs time-to-eventendpoints.This is important because they are measured and analyzed in a different statistical way. 

Time-to-event endpoints are any endpoints that are measured in terms of the time it takes for the event to happen. This includes disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and metastasis-free survival. All of these are time-to-event endpoints. 

Let's spend some time talking about response rate because it's getting more and more frequently used in clinical trials and also as a basis for approval, but it's a very weak surrogate. The correlation with overall survival is even weaker than progression-free survival. 

The other interesting thing about response rate is that there is no way to define success. If we are measuring response rate in a phase 2 or a single-arm trial, is a 30%response rate enough? Is a 50% response rate enough? Is a 20% response rate enough? In how many patients? In 50 patients? In 40 patients? There is no way to define success here. As I mentioned, this was not meant for approval or clinical use. This was meant for transitioning from phase 2 to phase 3.

In fact, we did a comprehensive study on the response rate of placebo in randomized controlled trials of cancer drugs. You'd expect that placebo would have a 0% response rate, but we were surprised to find that even placebo had a 1% response rate. Complete response rate was, of course, zero with placebo.

When you put that in context with what we're approving nowadays, this is 1% response rate overall. There were some typical examples. For example, I'm showing this trial in renal cell carcinoma where interferon was compared with placebo. In this particular case, placebo had a higher response than the drug. The response from the drug was 4.4% and placebo had a 6.6% response rate. 

In another example from desmoid tumors, placebo had an overall response rate of 20%. If you compare that with some of the drugs that we have approved on the basis of response rate, like a 12% response rate in the CheckMate 032 trial, a 15% response rate in the EZH-20221 trial, and a 70% response rate in KEYNOTE-224. 

These are not good enough response rates, but we're approving drugs on the basis of these very small response rates. We need to be very careful. I think that, even if we were to rely on the response rate, it has to be in the context of a randomized trial where we're comparing the response rate of the drug against the response rate of the comparator arm. Just relying on the response rate in a single-arm trial is very likely to give us false positives. 

Let's also talk about progression-free survival. We talked about progression-free survival in the last video, but I'd also like to mentionthat there are some specific occasions where progression-free survival absolutely cannot be relied on, such as in later-line therapy trials or in situations where the prognosis is so bad that survival events happen within a year. 

For example, if we're talking about second- or third-line cholangiocarcinoma, in pancreatic cancer trials, patients have a median survival of 6-8 months — and not even 6 monthsif we're talking about second or third line. 

In that situation, there is no sense to use progression-free survival because you can measure survival so quickly, and there is no point in having a drug that does not improve survival. When the prognosis is very short, especially for later-line therapy trials, progression-free survival cannot be used.

For combination therapies, when we are combining drug A plus B vs drug A alone, of course if we combine two drugs, it will extend progression compared with one drug alone. The point to ask is whether combining up front is better than giving the same drug sequentially. Only overall survival can answer that.

For maintenance therapies, these are situations where we continue on a treatment for a long time, where the standard of care actually is to do no treatment. If you're giving an active drug instead of not giving a drug, of course you'll extend progression. Does that lead to improved survival outcomes and should we subject all of our patients for that extended duration of treatment? In these situations, progression-free survival cannot be used.

Let's spend some time on the adjuvant setting as well. In the adjuvant setting, I find it even trickier to rely on a surrogate endpoint, such as disease-free survival, as opposed to overall survival. In the adjuvant setting, by definition, we're treating all the patients, some of whom may not need treatment and some of whom may not benefit from treatment, but 100% of the patients will get toxicities.

In this particular example, in this Kaplan-Meier graph, at the 2-year landmark, 22% of the patients have relapsed or died even after getting the drug. There are 67% of patients who did not relapse even if they only received placebo. We are benefitting only that small margin of patients, that 11% of patients who benefited from getting the drug. Again, in this situation, we should also ask whether the patients who received placebo in this trial actually received the drug when they relapsed and how it affected overall survival.

We had this publication where we advocate to use the approach of three E's — evidence, ethics, and economics — to decide whether or not treating all the patients upfront on the basis of disease-free survival or surrogate endpoints is better than treating only the patients who relapse at the time of their relapse.

That ends our video for today. In the next video, we'll continue discussing some additional considerations about surrogate endpoints.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Chronic pain affects 150 million people across Europe, according to the European Pain Federation. That is approximately the population of France and Germany combined. This burden drives countless patients to seek help first from general practitioners, incurring substantial costs to patients and healthcare systems, potentially reaching €12 billion annually. That includes direct medical expenses, out-of-pocket costs, and productivity losses due to absenteeism and reduced work capacity. Bigger still is the physical and mental cost patients endure. People with chronic pain experience a lower quality of life, an increased risk for mental health problems like depression and anxiety, and often face social isolation and a reduced ability to participate in daily activities.

While managing the physical symptoms of pain is essential, a critical, often overlooked, factor contributes to its persistence: The intricate and powerful link between stress and the experience of pain. Despite evolving scientific understanding and clinical guidelines advocating for a biopsychosocial approach to pain, this crucial connection may not be consistently addressed during early consultations with nonspecialist healthcare professionals.

Pain specialists see the consequences firsthand.

“In my experience, this is incredibly common,” Ashley Simpson, MBChB, consultant orthopedic surgeon specializing in peripheral nerve injuries at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, London, England, told Medscape Medical News. “A significant portion of the chronic pain patients I see had clear psychosocial stressors, such as high anxiety and unresolved emotional distress, early on that went unaddressed.”

Research supports this observation, with one review finding that psychological factors were associated with pain becoming chronic in 83% of studies. This missed opportunity represents a critical junction where early intervention could potentially prevent acute pain from embedding into a chronic condition.

The scientific understanding of pain has moved beyond viewing it solely as a direct signal of tissue damage. Instead, researchers now understand the nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord, as a dynamic alarm system whose sensitivity can be modulated by various factors, including stress. In chronic pain, this system often becomes hypersensitive, reacting strongly even to minor stimuli.

Sandrine Géranton, PhD, principal research fellow at University College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News that chronic stress, whether psychological (anxiety or trauma), physiological (poor sleep or inflammation), or environmental, can significantly amplify this sensitivity.

“There are shared neural substrates between pain and stress,” David Finn, PhD, professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at the University of Galway, Galway, Ireland, said. “Some of the same brain regions and circuitry within the central nervous system mediate both stress and pain, and so maladaptive alterations in that circuitry due to stress can give rise to sensitization within the somatosensory system, which ultimately can lead to chronic pain,” he told Medscape Medical News.

The opposite is also true. Persistent pain itself acts as a potent stressor, disrupting sleep, mood, work, and relationships, feeding this cycle of sensitization.

Despite the compelling evidence, the integration of this biopsychosocial understanding into initial patient encounters remains often overlooked. Frontline healthcare professionals face significant time constraints, often prioritizing immediate symptom management or investigation of obvious structural issues.

Patients with chronic pain frequently present having received purely biomedical assessments and treatments, such as repeated scans or a focus solely on strengthening exercises, without ever having the stress or psychological component discussed. This is not necessarily a failing of the individual clinician but a reflection of systemic pressures, historical training biases toward biomedical models, and patient expectations often centered on a physical “fix.”

The consequence, as highlighted by both the clinical and scientific experts, is a missed opportunity. Patients may leave consultations without understanding why their pain persists despite a lack of clear physical findings, potentially feeling dismissed or believing their pain is purely physical when stress is a major contributor. This lack of early psychoeducation and acknowledgement of the stress-pain link can hinder their ability to adopt effective self-management strategies and make the pain much harder to treat later.

Simpson shared some key concepts healthcare professionals should help their patients understand early.

Integrating a stress-informed approach is feasible even in short consultations:

These steps, though seemingly basic, are “profoundly important,” Simpson said. “They help the patient not only physically but psychologically by preventing fear and despair from taking hold.”

“It is important to listen carefully to a patient who is saying that they feel stressed or anxious and to take that seriously,” Finn said. “Be aware of the possibility that if that's not addressed early, it can exacerbate pain-related conditions or contribute to the development of chronic pain.”

Géranton reinforced the importance of the integrated approach. “You really need to look at it as one package and never separate the sensory aspect from the emotional aspect of the pain experience.”

Simpson, Géranton, and Finn reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Lining the shelves of American supermarkets are food products with chemicals linked to health concerns. To a great extent, the FDA allows food companies to determine for themselves whether their ingredients and additives are safe.

Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels. Instead, companies can use broad terms such as “artificial flavors.”

In 1958, Congress mandated that before additives could be used in foods manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances ""generally recognized as safe,"" which came to be known simply as GRAS.

As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder. Over time, ""the loophole swallowed the law,"" said a 2014 Natural Resources Defense Council report.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to close or tighten the GRAS loophole. He has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end ""the mass poisoning of American children.""

Whether changes come from the FDA or the food companies, it's clear Americans are becoming more concerned about what they're buying.

More people are landing in the hospital with cannabis-related problems-and for many, a mental health condition is the primary issue, according to a new study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.

The study, conducted in Arizona, found that between 2016 and 2021, cannabis-related hospital visits across the state rose by 20%. Among those visits, one quarter ended up with a primary diagnosis of a mental health condition, including bipolar disorder, depression, and psychotic disorder. That compared with only about 3% of visits unrelated to cannabis.

Overall, people with a cannabis-related hospital visit were nearly eight times as likely to have a primary diagnosis of a mental health disorder. And the link between the two grew stronger over the five-year study period.

The reasons for the rising rate of cannabis-related visits are unclear, according to lead researcher Madeline Meier, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University, in Tempe, Ariz.

But, she said, legalization of non-medical (recreational) cannabis use is not to blame: Arizona legalized non-medical use for adults in late 2020, with sales beginning in 2021-too late to explain the trends seen during the study period.

On the other hand, Meier said, medical use of cannabis was legal in Arizona throughout the study period. So it's possible that easier access to the drug is partly responsible for the trends her team found. Meier noted that when states have less-restrictive policies on medical cannabis-such as making it available in dispensaries rather than pharmacies-that can make it easier for any adult to get the drug.

The findings also raise other key questions: Why do so many people with cannabis-related hospital visits have a mental health condition, and why is the connection between the two growing stronger over time?

""There are many possible explanations, and this study can't address them,"" Meier said. But based on other research, she said, one possibility is that cannabis use led to mental health conditions in some people. Another is that some people were using cannabis to treat mental health symptoms-and that tendency increased over time.

If that's the case, Meier said, it points to a need for better public education. ""I think it's important for people to be aware that the science on using cannabis to treat mental health problems is really not there yet,"" she said. ""In fact, there is evidence suggesting that cannabis use can worsen mental health conditions, or even increase the risk of developing them.""

The study also found some interesting patterns related to age: Older adults (age 65 and up) showed a bigger jump in cannabis-related hospitalizations between 2016 and 2021, versus other adults. And the growing tendency for those hospitalizations to be linked to mental health conditions was most pronounced among older adults.

That's not necessarily surprising, Meier said, given Baby Boomers' permissive attitudes about cannabis use. But, she added, older adults may need particular education about the potential risks of using the drug-including the fact it is much more potent (and potentially intoxicating) these days, compared with the cannabis of decades ago.

New research suggests that low testosterone could be more than a hormonal issue; it might also raise a man's risk of developing painful kidney stones.

Study: Older age and low testosterone levels are independently associated with kidney stone prevalence in men: results from a large cross-sectional study. Image Credit: Om Yos / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the International Journal of Impotence Research, researchers examined whether serum testosterone concentration is independently associated with the presence of kidney stones in adult men.

Kidney stones are a growing global health concern, with prevalence rising worldwide and occurring two to three times more often in men than in women. These stones can cause severe pain, disrupt daily life, and frequently recur even after treatment. Testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, has been proposed as a potential factor in stone formation, but research findings remain inconsistent. Some studies have found elevated testosterone levels in men with kidney stones, while others, including large population-based surveys, have reported lower levels. Many earlier studies were constrained by small sample sizes or reliance on self-reported stone history (introducing recall bias), highlighting the need for further research to clarify this relationship.

Researchers analyzed data from 3,234 men who participated in routine health checkups between 2010 and 2020 at a university hospital in Seoul, South Korea. All participants were at least 20 years old and completed blood tests, kidney–ureter–bladder radiography (KUB), and abdominal ultrasonography on the same day. Men receiving androgen therapy, those with kidney abnormalities or tumors, and those taking diuretics were excluded.

Morning blood samples were collected after fasting to measure serum testosterone levels. Stone detection used a combination of ultrasonography and radiography, which improves accuracy compared to using either method alone. Stones were identified as echogenic structures with acoustic shadowing, which indicates clinically relevant kidney stones (≥3 mm in size, as smaller stones without shadowing were excluded).

The study also considered various health indicators such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), calcium, albumin, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). Researchers applied logistic regression models to evaluate associations and adjusted for all relevant confounding factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the testosterone cutoff most predictive of kidney stone presence. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Out of the 3,234 men included in the analysis, 178 (5.5%) were diagnosed with kidney stones. The participants had a median age of 53 years and a median serum testosterone level of 4.7 nanograms per milliliter. The optimal testosterone threshold for predicting kidney stones was identified as 3.33 nanograms per milliliter (higher than thresholds linked to hypogonadism symptoms like low libido or erectile dysfunction), providing a sensitivity of 24.7% and specificity of 80.6%.

Initial analysis without adjusting for confounders showed that both older age and low LDL cholesterol levels were associated with kidney stones. However, once the analysis controlled for all relevant health variables, only older age (OR = 1.029 per year) and testosterone levels below 3.33 nanograms per milliliter remained significantly linked to kidney stones. Men with testosterone below this threshold had 65.5% higher odds (OR = 1.655) of having kidney stones compared to those with higher levels.

Previous research has produced mixed findings. Small case–control studies often reported higher testosterone in men with stones, while larger surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), found the opposite. Those studies that identified an inverse relationship between testosterone and stones tended to include men over 40 years of age.

This study supports the notion that low testosterone levels may play a role in kidney stone formation. One explanation may lie in shared lifestyle risk factors, such as reduced physical activity, lower water intake, and higher protein consumption, all of which are known to increase the risk of kidney stones. Dehydration has been strongly associated with stone formation, and studies have shown that men with lower physical activity are more likely to develop stones. Diets high in protein may also contribute to both reduced testosterone and increased stone risk.

Although LDL cholesterol initially appeared to be a predictor, its significance disappeared after adjusting for other variables. This highlights the importance of comprehensive analysis in identifying true risk factors. While the study focused on a single hospital population, it avoided common biases by using imaging to detect stones rather than relying on patient memory. The large sample size and detailed data adjustment strengthen the findings.

To summarize, this study found that men with serum testosterone levels lower than 3.33 nanograms per milliliter (a threshold distinct from hypogonadism criteria) were significantly more likely to have kidney stones. This relationship held true even after accounting for other health indicators, including age, blood pressure, and metabolic factors.

These results suggest that testosterone may play a protective role against stone formation. Clinicians might consider monitoring testosterone levels as part of kidney stone risk assessments. Further research using long-term observational data or clinical trials is needed to determine whether testosterone replacement therapy can reduce kidney stone risk or if low testosterone is a symptom rather than a cause.

Adding tomato and mixed fruit juices to children's asthma treatment led to better symptom control and happier, healthier lives, without side effects, say Thai researchers in a new clinical trial.

Study: Effectiveness of an antioxidant-rich diet on childhood asthma outcomes: A randomized controlled trial. Image Credit: Africa Studio / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal BMC Nutrition, researchers evaluated the effects of an antioxidant-rich diet on asthma outcomes in children.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. The prevalence and incidence of asthma have steadily increased in various age groups over the past decades worldwide. In 2012, asthma prevalence was 9% in children aged 6–12 in Bangkok, Thailand. Given the chronic nature of the illness, asthma patients require long-term disease management.

However, medication adherence, particularly with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), remains a significant challenge. Oxidative stress contributes to inflammatory processes in the airways of asthmatic patients. As such, an antioxidant-rich diet may augment asthmatic outcomes, but evidence on antioxidant-rich diets and asthma control is scarce.

Unique Juice Blend: The intervention used a precisely formulated mix of 64% tomato juice combined with strawberry, passion fruit, and orange juices, a combination designed to maximize antioxidant synergy while appealing to children's taste preferences.

In the present study, researchers examined clinical outcomes, pulmonary function, and serum antioxidant levels in asthmatic children in Thailand. Asthmatic children registered at an outpatient department of two primary care settings in southern Thailand were enrolled between October 5, 2021, and May 11, 2022. Eligible patients were aged 4–15 years, with physician-diagnosed moderately or mildly persistent asthma and ICS treatment within the past two years.

Individuals were excluded if they had an airway infection within the past four weeks, acute asthmatic exacerbation within the past three months, chronic diseases (psychiatric, renal, neurological, pulmonary, or cardiovascular conditions), or consumed high doses of supplements like lycopene, ascorbic acid, or beta-carotene in the past three months. This study was a randomized, parallel, controlled trial spanning eight weeks.

Participants were randomized to the intervention or control group. The control group received conventional usual care, whereas the intervention group received usual care and mixed fruit and tomato juices. Participants completed a questionnaire on sociodemographics, asthmatic clinical data, history of related allergic conditions, and medication use.

Further, a modified asthma control test (ACT) was administered. An ACT score ≥ 20 indicated well-controlled asthma, while a score below 20 indicated uncontrolled or partially controlled asthma. The Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) was also administered. Pulmonary function was tested using a mobile spirometer.

Further, serum antioxidants (ascorbic acid, lycopene, and beta-carotene) were measured. Measurements and questionnaires were administered at baseline and the end of the trial (eight weeks later). Fisher's exact test was used to assess the correlation between the intake frequency of the antioxidant-rich diet and the level of asthma control. Student's t-test was used to examine the associations between serum antioxidants and asthma control level.

The study also assessed the palatability and adherence to the juice intervention. Participants in the intervention group were instructed to consume tomato and mixed fruit juice daily, and compliance was carefully monitored.

In total, 48 and 33 participants were randomized to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Of these, 80 completed the trial, as one control group subject was lost to follow-up. However, only 46 subjects (29 intervention and 17 control participants) had complete measures of serum antioxidants. No adverse events were reported with the antioxidant-rich diet.

Advanced Lab Analysis: Serum antioxidant levels were measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), a gold-standard method ensuring precise quantification of lycopene, beta-carotene, and vitamin C.

Baseline sociodemographic characteristics were comparable between groups. Mean pulmonary function test results differed between the two groups at baseline, although these differences were not statistically significant. The team observed a non-significant difference in the frequency of consumption of vegetables, fruits, and juices between participants with well-controlled and uncontrolled asthma.

Baseline levels of serum antioxidants were non-significantly different between participants with uncontrolled and well-controlled asthma. At the end of the trial, the ACT score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Likewise, PAQLQ also showed a significantly higher change in the intervention group than in controls. ICS use was not different between the intervention and control groups.

Notably, there were no significant differences in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25%–75%), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and percent of FEV1/FVC between the two groups. Although serum antioxidant levels in the intervention group showed slight increases, particularly for beta-carotene, only the within-group change for beta-carotene was statistically significant; however, the difference between intervention and control groups was not significant. No serious adverse events were identified; only two subjects complained of abdominal bloating or nausea.

Importantly, compliance with the juice intervention was high, with 95.8% of the intervention group consuming at least 75% of the expected total juice volume. Approximately half of the participants rated the juice as favorable or most favorable in terms of taste, supporting the palatability and practicality of this dietary approach.

The authors noted several limitations, including the small sample size (due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic), the short duration of intervention, and incomplete blood sample data for some participants. Additionally, most children had only mild asthma at baseline, which may have limited the ability to observe changes in pulmonary function or ICS usage.

The study was conducted at two primary care settings in southern Thailand, which may affect the generalizability of the findings beyond similar healthcare environments.

In sum, the consumption of tomato and mixed-fruit juices for eight weeks improved asthma symptom control and quality of life in children. Serum beta-carotene increased within the intervention group, though this was not significantly different compared to controls. However, pulmonary function, ICS usage, and between-group antioxidant levels were unaffected by the intervention. High compliance and favorable palatability were observed, and only mild, transient side effects occurred. Given these findings and the study's limitations, mixed fruit and tomato juices may be a well-tolerated adjuvant non-pharmacological intervention for childhood asthma, though larger and longer-term studies are warranted.

A recent study conducted by researchers from Universidad San Francisco de Quito and Johns Hopkins University has revealed critical insights into the mental health of healthcare providers in Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Published in journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, this research examines the balance between compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress among healthcare professionals working in public institutions across Ecuador, a low-and middle-income country. 

The study surveyed 2,873 healthcare providers from 111 public institutions across 23 provinces in Ecuador between February and July 2022. Using the Professional Quality of Life Scale Version-5 (ProQOL V5), researchers assessed self-reported levels of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. Key findings include high compassion satisfaction (84.9%), moderate burnout (57.1%, higher in the Amazon), and moderate secondary traumatic stress (59.6%), that correlated with burnout levels. 

The study also highlighted significant differences based on gender, professional roles, and geographic regions. Male healthcare providers exhibited slightly higher burnout levels than their female counterparts, while physicians reported the highest burnout rates compared to other professions such as nurses and first responders. 

These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted mental health policies and interventions to support healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries like Ecuador. Despite high levels of compassion satisfaction, many professionals are grappling with moderate burnout and secondary traumatic stress, which can impact both their well-being and the quality of care they provide."" 

Dr. Michelle Grunauer, lead author

The research calls for additional studies to explore factors contributing to burnout in resource-constrained settings and emphasizes the importance of developing mental health legislation tailored to the needs of healthcare providers in Ecuador and similar countries.

Rich in unsaturated fats and packed with bioactive compounds, pecans are gaining attention in clinical research, not just for their flavor, but for their role in preventing chronic disease. Pecans or Carya illinoinensis are a type of tree nut native to North America and have been cultivated and consumed for centuries, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico.1

Although pecans are known for their rich, buttery flavor and versatility in various dishes, including pies and confections, emerging evidence suggests that they are more than a culinary indulgence. In fact, pecans are a nutrient-dense food with demonstrated health benefits and, as a result, are increasingly being explored for their role in clinical nutrition, particularly in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.2–4

With a growing emphasis on whole foods in disease prevention, understanding the clinical implications of pecan intake is relevant for the general population, as well as athletes and healthcare professionals seeking evidence-based dietary interventions.

Pecans are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), which comprise over 70% of their total fat content.2 Pecans are also an excellent source of plant-based protein, dietary fiber, essential vitamins such as thiamin (B1) and tocopherols (vitamin E), as well as minerals including magnesium and zinc.3,5

In addition to macronutrients and micronutrients, pecans are abundant in bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, ellagic acid, and phytosterols, which have been associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and lipid-lowering properties.1,3 These attributes make pecans compatible with dietary patterns emphasizing cardiovascular and metabolic health, such as the Mediterranean diet.2,3

Pecans have been extensively studied for their cardioprotective effects, particularly in improving lipid profiles and reducing inflammation. One randomized controlled trial reported that individuals who consumed a pecan-rich diet for four weeks experienced significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels while maintaining high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.4

The mechanisms underlying these effects are likely linked to the high content of unsaturated fats and phytosterols, which inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption.2 Pecans have been shown to enhance endothelial function, a key factor in cardiovascular health. Additionally, improvements in flow-mediated dilation and reductions in markers of oxidative stress have also been observed, further supporting their inclusion in heart-healthy diets.2

Pecans may moderate glycemic response and improve insulin sensitivity, particularly in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. Previously, a controlled feeding trial reported that participants consuming 42 grams of pecans daily exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and reductions in fasting insulin levels over four weeks.1

The fiber and unsaturated fat content in pecans slows gastric emptying and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, which can benefit prediabetic individuals or those with metabolic syndrome. Previous studies have reported that pecans led to a lower glycemic load without impairing glucose homeostasis, thus supporting their safe inclusion in diets for prediabetes management.2

Pecan consumption has also been associated with increased satiety, potentially due to their fiber and fat content. This satiety-promoting effect may reduce subsequent energy intake and improve glycemic control through appetite regulation.6

Emerging clinical evidence suggests that nut consumption, including pecans, may have neuroprotective benefits. Higher tree nut intake has been associated with better cognitive function in older adults, particularly in domains such as memory and executive function.7

These effects are likely mediated by pecans' antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Rich in vitamin E, polyphenols, and ellagic acid, pecans counteract oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are implicated in age-related cognitive decline.8 Although specific randomized controlled trials on pecans and cognition remain limited, observational studies and mechanistic insights support their potential to promote brain health.

For athletes and physically active individuals, inflammation and oxidative stress are critical concerns during recovery. Consuming pecans has been shown to reduce the levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers after exercise, thus suggesting improved recovery outcomes for athletes.3

Previous studies have also suggested that polyphenolic compounds in pecans act as antioxidants by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated during intense physical activity. The antioxidant activity of pecans can minimize muscle damage and accelerate recovery, particularly in endurance sports and resistance training contexts. The magnesium and zinc content in pecans also supports muscle function and repair.1,5

Despite being energy-dense, pecans may support weight management when consumed in moderation. Clinical studies have reported that nut consumption is not associated with weight gain, likely due to mechanisms such as increased satiety, incomplete fat absorption, and enhanced thermogenesis.6

For example, one study involving daily pecan consumption over eight weeks did not report significant weight gain or increases in body fat percentage. Rather, these study participants reported increased fullness and satisfaction, which may contribute to better portion control and reduced caloric intake at subsequent meals.8

The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a mediator of systemic health. Nut consumption has been found to increase the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, which are associated with improved metabolic and immune health.9

SCFAs like butyrate play a critical role in gut barrier integrity and anti-inflammatory signaling. By fostering a more diverse and beneficial microbial profile, pecans may contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases linked to gut dysbiosis.

Pecans can trigger severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, in susceptible individuals; therefore, those with known nut allergies must avoid pecans entirely.

Pecans are calorie-dense, providing approximately 200 kcal for every one ounce or 28 grams serving. For individuals managing caloric intake or weight, portion control is essential.

Individuals at risk of kidney stones should also moderate their nut consumption due to the oxalate content in nuts. Although moderate oxalate content in pecans may warrant caution, no clinical studies have directly linked pecans to kidney stone formation.

The high vitamin E content in pecans may interact with anticoagulant medications such as warfarin, potentially increasing bleeding risk. Patients on these medications should consult healthcare providers before significantly increasing pecan intake.5,11

Pecans are a nutrient-rich, functional food supporting cardiovascular health, glycemic control, cognitive function, inflammation reduction, and modulation of gut microbiota. These effects make pecans a valuable dietary component in public health nutrition and athletic recovery strategies.

A moderate daily intake of 30-50 grams of pecans, which is equivalent to approximately 1-1.5 ounces, has been used effectively in clinical trials without adverse effects. However, additional long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to fully understand the potential role of pecan consumption in chronic disease prevention and health maintenance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New predictive algorithms improve early detection of undiagnosed cancers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250507/New-predictive-algorithms-improve-early-detection-of-undiagnosed-cancers.aspx","Wed, 07 May 2025 16:07:00 GMT","

Two new advanced predictive algorithms use information about a person's health conditions and simple blood tests to accurately predict a patient's chances of having a currently undiagnosed cancer, including hard to diagnose liver and oral cancers. The new models could revolutionise how cancer is detected in primary care, and make it easier for patients to get treatment at much earlier stages. 

The NHS currently uses prediction algorithms, such as the QCancer scores, to combine relevant information from patient data and identify individuals deemed at high risk of having a currently undiagnosed cancer, enabling GPs and specialists to call them in for further testing. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London and the University of Oxford have used the anonymised electronic health records from over 7.4 million adults in England to create two new algorithms which are much more sensitive than existing models, and which could lead to better clinical decision making and potentially earlier diagnosis of cancer. 

Crucially, in addition to information about a patient's age, family history, medical diagnoses, symptoms, and general health, the new algorithms incorporated the results of seven routine blood tests (which measure a person's full blood count and test liver function) as biomarkers to improve early cancer diagnosis. 

Compared with the existing QCancer algorithms, the new models identified four additional medical conditions associated with an increased risk of 15 different cancers including those affecting the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Two additional associations were also found for family history with lung cancer and blood cancer, and seven new symptoms of concern (including itching, bruising, back pain, hoarseness, flatulence, abdominal mass, dark urine) were identified as being associated with multiple cancer types. 

These results showed that the new algorithms offer much improved diagnostic capabilities, and in fact are the only ones currently which can be used in primary care settings to estimate the likelihood of having a current but as yet undiagnosed liver cancer. 

These algorithms are designed to be embedded into clinical systems and used during routine GP consultations. They offer a substantial improvement over current models, with higher accuracy in identifying cancers - especially at early, more treatable stages. They use existing blood test results which are already in the patients' records making this an affordable and efficient approach to help the NHS meet its targets to improve its record on diagnosing cancer early by 2028.""

Dr. Carol Coupland, senior researcher at the Queen Mary University of London and Emeritus Professor of Medical Statistics in Primary Care at the University of Nottingham, and co-author, said: ""These new algorithms for assessing individuals' risks of having currently undiagnosed cancer show improved capability of identifying people most at risk of having one of 15 types of cancer based on their symptoms, blood test results, lifestyle factors and other information recorded in their medical records. They offer the potential for enabling earlier cancer diagnoses in people from the age of 18 onwards, including for some rare types of cancer type.""

With the right care and attention, you can keep your unit running efficiently while also extending its lifespan.

To help you get the most out of your investment, this article presents five practical tips that can make a real difference. Incorporate these into your routine, and your unit will continue to perform reliably for years to come.

Dust accumulation can gradually affect your unit's efficiency and performance. If left unchecked, it can block vents, reduce cooling effectiveness, and even lead to overheating or corrosion. To prevent these issues, regularly clean the unit's exterior to remove visible dust and debris.

For harder-to-reach areas, use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner, especially around ventilation openings and fans. Making a habit of checking and cleaning for dust at least once a week helps keep your unit running at peak performance while minimizing unnecessary strain on its components.

Consistent cleaning also improves energy efficiency, which can lead to lower operational costs over time.

While condensation is a normal part of refrigeration, allowing excess water to accumulate in your fridge unit can lead to long-term damage. Too much moisture can promote mold growth and harm essential components, ultimately affecting performance and lifespan.

To prevent these issues, make it a habit to manage condensation daily. Using the drainage plug to remove excess water is a simple yet effective step with significant benefits. This routine not only helps maintain a clean and hygienic environment but also safeguards the unit's internal mechanisms from potential water damage.

The condenser fan plays a crucial role in keeping your unit's cooling system running efficiently, ensuring that stored products remain at a stable and safe temperature.

If airflow is obstructed, the unit has to work harder to maintain performance, leading to higher energy consumption and a reduced lifespan. To prevent these issues, regularly check the fan area for dust or debris and make sure nothing is blocking airflow. Keeping the fan clean and unobstructed helps your unit run smoothly and efficiently.

Proper ventilation is essential for keeping your unit running efficiently and in good condition. When dust and debris clog the ventilation holes or condenser, the unit has to work harder than necessary, leading to higher energy consumption and faster wear and tear. Over time, this can result in costly breakdowns.

Regularly checking and cleaning these components is a simple yet effective way to maintain optimal performance and extend your unit's lifespan.

Even with regular cleaning, professional maintenance is key to ensuring your unit's longevity. Over time, components can experience wear and tear that may not be immediately noticeable.

Scheduling an annual inspection with a qualified technician allows for a thorough assessment, ensuring all systems are functioning correctly and addressing minor issues before they turn into major problems.

Preventative maintenance not only protects your investment but also improves operational efficiency. Catching potential issues early helps prevent unexpected breakdowns that could disrupt workflows and lead to costly repairs.

This proactive approach keeps your unit running reliably year-round while extending its lifespan. B Medical Systems' expert technicians are available to provide specialized care and guidance tailored to your unit's specific needs.

By incorporating these five simple tips into your routine, you can significantly extend the lifespan of your B Medical Systems unit. Regular cleaning and ongoing minor maintenance help prevent major issues before they arise.

Not only does this reduce the risk of costly repairs, but it also ensures your unit operates reliably—safeguarding the integrity of its valuable contents. A little consistent care goes a long way in maintaining efficiency and performance for years to come.

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 4, on April 2, 2025, titled ""Fisetin ameliorates vascular smooth muscle cell calcification via DUSP1-dependent p38 MAPK inhibition.""

In this study, researchers at Johannes Kepler University Linz found that fisetin, a natural substance found in fruits and vegetables, helps protect blood vessels from hardening, which is a common problem in older adults and people with kidney disease. This discovery highlights fisetin's potential to prevent vascular calcification and reduce cardiovascular damage caused by aging and chronic kidney disease.

The research, led by first author Mehdi Razazian and corresponding author Ioana Alesutan, focused on vascular calcification-a condition in which blood vessels stiffen due to calcium deposits. This process is common in aging and chronic kidney disease and increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Using human and mouse study models, the researchers tested fisetin's ability to prevent this calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), which play a key role in maintaining vessel health. Fisetin, known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, significantly reduced calcium buildup and calcification markers under stress conditions that mimic disease.

The team also discovered that fisetin suppresses activity in a signaling pathway called p38 MAPK, which is known to promote calcification. This effect depends on a protein called DUSP1. When DUSP1 was blocked, fisetin could no longer protect the cells, showing that this protein is essential for its anti-calcification activity. The researchers confirmed fisetin's protective effects in isolated mouse arteries and in living mice treated with high doses of vitamin D, which typically increases arterial calcification.

""Mechanistically, fisetin requires the phosphatase DUSP1 to inhibit p38 MAPK in order to mediate its protective effect on VSMC calcification.""

Importantly, the researchers tested fisetin under conditions similar to human disease. When VSMCs were exposed to blood serum from kidney dialysis patients-a condition known to trigger vascular calcification-fisetin again reduced calcium buildup and protected the cells. These findings suggest fisetin could be useful in countering the harmful vascular effects seen in chronic kidney disease.

This study adds to growing evidence that fisetin may protect blood vessels from aging-related damage. While more research is needed before it can be used in clinical treatments, the study highlights fisetin as a promising candidate for slowing or preventing vascular calcification. The findings could have broad implications for aging populations and individuals with kidney disease, who are at greater risk for heart problems due to vascular stiffening.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mental health diagnoses rise sharply among publicly insured children","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250506/Mental-health-diagnoses-rise-sharply-among-publicly-insured-children.aspx","Wed, 07 May 2025 02:44:00 GMT","

In the first comprehensive investigation into the trends of mental health diagnoses among children with public health insurance, a new study reports the percentage of mental health and neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses increased substantially in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Researchers from Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta used Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program claims data to analyze trends in mental health and neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses among nearly 30 million publicly insured children ages 3-17 across 22 U.S. states from 2010-19.

The study, which was published in JAMA on Thursday, found the percentage of children diagnosed with such disorders in each year rose from 10.7% to 16.5% during this period. After accounting for population changes over time, this translated into an increase of 6.7 percentage points.

The size of the increase is alarming and clinically significant on its own. But it is even more concerning that we saw this increase and our last year of data was 2019, when we know from other sources that mental health among children continued to decline after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Janet Cummings, PhD, lead author, professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health

""Our data represents a significant number and percentage of the children in our communities. These increases in both the number and rates of children being diagnosed with mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders have important implications for chronically underfunded mental health systems that have already been struggling to meet the needs of this vulnerable population,"" Cummings says.

""As mental health diagnoses among children increase,"" Cummings continues,""we must make sure the systems that support them have enough resources to address their challenges and help them get better. Mental health is foundational for a child's development, and investment in the systems that serve children with public insurance is critical for their well-being, their life trajectory and their long-term success.""

A quarter of women who gave birth in metropolitan France and were surveyed reported that they were treated disrespectfully during childbirth and/or while staying in the hospital after giving birth. 

Among the 7,332 women surveyed in the Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica study, 1,888 reported that they experienced words, gestures, or attitudes that shocked, offended, or made them feel uncomfortable from health care professionals. They were more frequently nulliparous, had a high education level, a birth plan, and an instrumental or cesarean birth. Women with psychiatric history or prenatal psychological distress were also more likely to experience disrespectful care.

Disrespectful care was also reported more frequently when women breastfed. 

""Professionals should welcome women's birth plans as a means of communicating their wishes and should treat them with respect, even when medical complications arise,"" the authors wrote. ""This study highlights the need for the healthcare system to further develop training for healthcare professionals and consider a thorough overhaul of its functioning to foster an environment where more women experience respectful maternity care.""

Announcing a new article publication for Zoonoses journal. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the tick-borne severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), is a disease that is endemic to East Asia and has mortality rates reaching 30%. Despite its substantial public health impact, no vaccines or antiviral treatments are currently available. The SFTSV genome encodes key structural proteins, including glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and nucleocapsid protein (NP), which serve as critical vaccine targets.

This article reviews the current status of SFTSV-related vaccine platforms—such as viral vectors, inactivated viruses, DNA, mRNA, and protein-based approaches—and highlights the immune responses elicited by these platforms against key antigens, particularly glycoproteins and NP. Future research directions are additionally proposed to accelerate the development of effective SFTSV vaccines by leveraging insights from existing studies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Breakthrough treatment boosts survival after severe blood loss","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250506/Breakthrough-treatment-boosts-survival-after-severe-blood-loss.aspx","Wed, 07 May 2025 01:10:00 GMT","

A team of researchers has made a significant breakthrough that could save countless lives in emergencies involving severe blood loss. Their new treatment involves activating a protein called PKC-ε soon after intense bleeding occurs. In their studies, this approach tripled survival rates, increasing them from 25% to an impressive 73%. Additionally, the treatment helped maintain healthy organ function by boosting cellular energy levels, offering hope for improved outcomes in emergency trauma care.

Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the IDF Medical Corps have discovered a promising new therapeutic approach to treating hemorrhagic shock, a life-threatening condition caused by severe blood loss that remains the leading cause of preventable death in trauma cases globally. The study, led by Dr. Ariel Furer and Dr. Maya Simchoni, from the Institute for Research in Military Medicine a joint project between Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Medical Corps demonstrates that activating Protein Kinase C epsilon (PKC-ε) significantly improves early survival rates and physiological stability following severe hemorrhage.

In a carefully controlled experiment using a porcine model, researchers induced hemorrhagic shock by withdrawing 35% of the animals' total blood volume. Animals treated with a PKC-ε activator peptide just five minutes after the onset of bleeding showed dramatically improved survival—73% of treated subjects survived compared to only 25% of those left untreated. Additionally, treated animals maintained significantly better cardiovascular stability, including blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, all critical indicators of effective response during severe trauma.

Moreover, detailed analysis of mitochondrial activity revealed enhanced function within the heart tissues of animals receiving the PKC-ε activator. As mitochondria are vital cellular energy producers, these findings suggest that activating PKC-ε helps maintain organ energy levels under stress, potentially protecting tissues against further damage associated with severe blood loss.

The implications of this study are far-reaching. Current therapeutic strategies for severe hemorrhagic shock often involve fluid resuscitation, which can unintentionally exacerbate tissue damage by triggering ischemic-reperfusion injury. This new approach—administering a PKC-ε activator peptide—has the potential to significantly minimize these detrimental effects, thereby improving survival chances and reducing complications associated with severe trauma.

Dr. Ariel Furer commented on the broader implications: ""Massive hemorrhage remains one of the most critical challenges faced in emergency medicine, particularly in battlefield and civilian trauma scenarios. Our findings suggest that activating PKC-ε can be a highly effective therapeutic approach, potentially transforming trauma care by providing frontline medical responders with a powerful tool to improve patient outcomes.""

Published in the prestigious journal Scientific Reports, this study marks a critical step forward in trauma medicine. However, Dr. Furer notes that further clinical research is necessary before this treatment can be widely adopted in clinical settings.

""Our findings open new avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies that can be administered by first responders in emergency settings, potentially saving countless lives worldwide,"" concluded Dr. Furer. ""Future clinical trials will be essential to validate these promising results and to move towards practical implementation.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New AI approach speeds up antiviral discovery for human enterovirus 71","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250506/New-AI-approach-speeds-up-antiviral-discovery-for-human-enteroviruse280af71.aspx","Wed, 07 May 2025 02:20:00 GMT","

Artificial intelligence algorithms have now been combined with traditional laboratory methods to uncover promising drug leads against human enterovirus 71 (EV71), the pathogen behind most cases of hand, foot and mouth disease. The study, published today in Cell Reports Physical Science by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, showed that reliable antiviral predictions can be made even when only a modest amount of experimental data are available. 

Using an initial panel of 36 small molecules, the investigators trained a machine learning model to spot certain shapes and chemical features that help stop viruses, scoring each compound's likelihood of blocking EV71. The authors put their AI-chosen shortlist to the test: out of eight compounds, five successfully slowed the virus in cell experiments-about ten times more hits than traditional screening methods usually deliver.

""We are collapsing what used to be months of trial‑and‑error into days,"" said César de la Fuente, PhD, a Presidential Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Microbiology, Bioengineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Chemistry. ""The approach is especially powerful when time, budget or other constraints limit the amount of data you can generate up front."" 

EV71 infections can escalate from mild rash and fever to severe neurological complications, particularly in children under seven and immunocompromised adults. No FDA-approved antivirals currently target the virus. 

All five confirmed results were tested using computer simulations, which showed that they stuck to certain spots on the virus, findings which could help future researchers stop the virus from changing shape and entering cells. 

We see this as a template for rapid antiviral discovery. Whether the next threat is another enterovirus, an emergent respiratory pathogen or a reemerging virus like polio, our AI-driven method shows that, even with limited data, machine learning can accelerate the development of effective solutions and drive a swift response to future outbreaks.""

Carli Lloyd had six months to figure out her National Soccer Hall of Fame speech. However, since fellow Hall of Famer Alexi Lalas told her she would be a first-ballot inductee during a surprise visit at her home in New Jersey, she has worked to find just the right words.

Her speech at the induction ceremony on Saturday was surprisingly unguarded for a player who had built her entire professional persona around her aloof strength. It was a rare moment of vulnerability that almost didn't happen.

“I wanted to stand up there and not explain to people, but just show people that this is all of the things that were going through my mind in my professional career,” Lloyd told The Athletic. “This is everything that I had to deal with, that I had to navigate from a human standpoint.”

Call it whatever you want — explaining, showing — Lloyd revealed more on that stage in Frisco, Texas, than she ever has before. She grappled with many of the same ideas during her final months as a player: What it took to make it to multiple World Cups and Olympics and the cost of a single-minded focus on soccer.

“Everything that I do and say comes from my heart,” Lloyd said, “whether that's the popular thing or the not-so-popular thing to say. I don't say things for clicks or for likes or for people to write about me. Everything is what I'm feeling in that particular moment.”

That's Lloyd, to a T. She hasn't changed, not really. We're just seeing a little more of her these days.

“I'm not all of a sudden a new Carli Lloyd,” she said. “I was that person pre-professional career, and then had that professional career of just going into another zone for 17 years, of being that person, that emotionless machine.

“That was my fight or flight. That was my way of surviving. I didn't want to let people in, and I didn't want to. I couldn't necessarily trust people. People would chop you up. That's just how I felt. So maybe that's why fans, the media and some of my teammates and coaches had that reluctance with me, of really not understanding me.”

Lloyd has grappled with this tension of wanting to be understood before.

In 2021, during her final days as a professional athlete, she told The Athletic, “What people don't understand is to reach the heights that I have, I almost had to be emotionless.” She compared it to fight or flight then too, and spoke about being emotionally numb.

There's more clarity now, though, almost four years on.

Lloyd's still a runner, and she used the alone time on her runs to get her thoughts in order, including preparing a mental draft of the speech: “My love for the game, and all that stuff,” she said, calling it obvious. “I love the game. I work hard. I do this, I do that. Everybody knows that about me.”

She was on a flight when she realized what she wanted to accomplish with her speech. She started writing it in her notes app: “Was it all worth it?”

“That was something that I really wanted to share because I've never spoken about it,” Lloyd said. “You know me, I was never vulnerable. I've never shown any type of weakness.” In that same 2021 interview, she was asked if she was happy — a related, but fundamentally different, question from whether it had all been worth it.

“What I kept coming back to again and again was one simple question,” Lloyd began in her speech before a litany of questions to her past self. “Was it all worth it? Was it worth dedicating my entire youth to soccer? Was it worth being so ruthless on myself when things didn't go well? Was it worth having my life be consumed by the game? Was it worth the guilt of taking time off, or feeling like I hadn't trained enough? Was it worth all the sacrifices — missing funerals, birthdays, holidays, weddings and other important milestones? Was it worth allowing a trainer into my life that, over time, created a wedge between me and my family for over a decade?”

At this question, a moment of levity interrupted: Lloyd's six-month-old daughter let out a happy squeal in the audience.

“Thank you, Harper,” Lloyd said with a smile.

“Was it worth putting my husband second? Was it worth being so intense, so obsessed every single day of my career? Was it worth not allowing myself to fully enjoy some of the most meaningful moments, out of fear that I might slip backwards? And the biggest question of all: was it worth putting off starting a family?”

Lloyd's rift with her family has been well documented, a 12-year estrangement that came to a close when she cut ties with her long-time personal trainer James Galanis. The shutdown prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic helped her hit pause and opened her eyes.

“The control, the manipulation, the brainwashing, driving a wedge through my family. All of these things that I didn't see or I didn't have the opportunity for life to slow down for me to see, I saw it all. I was going back and back, and the person you trust with your life, you think someone that is in your life for that long is going to do right by you, and it was the total opposite,” Lloyd said about Galanis in an episode of Kickin' It in 2023.

Only four years before, in an article for The Players' Tribune, Lloyd had detailed how Galanis had become her personal coach in the wake of being cut from the U.S. youth national team before a minor international tournament in 2003. “I'll train you free and won't charge your parents anything,” Lloyd recounted Galanis saying at the start of their relationship. “But you have to dedicate your entire life to this. If I call you at 10 p.m. on a Saturday, and I tell you to come to the field, are you going to come?”

For years, she did. “The truth is,” Lloyd said in her Hall of Fame speech, “the path of a professional athlete can be incredibly lonely.”

Even her mother, Lloyd said, hadn't fully understood what she had struggled with throughout her career, how deeply she had felt the sacrifices.

“It felt freeing,” Lloyd said this week. “It felt so good to be standing up there, on my terms, in one of the biggest moments of my career, being able to share.”

In some ways, the boundaries between Lloyd the person and Lloyd the player have collapsed, but mostly she is not afraid of any consequences anymore — even if, for years, they probably wouldn't have happened, or worse, been self-imposed.

Lloyd called herself a “black sheep” of the USWNT plenty of times over the years, but she revisited one of the early moments in her national team career this week — the fallout from the 2007 World Cup goalkeeping selection by then head coach Greg Ryan — as a defining moment.

The short version: Hope Solo had started the first four games of the tournament but Ryan made the call to start Briana Scurry in the semifinal against Brazil, and the USWNT lost 4-0. Solo criticized the decision in public comments after the match. Lloyd was still new to the team; she's entirely uninterested in litigating who was right and who was wrong, but on the human level, she felt sad for Solo.

“Everyone shunned Hope. We didn't allow her in the team meal. We didn't allow her to fly home with us. Nobody stood next to her in a pool recovery workout. We're talking about some public comments, but that was the length of it,” Lloyd said. She felt awful, seeing Solo without any support network. So she supported her, because she felt like it was the right thing to do. But she still feels like that sets her apart from the rest of the team.

“I became the person that didn't follow the crowd, and didn't support everybody else,” Lloyd said.

Maybe it was self-inflicted, she noted, but that's where she started thinking she was on the outs with the USWNT. Teammates looked at her differently, and the coaching staff handled her a little more hesitantly. The barrier came up as protection. “I just need to figure out how I'm going to survive and perform and help my team without draining any other ounce of my mental energy on anything else.”

Lloyd felt every slight, real or perceived, coming her way. She was never good enough. She didn't play well enough. She had to prove people wrong.

None of this will be all that surprising to people who have watched her through the years, but she's had more time to reflect on it.

“I wouldn't say I have regrets,” Lloyd said in her Hall of Fame speech, “but if there's one thing I do wish, I wish I had let more people understand me. Over the years, I operated like an emotionless machine. I was intense, and I truly believe that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. So to my teammates, I want to say this: I'm sorry I wasn't always able to give you all of me.”

A few days later, she did say that by the end, she had let in more teammates — when she was benched later in her career, there were a few that also saw her in a deeply emotional state. But this wasn't an apology where she was expecting people to text her after or anything. “I just wanted to address — not necessarily the elephant in the room — but maybe certain teammates that didn't understand why I was the way that I was.”

She pointed out several times that she has no ill-will towards anyone in the U.S. program — she was never angry at teammates, she said, she was just trying to survive. “Whatever comes of it is awesome,” she said. “We all had our unique journeys. I'm open to anything.”

There are certainly more conversations for Lloyd to have on that front, but maybe that apology opened the door a bit further. After all, what's more human than wanting to be understood, even as the barriers to being known are of your own making?

The twist is that Lloyd has changed.

“We are so blessed to have Harper. She is my greatest accomplishment. I always knew I wanted a child, but I had no idea how this little baby could completely change me as a person. Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.”

So, yes, in the end, it was worth it. Sporting her new red Hall of Fame blazer, her family in the audience, Harper watching on, Lloyd was ready to do it all over again if it got her to this moment.

“There was nothing I loved more than winning, but winning comes at a cost. I paid that price, yet in return, I gained more than I ever could have imagined.”

The United States has been waiting for men's soccer to take off; it has been close, but next summer could be the big ascend.

Next year, of course, marks the first time since 1994 that the United States will host the World Cup (along with Canada and Mexico). 

The U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) has yet to get over the hump, but they have reached the knockout stage in each of their last two World Cups. With one good showing, former USMNT star Clint Dempsey thinks the sport could be the next big thing in America.

“When I think back to the 1994 World Cup and going to my first game in Dallas, because of how well the U.S. team did and how much the game grew because of having the World Cup here, I'm curious to see what will happen from a good showing next year, if the U.S. can perform well, what could come of that,” Dempsey told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. “It's too many times it seems like every four years, everybody that's mainstream American taking notice instead of mainstream American taking notice every year. 

“You have [Lionel] Messi moving the needle in terms of creating an impact in mainstream media, but if the U.S. have a great showing at the World Cup, the sky is the limit as to what can be accomplished. I am a little bit nervous, though, right now, but I'm looking forward to a strong showing at the Gold Cup to get a dance for the big dance in 2026.”

Why is Dempsey nervous? Well, not advancing out of the group stage in the Copa América last year, a tournament that only includes countries in North and South America, on their own home soil will do that.

“It was a failure. You're the only host country to not get out of the group stage in COPA America,” Dempsey said bluntly.

“But they can get back on track. I think [head coach Mauricio Pochettino] needs a little more time with them. Hopefully Gold Cup, strong showing, get back on track, and try to do something special.”

TRUMP NAMES ANDREW GIULIANI, SON OF FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI, TO FIFA WORLD CUP TASK FORCE

The World Cup will naturally garner viewers and grow the game on its own. However, Dempsey has always felt a “responsibility” to do it himself. So, that is why he has partnered with Abbott, the Official Health and Nutrition Sciences Partner of Real Madrid Football Club, to make the Abbott Dream Team.

Abbott and Real Madrid are hosting soccer tryouts for 18- and 19-year-olds in Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Dallas this summer, when the 11 top players will travel abroad on an all-expenses-paid trip to Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas, Madrid this fall. 

“I'm happy to give kids a platform to chase their dreams. One of those cities to try out happens to be Dallas where I kind of started it all. It comes full circle for me, as that's where I played my club ball growing up in the classic league. So look forward to being a part of that,” Dempsey said. “These young players have an opportunity to chase their dreams and also learn about nutrition to prolong their careers if they get lucky enough to get to do this as a profession. I'm happy to get people be a part of something that gives people the chance to chase their dreams, because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. I was lucky enough to make it my dream and do it for a living.”

“I just kind of always felt like I've been trying to grow the game in terms of trailblazing, but at the same time, if you have opportunities like this to give back and give people that platform to have those experiences, it's special, because that's what life's about,” he added. “I have six kids, and it's pretty busy chasing them around, and sometimes it feels like you're an Uber driver, but's it's me watching them try to chase their dreams. That's what this life is about. You wanna give people the chance to to do something special in their life so you can be at peace and look back be happy with everything. So that's just kind of I'm at in life. I wanna help people out, and this was a perfect platform for that.”

Dempsey, like all of us, is hoping the word “failure” is not brought up next summer during the World Cup. The USMNT can avoid that, Dempsey said, as long as they can continue what they have done in recent Cups.

“At the bare minimum, I think you have to get out of the group. If you don't the group, it's a failure,” Dempsey said. “There's gonna be a lot of pressure on this team for being one of the host countries, and not getting out of the group will be a failure. It starts with getting out of the group, get people believing, and anything can happen when you get into the knockout rounds.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Sergio Busquets Makes Brutally Honest Inter Miami Club World Cup Admission","https://www.si.com/soccer/sergio-busquets-brutally-honest-inter-miami-club-world-cup-admission","Wed, 07 May 2025 16:52:24 GMT","

Sergio Busquets did not hold back when speaking about Inter Miami's chances at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

As the host nation for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, Inter Miami were handed a spot in the newly expanded tournament. The Herons received the bid after they won the 2024 Supporters' Shield for their record-breaking MLS regular season under Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino. 

Fast forward five months later and Inter Miami are somewhat unrecognizable under Javier Mascherano. The club sits fourth in the Eastern Conference standings and just suffered two poor defeats in their Concacaf Champions Cup semifinal tie. Vancouver Whitecaps eliminated the Herons 5–1 on aggregate, leaving Inter Miami with a lot of questions moving forward.

In fact, the lopsided tie prompted Busquets to look ahead to Inter Miami's FIFA Club World Cup campaign, and the former Barcelona star is questioning his side's ability to make a deep run in the tournament.

""It's clear that we are not at the level to compete at the Club World Cup, but we will try to compete in our group,"" Busquets said. ""Go game by game, fight and hopefully advance to the next round though it'll be difficult.""

Inter Miami were sorted into Group A with SE Palmeiras, FC Porto and Al Ahly FC. On paper, a team with Busquets, Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Jordi Alaba should be able to make it out of its group, but much tougher competition is on the horizon. With European giants like Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City all participating in the tournament, the Herons are fighting an uphill battle, especially if they do not improve their recent form.

Unlike Busquets, though, Mascherano believes it is too early to shift focus to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. After all, Inter Miami still must play six MLS matches before the tournament begins.

""We now have to keep focusing on MLS,"" Mascherano said after the Herons crashed out of the Concacaf Champions Cup. ""I don't think ahead to the Club Cup because we are a month and a half away. Now it's time to focus on MLS. We've been competing in two competitions for two months and a half and we did it well.""

Mascherano will hope Inter Miami's 4–1 victory over New York Red Bulls at the weekend will get the Herons back on track. The team has already suffered four defeats across all competitions in the last two months and will be eager to string together some important victories to climb back up the Eastern Conference standings.

All eyes will be on Messi and Inter Miami, though, when the Herons kick off the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup against Al Ahly on June 14.

A Premier League manager has reportedly informally agreed to take the reins at Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal.

One Saudi outlet claims that the manager is willing to join before the Club World Cup starts in June.

However, Al-Hilal are reportedly waiting on the response of another candidate - who they prefer - before formalising their move for the Premier League man. 

The manager in question is none other than Fulham's Marco Silva.

Mail Sport reported in 2023 that Silva had turned down a mega £40million offer to manage Al-Ahli for two years.

But now it would appear that the temptation of the Saudi cash has returned, if Arriyadiyah are to be believed. 

TalkSPORT have also reported that Silva is stalling on signing a new contract due to the interest from Saudi.

They claim that Al-Hilal are after Inter Milan manager Simone Inzaghi, who has qualified the Italian giants for a second Champions League final in three years.  

Silva's deal at Craven Cottage expires in 2026.

He took over at Fulham in 2021, leading them to the Championship title in his first season and since stabilising them at Premier League level.

The Cottagers could yet qualify for Europe as they sit 11th in the Premier League, a position which could be enough to earn them a place in continental football.

A run of three defeats in their last four has dampened their hopes somewhat, but they are only two points behind eighth-placed Bournemouth. 

Should Silva join Al-Hilal, he would be teaming up with former Fulham striker Alexsandar Mitrovic as well as ex-Premier League stars Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, and Joao Cancelo.

The side, majority owned by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund, have also made a lucrative offer to Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes. 

Mail Sport exclusively revealed that they can afford to pay the Portuguese around £65million per season.

However, Fernandes' camp has not yet responded. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to join Real Madrid as a free agent after announcing he will leave Liverpool when his contract expires this summer.

A deal for the England international, 26, to join the Spanish side has entered its final stages and is on course to be signed in the coming weeks. Sources in Spain — speaking anonymously to protect relationships — suggest a proposed six-year agreement is in the process of being completed.

The player's contract with Liverpool expires at the end of June, and Madrid are in action in the revamped Club World Cup in the United States before then. The competition kicks off on June 14 and Madrid's first match is against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal on June 18 in Miami.

Will Alexander-Arnold be wearing the white of Madrid by then? What needs to happen for him to make the move early? And how much do Madrid need him in the States?

Mario Cortegana and James Pearce explain the state of play…

Madrid want Alexander-Arnold to play for them at the Club World Cup. Club sources, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, believe that an agreement can be reached between two clubs, who have great respect for each other. 

They expect it would take a nominal fee for Liverpool to allow the player to end his contract early and be available for the tournament.  

A lot. 

The team lost their first-choice right-back, Dani Carvajal, to a serious knee injury (torn anterior cruciate ligament, ACL) in October and since then have suffered in that position. Lucas Vazquez has been outclassed in several demanding games, prompting coach Carlo Ancelotti to move Federico Valverde, his most important midfielder, to right-back.

The 33-year-old Carvajal is confident of being fit for the Club World Cup but he has missed seven months of competitive football. He may take time to return to his best, as Madrid have seen with other players who have experienced the same injury in recent years. 

The centre-back Eder Militao suffered an ACL injury last season and returned in March 2024 far from his best. He had two muscle problems in September and October 2024 and suffered another ACL injury in November. He is yet to return to first-team action.

David Alaba, another defender, was sidelined for 13 months with an ACL injury and, after returning in January 2025, he suffered another muscle injury in February and had to undergo knee surgery again last week. The Austria international could be fit in time for the Club World Cup.

On a purely footballing level, Madrid have had a lot of problems when it comes to playmaking, something that Alexander-Arnold's qualities would alleviate. They would also benefit from his set-piece prowess. 



Madrid would not be trying to get Alexander-Arnold to join early unless they were sure he wanted to play a role for them at the tournament. 

And fatigue should not be an issue either. Alexander-Arnold helped Liverpool win the Premier League under Arne Slot but he missed a chunk of games across March and April while on the sidelines for six weeks with an ankle injury.

The question is: would Alexander-Arnold be able to hit the ground running in the Madrid first team? 

As well as his quality, age and beneficial contract situation at Anfield, Madrid have always been attracted to signing Alexander-Arnold because of the positive impact he will have on the club's brand.

Signing a world-class talent is always a big moment, but particularly when they are joining from a club as prestigious as Liverpool and have been a dominant player in the best league in the world for many years. Alexander-Arnold arriving at Madrid would be considered a massive move. 

The Madrid president Florentino Perez and his closest advisers are very interested in the Club World Cup because of the huge financial rewards on offer — the winners could receive up to to $125million (£93m) — and the global interest they expect from the tournament. 

Since the pandemic, the club has held pre-season tours in the United States, and shown a clear interest in growing their brand there and moving away from the Asian market, which was a more common destination in the past.

Showing off a new galactico at a Club World Cup in the United States would be a win-win for the club.

Alexander-Arnold earns around £200,000 a week, plus bonuses, at Liverpool, so if he were to leave a month early — to be part of Madrid's Club World Cup plans — that would be a shortfall for the player of around £900,000 from his base salary. 

It is unclear how much compensation Liverpool will demand to release Alexander-Arnold from his contract in time for the competition.

According to senior Anfield sources, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, talks between the clubs were initiated by Madrid on Monday night. Not having to pay Alexander-Arnold's wages in June would benefit Liverpool, but they are also expected to demand a fee, especially given the riches on offer at the Club World Cup. 

If an agreement between the clubs cannot be reached then there is a scenario where Alexander-Arnold cannot feature in the group stage, but is eligible for the knockout stages of the tournament, with the right-back's current contract expiring on June 30. The round of 16 begins on June 28, with the quarter-finals on July 4-5, the semi-finals on July 8-9 and the final in New York on July 13.

Well, FIFA announced in October that there would be an “exceptional registration window” open between June 1 and June 10, which would allow clubs competing in the Club World Cup to sign new players before the start of the tournament.

The Premier League and La Liga — the two leagues involved in Alexander-Arnold's potential move — announced they will hold an extra transfer window for that period.

The regular summer transfer window will reopen on June 16 and close on September 1.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Real Madrid ready to pay Liverpool and get Alexander-Arnold for Club World Cup","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/06/real-madrid-trent-alexander-arnold-club-world-cup-liverpool-fee","Wed, 07 May 2025 01:30:00 GMT","

Real Madrid have approached Liverpool in an attempt to bring forward the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold so that he is available to play in the Club World Cup, which starts on 14 June in the United States. The right-back is set to join the Spanish side when his contract expires at the end of June, but Real are eager to take him earlier.

Any agreement would lead to Liverpool receiving a fee. Fifa has implemented a two-window summer to benefit those playing at the Club World Cup, with the first lasting from 1 to 10 June and the second opening on 16 June. Real's first fixture is on 18 June against Al-Hilal at the Hard Rock Cafe Stadium in Miami.

Alexander-Arnold, who helped Liverpool win the Club World Cup in 2019, announced on Monday that he would not be renewing his contract after two decades with Liverpool, having started in the academy aged six. He is yet to confirm Real is his next destination, but is expected to move there on a five-year deal.

“After 20 years at Liverpool Football Club, now is the time for me to confirm that I will be leaving at the end of the season,” said Alexander-Arnold. “This is easily the hardest decision I've ever made in my life. I know many of you have wondered why or been frustrated that I haven't spoken about this yet, but it was always my intention to keep my full focus on the team's best interests, which was securing number 20,” referring to the club's 20th league title.

                It has been confirmed by FIFA that Chelsea's first opponent at this summer's Club World Cup will now be either Los Angeles FC or Club America.
            

We were due to play Mexican side Club Leon, but they will no longer be participating in the tournament.

In their place, FIFA have decided the team to be admitted will be determined by a play-off match between Los Angeles (runners-up to Club Leon in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions Cup) and Club America (the top ranked team in the Club World Cup confederation ranking at the conclusion of the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup).

The winners will automatically qualify for the Club World Cup and will take the position of Club Leon in Group D, joining Chelsea, Flamengo and ES Tunis.

We will meet either Los Angeles or Club America on Monday 16 June in Atlanta. The details of their play-off match, including the date, will be announced in due course.

Los Angeles' squad includes former Blue Olivier Giroud, while Mexican team Club America have been regular opponents of ours in pre-season, including at the start of this campaign.





We won 3-0 courtesy of goals from Christopher Nkunku, Noni Madueke and Marc Guiu. That game also took place in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

Officially official

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) handed down their verdict on Tuesday in the case of Club León against FIFA, and unfortunately for the Liga MX outfit, they have sided with FIFA.  León were appealing their expulsion from this summer's Club World Cup due to their shared ownership structure with another participant, Club Pachuca.

So, with FIFA's own decision upheld about their own tournament, León are now officially out, and will be replaced by either Los Angeles FC (LAFC) or another Liga MX side, Club América.  These two are set to play a one-off playoff (play-in?) at the end of the month, at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles on May 31.

The winner of that game will face Chelsea a couple weeks later, in Atlanta on Friday Monday, June 16, in the first group stage game.

Chelsea's other two games in the group stage of the tournament will be in Philadelphia, against Flamengo on Friday, June 20, and ES Tunis the following Tuesday, June 24.

A one-match playoff is set to be played by LAFC and Club América to determine the final spot in the 2025 Club World Cup, per @tombogert and @JacobsBen The match will be played at BMO Stadium on May 31st and the winner will replace Club Leon in this summer's Club WC. pic.twitter.com/mRWlcMLWKY

President Trump tells reporters that the World Cup could be an incentive for Russia to end the war in Ukraine

US President Donald Trump says the opportunity for Russia to play at the 2026 World Cup could be an ""incentive"" to end the war in Ukraine.

The Russian national football team has been banned from international competition by Fifa and Uefa since the country's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Trump campaigned on ending the war in Ukraine on ""day one"" of office if he was elected for a second time in November 2024.

Under current rules, Russia will not play at the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.

Qualification began in September 2023, with 45 spots available in addition to the three host nations.

Speaking at the first meeting of his administration's 2026 World Cup taskforce, Trump said reinstating Russia for the tournament could end the war in Ukraine.

Sitting next to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, Trump was unaware that Russia were banned from the tournament. 

""I didn't know that. Is that right?"" Trump asked. 

""That is right,"" said Infantino.

""They are banned for the time being from playing but we hope that something happens and peace will happen so that Russia can be readmitted.""

Trump said: ""That's possible. Hey, that could be a good incentive, right?

""We want to get them to stop. We want them to stop. Five thousand young people a week are being killed - it's not even believable.""

Trump said Infantino was ""the boss"" when it came to a decision over Russia's participation and that he had ""nothing to do"" with any call to reinstate them.

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.

President Trump opened the meeting of the 2026 World Cup taskforce 

US vice-president JD Vance, who was sitting on the other side of President Trump in the meeting, said the US is looking forward to welcoming fans from across the globe for the tournament but says supporters must ""go home"" afterwards.

The US will host 78 of the 104 matches, including the final.

The World Tourism Forum Institute has warned that strict immigration policies in the US and global political tensions could ""significantly"" disrupt international arrivals.

""I know we'll have visitors, probably from close to 100 countries,"" said Vance.

""We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game.

""But when the time is up, they'll have to go home.""

The Fifa Club World Cup, which starts next month, is being held across 12 stadiums in the US.

About two million overseas visitors are expected for the tournament.

""We're processing those travel documents and visa applications already,"" said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

""That is obviously going to be a precursor to what we can do next year for the World Cup as well. It is all being facilitated.""

The United States has been waiting for men's soccer to take off; it has been close, but next summer could be the big ascend.

Next year, of course, marks the first time since 1994 that the United States will host the World Cup (along with Canada and Mexico). 

The U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) has yet to get over the hump, but they have reached the knockout stage in each of their last two World Cups. With one good showing, former USMNT star Clint Dempsey thinks the sport could be the next big thing in America.

""When I think back to the 1994 World Cup and going to my first game in Dallas, because of how well the U.S. team did and how much the game grew because of having the World Cup here, I'm curious to see what will happen from a good showing next year, if the U.S. can perform well, what could come of that,"" Dempsey told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. ""It's too many times it seems like every four years, everybody that's mainstream American taking notice instead of mainstream American taking notice every year. 

""You have [Lionel] Messi moving the needle in terms of creating an impact in mainstream media, but if the U.S. have a great showing at the World Cup, the sky is the limit as to what can be accomplished. I am a little bit nervous, though, right now, but I'm looking forward to a strong showing at the Gold Cup to get a dance for the big dance in 2026.""

Why is Dempsey nervous? Well, not advancing out of the group stage in the Copa América last year, a tournament that only includes countries in North and South America, on their own home soil will do that.

""It was a failure. You're the only host country to not get out of the group stage in COPA America,"" Dempsey said bluntly.

""But they can get back on track. I think [head coach Mauricio Pochettino] needs a little more time with them. Hopefully Gold Cup, strong showing, get back on track, and try to do something special.""

TRUMP NAMES ANDREW GIULIANI, SON OF FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI, TO FIFA WORLD CUP TASK FORCE

The World Cup will naturally garner viewers and grow the game on its own. However, Dempsey has always felt a ""responsibility"" to do it himself. So, that is why he has partnered with Abbott, the Official Health and Nutrition Sciences Partner of Real Madrid Football Club, to make the Abbott Dream Team.

Abbott and Real Madrid are hosting soccer tryouts for 18- and 19-year-olds in Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Dallas this summer, when the 11 top players will travel abroad on an all-expenses-paid trip to Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas, Madrid this fall. Players can sign up at abbottdreamteam.com.

""I'm happy to give kids a platform to chase their dreams. One of those cities to try out happens to be Dallas where I kind of started it all. It comes full circle for me, as that's where I played my club ball growing up in the classic league. So look forward to being a part of that,"" Dempsey said. ""These young players have an opportunity to chase their dreams and also learn about nutrition to prolong their careers if they get lucky enough to get to do this as a profession. I'm happy to get people be a part of something that gives people the chance to chase their dreams, because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. I was lucky enough to make it my dream and do it for a living.""

""I just kind of always felt like I've been trying to grow the game in terms of trailblazing, but at the same time, if you have opportunities like this to give back and give people that platform to have those experiences, it's special, because that's what life's about,"" he added. ""I have six kids, and it's pretty busy chasing them around, and sometimes it feels like you're an Uber driver, but's it's me watching them try to chase their dreams. That's what this life is about. You wanna give people the chance to to do something special in their life so you can be at peace and look back be happy with everything. So that's just kind of I'm at in life. I wanna help people out, and this was a perfect platform for that.""

Dempsey, like all of us, is hoping the word ""failure"" is not brought up next summer during the World Cup. The USMNT can avoid that, Dempsey said, as long as they can continue what they have done in recent Cups.

""At the bare minimum, I think you have to get out of the group. If you don't the group, it's a failure,"" Dempsey said. ""There's gonna be a lot of pressure on this team for being one of the host countries, and not getting out of the group will be a failure. It starts with getting out of the group, get people believing, and anything can happen when you get into the knockout rounds.""

World Cup

U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested that Russia's men's national team being allowed into the qualification process for the 2026 World Cup could be an incentive for the country to end the war in Ukraine.

Since their illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia's national teams and domestic clubs have been suspended by FIFA and UEFA, which respectively govern world and European soccer. Those suspensions were upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2023 after Russia appealed.

Trump has held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in recent months in a bid to broker a peace deal.

The possibility of Russia's three-year ban from soccer being lifted has been heightened recently with Gianni Infantino, FIFA's president, saying last month he hoped the country's return would come “soon”. Infantino has also spoken of his close relationship with Trump ahead of the 2026 men's World Cup, which is organised by FIFA and will be held across the U.S., Canada and Mexico next summer.

A task force for the event has been set up, chaired by Trump, which will also oversee both this summer's Club World Cup. Speaking at the task force's first meeting on Tuesday, Trump said he was unaware Russia could not, under its current ban, qualify for next summer's tournament.

“I didn't know that. Is that right?” Trump asked, before Infantino confirmed it was. “They are banned for the time being from playing but we hope that something happens and peace will happen so that Russia can be readmitted,” Infantino added.

Trump then replied: “That's possible. Hey, that could be a good incentive, right? We want to get them to stop. We want them to stop.”

Speaking at the 49th UEFA Congress in Belgrade, Serbia, Infantino discussed the peace talks being mediated by the U.S.“As talks are going on for peace in Ukraine, I hope that we can soon move to the next page, bring back, as well, Russia in the football landscape because this would mean that everything is solved,” he said.

The UEFA qualifying groups for the 2026 World Cup have already been drawn and matches have already been played in some of them. The Athletic has contacted FIFA and UEFA for comment.

It was confirmed on Tuesday that Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, would be the executive director of the World Cup task force with Carlos Cordeiro, a FIFA advisor and former United States Soccer Federation president, a senior advisor and U.S. Vice President JD Vance acting as vice chair.

Vice President JD Vance joked about detaining foreign visitors who overstay their welcome during the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. is hosting next summer along with Canada and Mexico.

""I know we'll have visitors from close to 100 countries, we want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,"" Vance said at the meeting of the White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026 on Tuesday.

""But when the time is up, they'll have to go home, otherwise they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has become the face of ICE's crackdown on migrants, often joining them on raids as they detain people.

Next year's soccer World Cup will be held jointly by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, at a time when international relations with America are particularly strained.

On top of several ongoing wars, Trump has implemented widespread tariffs, stoked fears that the U.S. will leave NATO and has begun a massive crackdown on illegal immigration.

Around 2 million foreign visitors are expected to come to the U.S. for the World Cup next year, Noem said at the meeting.

Noem has increasingly become the public face of the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement efforts as she has personally joined ICE agents on multiple enforcement actions targeting undocumented immigrants, aligning herself closely with the agency's frontline activities.

Noem has ""unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in its summary of her first 100 days.

She was at Tuesday's World Cup meeting, where she said that handling visitors' documents to get into the U.S. will ""go smoothly.""

Trump said the tournament spoke about how the tournament would generate ""tens of billions of dollars in economic activities for local businesses"" and ""thousands and thousands of jobs for American workers.""

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: ""America will welcome the world. Everyone who wants to come here to enjoy, to have fun to celebrate the game, will be able to do that.""

Trump said the event ""will be the biggest, safest and most extraordinary soccer tournament in history.""

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup set to kick off in June across the United States, Canada and Mexico, preparations are entering their final phase. In the U.S., cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Dallas and Atlanta are gearing up to host matches, with infrastructure projects nearing completion and security protocols being finalized.

	The cameras rolled on Tuesday as President Donald Trump held his first 2026 World Cup task force meeting in a public spectacle that included several Cabinet members, as well as FIFA president Gianni Infantino.


	Millions of foreigners from around the world are expected to visit the United States for soccer's most anticipated international tournament, yet Trump and some of his Cabinet members chilled the usually celebratory mood with ominous warnings to travelers planning to attend next year's World Cup. 


	When asked if people who have taken part in pro-Palestinian protests should be concerned about visiting the U.S., Trump replied, “I think people are allowed to protest.” He continued: “You have to do it in a reasonable manner, not necessarily friendly, but reasonable.”


	“Pam will come after you, and you're going to have a big problem,” he then warned, referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who attended Tuesday's task force meeting.


	It's hardly an idle threat. Trump's administration has sought to revoke the visas of hundreds of foreign students for participating in pro-Palestine activism, detaining some and seeking their deportation.

	“Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event,” Vice President J.D. Vance said. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem,” Vance added. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has led the administration's crackdown on immigration.


	Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy also chimed in, and said, “If you're coming to see some soccer … go on a road trip. See America,” before saying: “Don't overstay your visa. Don't stay too long.”


	The threats come as some countries warn their citizens about traveling to the United States. Last month. Canada issued a travel advisory warning that officials could demand to search citizens' electronic devices at the border without any reason.


	The U.K. updated its guidance to tell citizens traveling to the U.S. to “comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry,” adding: “The authorities in the U.S. set and enforce entry rules strictly. You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.” 


	Several European countries have warned citizens about Trump's trans crackdown and how it may affect travelers to the U.S.

	Noem said Wednedsay that two million people were expected to visit the U.S. for the World Cup and assured listeners that her department would be working with the Department of State and the FBI to process visitors' travel documents and that the massive event “will go smoothly.”


	“America will welcome the world,” Infantino insisted. “Everyone who wants to come here to enjoy, to have fun to celebrate the game, will be able to do that.”

Modern football can be tough going at times. A nauseating combination of financial inequality, ever-expanding tournaments, farcical fixture lists, spiralling TV subscription fees, conspiracy theorists, endless VAR-related delays, relentless time-wasting, incessant simulation, blatant sports-washing and embarrassingly ineffective attempts to rid the sport of racism are sucking nearly all of the joy out of the game. But not at all of it.

Because sometimes there's a game that makes all of the misery worthwhile. Sometimes there's a game that reminds you why you fell in love with football in the first place. Sometimes there's a game that you just never want to end. On Tuesday at San Siro, we got to witness such a game.

Returning to Europe's top competition would give Ruben Amorim an extra £100m to work with, as well as raising the calibre of player he could target

Just a few weeks ago, Manchester United were preparing themselves for having no European football for the first time in a decade, wondering how they would fill their weeks between Premier League games. But now, they are just a couple of steps away from sneaking back into the Champions League despite their worst domestic season in 51 years.

The Red Devils have one foot in the Europa League final after their brilliant 3-0 win over Athletic Club in Bilbao, and even considering their capacity for disaster, they should be able to navigate their way through Thursday's second leg and make it to the final. Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would await them at San Mames, where they would be one win from dining at European football's top table once more.

Winning the Europa League, then, is about far more than one glorious evening in Bilbao; it is about playing in the biggest club competition, the one that every player wants to appear in. And that means that United will suddenly be able to attract a higher calibre of player than they would were they only offering potential targets Premier League football and their storied history. And just as crucially, they will be able to afford the elite players that would previously have been out of their reach.

As Ruben Amorim put it last month: ""The Champions League can change everything. If you are in the Champions League, you play top teams on a Wednesday and at the weekend. This is the best thing. If you have Champions League, you know you have a better budget to put forward a different team next season.""

United will be refreshing their squad in the summer even if they are left with no European football and they are believed to be close to signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves. But if they play their cards right, then many more names that they had previously dismissed as being beyond their grasp would suddenly be within reach.

After Casper Ruud won his first Masters 1000 title in Madrid, the ATP Tour moves to Rome for the last clay Masters 1000 of the season. The first round begins Wednesday, without the seeds yet, but still with plenty of interesting matchups in prospect. It should be a great day of tennis in the Italian capital to kickstart the tournament.

Head-to-head: Tseng 1-0 Passaro

Ranking-wise, this is the closest match of this round, with #101 taking on #102. As the rankings suggest, it should be a really close match and it is very hard to call which way it will go. Tseng played really good tennis to make it through qualifying but Passaro's home court advantage might well be the difference maker in such a close matchup.
Prediction: Passaro in 3

Head-to-head: Altmaier 1-0 Comesana

Altmaier won a long five setter when the pair faced at the Australian Open this year, but both of these players play their best stuff on clay so this should be a considerably higher quality match. Comesana has been playing at a really good level on clay this year and could well get revenge on Altmaier for the loss in Australia.
Prediction: Comesana in 3

Head-to-head: Medjedovic 1-0 Virtanen

Virtanen played some good tennis to make it through qualifying and he definitely has the ability to cause problems to Medjedovic here, but the latter is the better and more talented player overall and should have the edge here, even if it should be quite a close encounter.
Prediction: Medjedovic in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

Norrie is very far from the level that saw him reach the Top 10, win a Masters 1000, and reach a Slam semifinal, but he's still a tough player to beat and on clay he should have the edge in this particular matchup, as O'Connell's best results have all come on faster surfaces. While Norrie likely isn't a threat to go far, he should pull through here.
Prediction: Norrie in 2

Australian ATP star Nick Kyrgios took a harsh jab at Jannik Sinner ahead of his return at the 2025 Italian Open. The 30-year-old replied to an encouragement post on social media, snubbing the Italian's chances to excel at the upcoming Masters 1000 event in Rome. This came amid the 3-time Grand Slam champion's return from serving a 3-month-long ban after testing positive for a banned substance.

Sinner was imposed with a three-month ban after testing positive for the banned drug Clostebol. However, the allegations were marked as a mistake caused by the treatment from his physiotherapist. Kyrgios emerged as one of the strongest critics as he was upset with the decision and believed the punishment was too soft. He started the feud by posting on social media, saying that players with better resources get easier treatment. Kyrgios called it unfair, marking it as a sad day for tennis.

While the Aussie remained quiet until the Italian served the 3-month-long ban, he recreated his position as a critic by denying Sinner's authority as the World No. 1. The controversy began after a tennis insider named Scott Barclay showcased firm belief in Jannik Sinner's potential. He predicted the Italian's rise in the upcoming event, optimistically mentioning that he would clinch the title.

Nick Kyrgios couldn't stop himself from being a part of the conversation and snubbed Sinner's chances to secure a top position in the upcoming event, using brutal satire.

Kyrgios made a comeback in 2025 after keeping out of competition for more than 2 years. However, the Aussie couldn't handle the pressure, facing opening round exits in Brisbane, Melbourne and Indian Wells.

Jannik Sinner expressed mixed emotions during the doping ban. The Italian player mentioned how he never really wanted to accept the ban, but his conscience asked him to move past the controversy as soon as possible. Although he had to miss four crucial Masters 1000 events in the last months, the 23-year-old expressed relief over not missing out on any Grand Slams.

Although Sinner admitted to not setting his expectations high for the upcoming event, he is preparing to compete against the top-ranked rivals, including Alexander Zverev, Carlos Alcaraz and others. The Italian will look to chase his 20th tour-level title, with his comeback showdown scheduled for May 9.

After Casper Ruud won his first Masters 1000 title in Madrid, the ATP tTur moves to Rome for the last clay Masters 1000 of the season. The first round begins Wednesday without the seeds, yet still with plenty of interesting matchups in prospect in what should be a great day of tennis in the Italian capital to kickstart the tournament.

Head-to-head: Thompson 4-0 Perricard

Thompson has won all four matches and all eight sets between the pair–two of them this year at Masters 1000 level, in Miami and Monte Carlo. While Mpetshi Perricard's huge serve is effective on faster surfaces, the same doesn't seem to be the case on slower surfaces for now, and even if Thompson himself struggles on clay he should have a clear edge when it comes to returning and rallying and this match could well pan out in a similar way to their Monte Carlo encounter.
Prediction: Thompson in 2

Head-to-head: Lehecka 2-0 Muller

Both Lehecka and Muller had strong starts to the season but have been struggling to get wins in recent tournaments, so they will be looking to gain some momentum back here in Rome. While Muller is a solid player, Lehecka seems to have a clearly higher upside and if he plays anywhere close to his best level he should prevail here.
Prediction: Lehecka in 2

Head-to-head: first meeting

Darderi started the clay season amazingly, with a title in Marrakech, but he hasn't been able to maintain that level since. Now playing at home in Rome he theoretically has a very nice first round draw as he should be able to overcome Bu on a slow clay court. Under normal circumstances, Darderi should pull through here in relatively straightforward fashion.
Prediction: Darderi in 2

Head-to-head: first meeting

Carreno Busta is a former Top 10 player with several good Slam runs and a Masters 1000 title, but he has really been struggling to get back to his best after injury. He actually lost in qualifying here but has been given a second chance, albeit against a good opponent on clay like Ugo Carabelli. It should be a very close match, with lots of gruelling rallies and decided by who executes better in key points.
Prediction: Carreno Busta in 3

O'Connell – Norrie: 07.05.2025 15:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Christopher O'Connell has lost four of his last five matches. His last match was in Madrid, where he lost in the second round against Fritz in straight sets. This will be his third appearance in Rome. He has never made it past the opening round.

Cameron Norrie has won three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Norrie lost in the final qualifying round against Lajovic in three tight sets. However, with several players withdrawing from the tournament, Norrie entered the main draw as a lucky loser. Last season in Rome, Norrie lost in the third round against Tsitsipas in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Norrie is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. O'Connell never succeeded on clay nor in Rome. On the other hand, Norrie played well in the qualifying tournament and has more experience in Rome, where he scored decent wins against solid clay-court players. We expect Norrie to be a better player and win today.

That being said, Norrie winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Cameron Norrie winning @1.53 @bet365

Passaro – Tseng: 07.05.2025 16:00 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Francesco Passaro has won three of his last five matches. His last match was over a month ago in Naples, where he lost in the opening round of the Challenger tournament against Ymer. Last season in Rome, Passaro lost in the third round against Borges in three tight sets.

Chun Hsin Tseng has won three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Tseng qualified for the main draw tournament. In the final qualifying round, he defeated Cerundolo in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Tseng is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He won both qualifying matches this week in straight sets and played his best tennis. On the other hand, Passaro has not played any competitive matches for over a month. We expect Tseng to be a better player on the court.

That being said, Tseng winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Chun Hsin Tseng winning @1.62 @bet365

Gaubas – Dzumhur: 07.05.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Vilius Gaubas has won three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Gaubas qualified for the main draw tournament by winning both matches in straight sets. In the final qualifying round, he defeated Dellien in straight sets.

Damir Dzumhur has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Madrid, the Bosnian lost in the third round against Arnaldi in straight sets. He hopes for a solid result this week to reach the top 50 in the rankings.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Dzumhur is having a great season. He had his biggest results at the Challenger Tour level. He will be confident coming into this match and is a better clay-court player than Gaubas.

That being said, Dzumhur winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Damir Dzumhur winning @1.91 @bet365

The ATP Rome Masters first round features several intriguing matchups, including Tallon Griekspoor looking to build on strong clay form against Miomir Kecmanovic. With players aiming to find rhythm ahead of the French Open, these early clashes could set the tone for the week in the Italian capital.

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Cameron Norrie may benefit from having played two qualifying matches in Rome, giving him a better feel for the conditions despite a final-round loss. Christopher O'Connell has had a quiet clay season so far and didn't make much impact in Munich. With Norrie's grinding style and experience on the surface, he should be slightly favored to come through this first-time meeting.
Prediction: Norrie in 3

Head-to-Head: Nishioka 2-1 Struff

Yoshihito Nishioka leads the head-to-head 2–1, but he's just returning from injury and has played very little clay-court tennis this season. Jan-Lennard Struff hasn't been in great form either, but his power game and greater match play on clay give him an edge. If he keeps his unforced errors in check, Struff should be favored to win this one.
Prediction: Struff in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Vilius Gaubas has been impressive on clay this season, winning the Menorca Challenger and posting a strong 13–5 record on the surface. Damir Dzumhur, though more experienced, has also been solid with recent wins in Madrid. Gaubas is a rising talent, but Dzumhur's consistency and tour-level experience make him a slight favorite in this first-time meeting.
Prediction: Dzumhur in 3

Head-to-Head: Griekspoor 3-1 Kecmanovic

Tallon Griekspoor comes into Rome with solid clay form, including a recent final in Marrakech, and holds a 3–1 head-to-head lead over Miomir Kecmanovic. While Kecmanovic has had flashes of good tennis this year, his inconsistency and Griekspoor's edge on clay give the Dutchman the upper hand. Expect a tight match, but Griekspoor should be favored to advance.
Prediction: Griekspoor in 3

It was literally a delightful welcome for spectators at the inaugural Open Menorca last month. Upon entering the tournament grounds, visitors were greeted by a stand showcasing the tourism and culinary treasures of Menorca, the second largest of the Balearic Islands. Guests were invited to sample local specialties like cheese, ham, and sausage, adding a flavorful touch to the tennis experience.While these treats were likely not the main reason for the tournament's impressive turnout, they certainly added a charming detail to the event's atmosphere. Whether or not the crowd indulged in the tapas, fans from across Menorca flocked to the Tennis Club Ciutadella on the island's west coast. The temporary stands could hardly accommodate the enthusiastic audience. With a population of around 100,000 people, it was clear that Menorca had warmly embraced its first-ever international tennis tournament.“The locals are thrilled that the tournament is happening here - you can really feel that they're enjoying being part of this event,” shared tournament director Edi Bentivegna, originally from Italy but long involved with the Spanish Tennis Federation.

“It's really beautiful here, and the weather just kept getting better as the week went on. It's a fun place to play,” said Austrian Lukas Neumayer.“I was only here once before, when I was five years old,” noted Spanish player Pol Martín Tiffon, who now trains in Barcelona. “It's incredible how many people came to watch throughout the week. For us players at the Challenger level, it's really special to have this kind of support.”So, how did professional tennis arrive in Menorca?“It's a project that began several years ago, initiated by Biosport, the event organizers,” Bentivegna explained. “It wasn't an easy road, but we worked hard with the local institutions and the Consell Insular de Menorca (the island's government) to secure the right week for the tournament. We only got the final approval in mid-January, which left us just two months to make it happen.”

A high-level debut - and big ambitionsInstead of starting small, the organizers aimed high from the outset, joining the ATP Challenger 100 series. The tournament offered €145,250 in total prize money, with champion Vilius Gaubas taking home €20,630 and 100 ATP Ranking points.“Our goal is to climb to the highest category of Challenger tournaments - or maybe even become an ATP Tour event,” Bentivegna revealed, looking confidently ahead. “But who knows?

Christopher Clarey, who covered tennis and international sports for 40 years for the International Herald Tribune and the New York Times, wrote what is widely regarded as the definitive book on Roger Federer: “The Master: The Long Run and Beautiful Game of Roger Federer.”

Now he has produced a similarly authoritative book on Federer's longtime rival and friend, Rafael Nadal: “The Warrior: Rafael Nadal and His Kingdom of Clay.” The book tells the story of both Nadal and clay-court tennis, using the Spanish great's relationship with Roland Garros, the French Open, as its frame.

In an interview with The Athletic, Clarey explained why he chose this approach for tackling the subject of the 22-time Grand Slam champion, someone he covered for the entirety of his career and, as a Spanish speaker, with whom he was able to communicate in Nadal's native language.

“Rafa is a lot funnier and wittier and quicker and a little more acid, for sure, when he's at ease in his own language than he is as the philosophical snippet Rafa from English press conferences over the years,” Clarey said.

An excerpt from Clarey's book follows the interview, detailing the four French sports heroes without whom Nadal's Roland Garros legacy could never have existed.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.



Why did you take this approach to Nadal?

The one thing that really ate at me over the years that I knew I would regret if I didn't do was a Roland Garros book. That was the one that I had connected to as a very young person. I lived a couple of blocks away. My wife is French. She's from that area. And that was the one that I really connected with. Wimbledon was the first one that I covered, but I learned French as I was covering Roland Garros. All these things happened there. I really knew from a pretty early age as a journalist that if I didn't write a book about that at some point, I was going to have a regret about it.

Rafa had done a good autobiography. I wanted to find a way to do something a little more challenging and original for me, and fresh. I don't want to reduce him to Roland Garros, but this gave me a chance to go at Roland Garros and put them together, because I don't think there's anybody else who could be as defined by the dominance of one event than him.

You grew up in America on hard courts. Where did your affinity for clay come from? 

Watching on TV as a kid. We didn't have that much like we do now, but my family was a tennis family and we watched the majors when we could and listened to Bud Collins and his nicknames and all the rest, and the French Open had this mystical, exotic quality. You had to move so differently. I taught tennis for one summer in East Hampton Tennis Club after Williams College to make money for traveling. It was on green clay. By the end, like the last week or two, I could actually slide on the stuff.

And then, when I met my wif,e and I got a chance to go to Roland Garros and cover it, I just loved the scrape, the sound, the light. In Paris, at Roland Garros, at night … That sort of end-of-day light across the clay, the colors … I think it was just the fact that it was so different from what I had grown up with as a youngster that made it so appealing.

There used to be the argument that the French Open doesn't produce the all-time greats in the same way that the other Slams do.

It is a fair point because the game was played primarily on grass initially, then on quicker surfaces through the hard-court era. The speed of the game and the skill sets hadn't been as homogenized at that point, so there really were big deltas in terms of what somebody was able to do on one surface versus another. What I didn't grasp until later on, and actually it came from talking to Americans and adopted Americans like Patrick McEnroe and Jose Higueras, was what an incredible tool clay-court tennis is for learning the game. If you can get the speeds right and the technique a little bit more compact, it can translate to everything because of the angles that you have to create and the geometry you have to understand.

For a long time, I think the really underappreciated thing about Rafa was how great a tennis mathematician and geometrist he was. I think people thought of him as a slugging warrior type — look at my title of the book — somebody who was more grit than genius. I think that's selling him short.

Did you get much pushback from his people that you were portraying him as a clay-court specialist?

There's no doubt that what he is going to be remembered 20 years from now is his 14 Roland Garros titles. In your memory, a red-clay backdrop. Now, in no way does that sell anything else that he did short. In some ways, it magnifies the things he was able to do elsewhere. Even if he had never played on clay, he still would have had a double-times-two Hall of Fame career. Eight other majors put him in John McEnroe and Andre Agassi territory, and no one's complaining about them.

His camp was afraid it was going to diminish the overall body of work. I really don't think it does that. He was chasing other things from a very early age. But their career-long focus was to make Rafa a global champion, an all-court champion. They wanted to take Rafa big and broad, and their ticket to that was to go beyond clay.

Was there a point between his first and 14th titles when you thought someone was going to take him out?

In 2015, 2016, when Novak Djokovic finally solved him there and Rafa was going through his tennis existential crisis, the anxiety attacks on court. But that led to the big comeback year of 2017. I always knew he'd be competitive on clay, but I thought Novak had solved it and Novak had taken over the game. In tennis, when you're king of the hill and somebody deposes you, you're never quite the same again. Novak had all the tools to make his life miserable on every surface.

What was the most surprising thing you heard as you were researching and writing this? 

How much people in Mallorca were accessible to him. These were guys who were more on the expert level than probably Toni Nadal was, who coached juniors nationally in Spain. Early on, Rafa would just play it at light speed. Bounce the ball, serve. Ball, serve, with all that life-force and vitality that he has. They felt like he was burning himself out that way, so they gave him his routines to slow him down. If they had let him just go with his natural thing, kind of like Federer, his natural original state of just madness and self-immolation on the court … That's quite a different thing than what we saw.

I didn't realize quite how much of a village had raised him tennis-wise. Toni is the main guy; never take that away from him. But how does a guy like that really raise a champion to the level of Nadal? Well, the fact is, he didn't do it really alone. He had Carlos Costa, who had been top 10 in the world. He was very much early on in the process as the agent, but also knew a heck of a lot about tennis. And then he also had Carlos Moya, who was in many ways just as essential.

What does a hyper-competitive person like Nadal do in retirement to fill that need to compete?

That competitive streak does not exclude having the ability to have fun. Nadal has that duality in him, but anybody who knows him will talk about that vitality and that intensity of energy during the day. I think both he and Federer were hyperactive children, just overflowing energy that needed to come out and was channeled into sport.

He set up so many things with business, with the academy structure. He's definitely focused on that through his family and Toni's influence, but it's spreading and he's got a lot of business deals going on. And I definitely see him trying to compete recreationally in golf.

Maybe it will be more of “you'll come to me,” but I wouldn't be surprised to see him become part of a coaching team for a top Spanish player, maybe even Carlos Alcaraz down the road. They have a big connection.

These guys, Nadal and Federer, will stay engaged. They know that they're tied together and they know that part of the business model is a Big Three. We'll see what happens with Djokovic when he retires, whether they integrate him into their club. But Nadal and Federer will do things. They've built these empires.

The following excerpt introduces four French tennis professionals from almost a century ago, who had an indelible impact on Nadal's tennis legacy and that of the French Open. The full chapter, ‘The Founders,' outlines their shared lives from the tennis court to the fields of battle, and details how their collective success resonated throughout the tennis world and through history.

Roland Garros, the dusty French domain that Rafael Nadal would rule for nearly twenty years, almost certainly would not have existed without four men he never met who played their best tennis nearly a century ago. They were known, predictably for French sports heroes, as the Musketeers, even if the first to nickname them was an American rival who had seen a movie based on Frenchman Alexandre Dumas's work.

All for one and one for all (unless they were playing each other), les Mousquetaires — Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste — changed the history of tennis and of Parisian landmarks, creating the need, with their resounding success, for a tennis stadium worthy of staging what was in 1928 one of the leading events in global sport: the Davis Cup.

“The Musketeers of Alexandre Dumas were ready to die for each other,” Borotra once said. “Luckily, we didn't have to go that far, but there was a mutual devotion between us of a higher order, every bit as profound.”

Tennis would have continued to grow in France without their breakthrough, but the prime and leafy location where Roland‑Garros Stadium was constructed would very likely have been developed differently without the Davis Cup victory in 1927 against “Big” Bill Tilden and the Americans. Other French organizations and sports federations coveted the site, whose lease had just expired, but tennis was now a national priority in France.

The Musketeers were riding on the momentum and enormous interest that had been generated by their compatriot Suzanne Lenglen. She was one of the transcendent athletes and personalities of the 1920s, and she reveled in it, breaking social codes with her knee‑length tennis outfits that were risqué for the time. She dominated the game and the courtside conversations with her balletic shot making full of leaps and flourishes, losing just one singles match between 1919 and 1926.

She inspired not only sportswriters but songwriters: “Ah! Suzanne!” was a hit in Paris in 1925, its title drawn from what spectators would exclaim as they watched her at play. Lenglen was also a muse for the Musketeers. She convinced Brugnon, the oldest of the four, to postpone his law studies and focus on tennis, and partnered successfully with him, Borotra, and Cochet in mixed doubles. She even offered tactical and technical advice, recommending that Lacoste lower the grip on his ground strokes and shorten his preparation time. But she, unlike Lacoste, was no poker‑faced technician. La Divine, as she was known in France, was a flamboyant attacking player, and Borotra, who played with the same brio and spontaneity, was mesmerized when he first saw Lenglen play in 1919.

“She had adopted what was traditionally the game of a man, with the volleys and an overhead of great power,” Borotra told me. “She had remarkable reflexes. She had an incredible game. There was never another one like her. She was also an intelligent woman, a great credit to France.”

But her business decision to turn professional in 1926 — she was the first female tennis player to do so — did not leave a void for long in French tennis because the Musketeers were establishing themselves as the preeminent force in the men's game.

They had sobriquets of their own. The dashing and sometimes maddening Borotra, who was born in the French Basque country in Biarritz and was fond of wearing a blue beret on court, was the Bounding Basque. Cochet, a diminutive and seemingly nonchalant shot maker extraordinaire from Lyon, was the Magician. Brugnon, primarily a doubles specialist in an age when doubles mattered more, was Toto. Lacoste, with his cunning and relentless game, was the Crocodile.

I never got the chance to interview Cochet or Brugnon before their deaths. But after I moved to France, I did spend time in the early 1990s with Lacoste and Borotra when I was on assignment for the International Herald Tribune. Given their advanced ages — Lacoste was 88, Borotra was 94 — I was well aware of how precious an opportunity this was. I twice visited Lacoste and his wife, Simone, at their villa in the Basque country near Saint Jean de Luz on the Chantaco golf course, which Simone's father had built in honor of Simone's golfing achievements.

Lacoste, at this stage, was frail, restricted in his movements because of a heart condition and reliant on a motorized chair to mount and descend the house's sweeping central staircase. “Doctor's orders,” he explained to me. “If you were a pretty woman, you could ride up on my knees, but you are not.”

I met Borotra briefly at the 1991 Davis Cup final in Lyon, where he was doused with champagne after a French team led by Guy Forget, Henri Leconte, and charismatic captain Yannick Noah ended a 59‑year Davis Cup drought that dated to the Musketeers by upsetting another powerhouse United States squad that this time included a young Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.

In 1993, a year before Borotra died, he granted me an audience (that was how it felt) in his elegant Haussmannian apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris. In a dark business suit and with his hair slicked back over his high forehead, Borotra was still full of vigor as he took me on a train‑to‑catch tour of his drawing room, where a shiny replica of the Davis Cup was on prominent display. He was firm of handshake and brisk of step and, though hitting forehands had become too painful because of arthritis, he continued to practice his backhand with hitting partners or, more often, against the wall at his longtime fief, the Tennis Club de Paris.

“The wall has no problem hitting to my backhand,” Borotra explained.

He was droll. He was dry. The problem for me was that Borotra was so hard of hearing that our interview had to be conducted at a shout, which was no way to build rapport. But Borotra's mind and memory, like Lacoste's, were still sharp: a fine advertisement for spending much of one's life in and around tennis. Both came to the game relatively late — as teenagers — and were drawn to it after trips to England. But while Lacoste, at age 15, committed himself immediately and systematically to studying the game's finer points, Borotra, a natural athlete who had played Basque pelota and other sports in his early youth, did not get truly serious about tennis or even join a club until after World War One.

He was in his early twenties, but with trademark energy and unconventional technique, he made up for lost time by relentlessly attacking the net. More man of action than reflection, he won nineteen major titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, and was the only Musketeer to win the Australian Championships (and the only one to make the long sea voyage to play in the Australian Championships). He sparred with Tilden, who often found him insufferable and dubbed him “the Bantering Basque,” put off by his attention‑grabbing behavior and gallantries. Borotra liked to doff his beret and kiss female spectators' hands if forced to chase a shot into the stands. But he was certainly a crowd favorite, one of tennis' and Wimbledon's main attractions in the 1920s and 1930s.

Lacoste was from an affluent background: His father, Jean Jules, was a top executive at luxury automaker Hispano Suiza and started his own automotive company. But René, his only son, would have a successful business career of his own. He worked in shipping, banking, and the automotive and aviation industries but was best known for co-founding the Lacoste Clothing Company, which became a leading global brand with its crocodile trademark inspired by Lacoste's nickname. But when I asked him in French what he considered himself, he answered un bricoleur, which literally translates to “handyman.”

“Tinkerer” might be more appropriate. He was an inventor at heart: creating, with Simone's help, the innovative cotton Polo shirts that helped him through the hot American summers; and constructing and patenting the first metal tennis racket. It was later called the Wilson T2000 and used by Jimmy Connors and Billie Jean King to win major titles. Connors, no lover of authority or polished manners, treated “Mr. Lacoste” with great deference throughout his playing career.

“I will be perhaps dead next week, but for the moment, I am thinking about what I will be doing and inventing next year, and in two years,” Lacoste told me.

Even at a late stage in life, his workshop was overflowing with plans and prototypes for new rackets, vibration dampeners, and golf clubs. Golf was arguably his own family's most successful sport. Simone won the British Ladies Amateur title in 1927. Forty years later, Catherine, their only daughter, stunned the golf world by winning the 1967 U.S. Women's Open at age 22. She was the first European to win a women's golf major and remains the only amateur to have won the U.S. Women's Open.

“When Catherine went to the USA the first time, someone asked her, ‘Are you the daughter of René Lacoste?' And she was a bit upset by that,” René said. “Several years later, after she won the U.S. Open, we were all heading to the USA, and somebody asked me at customs if by any chance, I was the father of Catherine Lacoste. Catherine was delighted.”

Mouratoglou thinks that the Italian is a genuine contender to win a maiden Roland-Garros title this season

Jannik Sinner, coming off the back of a three-month absence from the tour, remains a major threat to the rest of the field at this year's Roland-Garros.

Patrick Mouratoglou asserts that because of his supreme movement – especially on clay – the Italian is a genuine contender to lift a maiden French Open title this season.

“The key element to be performant on clay and grass is the movement,” the Frenchman explains. “The fact that Sinner is moving so well and he is comfortable moving on clay and on grass makes him immediately a potential winner of these Grand Slams.”

But Mouratoglou goes on to say that Sinner will need a few matches in a row to start to really feel the game after being absent for the past three months.

New Times, New Thinking.

No player has dominated one Grand Slam as Nadal did the red clay of Roland Garros.

By
                    Jason Cowley 

The era of the so-called Big Three in men's tennis is finally ending. Roger Federer, winner of 20 Grand Slam titles, retired aged 41 in 2022. Rafael Nadal, the subject of this new book and winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, was forced through injury to retire at the age of 38 last autumn. But Novak Djokovic, aged 37 and winner of an unsurpassed 24 Grand Slams, grinds on even as a new generation of players, led pre-eminently by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, has emerged to challenge and now supplant him at the apex of the game. 

There's something especially poignant about the last days of a tennis champion. The technical brilliance, discipline and will to win remain but the body is much less accommodating. In the end, no matter what you have achieved, as Geoff Dyer writes in The Last Days of Roger Federer, “you run out of options”.

The question, then, is how and when to depart. Do you stay on, as Andy Murray did after multiple surgeries and a hip replacement operation, to continue playing but as an imperfect facsimile of what you once were? The last days of Murray's career were defined by physical and psychological pain as he lost to players he would once have beaten routinely, and yet he felt compelled to go on. I was at Queen's in London last summer to see Murray's final game as a singles player. He carried yet another injury into the match and could scarcely move – the crowd collectively gasped as he hobbled towards the ball at the start – but tried to compete all the same before succumbing to the inevitable: it ended with Murray 4-1 down in the first set. Note that, somehow, he won a game. 

The Big Three – plus Murray, who won three Grand Slams and two Olympic gold medals – were intensely self-motivated but their rivalry powered their ambition and sustained them through the long years of gruelling competition and travel. “Why are you even asking me this question about why I want to keep it up?” Federer once said. “This is what we all love doing, and you want to prove to yourself you can do it over and over again. You can just never get enough until you hit the wall.”

The tennis tour is truly global and the appeal of the four Grand Slams – the US Open, the Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon – is that they are played on different surfaces in different countries. But no player has dominated one Grand Slam as Nadal did Roland Garros on the red clay in Paris.

He won 14 titles there and Christopher Clarey, who began work on The Warrior in 2022, must have hoped he would be playing at this year's tournament in Paris as the book came out. It was not to be. Nadal's last competitive match was to represent Spain in a Davis Cup tie against the Netherlands in November 2024. By which point, even the great Spaniard, the only male tennis player to rank No 1 in three different decades, had run out of options. He had hit Federer's wall.

As tennis correspondent for the New York Times, Clarey followed the tour for more than three decades and what elevates the book above mere hagiography, or a fan's memoir, are the author's contacts in the game, the conversations he has had with players and coaches over the years and his technical analysis. The book has 20 chapters. Each has a two-word title, the first word being the definite article: The Monument, The Code, The Weapon, The Canvas, and so on. It's a formulaic approach but it enables Clarey to organise his material, and move fluidly back and forth in time without too much repetition as he charts the rise of Nadal, with each of his 14 triumphs at Roland Garros being the rope that tugs the narrative on. The courtside summaries of forgotten or nearly-forgotten matches are much less engaging than the digressions into tennis history and biography. I didn't know that the Roland Garros Stadium was used as an internment camp for “foreign undesirables” at the start of the Second World War; the writer Arthur Koestler was among the detained.

There is a good section on Björn Borg and Chris Evert, the premier players at Roland Garros in the 1970s, and a fascinatingly nerdish chapter on the origins of clay court tennis. The French for clay courts is terre battue, which literally means “beaten earth”. Clarey, who married a French woman and lived in Paris, likes this detail and repeats it on numerous occasions. To excel on clay a player must learn to slide; Stan Smith, a former Wimbledon champion, equated playing on clay to “running on marbles”.

Nadal, with his “deeply ingrained patterns and choreography”, learned the game on clay courts at his local club in Manacor, on the island of Mallorca, where he still lives and in 2016 opened his own academy. Coached from a young age and for much of his career by his uncle Toni Nadal, Rafael was a teenage prodigy. Toni, a failed player, was relentlessly demanding of him: he knew his nephew had the potential to be a player for the ages and sought every competitive advantage. Rafael was naturally right-handed but ended up playing with his non-dominant hand. His power and athleticism were remarkable. “I saw very quickly that he was an extraterrestrial,” Richard Gasquet, one of his talented teenage rivals, said of Nadal after losing to him. “When I came off court, I told my father, ‘It's over, that's the new champion of Roland Garros.'”

The young Nadal, who first won Roland Garros aged 19, was piratical in appearance, with flowing hair, bulging biceps and sleeveless shirts. He sweated profusely and would lose four litres of fluid every match; Nike developed fabrics that could better absorb his sweat. His forehand, hit with extraordinary speed and topspin, was his signature shot, and the more he played the faster it became.

Clarey mentions that Nadal, because of his achievements, stamina and physique, was subject to much speculation, notably in France, about whether he took performance-enhancing drugs (he never failed a doping test). His obsessive and eccentric on-court rituals – meticulously lining up his water bottles, tugging at his shorts and shirt and touching his nose before each serve – only increased people's fascination in a player who seemed as shy and reserved off-court as he was compelling and flamboyant on it.

Christopher Clarey doubts that another player will ever surpass Nadal's achievements at Roland Garros. But in sports, one can never predict who might come next or what the human athlete can achieve. Clarey was from the beginning watching with “a growing sense of wonder” as Rafael Nadal set about conquering his kingdom of clay in Paris, and The Warrior is an absorbing tribute to the tournament's greatest champion.

Which British players will be competing at Roland Garros 2025?



A British quartet of Katie Boulter, Emma Raducanu, Sonay Kartal and Jodie Burrage have direct entry into the main draw of Roland Garros this year.

British No.1 Boulter made her debut at Roland Garros last year and will be hoping to build on positive results she's managed to pick up on the clay at the Billie Jean King Cup and in Madrid.

Raducanu had a strong run to the third round of the Australian Open earlier in the year and has showed her quality to make the quarter-final of the Miami Open. The former US Open champion has the game to deliver damage on the clay and will be hoping to find her form again in Paris.

Kartal has only continued her rise up the rankings on the clay. Having made the last 16 at Indian Wells, Kartal was the star for GB in the Billie Jean King Cup with two crucial victories and has picked up WTA 1000 wins in Madrid and Rome.

Finally, Burrage has secured her place with a protected ranking as she continues her comeback from a series of injuries.

Harriet Dart, Francesca Jones and Heather Watson are set for qualifying.

 

Jack Draper will head to Paris as one of the favourites for a deep run, after the 23-year-old has cemented his place as arguably the in-form player on the ATP Tour this year.

So far in 2025, Draper has won the Indian Wells title, reached finals in Madrid and Doha, made the fourth round of the Australian Open and broken into the world's top five for the first time.

He'll be joined by Jacob Fearnley who has continued his ascension this season and has had some impressive results on the clay – including a run from qualifying to the third round at the Mutua Madrid Open.

Cam Norrie has picked up more positive results of late, with a third round run in Madrid and Indian Wells. Norrie has won titles on clay in the past an has previously made the third round in Paris on three occasions.

Billy Harris, Jan Choinski and Dan Evans are on this year's qualifying entry list.

More information on which British tennis players will be competing in the doubles, wheelchair and qualifying draws will be available soon.

Sue Barker is the only British singles player to have won the Roland Garros title in the Open Era after she beat Czech star Renata Tomanova in the 1976 women's final.

At the start of the Open Era in 1968 and 1969, Britain's Ann Jones made back-to-back finals but finished runner-up in both to Nancy Richy and Margaret Court.

However, Jones did win the women's doubles title in both those years as well – teaming up with France's Franciose Durr.

Virginia Wade was also crowned women's doubles champion with Court back in 1973, beating Durr and Betty Stove 6-2, 6-3.

Andy Murray is the only male British player to have made a singles final in Paris during the Open Era back in 2016 when he ascended to world No.1. Murray lost out to now three-time champion Novak Djokovic in the final 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.

In the mixed doubles, Great Britain has had two winners in the Open Era. First was John Lloyd with Australia's Wendy Turnbull in 1982 and then later, Joe Salisbury with American Desirae Krawczyk in 2021.

Neal Skupski and Krawczyk finished runners-up in 2024, joining Winnie Shaw (1971) as Britain's only other mixed doubles runner-up.

The Italian Open is now underway, with the WTA and ATP tours continuing to progress towards the French Open.

Jack Sock thinks Jannik Sinner can win the French Open, with the world number one returning from his three-month ban at the Italian Open.

He is the top seed at the ATP Masters 1000 event, with Aryna Sabalenka the top seed at the WTA 1000 tournament in Rome.

Both Sinner and Sabalenka have received byes into round two, with many first round matches now taking centre stage.

The Italian Open helps continue the clay-court season, and comes shortly before the ATP and WTA tours return to the French Open.

Wimbledon and the US Open complete the 2025 Grand Slam schedule, with both taking place later this summer.

And one recent champion of the former is currently dealing with an injury that has forced her to withdraw from the Italian Open.

Marketa Vondrousova, who triumphed at Wimbledon in 2023, has taken to social media to confirm her late withdrawal.

Withdrawing just before her match against Xinyu Wang, she wrote on her Instagram story: “Tried my best but not ready yet. See you next year Rome.”

Vondrousova was replaced by Kamilla Rakhimova at the Italian Open, with the latter going on to beat Wang 6-3, 6-2.

The former meanwhile will likely continue working on her road to recovery, with the Czech ace currently sitting 68th in the WTA rankings.

At 25, Vondrousova has two career titles to her name so far, including that superb 2023 final win over Ons Jabeur at the All England Club, where she became the first unseeded woman in the Open Era to win Wimbledon.

She also has a promising record at the French Open, having made it all the way to the final in 2019 before losing to Ashleigh Barty.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Exclusive: Laura Robson recalls 'cool experience' with Princess Kate amid exciting tennis news","https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/830681/aura-robson-surprise-day-with-princess-kate-womens-tennis-queens/","Wed, 07 May 2025 16:23:11 GMT","

Tennis champion Laura Robson has experienced some incredible moments during her career, from winning Junior Wimbledon at the age of 14 to scooping a silver medal with her mixed doubles partner, Andy Murray, at the London Olympics. 

But off court, one of her greatest memories is of spending time with the Princess of Wales when they spectated together at Wimbledon, describing the special day as ""a really cool experience"".

Laura, who was on the player relations team at the time two years ago, exclusively tells HELLO! that she ""didn't know that was going to be part of my job that day"". 

""[Kate] really loves her tennis,"" she recalls. ""We went out to watch [British female No. 1] Katie Boulter, and then she was going for lunch with Roger Federer afterwards because they were all in the royal box that day.

""I think it's just great to see someone like that support tennis and to have such a passion for it, and the rest of her family are always at Wimbledon as well, so the more support the better.""

After being forced to end her playing career in 2022 due to injury, Laura, 31, is now behind one of the most hotly anticipated dates on the British tennis calendar: she is tournament director for the new Women's WTA 500 event at London's historic The Queen's Club. 

Taking place in June, the tournament sees female players compete at the exclusive members-only tennis club in West London – founded in 1886 – for the first time since 1973. 

And perhaps there, amid the terraces lined with tulips, she will be reunited with the Princess of Wales, who is the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. ""I would love to see her at the women's event here.""

Her enthusiasm for the new event – running from 9-15 June – is infectious. 

Sponsored by HSBC, the men's championships, which have been held at the club since 1889 and follow this year from 16 June, are one of the most-watched grass court events of the season, and the WTA event is expected to be equally popular. 

British tennis stars Katie – a good friend of Laura's – and Emma Raducanu are hoping to play, as are Australian Open champion Madison Keys, four-time major winner Naomi Osaka and last year's Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova. 

""The players are really excited,"" says Laura. ""The women have known about the club for so long but have never been able to play here.""

Many will wonder why women's tournament tennis stopped more than 50 years ago at the £15,000-a-year members' club. 

Laura explains: ""Because of the site being what it is, the tournament couldn't grow as a combined event, which is what it was then. That's where tournaments like Nottingham [where Laura was tournament director from 2022 until 2024] and Eastbourne came about, and they were women-specific for a while.""

Now, though, it makes sense that the four biggest UK tournaments are all male and female events, Laura says. ""Hopefully people will see it [Queen's] as a two-week tennis festival and come to both.""

She's already implemented a crucial change in her new role: this year will see the introduction of a children's creche for players' and coaches' families.

 ""A lot of players rent houses rather than stay at hotels across these weeks and they want to bring their kids,"" she explains. 

""It really feels like a club experience, whereas Wimbledon is huge and you're so far away from the players. Queen's is so intimate, you're going to see the best players in the world from a really close standpoint.""

Who does she tip to win? ""I'm hesitant to say one person, but I think as a director of a British tournament, you always want the Brits to do well,"" she says with a smile.

                Will the World No. 2 feature on the hallowed grass?            

After recent rumours about potentially taking a break after the 2025 Roland Garros Championships, World No. 2 Iga Swiatek has hit back at the media. Her statements come in the aftermath of inconsistencies with form, which led to multiple reports about the 23-year-old possibly skipping the grass court season before the US Open. And now, Swiatek has given an eye-opening reply at the 2025 Italian Open to everyone concerned.

At the recently concluded Madrid Open, Swiatek was dumped out of the tournament by No. 4 seed Coco Gauff. It was a surprisingly meek performance from the five-time Grand Slam winner, resulting in a 1-6 1-6 thumping. Considering the supremely high standards set by Swiatek on tour, 2025 has proven to draw blanks for her. She is yet to win a title this year or enter a final thus far.

Contrary to the prior reports, former World No. 1 Swiatek has denied having plans to skip the solitary grass court major. “Who said that,” countered Swiatek when asked about the hearsay regarding her grass court season plans. “You shouldn't believe this stuff. Well during the past few days, I saw like a million comments that were not true so…”

Earlier Brad Gilbert, former coach of players like Coco Gauff and Andy Murray, criticised the alleged decision of Swiatek to skip Wimbledon. However, the Polish sensation did not pay heed to the white noise. “I don't get it. There are so many theories right now, I would say especially in Polish media, about me that are not true.”

🗣️ “During the past few days, I saw like a million comments that were not true.”Iga Swiatek on recent rumors ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/U5p17wTXtF

“I think, I don't know, you guys like to make some articles that will attract people. And I get it – it's part of the job. But yeah, for sure I'm not going to skip Wimbledon. I really want to learn how to play on grass better and every year is another opportunity. So I will play Wimbledon for sure – unless I get injured.”

Iga Swiatek thrashed current World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final of last year's Rome 1000 event. She is the No. 2 seed in the 2025 edition of the competition – and starts off with a bye in Round-1. She will face either Elina Avanesyan or Elisabetta Cocciaretto in Round-2. A familiar foe in Danielle Collins could potentially await the defending Roland Garros champion in the Round of 32.

Provided Swiatek makes it through to the Round of 16, fans could be treated to a blockbuster clash against No. 16 seed Elina Svitolina. In the quarterfinals, it could be one of the two powerhouses – Paula Badosa or Madison Keys – who opposes the Pole from entering the final four. As per the seeding, either Jessica Pegula or Jasmine Paolini will be Swiatek's possible semifinal opponents before a potential rematch against World No. 1 Sabalenka in the summit clash.

Can Iga Swiatek retain her coveted crowns in Rome and Paris this year? Rest assured, she will gather some much-needed confidence and momentum before heading to Wimbledon if she can.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","World Tennis Month: Story of the longest tennis match in history","https://www.indulgexpress.com/entertainment/sports-entertainment/2025/May/07/world-tennis-month-story-of-the-longest-tennis-match-in-history-john-isner-vs-nicolas-mahut-at-wimbledon-2010","Wed, 07 May 2025 13:23:19 GMT","

Tennis has always been a sport that tests not just physical stamina, but also mental grit and sheer determination. However, in 2010, one particular Wimbledon match took this to a whole new level, becoming a legendary endurance test that remains unmatched to this day.

On June 22, 2010, American John Isner and Frenchman Nicolas Mahut walked onto Court 18 at Wimbledon, expecting a typical first-round match. What unfolded was a bizarre, record-breaking showdown that stretched over three days, lasted an astonishing 11 hours and 5 minutes, and became a part of tennis history.

The final score: 6–4, 3–6, 6–7 (7–9), 7–6 (7–3), 70–68.

The match kicked off on a Tuesday but had to be paused as daylight faded. It picked back up on Wednesday, only to be halted again at a jaw-dropping 59–59 in the fifth set due to darkness. Finally, on Thursday, John Isner clinched the win with a powerful ace.

Fifth set alone lasted over eight gruelling hours

The final set alone dragged on for 8 hours and 11 minutes, making it longer than any complete tennis match ever played. The two players combined for a staggering 216 aces—John with 113 and Nicolas with 103—setting yet another unbreakable record.

Even the chair umpire, Mohamed Lahyani, became part of the legend with his marathon officiating. The scoreboard eventually malfunctioned because it couldn't keep up with the unprecedented score in the set. This epic match led to significant rule changes. Starting in 2019, Wimbledon introduced a final-set tiebreak at 12–12 to avoid similar marathon matches in the future.

The match is often hailed as one of the most incredible physical and mental challenges in sports history. It truly redefined what endurance means in tennis and caught the world's attention. This epic showdown even earned a spot in the Guinness World Records for several remarkable achievements, including being the longest tennis match ever played. 

It also ignited important discussions within the tennis community about player welfare, scheduling, and the constraints of traditional scoring systems. But beyond the numbers, it highlighted the incredible determination of two athletes who simply wouldn't give up—a lasting testament to perseverance and sportsmanship that will forever be part of Wimbledon's legacy.

Emma Raducanu is working with coach Mark Petchey to disguise her service motion, adding more shoulder turn and power in time for Wimbledon this summer; watch Raducanu in the first round of the Italian Open from approximately 4pm on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports Tennis


          Interviews, Comment & Analysis
              @RazMirza


Wednesday 7 May 2025 15:15, UK

Emma Raducanu's promising performances at the Madrid Open have not gone unnoticed with coach Mark Petchey working on elevating her serve in time for Wimbledon.

The 22-year-old posted her first win on outdoor clay courts since 2022 with a straight-sets victory over Suzan Lamens in the Spanish capital but her hopes of another strong WTA 1000 run ended with a second-round loss to Marta Kostyuk.

Raducanu is next in action in the first round of the Italian Open as she faces 19-year-old Australian Maya Joint in the first round in Rome on Wednesday - live on Sky Sports Tennis from approximately 4pm.



The former US Open champion took a break from the WTA Tour following her run to the Miami Open quarter-finals last month and instead took part in a training block with Mark Petchey ahead of the clay-court swing.

Sky Sports' Colin Fleming felt clay novice Raducanu could take a lot from her defeat against world No 36 Kostyuk, who is seen as a specialist on the red dirt.

""This was a good level at times on a surface where she hasn't played a lot of tennis recently,"" he said during commentary.

""If she can keep working, keep finding her feet in the clay, her movement, her balance and just comfort on this surface. I think she can still have some great results in this clay-court season and I think it will serve her well for beyond that into the grass and the hard.

""A lot of positives to take from this one.""

Fleming also said Raducanu gave a clear indication of what she has been working on alongside coach Petchey since he came on board for their ad-hoc partnership after mentoring her at the Miami Open.

Petchey has previously coached former world No 1 Andy Murray into the world's top 50, splitting in 2006 after less than 12 months together, and briefly worked with Greek ace Maria Sakkari.

""She's gone back to her more natural service motion since working with Mark Petchey recently,"" revealed Fleming. ""She has done a bit of work with Nick Cavaday [former coach] on adjusting the motion.

""She's always had a natural, flowing rhythmic service motion, and it became a bit more abbreviated with the work under Cavaday. I understand why! Trying to get the serve bigger, more impactful during matches. It's back to that longer, flowing rhythm.""

Raducanu served four aces, winning 56 per cent of her first serve points [25/45] and 66 per cent of her second serve points [19/29] with just one double fault during her win over Lamens, while did not serve any aces during her defeat against Kostyuk, hitting four double faults, and winning 60 per cent [35/58] of her first serve points but 41 per cent [14/34] of her second serve points.











Former four-time Grand Slam champion turned tennis analyst, Jim Courier, hopes Raducanu will give his colleague Petchey the opportunity to work through the grass season, where he believes she can thrive.

""When Covid-19 hit, they went to work together, in private in the UK, so he knew her before she became a star,"" the American said on the Tennis Channel.

""That's obviously important for her in a time when she's not been able to find a regular relationship with coaches.

""Relying on someone that she knew before it happened is really important so I don't know how long it can last, but frankly the fact that they're spending time together right now is really important. What I do hope is that it's able to last at least through the grass-court season.

""No one's expecting her to play well on clay, it's not a natural surface for her. Grass is a surface where she first surfaced, she made the round 16 at Wimbledon before she won the US Open so for me, it's about the building blocks for the grass-court season.""

Courier also indicated the young Brit has been working on masking her service motion and adding more potency in preparation for Wimbledon which begins on June 30.

Before the grass season, however, Raducanu competes at the WTA 1000 in Rome before the French Open.

Courier added: ""What I do know already is he's changed her service motion by adding more shoulder turn which the idea is to try and give her a little bit more disguise and a little more power. But I think overall this is a net positive for her on so many levels, we'll see where it goes.""

Raducanu has been without a permanent coach since parting ways with Nick Cavaday in January.

Before adding Petchey to her team, the British tennis star had a two-week trial period with Vladimir Platenik.

Christopher Clarey, who covered tennis and international sports for 40 years for the International Herald Tribune and the New York Times, wrote what is widely regarded as the definitive book on Roger Federer: “The Master: The Long Run and Beautiful Game of Roger Federer.”

Now he has produced a similarly authoritative book on Federer's longtime rival and friend, Rafael Nadal: “The Warrior: Rafael Nadal and His Kingdom of Clay.” The book tells the story of both Nadal and clay-court tennis, using the Spanish great's relationship with Roland Garros, the French Open, as its frame.

In an interview with The Athletic, Clarey explained why he chose this approach for tackling the subject of the 22-time Grand Slam champion, someone he covered for the entirety of his career and, as a Spanish speaker, with whom he was able to communicate in Nadal's native language.

“Rafa is a lot funnier and wittier and quicker and a little more acid, for sure, when he's at ease in his own language than he is as the philosophical snippet Rafa from English press conferences over the years,” Clarey said.

An excerpt from Clarey's book follows the interview, detailing the four French sports heroes without whom Nadal's Roland Garros legacy could never have existed.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.



Why did you take this approach to Nadal?

The one thing that really ate at me over the years that I knew I would regret if I didn't do was a Roland Garros book. That was the one that I had connected to as a very young person. I lived a couple of blocks away. My wife is French. She's from that area. And that was the one that I really connected with. Wimbledon was the first one that I covered, but I learned French as I was covering Roland Garros. All these things happened there. I really knew from a pretty early age as a journalist that if I didn't write a book about that at some point, I was going to have a regret about it.

Rafa had done a good autobiography. I wanted to find a way to do something a little more challenging and original for me, and fresh. I don't want to reduce him to Roland Garros, but this gave me a chance to go at Roland Garros and put them together, because I don't think there's anybody else who could be as defined by the dominance of one event than him.

You grew up in America on hard courts. Where did your affinity for clay come from? 

Watching on TV as a kid. We didn't have that much like we do now, but my family was a tennis family and we watched the majors when we could and listened to Bud Collins and his nicknames and all the rest, and the French Open had this mystical, exotic quality. You had to move so differently. I taught tennis for one summer in East Hampton Tennis Club after Williams College to make money for traveling. It was on green clay. By the end, like the last week or two, I could actually slide on the stuff.

And then, when I met my wif,e and I got a chance to go to Roland Garros and cover it, I just loved the scrape, the sound, the light. In Paris, at Roland Garros, at night … That sort of end-of-day light across the clay, the colors … I think it was just the fact that it was so different from what I had grown up with as a youngster that made it so appealing.

There used to be the argument that the French Open doesn't produce the all-time greats in the same way that the other Slams do.

It is a fair point because the game was played primarily on grass initially, then on quicker surfaces through the hard-court era. The speed of the game and the skill sets hadn't been as homogenized at that point, so there really were big deltas in terms of what somebody was able to do on one surface versus another. What I didn't grasp until later on, and actually it came from talking to Americans and adopted Americans like Patrick McEnroe and Jose Higueras, was what an incredible tool clay-court tennis is for learning the game. If you can get the speeds right and the technique a little bit more compact, it can translate to everything because of the angles that you have to create and the geometry you have to understand.

For a long time, I think the really underappreciated thing about Rafa was how great a tennis mathematician and geometrist he was. I think people thought of him as a slugging warrior type — look at my title of the book — somebody who was more grit than genius. I think that's selling him short.

Did you get much pushback from his people that you were portraying him as a clay-court specialist?

There's no doubt that what he is going to be remembered 20 years from now is his 14 Roland Garros titles. In your memory, a red-clay backdrop. Now, in no way does that sell anything else that he did short. In some ways, it magnifies the things he was able to do elsewhere. Even if he had never played on clay, he still would have had a double-times-two Hall of Fame career. Eight other majors put him in John McEnroe and Andre Agassi territory, and no one's complaining about them.

His camp was afraid it was going to diminish the overall body of work. I really don't think it does that. He was chasing other things from a very early age. But their career-long focus was to make Rafa a global champion, an all-court champion. They wanted to take Rafa big and broad, and their ticket to that was to go beyond clay.

Was there a point between his first and 14th titles when you thought someone was going to take him out?

In 2015, 2016, when Novak Djokovic finally solved him there and Rafa was going through his tennis existential crisis, the anxiety attacks on court. But that led to the big comeback year of 2017. I always knew he'd be competitive on clay, but I thought Novak had solved it and Novak had taken over the game. In tennis, when you're king of the hill and somebody deposes you, you're never quite the same again. Novak had all the tools to make his life miserable on every surface.

What was the most surprising thing you heard as you were researching and writing this? 

How much people in Mallorca were accessible to him. These were guys who were more on the expert level than probably Toni Nadal was, who coached juniors nationally in Spain. Early on, Rafa would just play it at light speed. Bounce the ball, serve. Ball, serve, with all that life-force and vitality that he has. They felt like he was burning himself out that way, so they gave him his routines to slow him down. If they had let him just go with his natural thing, kind of like Federer, his natural original state of just madness and self-immolation on the court … That's quite a different thing than what we saw.

I didn't realize quite how much of a village had raised him tennis-wise. Toni is the main guy; never take that away from him. But how does a guy like that really raise a champion to the level of Nadal? Well, the fact is, he didn't do it really alone. He had Carlos Costa, who had been top 10 in the world. He was very much early on in the process as the agent, but also knew a heck of a lot about tennis. And then he also had Carlos Moya, who was in many ways just as essential.

What does a hyper-competitive person like Nadal do in retirement to fill that need to compete?

That competitive streak does not exclude having the ability to have fun. Nadal has that duality in him, but anybody who knows him will talk about that vitality and that intensity of energy during the day. I think both he and Federer were hyperactive children, just overflowing energy that needed to come out and was channeled into sport.

He set up so many things with business, with the academy structure. He's definitely focused on that through his family and Toni's influence, but it's spreading and he's got a lot of business deals going on. And I definitely see him trying to compete recreationally in golf.

Maybe it will be more of “you'll come to me,” but I wouldn't be surprised to see him become part of a coaching team for a top Spanish player, maybe even Carlos Alcaraz down the road. They have a big connection.

These guys, Nadal and Federer, will stay engaged. They know that they're tied together and they know that part of the business model is a Big Three. We'll see what happens with Djokovic when he retires, whether they integrate him into their club. But Nadal and Federer will do things. They've built these empires.

The following excerpt introduces four French tennis professionals from almost a century ago, who had an indelible impact on Nadal's tennis legacy and that of the French Open. The full chapter, ‘The Founders,' outlines their shared lives from the tennis court to the fields of battle, and details how their collective success resonated throughout the tennis world and through history.

Roland Garros, the dusty French domain that Rafael Nadal would rule for nearly twenty years, almost certainly would not have existed without four men he never met who played their best tennis nearly a century ago. They were known, predictably for French sports heroes, as the Musketeers, even if the first to nickname them was an American rival who had seen a movie based on Frenchman Alexandre Dumas's work.

All for one and one for all (unless they were playing each other), les Mousquetaires — Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste — changed the history of tennis and of Parisian landmarks, creating the need, with their resounding success, for a tennis stadium worthy of staging what was in 1928 one of the leading events in global sport: the Davis Cup.

“The Musketeers of Alexandre Dumas were ready to die for each other,” Borotra once said. “Luckily, we didn't have to go that far, but there was a mutual devotion between us of a higher order, every bit as profound.”

Tennis would have continued to grow in France without their breakthrough, but the prime and leafy location where Roland‑Garros Stadium was constructed would very likely have been developed differently without the Davis Cup victory in 1927 against “Big” Bill Tilden and the Americans. Other French organizations and sports federations coveted the site, whose lease had just expired, but tennis was now a national priority in France.

The Musketeers were riding on the momentum and enormous interest that had been generated by their compatriot Suzanne Lenglen. She was one of the transcendent athletes and personalities of the 1920s, and she reveled in it, breaking social codes with her knee‑length tennis outfits that were risqué for the time. She dominated the game and the courtside conversations with her balletic shot making full of leaps and flourishes, losing just one singles match between 1919 and 1926.

She inspired not only sportswriters but songwriters: “Ah! Suzanne!” was a hit in Paris in 1925, its title drawn from what spectators would exclaim as they watched her at play. Lenglen was also a muse for the Musketeers. She convinced Brugnon, the oldest of the four, to postpone his law studies and focus on tennis, and partnered successfully with him, Borotra, and Cochet in mixed doubles. She even offered tactical and technical advice, recommending that Lacoste lower the grip on his ground strokes and shorten his preparation time. But she, unlike Lacoste, was no poker‑faced technician. La Divine, as she was known in France, was a flamboyant attacking player, and Borotra, who played with the same brio and spontaneity, was mesmerized when he first saw Lenglen play in 1919.

“She had adopted what was traditionally the game of a man, with the volleys and an overhead of great power,” Borotra told me. “She had remarkable reflexes. She had an incredible game. There was never another one like her. She was also an intelligent woman, a great credit to France.”

But her business decision to turn professional in 1926 — she was the first female tennis player to do so — did not leave a void for long in French tennis because the Musketeers were establishing themselves as the preeminent force in the men's game.

They had sobriquets of their own. The dashing and sometimes maddening Borotra, who was born in the French Basque country in Biarritz and was fond of wearing a blue beret on court, was the Bounding Basque. Cochet, a diminutive and seemingly nonchalant shot maker extraordinaire from Lyon, was the Magician. Brugnon, primarily a doubles specialist in an age when doubles mattered more, was Toto. Lacoste, with his cunning and relentless game, was the Crocodile.

I never got the chance to interview Cochet or Brugnon before their deaths. But after I moved to France, I did spend time in the early 1990s with Lacoste and Borotra when I was on assignment for the International Herald Tribune. Given their advanced ages — Lacoste was 88, Borotra was 94 — I was well aware of how precious an opportunity this was. I twice visited Lacoste and his wife, Simone, at their villa in the Basque country near Saint Jean de Luz on the Chantaco golf course, which Simone's father had built in honor of Simone's golfing achievements.

Lacoste, at this stage, was frail, restricted in his movements because of a heart condition and reliant on a motorized chair to mount and descend the house's sweeping central staircase. “Doctor's orders,” he explained to me. “If you were a pretty woman, you could ride up on my knees, but you are not.”

I met Borotra briefly at the 1991 Davis Cup final in Lyon, where he was doused with champagne after a French team led by Guy Forget, Henri Leconte, and charismatic captain Yannick Noah ended a 59‑year Davis Cup drought that dated to the Musketeers by upsetting another powerhouse United States squad that this time included a young Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.

In 1993, a year before Borotra died, he granted me an audience (that was how it felt) in his elegant Haussmannian apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris. In a dark business suit and with his hair slicked back over his high forehead, Borotra was still full of vigor as he took me on a train‑to‑catch tour of his drawing room, where a shiny replica of the Davis Cup was on prominent display. He was firm of handshake and brisk of step and, though hitting forehands had become too painful because of arthritis, he continued to practice his backhand with hitting partners or, more often, against the wall at his longtime fief, the Tennis Club de Paris.

“The wall has no problem hitting to my backhand,” Borotra explained.

He was droll. He was dry. The problem for me was that Borotra was so hard of hearing that our interview had to be conducted at a shout, which was no way to build rapport. But Borotra's mind and memory, like Lacoste's, were still sharp: a fine advertisement for spending much of one's life in and around tennis. Both came to the game relatively late — as teenagers — and were drawn to it after trips to England. But while Lacoste, at age 15, committed himself immediately and systematically to studying the game's finer points, Borotra, a natural athlete who had played Basque pelota and other sports in his early youth, did not get truly serious about tennis or even join a club until after World War One.

He was in his early twenties, but with trademark energy and unconventional technique, he made up for lost time by relentlessly attacking the net. More man of action than reflection, he won nineteen major titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, and was the only Musketeer to win the Australian Championships (and the only one to make the long sea voyage to play in the Australian Championships). He sparred with Tilden, who often found him insufferable and dubbed him “the Bantering Basque,” put off by his attention‑grabbing behavior and gallantries. Borotra liked to doff his beret and kiss female spectators' hands if forced to chase a shot into the stands. But he was certainly a crowd favorite, one of tennis' and Wimbledon's main attractions in the 1920s and 1930s.

Lacoste was from an affluent background: His father, Jean Jules, was a top executive at luxury automaker Hispano Suiza and started his own automotive company. But René, his only son, would have a successful business career of his own. He worked in shipping, banking, and the automotive and aviation industries but was best known for co-founding the Lacoste Clothing Company, which became a leading global brand with its crocodile trademark inspired by Lacoste's nickname. But when I asked him in French what he considered himself, he answered un bricoleur, which literally translates to “handyman.”

“Tinkerer” might be more appropriate. He was an inventor at heart: creating, with Simone's help, the innovative cotton Polo shirts that helped him through the hot American summers; and constructing and patenting the first metal tennis racket. It was later called the Wilson T2000 and used by Jimmy Connors and Billie Jean King to win major titles. Connors, no lover of authority or polished manners, treated “Mr. Lacoste” with great deference throughout his playing career.

“I will be perhaps dead next week, but for the moment, I am thinking about what I will be doing and inventing next year, and in two years,” Lacoste told me.

Even at a late stage in life, his workshop was overflowing with plans and prototypes for new rackets, vibration dampeners, and golf clubs. Golf was arguably his own family's most successful sport. Simone won the British Ladies Amateur title in 1927. Forty years later, Catherine, their only daughter, stunned the golf world by winning the 1967 U.S. Women's Open at age 22. She was the first European to win a women's golf major and remains the only amateur to have won the U.S. Women's Open.

“When Catherine went to the USA the first time, someone asked her, ‘Are you the daughter of René Lacoste?' And she was a bit upset by that,” René said. “Several years later, after she won the U.S. Open, we were all heading to the USA, and somebody asked me at customs if by any chance, I was the father of Catherine Lacoste. Catherine was delighted.”

ROME - Canadians Bianca Andreescu and Victoria Mboko cruised to wins over local favourites Wednesday in opening-round action at the Italian Open WTA 1000 tennis tournament.

Andreescu, from Mississauga, Ont., faced few problems from Italy's Federica Urgesi in a 6-0, 6-3 victory, winning 97.1 per cent of first service points without facing a break point in a dominant first set.

The 24-year-old cruised to a 5-1 lead in the second set before Urgesi responded with a hold and a break. Andreescu put the game away with her six break-point conversion on 10 chances.

Andreescu will face 20th-seed Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round. Vekic won the only other match between the two at last year's Paris Olympics, which was also played on clay.

Andreescu, a former world No. 4 and the 2019 U.S. Open champion, made her return from a six-month absence to the WTA circuit earlier this year at the Open de Rouen. She improved to 2-3 on the season, with her other victory coming at the Madrid Open WTA 1000 event.

Earlier, Toronto's Mboko posted a comfortable 6-2, 6-3 victory over Italy's Arianna Zucchini 

Mboko, who advanced to her second career 1000-series event through qualifying, converted six break points, including three in a sequence that saw the 18-year-old Canadian and Zucchini trade breaks over the final five games of the second set.

Mboko, ranked 158th in the world, has compiled a 33-3 record this season while racking up five titles on the lower-tier ITF circuit.

She will face fourth seed Coco Gauff of the United States in the second round.

The other Canadian in the women's draw, Leylah Fernandez of Laval, Que., is seeded 24th and has a first-round bye.

Felix Auger-Aliassime and Gabriel Diallo, both from Montreal, and Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., are entered on the men's side.

Diallo faces American Marcos Giron in first-round action Thursday while Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov have byes.

Long before Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal dominated the global stage, Spain boasted tennis trailblazers like Carlos Moyá, Juan Carlos Ferrero, and Sergi Bruguera. But even earlier, pioneers such as Andrés Gimeno, Manuel Santana, and Manuel Orantes laid the groundwork for Spain's rich tennis tradition.

Manuel Orantes, born in 1949 on the outskirts of Barcelona, is one of those foundational figures. Growing up in humble surroundings, his tennis journey began as a ball boy at Club de Tenis de la Salut, where coach Pedro Mora discovered and guided him through his junior career. By 1966, Orantes was making waves, capturing junior titles at Wimbledon and the Orange Bowl.

Orantes turned professional in 1968 during the dawn of the Open Era, an era that transformed tennis into the professional and globally organized sport it is today. Early on, Orantes showcased his talent, earning notable victories over legends like Jimmy Connors and Guillermo Vilas.

With 34 career titles, Orantes is the second most decorated Spanish player in the Open Era, trailing only Rafael Nadal's 92 titles. He achieved his first professional victory in 1969, defeating Manuel Santana in Barcelona. His career-high ATP ranking of World No. 2 came during a dominant stretch in the early 1970s, highlighted by his eight titles in 1972 and 1973.

Orantes' crowning moment came at the 1975 US Open when he defeated top-seeded Jimmy Connors in straight sets to claim the title. This victory followed an unforgettable semifinal against Guillermo Vilas, where Orantes staged an epic comeback, rallying from two sets to one down and saving three match points in the fourth set.

Orantes and Vilas shared a love-hate relationship. The duo started as doubles partners, achieving early success together in tournaments like Buenos Aires and Sweden. However, their friendship soured over time.

In a 2024 interview with La Vanguardia, Orantes reflected on the rivalry. “There's a story with Vilas… We had become friends. I usually played doubles with Antonio Muñoz, but he didn't have a high enough singles ranking to qualify for Wimbledon. In 1974, I partnered with Guillermo. We played in Sweden and Buenos Aires, and we started winning matches,” he recalled.

But tensions rose during an Australian tournament, which Vilas won while Orantes reached the semifinals. “Fame went to his head. From that point on, whenever we played, I didn't just want to beat him—I wanted to go all out,” Orantes continued.

The rivalry reached its peak at the 1975 US Open semifinal, where Orantes delivered one of the most dramatic victories of his career. “I was losing two sets to one against Guillermo Vilas. In the fourth set, I was down 0-5 and 0-40. I turned it around to win the set and eventually took the fifth, 6-4. That year, I won nine tournaments,” he added.

Orantes retired in the mid-1980s and briefly served as captain of Spain's Davis Cup team. His tenure ended in the early 1990s following disputes with Emilio Sánchez Vicario. Despite stepping away from formal coaching roles, Orantes has remained deeply connected to the sport.

In 2012, Orantes was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, cementing his place among the game's all-time greats. Today, he continues to inspire the next generation of Spanish players and is revered as a national icon.

Armed with a blazing serve, whipping forehand and seemingly endless stores of charisma, there was an undeniably dazzling quality as Matteo Berrettini fired up his stylish weapons to achieve early professional milestones.

From a first career title, at Gstaad as a 22-year-old in 2018, Berrettini progressed to a maiden Grand Slam semifinal appearance at the 2019 US Open, the first Italian man to do so in 35 years.

The highs – along with passionate fans and lucrative sponsors – kept coming as he charged to the Wimbledon final in 2021, making him the first player from his nation to progress to a singles decider at The Championships. Following another Grand Slam semifinal appearance at Australian Open 2022, he peaked at a career-high ranking of world No.6.

It was hard to dispute the glamorous appeal as Berrettini combined those career heights with off-court pursuits such as modelling assignments for designer fashion label Hugo Boss and a Met Gala appearance.

The foundations for success, however, were built on qualities considerably more solid – as Berrettini, now 29, has demonstrated in overcoming challenge after challenge in more recent chapters of his career. 

“Last year [2023] was really, really tough, one of the worse years of my career and my life as well,” he admitted in Shanghai last season. “When you're not able to do your job and what you like to do, then it's always a struggle.”

Those struggles for the Italian came on multiple fronts, several of them overlapping. After sustaining an injury in a fourth-round run at Indian Wells in 2023, he required emergency right hand surgery, sidelining him for the entire clay-court swing that season.

Berrettini recovered to win consecutive grasscourt titles at Stuttgart and Queen's but on the eve of returning to Wimbledon as defending finalist, a positive Covid test forced his withdrawal. 

The physical challenges continued. After the US Open, he abandoned his 2023 season due to a ruptured ankle ligament. A new foot injury thwarted his return at AO 2024.

It was a series of events that, unsurprisingly, saw the Italian question his ability to remain on tour.

“Unfortunately, since I was really young, I got injured a lot. But when I was younger, I had this energy of just ‘I'm going to do anything in my power to come back and feel stronger and be better',” he explained to Australian Tennis Magazine in January.

“And then, for the first time in 2023, after I broke my ankle, I felt like I didn't have that energy to come back anymore. So, I started to question, ‘Am I going to be able to do it?'”

FIVE IN FOCUS: Ruud, Sabalenka, Draper, Swiatek, Sinner

As hard-gained stores of resilience kicked in, so too did the critical support of Berrettini's closest supporters.

“I was really lucky because people around me they never doubt this, they always told me that I could've done it, I just had to find the energy inside me,” he added. “So I trusted them, and I kept going, and that's what I proved to myself. I think once again, I proved [to] myself that I could come back.”

Indeed, the positive outlook proved priceless as Berrettini, despite the delayed start, constructed a transformational 2024 season. With titles in Marrakech, Gstaad and Kitzbuhel – along with his fifth appearance in a grasscourt final in Stuttgart – the Italian climbed from No.154 in March to No.34 by season's end. With that turnaround, he earned ATP Comeback of the Year honours.



Alongside the public recognition for the hard work he'd invested in his career rebuild, another reward for Berrettini was profoundly more personal. Having faced the possibility that a pro-playing career could be taken away, he developed a deep sense of gratitude for his time on tour.

“I was talking to my family a few days ago about how now I'm obviously more wise about my tennis life, and I appreciate the moments more,” Berrettini explained. 

“When you're younger, you just want to get better, stronger, you want your ranking to be higher, you don't really pay attention to details or what is happening around you.

“Now I've been there, I'm appreciating the journey, I'm appreciating every single day. Some days, I know they're going to be tough; some days are going to be better, but it gives you this knowledge of yourself into the career that only time can give to you.""

The ability to make the best of every challenge was also rewarded in other ways. When he was sidelined due to injury in the Davis Cup 2023 Finals, Berrettini nevertheless supported his Italian countrymen courtside as they surged to the world team title.

“I consider myself pretty humble, but when I'm on the bench, I think you could feel that there is something, like, the energy is different,” explained Berrettini, who won both matches he contested – over Thanasi Kokkinakis and Botic van de Zandschulp – in the Davis Cup 2024 Finals to help Italy defend the title.

The first quarter of 2025 saw Berrettini gradually regaining consistency, with quarterfinal appearances at Doha, Dubai and Miami. An upset of Novak Djokovic in the firstround at Doha marked his first win over the Serbian in five matches.

It was further reward for the painstaking efforts Berrettini has invested in rebuilding his career. “On hard court, [Djokovic is] one of the toughest ever, like toughest opponent you can ever play,” he said. 

“But at the same time, I told my team that I wanted to take this chance to enjoy the match, to take my chances, to play aggressive, to try to do what we've been working on in the last month … on the match point, I just, I think I smiled, you know, like just happiness. [It's] for these matches I train and I sacrifice.”



With that steady progress, Berrettini returned to world No.27 after Miami, which set him on track for his goal to be seeded at Grand Slams. 

If not quite yet the heady heights of his earlier career milestones, Berrettini moves forward knowing that his overall journey in the sport is one to cherish.

In a recent “Love letter to tennis” feature on ATPTour.com, he expanded on the many ways that tennis had changed his life.

“I think everything bad, if we can call it bad, that happened, it was really worth it because then it brought me here to enjoy [the game] to the fullest,” Berrettini smiled. 

“[It] taught me to be resilient, to keep fighting, to trust the people that you're working with. For me it's not only about the sport, but the chance to meet people, to create friends, almost family members. I had the fortune to meet the people that changed my life, on and off the court.”

As the Italian Open starts, the absence of dominant figures on both the ATP and WTA Tours is more noticeable than ever. Jannik Sinner's three-month suspension left a temporary void at the top of the men's game, while the women's circuit had new champions. Madison Keys, who won the Australian Open early this year, reflected on the change of tide, especially after legends such as Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal left the game.

“There are so many players now […] you wouldn't be surprised if 20 different people won a tournament,” Keys said recently, reflecting on the current state of the game. “It's happening on both tours.”

According to the American, part of this shift stems from the retirement of iconic names such as Williams, Federer or Nadal. “You don't have Serena showing up and assuming she's going to win every time. On the men's side, you don't have Roger, Rafa, and Novak [Djokovic] every single week either.”

But the change isn't just about who's missing, it's also about how much deeper the competition has become. “The base level has gotten much higher. The margin for error is so much smaller,” Keys said. “If both players are playing well, the match could come down to just two points.”

She also noted that today's players are getting stronger and that the game is now “more physical” than ever. “Players are getting fitter and staying healthy longer,” she added. “That's why we're seeing so many close, competitive matches.”

While Keys has long been a consistent force on the WTA Tour, 2025 has been her most successful campaign to date. In January, she captured her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a career-defining final. It marked a return to the sport's biggest stage nearly eight years after her first major final appearance at the 2017 US Open.

The 30-year-old began her season with a title in Adelaide, beating fellow American Jessica Pegula in the final. Strong showings at Indian Wells and the Madrid Open have followed, cementing her status as one of the year's most consistent players. However, as she expressed, anything can happen this season.

Aryna Sabalenka has described herself as a “very unpleasant person” on the tennis court as she asserted her belief that players “have to be mean.”

The world No 1's fierce on-court attitude and intensity has earned her the reputation of being one of the toughest competitors in tennis.

However, Sabalenka is also well known for her sense of humour and likeable personality away from the match court.

The Belarusian star extended her huge lead at the top of the WTA Rankings to 4,345 points with her triumph at the Madrid Open.

Sabalenka defeated Coco Gauff 6-3, 7-6(3) in the final of the WTA 1000 event in Madrid to claim her third title of 2025 after wins in Brisbane and Miami.

The 27-year-old has also been a runner-up at the Australian Open, the Indian Wells Open and the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart this year.

Speaking to Bolshe!, Sabalenka spoke with brutal honesty about her on-court personality. 

“I can say that I am a very unpleasant person on the court, I am downright nasty. Well, not nasty, no, very tenacious, with a character,” Sabalenka said (translated from Russian).

“Probably b**chy. In short, a b**ch, yes. That's how they called me here. Probably, I have sporting greed and tenacity.

“I think you have to be mean. Of course, you can be a good person, a good girl off the court, but on the court you have to be mean, hungry, greedy and very unpleasant.”

Sabalenka will aim to extend her six-match winnings streak at the Italian Open, where she is seeking a maiden title. She was a runner-up to Iga Swiatek in Rome last year.

Ahead of her Italian Open campaign, Sabalenka was asked about her 3-3 record in finals this season.

“Well, honestly, that's a good problem to have,” Sabalenka said in her pre-tournament press conference.

“At the same time some of the finals I lost were really heartbreaking and were really tough to kind of like accept.

“At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just have to learn and sometimes you're not that good on court, you just have to accept, learn from that loss, and come back stronger.

“What I'm actually proud of [is] that I was able to come back in those finals and I was able to change things and see if the lesson was learned, try to bring better tennis in the next final.”

Rory McIlroy loves Australian golf courses and the Australian Open and now there's growing speculation about the Masters champ heading to play.

There's no date or course locked in yet for the 2025 Australian Open but speculation is growing that Masters champ Rory McIlroy will be playing. 

After heavy criticism from leading players including Cam Smith, Golf Australia officials abandoned the dual-gender format of the Open, which involved the men's and women's events being played on the same course at the same time. 

Smith said moving it back to a stand-alone event would help lure bigger names to the tournament which could ﻿“be the fifth major”. 

 “I think it lends itself to have a stronger field, having more guys come down here and play the Australian Open and let it be the event it once was,” he said when the format change was confirmed. 

But while the events have been split, there's no confirmed start dates for the 2025 men's Open, with speculation that the Royal Melbourne composite course will host. 

With the historic tournament returning to a stand-alone event in either late November or early December, the door is open for a raft of the world's best players who end the PGA Tour season in August, before the Ryder Cup. 

McIlroy will be a part of what looms as the biggest ever clash between Europe and the US and could follow that with a trip to Australia according to former pro turned commentator Mark Allen. 

“As we speak here right now, it's going to happen,” Allen told the Talk Birdies to me Podcast. 

“But we all know in the sporting world that things can change.”

McIlroy is a previous winner of the Australian Open, winning in 2013 when he defeated Adam Scott by a stroke. 

He's often spoken about his love of Royal Melbourne and recently said the tournament, won by the game's biggest names including Jack Nicklaus and Greg Norman, needed to once again be “elevated” to lofty status as part of an elite world tour. 

“I think the Australian Open needs to be put up .... it was always a very big tournament in the day and that could be one that could be elevated,” he said. 

Golf Australia said there was nothing formal” to confirm as it works through the staging of both the men's and women's Opens. “Golf Australia continues to work through the future of the men's and women's Australian Opens, with nothing formal to confirm at this point in time,” a statement said. 

“We look forward to working with our partners to confirm and announce the future of both events in the coming weeks.”

McIlroy is teeing it up for the second time since his breakthrough win at Augusta at this week's $30 million Truist Championship in Philadelphia.

ROME • ITALY

For nearly 100 years, the Internazionali BNL d'Italia (AKA the Italian Open) has been making women's tennis history. From Lili Alvarez winning in three sets in 1930 against her doubles partner Lucia Valerio, to Open Era multi-time champions like Chris Evert, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams and Iga Swiatek, Rome's annual WTA 1000 spectacle has given the sport's best athletes a stage to perform at the highest level.The Italian Open is played on outdoor clay courts at the historic Foro Italico, with the biggest matches taking place at the incomparable Stadio Centrale.

On Wednesday afternoon, 133 Cardinals representing some 70 countries will gather in the Sistine Chapel to begin the age-old process of selecting the successor to Pope Francis.

Eventually, the Conclave will produce the next leader for 1.4 billion Catholics and, after the signature white smoke emerges, he'll appear on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.

At the same time, a mere four kilometers away, another global selection process will be underway at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Forty-nine of the Top 50 players in the PIF WTA Rankings are scheduled to begin play on Tuesday -- only Barbora Krejcikova (back injury) is missing.

All eyes will be on World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, winner of the past two WTA 1000 events, the most recent on the red clay of Madrid, and No. 2 Iga Swiatek, who has won the Rome title three of the past four years.

Here's a look at some of the leading storylines:

Naomi Osaka vs. wild card Sara Errani

Marketa Vondrousova vs. Wang Xinyu

Dayana Yastremska vs. Anastasia Potapova

Naomi Osaka comes into Rome with some serious momentum after capturing the L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo title in France. It was the first career clay-court title for Osaka, a wild card who defeated Kaja Juvan of Slovenia 6-1, 7-5 in the final. Osaka's ranking rose six spots this past week to No. 48.

She went 5-0 for the week, her first clay matches since last summer Olympic Games in Paris, when she lost in the first round to Angelique Kerber. It was her first title at any level since collecting her fourth Grand Slam singles crown five years ago at the Australian Open.

Kinda ironic to win my first trophy back on the surface that I thought was my worst. That's one of my favorite things about life though, there's always room to grow and evolve.

Three players are using their personal ranking to join the main draw: Petra Kvitova, Bianca Andreescu and Anastasija Sevastova.

Kvitova plays Irina-Camelia Begu, always dangerous on clay. Andreescu gets 20-year-old Italian wildcard Federica Urgesi, while Sevastova meets another Italian, Lucia Bronzetti.

Sevastova wasn't sure she'd walk unaided again. She was wrong

Chris Evert won the most titles (five) at the Italian Open. Conchita Martinez, Gabriela Sabatini and Serena Williams are the next with four each. Martinez is the only player male or female to win on four consecutive occasions, between 1993 and 1996.

Williams (44) has the most women's singles match wins in the Open Era, with Conchita Martinez (43) registering the next most. Victoria Azarenka's 28 are the most of any active player.

Sixteen-year-old Tracy Austin (1979) is the youngest player in the Open Era to win the women's singles at the Italian Open. Serena, at 34, was the oldest champion, winning the title in 2016. She won the title three times after turning 30.

Only three women have won the titles in Madrid and Rome in the same season -- Dinara Safina (2009), Serena Williams (2013) and Iga Swiatek (2024), and all did it as World No. 1. Aryna Sabalenka has the opportunity to match them.

Among players with multiple appearances at the event in the Open Era, Evert holds the best winning percentage at the Italian Open (.923), while Swiatek (.909) has the second-best.

Only a few weeks ago, 17-year-old Tyra Caterina Grant -- one of the most promising young players in the world -- was playing under the United States colors, but here in Rome she's representing Italy. She received a wild card and many will be watching her first-round match against a qualifier to be named later.

Grant was born in Rome to an American father and Italian mother and grew up near Milan and trained at the Piatti Academy where Jannik Sinner learned his craft. Grant spent time in Florida at the USTA national campus as well. Grant has won three junior Grand Slam doubles titles and reached the singles semifinals at last year's French Open. The move has been anticipated for several weeks.

Play is Monday and Tuesday and will deliver a dozen players to the main draw. 

Top seeds: No. 1 Katie Volynets, No. 2 Anna Blinkova, No. 3 Zeynep Sonmez, No. 4 Maya Joint, No. 5 Ajla Tomljanovic.

Surprise guest: 35-year-old Alize Cornet. She announced her retirement last year at Roland Garros but returns to action, opposite No. 22 seed Anna Bondar

ROME, Italy— Victoria Azarenka shook her head as she walked out of a press conference at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.“I'm surprised I didn't have any non-match related questions,” she said. “Everybody else gets asked and I don't get asked. I mean, I have opinions.”The weekend leading up to the tournament had been consumed by hot topics ranging from anti-doping to player safeguarding, and the former No. 1-turned-WTA Player Council stalwart was feeling left out of the loop.Azarenka got her crack at the sport's latest hot topics at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, starting with the return of ATP world No. 1 Jannik Sinner from a three-month anti-doping suspension.

Azarenka got her crack at the sport's latest hot topics at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, starting with the return of ATP world No. 1 Jannik Sinner from a three-month anti-doping suspension.

“I really like Jannik, personally,” she opened on Wednesday after a first-round victory over Camila Osorio. “I think he's a great guy. He's always been very sweet to me. He seems like a pretty humble person. I don't know him too well, but it's hard for me to be too critical in a personal sense.“In terms of professional, I think there are discrepancies, where I don't believe all players are treated the same. It's not only his case. I think there are a lot of different questions in terms of how things were conducted.”A player committee member of the International Tennis Integrity Association (ITIA), Azarenka is up to date on all current anti-doping cases, including the recent decision regarding Australian doubles champion Max Purcell, and feels the current system is too reliant on the structure set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to adapt as she feels is necessary to fit a tennis-specific landscape.

I just want to see our sport grow, honestly...This sport gave me so much in my life, and I want to see it grow, become bigger, keep being a dominant sport for women. There's a lot of sports coming up and giving us competition. We need to keep making those strides forward too. Victoria Azarenka

“We're still under the WADA umbrella, which makes it harder to implement some of the rules,” explained Azarenka. “Otherwise, we'd have to take ourselves out of the Olympic pool, which I don't necessarily think a bad idea.“We're often asked, ‘How do you feel about [the system]?' How I feel about it doesn't really matter. It's more about how the rules applied: Are they applied the same way? Is there a modification that needs to be made? I think that's the conversation that we should be having, more about the things that can be done better.”The two-time Australian Open champion, who has been struggling with injuries since last season, conceded that the legal element of anti-doping cases further complicate—and sometimes obscure—the issue, citing the secrecy surrounding Sinner's positive tests for the banned substance Clostebol.“If you talk about Jannik Sinner's case, people will ask why nobody knew,” said Azarenka. “Well, there's a legal aspect to it; I understand that. But, you know, it's a little bit on the edge.”

Sinner was successfully able to overturn the provisional handed down by the ITIA before they were made public. Though the ITIA initially found Sinner bore No Fault or Negligence for the presence of Clostebol in his sample, WADA appealed the ruling and Sinner served his suspension between the Australian Open and Roland Garros.Though she praised the ITIA's efforts to educate players—the organization offers in-person workshops at tournaments—she argued for transparency over bureaucracy.“I think overall, there has to be better integrity from the organization, personally. It's a big problem is that we're under WADA and WADA only has specific windows when they look to make changes to their rules.“I don't think I have all the answers, but there are valid questions that could be asked and see if it makes sense.”

My concern is less for me and more for younger players because it's going to be a lot harder for them to have a career as long as I've had, to play 20-plus years on tour. Victoria Azarenka

A meditation on anti-doping and corruption gave way to Azarenka's broader wishlist of what she'd change in the sport. A pro for over two decades and a mom to eight-year-old son Leo, she took a blue-sky approach in the mixed zone and outlined everything from prize money to scheduling to marketing the sport and its players.“My concern is less for me and more for younger players because it's going to be a lot harder for them to have a career as long as I've had, to play 20-plus years on tour,” she said, taking a stand against the influx of two-week 1000-level tournaments and best-of-five-set scoring. “From that end, I also think there should also be a conversation about how differently the balls have changed and evolved over the years, surfaces as well.“When it comes to scheduling, we need more predictability to sell product for players to prepare, for fans to watch and business to distribute,” she added.“I just want to see our sport grow, honestly. I really want our sport to do well. This sport gave me so much in my life, and I want to see it grow, become bigger, keep being a dominant sport for women. There's a lot of sports coming up and giving us competition.

The BNP Paribas Open champion talks the mental shift that helped him reach the top of the game.ByDavid KanePublished May 07, 2025 copy_link

ROME, Italy—When Jack Draper opens his phone, the first thing he sees is a daily affirmation.The 23-year-old Brit credits the power of positive thinking with kickstarting his career, one that has already seen him capture a Masters 1000 title at the BNP Paribas Open and reach another final at the Mutua Madrid Open only last week.“I suppose when I was 18 during lockdown, I went through some stuff mentally,” Draper told Tennis Channel, echoing a similar sentiment expressed by Madrid champion Casper Ruud last week. “I came to a conclusion that if I wanted to change my view on life or change my perspective, I was going to have to take responsibility for that.”

I'm a big believer that you can create your own reality...accept the struggle and hard work. It's going to be hard most days. That's the biggest message I send to myself: I have the power to achieve anything I put my mind to. Jack Draper

Though Draper avoids more traditional New Age techniques like meditation, the world No. 5 has gained much from affirmations and self-talk, the latter helping him score a breakthrough win over Carlos Alcaraz two months ago in Indian Wells.“After that set went away, I went to the toilet and just, yeah, kind of looked at myself in the mirror and was like, ‘You need to really, you need to really get my stuff together,'” he said after recovering from a second-set bagel to win, 6-1, 0-6, 6-4.Draper has taken the technique onto clay, where he is in the midst of a career-best run on the surface, beating more established dirtballers like Matteo Arnaldi and Lorenzo Musetti en route to the final in Madrid.

Kvitova scored the first win of her comeback from maternity leave in Rome.ByDavid KanePublished May 07, 2025 copy_link

ROME, Italy—In tennis, everyone loves a comeback story. Few things will bring disparate fan groups together quite like the former star returning to action after time away, and the results are often spectacular.Kim Clijsters won a major title within weeks of her return in 2009. Serena Williams reached four finals in 2018 and 2019. This year alone, Belinda Bencic and Elina Svitolina have been two of the tour's biggest success stories, both coming back from maternity leave in the last 24 months.Petra Kvitova isn't as certain she can achieve those heights.“I've been saying even before, that people shouldn't be expecting any great results or game or whatever,” the two-time Wimbledon winner said after winning her first match of her comeback at the 2025 Internazionali BNL d'Itlia. “Still, they do, right? I was like, ‘Ok, whatever.'”

Kvitova wasn't even sure she'd return to tennis at all, rating the chance at about 5% after playing her last match at the 2023 China Open.“I was like, ‘No, I can't do it anymore,' and we decided to go for the baby,” recalled Kvitova, who had won a WTA 1000 title earlier that year at the Miami Open. “I was like, ‘Ok,' and then it happened straightaway and it was like, ‘Ok! We'll see how everything goes.'”Indeed, the two-time Wimbledon champion announced her pregnancy at the very start of 2024 and appeared ready to settle into family life with coach-turned-husband Jiri Vanek. But a return to the court after the birth of son Petr quickly helped her rediscover her competitive edge.“When I could do some things finally after pregnancy and postpartum, I played some tennis and it felt so good and I really enjoyed it,” said Kvitova. “That was really the thing. I was laughing and every shot I hit smoothly I was like, ‘Wow! It's still there.' It's not in the legs that much, but in the hands sometimes it's very good. That was the key, why I came back.”

My parents are proud that I'm still trying, even though it's not going that well sometimes. Petra Kvitova

She revealed her plans to come back to tennis weeks before her 35th birthday, and played her first match at a WTA 250 in Austin, Texas after a month of intense training.“It was back to normal, unfortunately,” joked Kvitova, who said she prefers tennis to the tournaments. “I was coming back after 6 p.m. every day, not seeing my son for more than an hour before he would go to sleep. It was very sad, and of course practicing, gym, recovery. I thought I was like, ‘Oh my god, really? I want this again?'“I've been doing it my whole life, basically, so it's very natural. Still, it's a lot of work I have to put in because I'm not where I wanted to be. It's taking some time.”Her first four matches ended in defeat, but a return to the Foro Italico came with an ironic change in fortune. Despite only making two quarterfinals in eight previous attempts, she nonetheless earned her first win on Grand Stand Arena, a 7-5, 6-1 win over Irina-Camelia Begu.

“It's kind of weird that my first win came here in Rome because I never played the best here!” Kvitova laughed, flashing her inimitably sleepy smile. “I'm very glad. Even in the practices, I felt like my game was going a little bit up and I was playing a little bit better.“I'm glad to finally have the first win,” she added, making a check mark in the air and clicking her tongue for emphasis.She did look forward to celebrating with her family: father Vanek has been on babysitting duty all week.

Alpine share more information over Oakes' departure as team boss after ‘personal decision'

BEYOND THE GRID: Claire Williams on life at her family's F1 team and what she thinks of their recent charge up the order

Alpine have confirmed that Franco Colapinto will replace Jack Doohan for the next five race weekends, starting from the upcoming Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, with the team deciding to “rotate” the race seat alongside Pierre Gasly.

The news comes following the confirmation on Tuesday evening that Alpine Team Principal Oliver Oakes had resigned with immediate effect. Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore will be covering the duties previously performed by the Briton.

READ MORE: Alpine announce resignation of Team Principal Oliver Oakes

Having previously served as a reserve driver for the Enstone-based team, it was announced last summer that Doohan was set to be promoted to the main race squad for 2025. The 22-year-old was then given an earlier-than-expected debut at the 2024 season finale in Abu Dhabi, following the departure of Haas-bound Esteban Ocon.

After starting his first full-time campaign this year, Doohan has struggled to match team mate Gasly, and his troubles continued last time out in Miami, where he retired from the race following a Lap 1 collision with Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson.

Franco Colapinto will race for Alpine over the next five rounds of the 2025 season, starting at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix

Now Alpine have announced that Doohan's seat will be filled by Colapinto for the next five rounds, with the Argentinian having been signed to the outfit as one of their roster of reserve drivers following his impressive nine-race run as a substitute for Williams in 2024.

“As part of an on-going assessment of its driver line-up, the team has made the decision to rotate one of its race seats for the next five rounds of the 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship,” said an Alpine statement.

“BWT Alpine Formula One Team therefore announces that Franco Colapinto will be paired with Pierre Gasly from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, ahead of a new evaluation before the British Grand Prix in July.

“Jack Doohan remains an integral part of the team and will be the first-choice Reserve Driver for this period of time.”

ANALYSIS: Why Alpine chose to promote Colapinto and bench Doohan – concluding a dramatic 12 hours after Oakes' resignation

Doohan has shown flashes of pace but has also had a series of incidents in his seven-race run with Alpine, including his opening lap collision with Lawson in Miami as well as a heavy practice crash in Suzuka, when he failed to close his Drag Reduction System before turning into Turn 1.

Colapinto, meanwhile, returns to the grid following his eye-catching showing in the second half of 2024, where he bagged points for Williams in Azerbaijan and Austin after replacing Logan Sargeant. However, his Williams stint also included heavy crashes in Sao Paulo and Las Vegas.

Speculation over Doohan's future at the team had been a frequent topic of discussion since Colapinto's signing as a reserve in January, with Oakes having moved to quash those reports as recently as the Miami Grand Prix weekend.

“Firstly, I want to thank the team for giving me the opportunity to drive competitively for the next five races,” said Colapinto. “I will work hard with the team to prepare for the next race in Imola and the upcoming triple-header, which will no doubt be intense and a big challenge for everyone.

“I have stayed sharp, and I am as ready as possible with the team's race support testing programme, as well as on the simulator at Enstone. I will do my best to get up to speed quickly and give it my all to deliver the best possible results alongside Pierre.”

Doohan said: “I am very proud to have achieved my lifelong ambition to be a professional Formula 1 driver and I will forever be grateful to the team for helping me achieve this dream. Obviously, this latest chapter is a tough one for me to take because, as a professional driver, naturally I want to be racing.

“That said, I appreciate the team's trust and commitment. We have long-term goals as a team to achieve and I will continue to give my maximum efforts in any way I can to help achieve those. For now, I will keep my head down, keep working hard, watch with interest the next five races and keep chasing my own personal goals.”

Flavio Briatore has said the team need to 'rotate' their line-up to have a 'complete and fair' assessment of their drivers ahead of 2026

Flavio Briatore, Alpine's Executive Advisor, added: “Having reviewed the opening races of the season, we have come to the decision to put Franco in the car alongside Pierre for the next five races.

“With the field being so closely matched this year, and with a competitive car, which the team has drastically improved in the past 12 months, we are in a position where we see the need to rotate our line-up. We also know the 2026 season will be an important one for the team and having a complete and fair assessment of the drivers this season is the right thing to do in order to maximise our ambitions next year.

“We continue to support Jack at the team, as he has acted in a very professional manner in his role as a race driver so far this season. The next five races will give us an opportunity to try something different and after this time period we will assess our options.”

Despite being prescient, Gough says her character did not forsee the disastrous events of episode eight. 


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


[This story contains spoilers through Andor season two's eighth episode.]


	In Andor's season two premiere, Denise Gough's Dedra Meero is paid a very specific compliment by Orson Krennic. Ben Mendelsohn's Imperial Director recognized that the highly determined ISB Supervisor could foresee the future, particularly the pitfalls of his plan to seize the planet Ghorman through a propaganda campaign. Dedra then raised the added idea of cultivating a local radical insurgency, so that the Empire could ultimately use brute force to eliminate their manufactured “terrorist” threat and strip-mine the planet of its kalkite mineral to help fuel their forthcoming Death Star.

	In the second chapter of creator Tony Gilroy's first three-episode block, Dedra issues a plea to her superior, Major Partagaz (Anton Lesser), to keep her on the trail of Axis (Stellan Skarsgård's Luthen Rael) instead of the secretive Ghorman assignment. But Partagaz quickly shuts her down out of respect for Krennic and the Imperial chain of command. Well, following episode eight's Ghorman massacre and the death of Dedra's beloved Syril Karn (Kyle Soller), the question now becomes whether Dedra anticipated the possibility of such a disastrous outcome when she first implored Partagaz to remove her from the Ghorman project.




			Popular on THR		







	According to Gough, Dedra didn't predict this specific turn of events, and she genuinely just wanted to finish what she started in regard to the Axis network. If anything, she thought she could control the Ghorman scheme so tightly that she could have her cake and eat it too. She knew Syril would be the perfect patsy to embolden the Ghorman Front and unknowingly lead the Ghor to slaughter. But she mistakenly thought she could minimize the consequences of her law-abiding partner's discovery that he's been aiding large-scale grand theft and a planned genocide involving thousands of innocent lives. 


	“Her biggest fear is to lose control. So when Syril finds out what she's done and you see her desperately say, ‘No, we're going to go back [to Coruscant] …' she's losing control of this situation,” Gough tells The Hollywood Reporter. “That is what makes her feel bad about that whole Ghorman situation. It's not really the massacre, unfortunately. It's not that she sees that she's wiped out all these people; it's that she's lost Syril.”

	











	Below, during a spoiler conversation with THR, Gough also looks back on Dedra's earlier showdown with Syril's mother, Eedy (Kathryn Hunter).


***


As of the first block of episodes, Dedra and Syril are playing house together, and they're finding unique ways to save money on their electric bill. 


	(Laughs.)


Did she quickly talk herself into the idea of him after he saved her life on Ferrix a year earlier? 


	It's really interesting because I was thinking about that today: “How long have they lived together?” She strikes me as being very clinical about it all, and it makes sense that he would now be in her house. So I don't know how long it's been going on, but it's definitely been going on for a while. It's still interesting to wonder, “What was their first date? Where did they go? Did they date? What [else] happened in that [season one finale] cupboard?” Yeah, there's a lot of “what happened?” in that [unseen] year, but when we meet them again, they're established.


	The thing about Dedra that I've really learned now is that she needs to feel safe all the time, and the way that she feels safe is by being in control of everything. So Syril comes under that umbrella, and the closer he is, the more she has to control the outcomes. He's the only person who's ever seen her vulnerable, so she needs to keep that close. 


There have been many epic showdowns in the Star Wars galaxy: Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi/Anakin Skywalker and Rey/Kylo Ren. And now they have company in the form of Dedra Meero versus Eedy Karn. How excited were you to lay down the law with Kathryn Hunter's Eedy?












	(Laughs.) As a theater actress, Kathryn Hunter is one of our legends. I've known about her and her work forever, for as long as I've been acting. And so the thought that I was going to get to work with her was such a gift, first of all. But what's so fantastic about that scene is, on paper, it can look like an intimidation. Dedra does her Dedra-ing and intimidates Eedy, and then Eedy does what she's told. But when you work with a legend like Kathryn, they make much more complex choices within the scene. So, instead of being intimidated, she was impressed, and as soon as I saw that, I thought, “Oh my God, this isn't as simple as Dedra laying down the law.” Dedra does her Dedra thing, but she's matched with Eedy who finds it quite tasty. So, at the end, there's a respect there. 


	Kyle [Soller] said that he thinks it's like a bully being called out. If you stand up to a bully, the bully suddenly goes, “Oh, I like you, actually.” So I felt that from Eedy during what I called “the negotiation.” And Kyle's choice to lie on the bed like a broken bird was so inspired while these two women got to it. So that scene is one of the highlights of my career in all seriousness. Working with her was really something else.


It's truly one of the best scenes in the entire series.


	God, that means a lot. Thank you.


In 201, Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) compliments Dedra for being able to see many moves ahead, and then there's a key scene in 202 where she asks Anton Lesser's character, Partagaz, to let her out of Krennic's secret Ghorman assignment. Did she foresee who and what she'd have to risk by staying on the project? 












	That's a really good question. I think it's more because she's still obsessed with Axis [Stellan Skarsgård]. She knows that the chain of command means she has to do as she's told, and she knows that it will be all-consuming. I don't think she knows necessarily that she would use Syril the way that she does, but she's quite calculated about it. I don't think she would be fearful of taking on the [Ghorman] assignment because she's indoctrinated into the Empire. She'll go to any lengths for the Empire, but it's the fact that [Ghorman] gets in the way of Axis, and that's her downfall. She can't let go of Axis. If there was no Axis. I think she'd be thrilled to take Ghorman on and make it her mission. 


	Dedra grew up in an Imperial kinder-block, which means she had no example of love, of affection, of joy, of affirmation, of boundaries or of any parenting. So when Syril comes into her life and she has all these feelings that a normal person would be able to put in a place of safety within them, Dedra is undone by it. If she didn't have these weird things with Syril, she'd have sacrificed him. If she had assigned somebody else to the Ghorman project, she'd be like, “Okay, I need this person to go in there and do this, this, and this. It'll be all very calculated.” The problem is that she is undone by her feelings for Syril, but she doesn't know what those feelings are. 


	If you look at Cassian and Maarva [Fiona Shaw] in the first season, she teaches Cassian about love. When he says, “I'll be worried about you all the time,” she says, “That's just love.” But nobody has ever told Dedra what love is, or what it means when you look at a person and you're happy for them. In 205, when she says, “It's good to see you happy,” she doesn't say it in a way that's like, “Oh, it's so good to see you happy!” She [coolly] says, “It's good to see you happy,” and she doesn't know what that is doing. So Syril being the person that she sends into Ghorman and uses like that is what makes her feel bad about that whole Ghorman situation. It's not really the massacre, unfortunately. It's not that she sees that she's wiped out all these people; it's that she's lost Syril.

	











To me, Axis just felt like a convenient excuse because she couldn't tell Partagaz that she knew she'd have to use her boyfriend as the perfect patsy and, in turn, risk her relationship to fulfill this Ghorman objective.


	That's fantastic. I love that you got that reading from it. I always just felt it was, “Oh God, now I have to go and work under [Krennic]. Partagaz lets me be in control of everything, and I won't have control if I'm working under Krennic. I don't like Krennic. I don't know how to work Krennic in the same way.” So it's maybe both of those things. She knows that if she works for Krennic, she's not in control. She's safe if she works with Partagaz and is chasing Axis, because she knows that she's in control of that. 


	Her biggest fear is to lose control. So when Syril finds out what she's done and you see her desperately say, “No, we're going to go back [to Coruscant] and we're going to be this … ” she's losing control of this situation. But if Syril wasn't involved, I don't know if she'd feel so out of control. I think she'd be quite mechanical about it. He's the thorn; he's the thing that undoes it. 


	So I think that's brilliant, and I wish I had thought that. I wish I had thought that Dedra is seeing all of this ahead of her, but I don't think she is. She's genuinely obsessed with Axis and obsessed with being in control of Axis, and if she catches him, she redeems herself for Ferrix and everything. If she goes to Ghorman, then this Krennic guy gets all the glory of all her work.

Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson also star in director Francis Lawrence's dystopian feature that hits theaters later this year from Lionsgate.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Mark Hamill oversees a deadly journey in the trailer for the film adaptation of Stephen King‘s The Long Walk.


	Director Francis Lawrence‘s dystopian thriller movie hits theaters Sept. 12 from Lionsgate. Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Charlie Plummer, Ben Wang, Roman Griffin Davis and Judy Greer round out the cast. 




The Long Walk focuses on an annual contest in which 100 teen boys set out on the titular journey that requires them to maintain a quick pace. The walk ends with just a single survivor.

	In the trailer, the teens are directed to keep moving along “until there's only one of you left.”

	











	Lawrence helmed the feature from a script by JT Mollner (Strange Darling). The film adapts King's 1979 novel of the same name that was originally published under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman. Serving as producers are Lawrence, Roy Lee, Steven Schneider and Cameron MacConomy. 


	Hamill, Jonsson and Lawrence debuted the movie's first footage during Lionsgate's CinemaCon presentation last month. “The premise alone is nightmare-inducing, but it's good to get out of your comfort zone,” Hamill told the crowd about working on the project. The actor also reflected on playing the project's villain: “If you can't be the hero, there's nothing better than being the villain. If you get booed and people hate your guts, then you've done your job.”


	Additionally, Lawrence explained that he had been a longtime fan of the source material and was drawn to the memorable premise. “You can imagine yourself in the shoes of one of the boys,” the director noted.

The ‘Parks and Recreation' star and co-creator will both be writers and EPs on the series along with J.J. Philbin.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Peacock is staging a Parks and Recreation reunion of sorts — though it will be set far from Pawnee.


Parks and Rec star Amy Poehler and co-creator Mike Schur are reteaming for the first time since their NBC show ended in 2015 on a comedy called Dig, which Peacock has ordered to series. Poehler is set to star and executive produce alongside Schur and J.J. Philbin (Only Murders in the Building, Single Parents); all three will serve as writers on the show.




Dig, from Universal Television (where both Schur and Poehler have overall deals), is based on the novel Excavations by Kate Myers. The logline reads, “Four women working at an archeological dig in Greece are at wildly different crossroads in their lives. When the team uncovers a long-buried secret with the potential to rewrite history, they find themselves at the center of a high-stakes international conspiracy.”

	The show will also mark Poehler's first ongoing role in a live-action series since Parks and Rec. The Emmy winner voiced Joy in last year's Inside Out 2 from Pixar; her other recent credits include Fox's animated series Duncanville (which she also co-created), Chelsea Peretti's First Time Female Director and Netflix's movie Wine Country. She also hosts the podcast Good Hang from The Ringer.


	The show also marks the first time married couple Schur and Philbin have teamed on a half-hour series. They previously worked together at Saturday Night Live in the late 1990s. 


	Schur (via his Fremulon banner), Poehler (via Paper Kite Productions) and Philbin executive produce Dig with Morgan Sackett, Dave Becky and David Miner of 3 Arts, Sharon Jackson of Ocean Avenue, and Paper Kite's Kate Arend and Jordan Grief. Excavations author Myers is a co-EP.


	Poehler is repped by WME, 3 Arts, Ocean Avenue and Sloane Offer. Schur is with UTA, 3 Arts and Hansen Jacobson. Philbin is repped by UTA and Rise Management. Myers is repped by CAA and Claire Friedman at Inkwell Management.

The company also grew Disney+ subscribers to 126 million in its fiscal second quarter, after losing subs in the previous quarter.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The Walt Disney Co. blew past Wall Street earnings expectations in its latest quarter, the company's fiscal Q2.


	The company delivered revenue of $23.6 billion, up 7 percent from a year prior, and operating income of $4.4 billion, an improvement of 15 percent from a year earlier.




	The company also announced a major new project: Its seventh theme park and resort, to be located in Abu Dhabi.


	Every division — Entertainment, sports and experiences — beat expectations, with streaming driving particular growth in the entertainment division.

	Disney's entertainment division had revenue of $10.7 billion, up 9 percent vs the prior year, with operating income of $1.3 billion, up 61 percent from last year. Direct-to-consumer operating revenue soared to $336 million, compared to $47 million in the same quarter a year ago.


	In fact, after losing 700,000 Disney+ subscribers in the prior quarter, the company added 1.4 million subscribers in its latest quarter, bringing its Disney+ subscriber total to 126 million. ARPU also improved to $7.77. Hulu's SVOD offering added 1.3 million subscribers, likely helped by the integration into Disney+.


	In the experiences division, revenues rose by 6 percent to $8.9 billion, while operating income rose by 9 percent to $2.5 billion. The growth was attributable to the U.S. parks, as well as Disney Vacation Club and Disney Cruise Line, with the international parks down slightly year over year.


	At sports, revenue rose by 5 percent to $4.5 billion, with operating income falling 12 percent to $687 million. The decrease was due to the presence of three extra college football playoff games and one extra NFL game in the quarter, which increased costs, offset by a boost in advertising.


	And while some other companies are pulling guidance, Disney continues to give investors a window into its expectations, forecasting modest growth in Disney+ subscribers in Q3, and double digit growth in entertainment and sports this year, though it acknowledged the macroeconomy and uncertainty of the current moment.


	Disney's most ambitious and important theatrical films are also set to release in the second half of the year, including Marvel's The Fantastic Four, and the next Avatar film.


	“Our outstanding performance this quarter — with adjusted EPS up 20% from the prior year driven by our Entertainment and Experiences businesses — underscores our continued success building for growth and executing across our strategic priorities,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. “Following an excellent first half of the fiscal year, we have a lot more to look forward to, including our upcoming theatrical slate, the launch of ESPN's new DTC offering, and an unprecedented number of expansion projects underway in our Experiences segment. Overall, we remain optimistic about the direction of the company and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.”

""The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil."" Tony Gilroy breaks down Mon Mothma's searing anti-authoritarian warning from the third block of episodes in 'Andor' season two.


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Great sci-fi often serves as an allegory for current social and political issues. 


	But never before has Star Wars hit such a topical bullseye — intentional or not — as Tuesday's episodes of Andor season two when a character delivered a stunner speech that warned of rising government authoritarianism, the dilution of fact-based reality, and the reluctance to use the word “genocide.”  




	Airing on Disney+ the same day a Drudge Report headline became the latest to warn of “America's Slide Into Authoritarianism,” the acclaimed drama series featured a sequence where the courageous politician Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) risks her life to deliver a speech before the Galactic Senate where she furiously attacked Emperor Palpatine and his Imperial forces. But one can also easily imagine her words being said by a politician on C-SPAN right now.

	“I believe we are in crisis,” Mothma says. “The distance between what is said today and what is known to be true has become an abyss. Of all the things at risk, the loss of an objective reality is perhaps the most dangerous. The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil. When truth leaves us, when we let it slip away, when it is ripped from our hands, we become vulnerable to the appetite of whatever monster screams the loudest.”




			Popular on THR		







	And then, referring to a prior sequence where Imperial forces massacred peaceful protesters on the planet Ghorman — a world the Imperials invaded to exploit a precious mineral — Mothma says, “What took place yesterday… was unprovoked genocide.”


	At this, the other senators cry out in protest at Mothma's use of the word. “Yes, genocide!” she repeated. “And the monster screaming the loudest, that we helped create, the monster who will come for us all, soon enough, is Emperor Palpatine.”


	It's worth noting that Andor season two began production in November 2022 and wrapped around February 2024. So filming was completed long before the reelection of Donald Trump and just a few months after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 (the latter having sparked much debate among experts over the last two years — such as here and here — over the right or wrongness of using the word “genocide” when describing Israel's military response in Gaza). Nonetheless, the scene has some viewers on social media interpreting the moment as pro-Palestinian. 

	











	Asked about the sequence and its real-life inspirations, Andor creator Tony Gilroy told The Hollywood Reporter, “The really sorry truth about the about this question — and we get it a lot — is that peace and prosperity and calm are the rarities. Those are rarities throughout the last 6,000 years of recorded history. You could drop this show at any point in the last 6,000 years, and it would make sense to some people about what's happening to them.”


	Continued Gilroy: “I mean, the control of truth has always been a scabbard of power. Power dictates the narrative, and always has tried to always do that. Look at what the Empire does to Ghorman with their propaganda campaign. The very first scene [in the season] that Krennic has where he talks about Ghorman, that's based on the Wannsee convention — the convention where the Nazis got together and planned the final solution over a business lunch. You could say all this about the Gulf of Tonkin — which got America into Vietnam — or you could say the burning of the Reichstag [which paved the way to the Nazi's rise to power], or you could say the sinking of the Lusitania [which pushed America into World War I]. You go all the way through history, and power is the control of truth. So I think with that speech, we were looking to be timeless and classic.”


	Added the creator, a bit wearily, “And I'm not psychic.” 


	The second and final season of the Star Wars drama has been not pulling punches when it comes to depicting a wartime drama. In addition to that Wannsee convention scene (see the real-life photos and how closely the Andor setting matched up), the show made headlines during its premiere episodes by staging the first rape attempt in Star Wars content in a scene involving Bix (Adria Arjona).












	“I get one shot to tell everything I know — or can discover, or that I've learned — about revolution, about battles, with as many incidents and as many colors as I can get in there, without having [the story] tip over,” Gilroy said about the latter sequence. “I mean, let's be honest, man: The history of civilization, there's a huge arterial component of it that's rape. All of us who are here — we are all the product of rape. I mean armies and power throughout history [have committed rape]. So to not touch on it, in some way… It just was organic and it felt right, coming about as a power trip for this guy. I was really trying to make a path for Bix that would ultimately lead to clarity — but a difficult path to get back to clarity.”


Andor Disney+'s acclaimed Star Wars drama series which currently has the highest rating of any Star Wars TV show or movie on Rotten Tomatoes. The show follows the adventures of Rebel Alliance leader Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and leads up to the events in the film Rogue One. The final three episodes air next week.

On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are chatting about Gaga's positively massive show in Brazil.


Lady Gaga reportedly played to 2.5 million fans during her concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Saturday night. It's a hard-to-fathom crowd size, considering we've never seen anything like it for a concert in the United States.


	When it comes to free U.S. shows, some estimates put Garth Brooks' 1997 concert in New York's Central Park — nicknamed “Garthstock” — around 900,000 or even 1 million fans. (For non-concert crowds, the Chicago Cubs' 2016 World Series celebration reportedly drew 5 million fans for a parade and rally — but that's not a single-stage event.)

	











	On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are talking about the positively massive show and whether it could ever be replicated here in the U.S. — like, are Los Angeles beaches even big enough for such a thing? And where would people park?!?

	Mike Shinoda:She used to be–


	Emily Armstrong:Feels like years. 


	Mike Shinoda:She was so down to earth in the beginning.


	Dave Farrell:You poisoned her. I blame me and Mike, I think for us, like in this whole process, even going back to the record coming out, like, I don't ever want to take it for granted that people are going to be interested in what we're doing or or automatically on board. “Up From the Bottom” coming out, and people being interested and excited about it. I think it's like, it's exciting, it's special, it's new, and to be releasing new music at this stage of our career is something I didn't know 100% for sure that we able to do. So feels great. 


How did this one come together? 


	Mike Shinoda:It's unusual for us to be like writing and putting out new songs while we're touring. Yeah, we usually don't do that.  Did you guys never do that in Dead Sara?

	Host Drew Afualo gives Becky G flowers, and she shares how Selena Quintanilla has helped inspire her music, her love for her fans and more at Billboard Women in Music 2025.


Drew Afualo:


Y'all, we're here with the talented, iconic, hilarious and stunningly gorgeous Becky G, period. How are you feeling being here at Billboard Women in Music?


	Becky G:


	We're not just at Billboard Women in Music. We're in Inglewood, my hometown, so I'm very happy to be home. It's very nice. And also, we're celebrating so many bada– women.


So I love that, and I do want to start off by giving you your flowers. First, hold on. Here you go. That's for you. So I'd like to ask you: Who do you give flowers to for getting you where you are now? 


	Ooh, um, my mom. I quite literally would not be here without her.


I love that, that's beautiful. And who do you give flowers to for inspiring your music? 


	Selena Quintanilla, easy answer.


What a grand answer. “Si Una Vez” is my favorite song of hers. Yours?

We love that.

OK? And last, kind of serious one, what do you give flowers to your fans for?

We have fashion designer Stella McCartney to thank for the group pic.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	There's always one epic selfie that comes out of Met Gala, and we have a contender for the 2025 celebrity group pic of the year — and this time, it wasn't taken in the bathroom.


Fashion designer Stella McCartney managed to get the Queen of Pop and three of pop's brightest stars in one pic, posting a photo from inside the Met Gala with Madonna, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Lorde. McCartney posted the photo on her Instagram Story on Tuesday (May 6) with the caption: “This year's Met Gala Stelfie… x”

	











	While we've seen individual photos of all four of the musicians on the Met red carpet from Monday night, this is the only evidence we've seen of their interaction inside the ultra-exclusive gala, where cell phones are discouraged and only Vogue cameras are allowed.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Over the years, guests have been known to sneak celebrity selfies in the Met bathroom, with Kylie Jenner posting a famous pic with sisters Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian in 2017 alongside A$AP Rocky, Frank Ocean, Diddy and Brie Larson in 2017, while Billie Eilish posed with Halle Bailey, Elle Fanning and Maya Hawke for a 2023 mirror selfie.


	Before her pop-powered 2025 selfie, McCartney arrived at the Met Gala with a different music legend, walking the red carpet with Mary J. Blige, whom she dressed for the occasion in an off-white suit, matching floor-length jacket and a conversation-starting metal wide-brimmed hat.


	“When I tried the cream with the pinstripes and the big shoulders, I was like, ‘Oh, this is Mary J. Blige to the 10th power,'” Blige told Vogue of choosing the menswear-inspired McCartney look.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	It's low tide for Rescue HI-Surf as Fox has opted not to renew the freshman drama from producer John Wells for a second season. The news will come as a blow to diehard fans of the Hawaiian lifeguard series who have been showing their support by voting en masse in various Save the Show polls where Rescue HI-Surf has been ranking high. There are no plans for the show to be shopped by producing studio Warner Bros. Television, sources said.


	The cancellation comes more than a month after Rescue HI-Surf‘s Season 1 finale, which aired March 31, and a year after Fox revealed its big expectations for the series last spring — giving it a very early seven-episode back order and assigning it the post-Super Bowl slot. That was soon followed by a special Sunday series premiere date behind an NFL double-header.

	











Rescue HI-Surf developed a loyal following but, possibly hurt by the fact that there is no well known, promotable star in the cast, it was not a breakout the way fellow freshman Fox drama Doc was, earning an early 22-episode renewal. That is despite the strong sampling for the Rescue HI-Surf premiere, which, boosted by the football lead-in, drew 4.7 million Live+Same Day viewers.




			Watch on Deadline		







RELATED: 2025 TV Series Renewals: Photo Gallery


	The first red flag came in November, two months into Rescue HI-Surf‘s run, when Fox did a very rare last-minute switch of its Super Bowl lead-out program, replacing the freshman drama with the Season 3 premiere of game show The Floor.


	Because the decision came so late, the special Super Bowl episode of Rescue HI-Surf had already been filmed; it aired as a regular episode the following Monday after promotion during the big game. There was no post-Super Bowl bump, and the first responders drama wrapped its freshman season with steady but modest ratings, drawing 1.4 million L+SD viewers for the finale. The linear delivery was somewhat offset by Rescue HI-Surf's streaming performance on Hulu but it ultimately wasn't strong enough to secure a pickup.


	Even with the modest ratings, Rescue HI-Surf was seriously considered for a renewal, in large part because of Wells' involvement in the show, co-produced by Warner Bros. TV, where his John Wells Production is based, and Fox Entertainment Studios. The prolific producer is behind such popular series as ER, The West Wing, Maid and The Pitt.

	











	While it fits in Fox's $3M-$4M-an-episode model, Rescue HI-Surf is believed to be at the high end of the range and among the network's more expensive drama series — despite no big stars in the cast — because it films in Hawaii. The pricey location gives the series its lush look and feel which, along with the characters, has been a main draw for its devoted fans.


	Fox's planned Baywatch reboot is not believed to have played a significant part in deciding Rescue HI-Surf‘s fate as Fox had been considering running both series simultaneously, one in-season, one during the summer. (Baywatch has not been greenlighted yet but has been looking good.) 


	Fortunately for fans, Rescue HI-Surf did not end its first season on a massive cliffhanger. The finale saw Will (Adam Demos) heading back to Australia, though he did tell Em (Arielle Kebbel) he would be back, and the series' creator Matt Kester confirmed to TV Insider at the time that Will was expected to return should the show get renewed.


Rescue HI-Surf follows the personal and professional lives of the heavy-water lifeguards who patrol and protect the North Shore of O'ahu — the most famous and dangerous stretch of coastline in the world.


	In addition to Demos and Kebbel, the series starred Robbie Magasiva, Kekoa Kekumano, Alex Aiono and Zoe Cipres. 


	Kester created the series and served as executive producer and showrunner. Wells, who directed the first two episodes, executive produced through John Wells Productions along with JWP's Erin Jontow. Daniele Nathanson also served as an executive producer..

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Culpa Nuestra launches in October and it's safe to say the final instalment of the Prime Video trilogy is much anticipated – the trailer for the closing chapter has ranked the most-watched ever for an original streaming movie.


	The trailer for the Spanish-language film notched 163M views across all platforms in the week after it dropped in April, according to data from WaveMetrix shared with Deadline. That is more than for any other original movie for a streamer across the same seven-day timeframe.


Culpa Nuestra (Our Fault) follows Culpa Mía (My Fault) and Culpa Tuya (Your Fault) and will be the final of the three adaptations of Mercedes Ron's Wattpad book series. Banijay Iberia prodco Pokeepsie Films makes the movies, which have spawned an English-language remake, My Fault: London.

	The fact that expectation levels are high for Culpa Nuestra is no surprise given the success of the previous films, which are short on critical acclaim but are beloved by fans around the world. Culpa Tuya took the number one spot for Amazon Prime Video in over 170 countries. We revealed in January that it was the biggest ever international original launch for the streamer.


	The Culpa Nuestra trailer shows Nicole Wallace and Gabriel Guevara as they reprise their roles as Noah and Nick and the story of their relationship further unfolds.


WaveMetrix data is an industry standard for reporting trailer views. It captures engagement for every iteration of a trailer across social platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X. Official, talent and third-party posts count, and original projects from streaming services including Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, Hulu, Apple TV+ and Peacock are tracked.


Culpa Nuestra topped the overall rankings ahead of Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine rom-com The Idea Of You, also for Prime Video. Netflix also featured in the podium positions as Gal Gadot spy thriller Heart of Stone rounded out the top three.


	In case you missed it, here's the Culpa Nuestra trailer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Carol Burnett Recalls Her Special Relationship With ‘I Love Lucy' Star","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/carole-burnett-relationship-i-love-lucy/","Wed, 07 May 2025 00:08:48 GMT","

Carol Burnett opened up about her close friendship with the late Lucille Ball during her upcoming Mother's Day special, “The Carol Burnett Show: Mother of All Marathons.”

As shared by People on May 6, Burnett said, “The woman who influenced me probably the most was Lucille Ball.”

The actress shared, “She came to see me in ‘Once Upon a Mattress,' which was my first Broadway break, and she was there the second night, and I was more nervous that she was in the audience than I was the night before, when all the critics were.”

“We sat and we talked for about a half-hour and she was so supportive and she said, ‘Kid…' — she called me kid, she was 22 years older than I was — and she said, ‘Kid, whenever you need me, give me a call,” Burnett recalled.

The “Annie” star then revealed that a few years later, she was given a big break but was asked to bring in a well-known celebrity. She said that's when she called Ball and nervously asked her to help her.

Burnett and Ball made appearances on each other's shows after that and became good friends. “We were very close, and she always sent me flowers on my birthday,” Burnett said. 

She continued, “So this one morning I got up, turned on the television set — it was my birthday — and she had died that morning, on my birthday. And that afternoon, I got the flowers that said, ‘Happy birthday, kid.”

On April 30, “The Carol Burnett Show” announced on Facebook, “Shout! TV presents ‘The Carol Burnett Show Mother of All Marathons,' streaming exclusively on Shout! TV and The Carol Burnett Show Channel on May 10th and 11th in celebration of Mother's Day!”

The post continued, “Carol will host the marathon through brand-new introductions as she reflects on memorable moments from the show and why it remains a cherished favorite for families along with answering fan-submitted questions in the spirit of the show's original audience Q&As.”

Those with the following apps Roku, Android, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV can watch the special on Shout! TV.

Viewers can also stream the show through Samsung TV Plus, Prime Video FAST, Local Now, Plex, Sling Freestream, The CW, Fubo, Xumo Play, Vizio, and LiveTVx.

“However you're spending this weekend, I hope you're ready to spend it laughing together,” Burnett said in the teaser.

Former Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson was rocking two eye-catching accessories at the May 5 Met Gala.

One was a new short hairdo- a cropped bob with baby bangs.

The other- her oldest son with rocker Tommy Lee- 28-year-old Brandon Thomas Lee.

The 57-year-old actress wore a sparkly, bejewelled long-sleeve Tory Burch gown encrusted with layers of intricate beading, jewels and sequins. And while she kept true to her new look of minimal makeup, she did add a diamond Pandora ear cuff to complete the fit.

A post shared by Good Morning America (@goodmorningamerica)

A post shared by Pamela Anderson (@pamelaanderson)

Pamela Anderson summed up how she felt about her look for the Met Gala in three words.

In an Instagram post showing her from every angle, she wrote: ‘Bold… Brave… Precise. A celebration of courage and craftsmanship. Thank you for the invitation—an honor. Love, P'.

And her fans were quick to agree, including singer Katy Perry.

The pop star commented: ‘One of my favorite looks! And the hair was the cherry ❤️'.

Perry has sported some of the most iconic looks of the Met Gala in years past, but was not at this year's event.

Fans and followers on Instagram gushed: ‘WOW this hair and this look are perfection love the hair!!!!”; ‘Absolutely sublime! You look ethereal!' ‘THE MOST GORGEOUS GIRL IN THE WORLD'.

‘You look fabulous! Love this new hair on you!'; ‘Bold, brave, and BOB!! ‘Pamela Anderson is a goddess!'; 

“Love the bob, fringe & bold lippy! The dress is stunning too. Gorgeous.”

“THE MOST GORGEOUS GIRL IN THE WORLD”

Others commented on her timeless, old Hollywood look, writing, “Pam is so naturally beautiful, her profile is amazing. She reminds me of Mia Farrow with her hair like this 😍”

‘Stunning as always! Pamela brings timeless glam to the Met. ✨'; ‘beauty. Old hollywood glam vibes.'

“channeling Mia Farrow 🤍”

Pandora, who Anderson is a spokesperson for, also chimed in with “An absolutely incredible look! It is an honor to have our jewelry worn by you at the Met Gala again. 💕”

Anderson's oldest son, Brandon Thomas Lee, kept his look simple with a classic black tuxedo by Genuardi. 

Pam shares sons Brandon, 28, and Dylan Lee, 26, with her ex-husband, musician Tommy Lee.

And this isn't the first time Brandon has been Pam's plus one. 

A post shared by Brandon Thomas Lee (@brandonthomaslee)

He was her date to this year's Golden Globes, when Anderson was nominated for her performance in “The Last Showgirl.”

In an Instagram post about the night, Lee wrote, “Such a wonderful evening and so incredibly proud of @pamelaanderson for all she has accomplished with her film The @lastshowgirl .

Two days after Kolbi Jordan was eliminated from season 23 of “American Idol,” the 26-year-old powerhouse singer broke her silence with a touching Instagram post on May 6, 2025. Jordan, who made it to the top 10 before being cut, was showered with love by her fellow contestants and fans she's made along the way. 

“After an unforgettable journey on American Idol, I'm bidding farewell to the show that helped launch a transformative chapter in my artistic journey is nothing but God's timing,” Jordan wrote. “From the first audition to the final performance, the experience has left a lasting mark—both professionally and personally.” 

A post shared by Kolbi Jordan (@kolbijordan)

When Jordan, who hails from Atlanta, auditioned for “American Idol,” she blew away judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie with her vocals and spunky personality as she performed “Epiphany (I'm Leaving),” a 2009 Gospel song by Chrisette Michele. 

Toward the end of the season premiere on March 9, viewers saw the judges surprise Jordan with the first season 23 platinum ticket — establishing her as one of their favorite contestants and allowing her to skip the first round of competition in Hollywood. 

“Auditioning for American Idol changed my life,” Jordan wrote in her May 6 post. “I'm so grateful for the chance to share my God-given gift, connect with some of the most talented musicians, stylist, vocalists, beauticians in the world, and showcase my artistry on one of the biggest stages out there.” 

Jordan continued, “This journey came with its challenges—some I'm still working through—but I know God didn't bless me with this voice for no reason. I'm excited for what's next… to keep growing, creating, and stepping into everything that's ahead.” 

Expressing gratitude for all who supported her journey on the show, Jordan concluded, “Thank you from the bottom of my heart for every comment, vote, and word of support. This isn't goodbye—it's just the beginning. IF YOU GOT THIS FAR! Keep watching American Idol— That's all I'll say.” 

Many of Jordan's new friends from the show flooded her post with love, including top 7 contestant Gabby Samone, who wrote, “My babyyy!!! I love you!!! This experience would not have been the same without you!”

Another top 7 finalist, 17-year-old Slater Nalley, simply wrote to Jordan, “I love you”

Fellow platinum ticket winner Filo, who was cut after making the top 12, wrote, “Love you Kolbi!!! Just wait and see what God has in store for you. You deserve all the glory that's coming your way❤️”

It's likely Jordan will be back for the May 19 season finale, given that the top 10 typically returns for group performances and, potentially, collaborations with celebrity guests. A perfect pairing for Jordan would be R&B icon Patti LaBelle, whom Richie called during Jordan's audition, announcing that he'd love to see them perform together. 

When Jordan walked into the audition room, she was so star struck by the judges that she launched into a story about how she once briefly met LaBelle, another one of her idols. After Jordan sang, Richie called LaBelle to have her say hello to their newest contestant, who was shaking and squealing as she spoke to the star.

“I hear you're a ‘sanger,' not a singer,” LaBelle told Jordan. 

“My dream is to have the two of you singing side by side,” Richie said. “I can't even imagine what that's gonna be.”

With seconds left before the end of the live “American Idol” episode on May 5, 2025, the judges feverishly debated which of the bottom two contestants to save in order to complete the top seven of season 23.

Host Ryan Seacrest stalled for time as 16-year-old Mattie Pruitt and 23-year-old Josh King awaited the decision. But then King did something no one expected: he forcefully nodded his head toward Pruitt, silently encouraging the judges to pick her — which, in the end, they did. 

Whether King's kind gesture impacted the judges' decision isn't known, but his willingness to sacrifice his spot for Pruitt touched many fans, especially since he explicitly said earlier in the show he wanted very much to stay after performing Michael Bublé's song “Home.”

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Once the episode ended and King was sent home — to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he's an airport pianist — fans commented across social media about his last moments on the show. 

“Josh rooting on Mattie and pulling for her was everything you need to know about his character and how good of a person he is,” one person wrote on Instagram. 

Another person commented, “Watching @officialjoshking gesturing to the judges to save Mattie was one of the most wholesome moments I've seen in a long while. Friendship at its finest” 

On a photo of King posted by the “Idol” account, over 100 people liked a comment that said, “Him leaning at Maddie was so precious!! You're a good one Josh!! ❤️”

“You had a great performance,” another fan wrote to King, “but my heart exploded when you kept motioning for the judges to pick Maddy! That was so selfless! You have a bright future ahead of you Josh!”

“Josh King is nothing but class,” someone else tweeted. “In his singing and his heart.”

Leaving his “Idol” family can't be easy for King. A week prior to being sent home, he got choked up on the April 28 episode as he explained his decision to sing Celine Dion's “All By Myself,” which helped him land in the top 10. He vulnerably shared that he was lonely growing up, and that he worried the friendships he made at “American Idol” would fade post-show.

“Growing up, I was not a loner by choice, but not that many friends,” he admitted to producers. “I never had a place for me. Coming to ‘Idol' changed all that.”

“They're some of the greatest friends I've ever had, and I love them for that,” he said of his fellow contestants, getting choked up. “But it's that fear in the back of mind that once this ends and this journey ends with ‘American Idol,' that things will go to the way they used to be.”

“I want to have as many good memories with everyone for as long as possible,” he added.

During the judges' feedback, Lionel Richie told King, “I want you to believe this. Since Luke and I have been here, there has never been a class this talented, ever, for us. You will never, ever be alone again in your life. Never.”

Could Sydney Sweeney be a murderer, and if so, would her mother Julianne Moore even care? 

Such are the questions at the center of the highly-anticipated Apple Original Film “Echo Valley,” directed by “Beast” and “Encounter” filmmaker Michael Pearce and written by “Mare of Easttown” scribe Brad Inglesby. Sweeney stars as Claire, the troubled daughter of Kate (Moore), who shows up on her doorstep covered in someone else's blood. “As Kate pieces together the shocking truth of what happened, she learns just how far a mother will go to try to save her child in this gripping tale of love, sacrifice and survival,” the logline reads. The film is set on the secluded Echo Valley Farm in Pennsylvania, with the tagline teasing that the feature is a “heart-pounding thriller about just how far a mother will go to save her child.”

Kyle MacLachlan, Edmund Donovan, Domnhall Gleeson, and Fiona Shaw co-star. “Echo Valley” is produced by Ridley Scott's Scott Free Films and The Walsh Company, with Michael Pruss, Ingelsby, and Kevin Walsh for The Walsh Company under his multi-year Apple TV+ producing deal. Pruss and Ingelsby developed the script together. The film will be executive produced by Scott Greenberg, Scott Free's Rebecca Feuer, and Nicole Jordan-Webber. Erika Olde and Sam Roseme will also executive produce through Black Bicycle Entertainment. Tanja Tawadjoh will co-produce.

Sweeney told Vanity Fair that she watched hundreds of YouTube videos of addicts interviewed on Los Angeles' Skid Row to prepare to play Claire. She also drew from personal encounters with addicts as well. “I've had a lot of family members deal with addiction and then struggle with similar issues as Claire and her friends, and her group that she hangs out with,” Sweeney said. “I've kind of had firsthand experience with it. I mean, there's a manipulation underneath a lot of it. But when there was love in the air in the room, you truly still felt it. The person that they are at the core, as buried as they might be, is still there.” 

Director Pearce credited Sweeney for going all out for the role, saying, “It's kind of spooky how quickly she can get to a very raw emotional place when you call ‘action,' and she's just straight away exactly where the character needs to be. Which is often a very place of extreme emotional duress. Then you'd call cut and maybe change your lens, and she's very light. You'd call ‘action' again, and she's straight there in a matter of seconds.”

 










Pearce continued, “The way that she was screaming at Julianne, I thought she was going to burst her eardrum. It was so intense. But as soon as we called ‘cut,' they were just laughing. They were just so happy to get their teeth stuck into such a meaty scene.”

And co-lead Moore hinted at just how twisted the film is: “These are my favorite kinds of movies: movies about relationships,” Moore said. “What will people do for one another? What kind of decisions do you make? How far will you go? I'm kind of curious what the reaction will be,” she says. “There will be a sense, certainly, among parents going, like, ‘well, would I do that? How far would I go?' You're left with those questions.”

“Echo Valley” premieres June 13 on Apple TV+. Check out the trailer below.

Margaret Qualley is back on the road with Ethan Coen after “Drive–Away Dolls.” The actress leads cowriters Coen and co-writer Tricia Cooke‘s latest dark comedy “Honey Don't!” as the titular Honey, who is investigating a local cult.

Chris Evans stars as the religious leader at the center of Qualley's investigation, while Aubrey Plaza plays a key “mystery woman.” Charlie Day, Billy Eichner, and Talia Ryder co-star. The ensemble also includes Lera Abova, Jacnier, Gabby Beans, Kristin Connolly, Lena Hall, Don Swayze, Josh Pafchek, Kale Brown, Alexander Carstoiu, and Christin Antidormi.

 










The official “Honey Don't!” synopsis reads: “Honey O'Donahue is a small-town private investigator who delves into a series of strange deaths tied to a mysterious church.”

“Honey Don't!” is set in Bakersfield, California, though it was shot in New Mexico. The feature is produced by Coen, Cooke, Robert Graf, Tim Bevan, and Eric Fellner, and will debut at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. The project was first announced in 2024.

Qualley previously told IndieWire that she was more than excited to reunite with Coen and Cooke. “I just love Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke so damn much and love being on their set. I can can hardly put into words how special making that movie was for me and working with Aubrey Plaza, who is one of my favorite actors and people of all time.”

“Drive-Away Dolls” was Ethan Coen's first narrative feature sans his brother Joel Coen, who also made his solo debut with “The Tragedy of Macbeth” in 2021. Ethan Coen recently teased a Coen Brothers reunion to Empire magazine, saying he and brother Joel Coen are “working on writing something” together after a creative split in 2018.

“Nothing happened, certainly nothing dramatic,” Ethan said at the time. “You start out when you're a kid and you want to make a movie. Everything's enthusiasm and gung-ho, let's go make a movie. And the first movie is just loads of fun. And then the second movie is loads of fun, almost as much fun as the first. And after 30 years, not that it's no fun, but it's more of a job than it had been.”

He added, “Going our own separate ways sounds like it suggests it might be final. But none of this stuff happened definitively. None of the decisions are definitive. We might make another movie.”

 










“Honey Don't!” premieres August 22 in theaters from Focus Features. Check out the trailer below.

Among the many challenges in the world streaming, one of the most persistent is discovery. We've all spent an hour scrolling through thumbnails to find something you and your partner can actually agree upon to watch. Now Netflix believe generative artificial intelligence can help with that process.

Netflix announced on Wednesday its latest overhaul of its TV homepage. While many of the changes are aesthetic and designed to make it easier to find information you need or the My List tab, it's also partnering with OpenAI on a chatbot that will give you recommendations based on prompts in simple sentences. You can say, “I want something funny and upbeat,” and it will give you some options. We'll be waiting for the person who goes viral when that prompt inevitably tells you to watch “Adolescence” or “Baby Reindeer.”

But the TV homepage will also now have TikTok-style reels that offer short-form clips if you're browsing on mobile, vertical video shorts that you can swipe through or add something directly to your My List if you like what you see or share it with a friend.

The other improved features are simply more visible shortcuts, better real-time recommendations, and elevated design. The new features will be rolled out in the next couple weeks and months as a beta version on iOS devices for now.

In a presentation touting the changes, Chief Product Officer Eunice Kim and Chief Technology Officer Elizabeth Stone showed how Netflix's TV homepage has evolved dramatically over the years. 

“One of the reasons I joined (and why I stay) is because this company has always had a unique ability to marry incredible tech with incredible entertainment. That's our superpower,” Stone said. “Obviously, everything starts with great shows and movies that people love. But if you think about all of the areas where Netflix has a big advantage — our reach, our recommendations, our fandom — tech enables all those things.” 

Check out a video of all the new features demoed here.

Well, it seems as though Edward Berger's Oscar-winning “Conclave” could have been a documentary. Life is imitating art as Politico has revealed that real-life Catholic cardinals are binging the film ahead of the papal conclave process to replace late Pope Francis, which begins today, May 7.

“Some have watched it in the cinema,” one of the 133 high-ranking clerics told POLITICO. According to the source, the cardinals view the film as being “remarkably accurate” and therefore a “helpful research tool, especially at a time when so many of the conclave participants have little experience of Vatican politics and protocol,” as POLITICO reported. A majority of the cardinals were appointed by Pope Francis, who died April 21 due to complications from a stroke; these cardinals have thus never experienced a conclave before, and also hail from small international dioceses, much like in Berger's film.

“Conclave” stars Ralph Fiennes as Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, who serves as the dean of the College of Cardinals and the steward of the conclave. Following the death of the pope in the film, the political race to campaign for and later select the successor unravels into scandal.

And that gossipy nature that Berger captured appears to be accurate in tone: Vatican insiders have been leaking anonymous attacks against rivals to the Roman press, while some top contenders have suddenly been linked to abuse cases. Politico further reported that one cardinal was banned from the conclave proceedings after a posthumous letter sent by Pope Francis outed him for partaking in financial fraud.

The Catholic cardinals aren't the only ones who resorted to watching “Conclave” to learn about the pontiff nominations. Viewership for the film increased by 283 percent within hours of Pope Francis' passing being announced. 

There will soon be even more pope-themed films, too: Martin Scorsese is producing a documentary on Pope Francis, titled “Aldeas — A New Story.” The feature was developed in collaboration with the late Francis' Scholas Occurrentes; the film will include a sequence of Scorsese in conversation with the pope, plus his final in-depth on-camera interview. 

“Now, more than ever, we need to talk to each other, listen to one another cross-culturally,” Scorsese said in a statement. “One of the best ways to accomplish this is by sharing the stories of who we are, reflected from our personal lives and experiences. It helps us understand and value how each of us sees the world. It was important to Pope Francis for people across the globe to exchange ideas with respect while also preserving their cultural identity, and cinema is the best medium to do that.”

Trauma permeates Rainy Miller's music—it's sodden with it, like an overcoat peeled off after a downpour. Sometimes he expresses it through violent outbursts—spoken-word screeds that turn anger both outwards at the world, and inwards at the id. Other times, that hurt is sublimated, swaddled in Auto-Tune and ambient textures. Still present, but buried, made numb.

Hailing from Preston, in Lancashire, Miller is one of a loose fraternity of artists with roots in North West England—see also aya, Blackhaine, and Iceboy Violet—taking grime, drill, and club music and retooling it as a sort of avant-garde confessional art. Joseph, What Have You Done? sits loosely in the idiom of sadboi post-Drake rap. But in Miller's hands, the form dissolves, manifesting in sheets of rumbling noise or gentle tides of synth that hit like a warm rush of intoxication.

Miller figured out the building blocks of this sound on 2022's Desquamation (Fire, Burn. Nobody). On Joseph, What Have You Done?, he's learning how to locate his struggle on a wider canvas, lacing his confessionals with Biblical imagery and memories from his Lancashire upbringing. One of the record's influences is Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus, a 2003 BBC travelogue around the American South hosted by the country singer Jim White. Miller recognized something in White's journey that chimed with his own lived experience: a landscape of nowhere towns populated by people who refuse to let their disadvantage dislodge their pride in themselves and their communities. On Joseph, What Have You Done?, Miller sets out to transpose that film's documentarian approach to his Lancastrian ends, creating an aesthetic that he calls “Northern Gothic.”

The album begins on a note of grim prophecy. “We were born with a mark on our backs,” mutters Miller at the start of “Mud in My Mouth. (Predetermined Definitions).” That pronouncement is the opening for a monologue that builds in intensity. “You was born to be nothing,” he repeats, and the track peaks right at the moment you hear his voice crack with emotion, the breaking point where anger crumbles into sorrow.

Depression and dispossession hang over Joseph, What Have You Done? like a storm cloud. They're there in “Toddbrook Dam, 2019.” and “Mary Magdalene, as a Home.,” King Krule-esque ballads on which Miller accompanies his pained mumble with strumming and simple arpeggios on an acoustic guitar. And they linger throughout the moody psychogeography of “Then Casts Shadows, From Afar (A6 - Pendleton).,” a love letter to someone unnamed but now absent, told from the threadbare seat of a bus somewhere on the dual carriageway between Manchester and Preston. Accentuating the album's documentary sensibility, Miller scatters voice notes throughout—off-the-cuff monologues muttered into a phone that often pack a devastating payload. On “Marked, 2020.,” he recalls an accidental sighting of his estranged biological father near Preston's St George's Shopping Centre—and the resulting emotional fallout.

For all the gloom, though, Joseph, What Have You Done? is determined to deny prophecy—to free itself from the curse of its birthright and find its way to a better place. Sometimes this desire for transcendence is stamped into the fabric of the music—see “Chrome. Hallowed Be.,” a surging junglist anthem that takes flight on angelic Auto-Tuned vocals and cinematic synthesized strings. Other times, it feels like Miller is trying to explode his way out of a rut. “Vengeance.” is a squall of crunchy noise and clanking breakbeats with a vocal cameo from Graham Sayle of the UK hardcore group High Vis, while “An Obsidian Lake Flows Out of Me.” hinges on a tumultuous percussive battery by the Danish jazz drummer J. Ludvig III. Immediately after, another voice note: “I think I've experienced delirium only, like, three times.” A wry pause for effect. “At least in a negative sense.”

Rainy Miller's stark candor can be both a strength and a weakness. What makes his music dramatic and provoking also makes it unpleasantly harrowing in places; listening can be like witnessing the picking of a scab. On Joseph, What Have You Done? he's finding new ways to communicate, processing trauma by pulling back the lens and articulating his struggle into a piece in a wider, older story. You stick around in the hope of salvation—and it comes. The album concludes with its title track: a starry-eyed paean to the people of Lancashire vocalized by Miller's collaborator, the Manchester-based artist Christ Bryan, and wrapped in tear-stained synths and yearning strings courtesy of more eaze. It's the sort of track that might feel slightly saccharine were it not for the hard yards that got us here. As it is, you feel relieved for Miller: that he made it out alive, not quite healed, but at least healing.

Scott Morgan has hit a sweet spot in over 25 years of making music as Loscil. He's in love with dub sound design, and erratic kicks and choppy filters hint at the pulse of techno, but his sound is never really “dub techno” per se, not least because it's always pristinely recorded and rarely betrays the scuffmarks of post-Basic Channel developments. If anything, he's a Cascadian answer to the Europeans on Kompakt and Mille Plateaux who followed the ever-softening kick drum of ambient techno deeper into a womblike space. Just as the foggy majesty of black metal carries over nicely from Norway to the Northwest, it makes sense that an artist from British Columbia would use the awestruck sounds of German ambient to evoke the breathtaking sweep of the Pacific rim.

One imagines Morgan would agree with fellow Northwest sound wizard Phil Elverum that his home is “beautiful but troubled,” and Lake Fire may be his most troubling album yet, inspired by the increasingly common experience of driving through burning West Coast landscapes. On one level, the record honors the cycles of death and rebirth that drive the region's fire-reliant old-growth ecosystems. It was originally an ensemble record in the vein of his great 2004 album First Narrows, but Morgan torched away at the products of those sessions until the only things left were his electronics and the distant moan of James Meger's bass on “Ash Clouds.” Even without knowing how the album was made, it's easy to notice the sound design is more weathered than usual, his pads taking on resonant overtones that feel like wind howling through a canyon.

On another level, the album continues the thread of apprehension that's long been present in Loscil's music, which is often about human encroachment on the natural world. It's hard to imagine that Morgan is merely honoring natural cycles of “destruction and rejuvenation” in the wake of the LA fires and the other disasters that now grip the West Coast yearly and will probably soon flare up again. Unlike Wolfgang Voigt, the godfather of this stuff, Morgan is not a nature worshipper. He's frank about his environment, and there's always the uneasy awareness in his work that the “nature” ambient artists so frequently exalt is usually filtered through a middleman. The 2002 album Submers was as much about the sublimity of the ocean as the vulnerable vessels used to explore it. Equivalents, from 2019, is about not clouds but a set of Alfred Stieglitz photographs of clouds.

Here, the middleman is Morgan's car window, protecting him from the worst of the inferno. He makes no effort on Lake Fire to situate himself on the frontlines, within the hell of crumbling vegetation and dying animals the Australian painter William Strutt captured in his great bushfire painting Black Thursday. The urgency of the climate crisis has not driven Morgan to plumb his sound for more extreme places it can venture (his extremes skew quiet, as on the magisterial drone albums coast/range/arc// and Faults, Coasts, Lines). “Arrhythmia” uses a drum beat that seems labored and burdened, but the pneumatic dub chords instantly situate us in the familiar soundworld of his 2000s Kranky run, and it doesn't sound much more threatening than the stuff he was making about thermodynamics at the beginning of his career.

Lake Fire features some of Morgan's best sound design since his canonical 2000s trio of First Narrows, Plume, and Endless Falls. While even the best Loscil tracks tend to a mood and milk it for seven minutes or so at a time, these songs meander freely, with the sour strings of “Candling” yielding to an odd coda where a flute synth is allowed to just play for a while. The glacial throb of “Ash Clouds” and “Doux” suggests that Morgan's conversations with Lawrence English about “rich” sound sources that led to their awesome collaboration Colours of Air have rubbed off on his solo work. That might explain the unusually rich low end on “Bell Flame,” with a steady pulse that approximates the pace of a car that has slowed down to examine a scene of horror. This is road trip music for the new normal.

Yet you might also hope the widespread devastation on the West Coast would inspire something more substantial than a strong offering by an artist coming up on 30 years of dauntless consistency. It's hard to shake the feeling this porous music can soak up any context in which it's presented. Who's to say that if it were called Equivalents 2, we wouldn't be thinking of cute cumulus clouds instead of the dystopian brown smokescapes that have become a fact of life for so many people? Lots of those folks will probably also witness the burning of the West Coast from the relative safety of their cars, but it's hard to say for how many more generations, or even years, such a luxury will last. If things stay the way they are, Lake Fire may be remembered less as an alarming portent than a relic of a time when we had things a lot easier.

In the shadow of Houston, a Southern rap mecca, is Dallas: an underdog hip-hop city that has rarely gotten its due. One of the first Dallas rappers to get a buzz was the D.O.C., who broke out in the late '80s with the homegrown Fila Fresh Crew, then hit the road to L.A., assisting with N.W.A. and the rise of Death Row. In the mid-aughts through the early 2010s, the Dallas boogie scene popped—a grassroots movement of slow-mo club-rap jams (Lil Wil's “My Dougie,” Treal Lee and Prince Rick's “Mr. Hit That,” The Party Boyz's “Flex”) with infinite loose-limbed dances to match. It launched a few countrywide grade-school dance classics, but immortal hip-wobbling moves like the Dougie and Ricky Bobby became ingrained in pop culture through their California offshoots.

Compared to Houston, Dallas lacked the musical infrastructure, reach, and industry co-signs. But by the mid-2010s, this seemed to be changing, when Mo3 went on a run of raw, melodic ballads that merged Boosie-ish blues with the scenic, leisurely Dallas reality rap of the 2000s (Big Tuck, Big Chief, etc.)—perfect to be blasted out of a whip with a fresh coat of candy paint. But in 2020, fresh off “Broken Love,” a multi-platinum collab with Kevin Gates, he was murdered on a freeway in Dallas. His posthumous album Shottaz 4 Eva hit the charts, but the moment felt cut short.

Recently, a wave of Dallas street rappers have emerged on a mission to finally take the city's music mainstream. Unified under the hashtag #NewDallas, they're combining bits of regional scenes of the past and present into a flood of rags-to-riches stories a lot like the ones up and down HeadHuncho Amir's STILL AIN NUN BIGGER. The smooth-talker's tape is the latest in a string of noisemaking full-lengths of the city—joining Zillionaire Doe's D Boi Dreams, released in January, and Montana 700's 700 Reasons, in February—where the backstory on how the scene reached this point is more interesting than the music itself.

Coming on the heels of October's AIN NUN BIGGER, STILL AIN NUN BIGGER (hopefully he goes the Rich Homie Quan route with the mixtape titles) is easy-to-listen-to, no-frills motivation rap. You can visualize it inoffensively playing at a club with a bottle service or soundtracking college football training montages—the music video for the tape's generic hometown anthem “Motivate the City” leans into that by actually including footage from an SMU football practice. Evoking Rick Ross' underdeveloped brand of boss rap, which he made before cranking up the theater on Deeper Than Rap, Amir is heavy on unimaginative tales of steak dinners, Zoom meetings, and getting chauffeured around in black SUVs; obligatory dreams of riding in private jets and making one billion dollars; and life coach tips: “My advice to these young niggas learn how to save,” he raps on “Blow.” The point is to present himself as a Dallas boy who beat the odds and turned himself into a young rap mogul, which can make for exciting rap—but only if the details pop.

Unfortunately, Amir's writing is undercooked and non-specific. He lacks the finesse of other get-money motivation rappers; he doesn't set scenes like Jeezy, nor is he a hall-of-fame embellisher like Bossman Dlow. He relies on rap clichés and skimps on storytelling granularities. On “Bring to the Table,” he goes, “Every time I'm out to eat I'm known to leave a tip,” and the lyric says jack shit about him. How much is the tip? A standard 20%? Something lavish and unreal? On “BBTN,” he tells a girl his schedule is booked up with meetings, but doesn't give us any info about those meetings. He doesn't take these opportunities to be funny, or to otherwise be direct and realistic. It might seem like nitpicking, but those particulars are where you get to know a rapper.

Amir is better at setting a specific mood: one of hard-earned triumphs. He perpetually sounds like the newly wise narrator at the end of a sports movie, whether he's poppin' bottles on project standout “Barry Sanders” or on a g-funk cruise with Montana 700 on “Stay Down.” His worn voice and half-speed flow does a lot of the emotional heavy lifting. On the intro “3000,” over one of those spaghetti western beats I associate with fellow Dallas heavy hitter BigXthaPlug, he celebrates inking a record deal. Yeah, he's overestimating how much I want to hear about his negotiation tactics and splits (save it for the DJ Vlad interview), but you can tell how much being one of the Dallas rappers to break through the glass ceiling means to him. That balance between hard life and victory is in the tape's best music, like when he imagines what his grandmother's face might look like if she saw his bank account on the bouncy “Booked Up” or when, among the vintage trap flourishes and horns of “Hands On,” he recalls bonding with his dad over therapy.

This kind of emotional complexity makes Amir feel like a real human, rather than just a rapper of the moment repeating Southern hip-hop platitudes. But it doesn't happen enough on STILL AIN NUN BIGGER to elevate it from a random roundup of popular regional rap sounds—Flint shit-talk, South Florida stunting, rumbling Memphis radio hits—to a release with a distinctive identity. In general, that's the issue with the #NewDallas sound. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly is so Dallas about the music other than the constant shout outs to their hometown: the tempos are slow but not too slow; it's for the club, but not the kind of stuff you'd want to dance to. The result is music that could be from any city in the South, where the hashtag feels more important than the mixtape.

Michael Pitt, the actor best known for his roles in Dawson's Creek and Boardwalk Empire, was arrested last week and charged with sexual abuse and assault in New York City. 


	Pitt was arrested Friday and arraigned on the charges in Brooklyn Supreme Court. He's facing eight counts total, including two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, assault with a blunt object, and strangulation.


	According to online court records, Pitt pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him and was released on $15,000 bail. His next court appearance is scheduled for June 17. 


	Jason Goldman, a lawyer for Pitt, told Rolling Stone, “Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt — an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes — can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unhinged individual. In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, at a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual and voluntary relationship. This case will be dismissed.” 

	











	According to court documents obtained by the New York Post — which was the first to report on Pitt's arrest — the charges against the actor stem from four alleged incidents involving an ex-girlfriend that occurred between April 2020 and August 2021. Pitt is accused of forcibly groping his ex on one occasion, and sexually assaulting her and hitting her with a wooden plank on another. Prosecutors also alleged that Pitt assaulted his ex with a cinderblock in June 2021 and strangled her in August of that year.

	The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.


	Pitt was previously arrested in July 2022 for assault and petty larceny after allegedly hitting a man several times and taking his phone. He was hospitalized a few months later after being accused of throwing items at people in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. He was not charged with a crime in that instance as the police determined that he was emotionally disturbed.

	President Donald Trump's meme coin is already a thing that shouldn't exist, much less as a vehicle for foreign entities to funnel money to the sitting president, yet here we are. 


	According to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg, over half of the top holders of $TRUMP — a personal cryptocurrency token established days before his inauguration — are likely foreign buyers, who have dumped millions into the project. 


	And likely not without motive. Last month, the token announced that Trump would be hosting an exclusive May 22 dinner for about 200 of $TRUMP's largest investors at his Washington, D.C., golf club, leading to a flurry of purchases. According to Bloomberg, “76 percent of the token value held among the top 220 wallets likely belongs to foreign owners because the wallets used exchanges that are not available to U.S. residents.” According to a separate analysis by The Washington Post, roughly $100 million worth of tokens were purchased after the dinner was announced. 

	











	$TRUMP's existence as a piggy bank through which so-far anonymous entities from across the globe can dump untold amounts of cash into the president's coffers in exchange for exclusive access to his time is a pretty clear cut case of corruption. According to an analysis published by the Associated Press earlier this week, the coin has already generated over $320 million in transaction fees for its creators. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The president's crypto coin is by no means a safe investment. A Tuesday report from NBC News found that of the approximately two million crypto wallets that purchased $TRUMP, around 764,000 lost money on their investment. Just 58 wallets account for roughly $1.1 billion in value gains, each making more than $10 million on their investment. 


	“The sitting president appears to be selling personal cryptocurrency while in office, granting access to people who buy it, and thereby enriching his business and his family. It's gobsmacking,” Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) told Politico on Wednesday. “I'd like to hear one Republican senator defend it. Any self-respecting Congress would demand an accounting of everyone trading this coin who has any business before the government.”

	Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.), ranking Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, issued letters to Fight Fight Fight LLC and World Liberty Financial — the two primary business entities of the Trump family's growing crypto empire — notifying them that the committee is “conducting a preliminary inquiry into potential conflicts of interest and violations of the law from President Trump's cryptocurrency venture.” 

	











	“Donald Trump is selling cryptocurrency like snake oil in the Wild West, and he's put a for sale sign on the White House for his meme coin,” Blumenthal told USA Today. “People in America deserve to know how he is potentially under the influence of foreign governments and investors who are buying his crypto assets.”


	On Tuesday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Ct.) introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which would prohibit the president, vice president, other members of the executive branch and members of Congress and their families from launching meme coins or financially benefiting from other types of cryptocurrency schemes.

	“Trump's meme coin [is] the most unethical, most corrupt thing a president of the United States has ever done,” Murphy said in a video announcing the legislation. “It's essentially a way for any corporate CEO, any Saudi prince, any foreign oligarch who has business before the Trump administration to send Trump money privately, secretly, and then whisper to the Trump administration about how much money they've sent and the favor that they need.” 


	“No member of the executive branch, no member of Congress, should be able to profit off of their position — and certainly we should not allow for these secret ways for very powerful, very rich people to be able to send money to a member of Congress or the President of the United States,” he said. “This is a common sense bill and we should just get it done.”

	Ye (fka Kanye West) spent approximately three minutes doing an interview with Piers Morgan before storming off, which, to be fair, is probably about as long as we'd want to spend talking to Piers Morgan.


	Which is not to say that, in this instance — to paraphrase the tweet — you gotta hand it to him. Ye's exit was prompted by a dispute about social media followers, and preceded by a hilariously contentious exchange with Morgan about the views in Majorca and some not-so-thinly veiled comments from Ye about “being attacked by the banks.” 


	Ye's appearance on Uncensored got off to a rip-roaringly stupid start when Morgan asked how he was doing and Ye replied, “I mean, you see that view? … Judge it on the view, as the answer to how my life is. Judge me by the view.” 


	Morgan then suggested the serene Balearic view behind him was in stark contrast to the tumult that's engulfed the rapper/mogul/troll's life over the past few years. It was a remark that successfully piqued Ye into his first little diatribe: “I already disagree,” he said. “It's not in contrast, there's so many people and artists that are championing the idea of someone being able to just express who they really are, and have been able to go through the war of being attacked by the banks, being attacked, you know, by the banks — that's the best way to put it. Being attacked by the banks, and to still be here with this view is, you know, that's the win. So I think that's — I'm in contrast to your contrast.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Impressively, the veteran journalist Morgan did not run with the follow-up that many would find obvious in light of Ye's longstanding history of antisemitic comments and ask him what he meant by “the banks.” Rather, he managed to inadvertently derail his interview by getting Ye's follower numbers on X wrong. Morgan said 32 million, to which Ye fired back, “Look right now, you're not gonna take inches off my dick, bro. How many followers do I have?” (That Ye knew 32 million was wrong immediately is extremely unsurprising.)


	After Morgan confirmed that the correct number was actually 33 million followers, Ye leaned in one last time, spouting, “I'm a gift, bro. Why do all you people in media act like you haven't played my songs at your weddings or graduations or funerals or when your child was born? … It just shows the hate you put out for people that put love, there's so much love.”

	When Morgan tried to interject that he had no idea what Ye was talking about, Ye returned to the pressing issue of the incorrect X followers: “Now you're not taking accountability or responsibility. This is what you get for now. We can circle back when you can count.” 


	Ye then got up and left, leaving Morgan to spend the next 10 minutes or so talking to the popular/controversial social media personality, Sneako. To which we must paraphrase another tweet: we ain't watching all that, happy for you though, or sorry that happened.

	In case you had any doubts, André 3000 is living his — or anyone's — best life. Instead of doing what people want or expect, he's out here following his muse wherever it takes him. In 7 Piano Sketches, he goes for almost literally the last thing you'd predict from one of the greatest rappers ever: 16 minutes of improvised doodles, mostly recorded at home in 2013, with his iPhone sitting on the piano. “I'd rather go amateur interesting than master boring,” André told Rolling Stone last year, and he lives up to that motto on 7 Piano Sketches. There's a true ATLien spirit in releasing this to the public, with the label, “Warning: No Bars.”


	Like spaceships, pianos don't come equipped with rear-view mirrors, and that's the whole point here. He's stepping free of the OutKast legacy, so he can start from scratch in a spirit of pure discovery. No goals, no expectations. Like his surprise 2023 flute album New Blue Sun, it's a playfully enjoyable exercise in spiritual renewal by heading into the unknown, lost in music. As he describes it in his notes, it's a “palette cleanser.”

	











	André dropped 7 Piano Sketches as a total shocker on Monday night, at the same time he was attending the Met Gala fashion event in New York, wearing a piano strapped to his back. (He might be an amateur at his instrument, but the man's a virtuoso at rollouts.) As with his flute experiment, he takes pride in coming to his axe as a raw beginner. For a sophisticated music mastermind who once played Jimi Hendrix in a movie, it's a bold statement about doing something specifically because you don't know what you're doing.

	“I cannot name which notes, keys or chords that I'm playing,” he writes in his social-media liner notes. “I simply like the sound and mechanics of piano playing. Some of my favorite piano music composers and players that inspire me are Thelonious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Philip Glass, Stephen Sondheim, Joni Mitchell and Vince Guaraldi.”

New Blue Sun was a lot more than a solo flute trip — he was collaborating closely with other musicians. That's not happening here. He knocked it out in a Texas house where he and his son were living with no furniture — “only a piano, our beds and tv screens.” But there was no thought of making an album. “These piano pieces weren't recorded with the intention of presenting them in any formal way to the public,” he explains. “They were personal, at home recordings. I would sometimes text them to my family and friends.” 

	











	But Three Stacks' melodic sensibility comes through loud and clear, giving the whole thing a bittersweet low-key flow, even when he's just winging it. “And then one day you'll…” is a gorgeously jazzy meditation that sounds like the music you hear in your head driving alone in the rain — you can really hear his obsession with Monk. Same with the first minute of “hotel lobby pianos,” before it takes off on the riff from Dave Brubeck's “Take Five.” (Or Pavement's “5 – 4 = Unity”?) The high points come at the end, in “off rhythm laughter,” with its eerie echo and overdubbed human chuckles, dissolving into a reverberant drone. “I spend all day waiting for the night” has a welcome hip-hop beat, which gives him something to play against.

	Nothing too complex here, obviously — André is attracted to throwaways the way driven artists often are, as an exercise to keep their artistic muscles loose and limber. His original title: The Best Worst Rap Album In History. “It's jokingly the worst rap album in history because there are no lyrics on it at all,” he explained. “It's the best because it's the free-est emotionally and best I've felt personally. It's the best because it's like a palette cleanser for me.”


	So what's next? A ukelele album? A harmonica concerto? A 40-minute cello solo recorded in a rented Mazda at the Burger King drive-through? Whatever it is, it'll be exactly what André wants to try. 7 Piano Sketches is a tribute to enthusiasm for its own sake. He sat down at the piano and played around, with no thought of living up to his history — just jumping into a moment of freedom and riding it all the way through.

Architecture firm Rogers Partners and two other tenants signed deals at JEMB Realty's 150 Broadway, Commercial Observer has learned.

In the largest lease, Rogers Partners will be relocating from 100 Reade Street after signing a seven-year, 6,286-square-foot lease on the sixth floor of the property, according to landlord brokers JLL. Asking rent in the building is $55 per square foot.

“There has been a tremendous amount of movement in Lower Manhattan as tenants readjust their footprints and, in some cases, relocate from properties that are being converted to apartments,” JLL's Andrew Coe, who worked on deals with Margaux Kelleher, Jakob Cohn and Joseph Sipala, said in a statement. 

Ken Fishel of Legacy negotiated on behalf of the Rogers and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the second lease, modeling agency Muse Management signed a seven-year deal to move from its current 3,626 square feet on the 11th floor of the building to 5,432 square feet on the third floor. Marcus Rayner and Sam Einhorn of Colliers handled the deal for Muse Management, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It's unclear when the tenant moved into the building.

Lastly, art and design studio UAP signed a seven-year, 4,468-square-foot deal to relocate from 33 Bond Street to the third floor of the JEMB-owned building with Coe, Kelleher and Cohn representing them in the deal.

Other tenants in the building include manufacturer of modular wall systems ALUR, which signed a deal for 4,015 square feet in September 2023, and Chinese retailer Miniso — which sells cosmetics, stationery, toys and other home goods — which took 5,000 square feet of retail space in June 2024.

Drop star Meghann Fahy has been set to lead the supernatural thriller Banquet from The Platform director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, Deadline reports this morning.

Banquet is based on an original screenplay from writer Sam Steiner (Fingernails).

Fahy will play “Jenny Cochrane, a woman whose perfect life is shattered by the return of her estranged son, which reawakens a terrifying secret buried in her bloodline.”

While that's not a lot to go on as of yet, it's worth pointing out that Gaztelu-Urrutia's feature debut, The Platform, became one of Netflix's all-time top ten most watched films upcon release and received a sequel last year. The Platform also amassed glowing critical praise won a Goya at the Spanish Academy of Motion Pictures for Best Special Effects.

After breaking out in season two of “The White Lotus,” Meghann Fahy is keeping busy. After a starring role in Christopher Landon's Drop, the actor is next slated to appear in Netflix's dark comedy Sirens. All of which to say that the talent behind Banquet so far has our curiosity piqued.

David Yates (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts 1 & 2) will executive-produce under his banner Wychwood Media alongside Florian Zeller (The Father) and Federica Sainte-Rose for Blue Morning Pictures.

XYZ Films is financing and will launch international sales for Banquet this month and production is set for October in the UK, so stay tuned for additional news as it arrives.

Horror journalist, RT Top Critic, and Critics Choice Association member. Has appeared on PBS series' Monstrum, served on the SXSW Midnighter shorts jury, and moderated horror panels for WonderCon, SeriesFest, and Popcorn Frights Film Fest.

Modern genre favorites David Dastmalchian (Late Night with the Devil) and Georgina Campbell (Barbarian) will star in the horror-thriller The Shepherd, Variety has learned.

Production is set to begin in the fall with John Hyams (Sick, Alone) directing from a script written by Alexander Gustaveson.

Set in the desolate Nevada night, the film follows a young woman in labor fleeing an abusive past who has her escape hijacked by a mysterious stranger hiding an ominous threat in the back of her car.

Steven Schneider (Insidious, Paranormal Activity) and Roy Lee (It, Barbarian) produce for Spooky Pictures with Ben Cornwell, Jordan Foley and Nick Smith for Paperclip Ltd. (Alone, Snack Shack), Sébastien Raybaud (Greenland, The Night House) for Anton, and Jonathan Rosenthal (Alone).

Dastmalchian is executive producing under his Good Fiend Films banner. Anton and Image Nation are financing.

“Once I turned the first few pages of The Shepherd I was hooked,” said Dastmalchian. “I immediately wanted to see this high-octane, horrifying world brought to life and John is the perfect person to make it happen. After collaborating with Roy and Steven on Late Night with the Devil, I have been looking forward to getting back in the sandbox with them and I can't wait to bring the genre force of Good Fiend Films into the equation.”

“Following the success of Late Night with the Devil, we're excited to be working with David Dastmalchian once again on The Shepherd,” added Image Nation CEO Ben Ross. “David brings a distinctive energy and depth to every project he's part of, and this film marks another strong collaboration in our ongoing partnership with Spooky Pictures.”

Dastmalchian's upcoming genre films include the action-horror Epilogue with Kate Siegel, the psychological thriller Kodak SuperXX with Kelly Marie Tran, the sci-fi horror The Cure with Ashley Greene, and the psychological horror Sender with Britt Lower and Jamie Lee Curtis.

Campbell, meanwhile, has the sci-fi thriller Cold Storage with Joe Keery and the Influencer sequel Influencers with Cassandra Naud coming soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","15 Best TV Shows Like Supernatural","https://www.slashfilm.com/1851876/best-tv-shows-like-supernatural/","Wed, 07 May 2025 17:15:00 GMT","




When we first met Sam and Dean Winchester (played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively) on ""Supernatural,"" they were just a pair of estranged brothers with a whole host of daddy issues attempting to track down their missing father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). They — and we — never could have imagined the journey that the Winchesters would go on over the course of the show's astonishing 15 seasons. From their humble origins as hunters to becoming pawns in a larger battle between God and the Devil, the best ""Supernatural"" episodes saw these two boys put through the gamut. 

With such a long series run, ""Supernatural"" was able to embrace every facet of the genre, including goofier and increasingly meta storylines right around the show's 10th season. ""Supernatural"" was beloved by its fans, as evinced by thousands of pages of fan fiction produced and the enthusiastic response to its stars' appearances at conventions. If you're still mourning its loss, here are some other similar shows that might fill the Winchester-shaped hole in your heart.




If you've never heard of ""Dead Last,"" you're hardly alone there: It was cancelled after just a single season back in the early 2000s, and only six of its 12 filmed episodes actually made it to air. But similar to how the Winchester brothers, especially in the first few seasons of ""Supernatural,"" spent a lot of time trying to reduce the Midwest's ghost population, ""Dead Last"" was all about three friends trying to help the dead resolve whatever unfinished business that was preventing them from moving on to the afterlife.

Their story begins when the three bandmates stumble upon an amulet that gives them the ability to see ghosts. And once they see them, it's kind of hard to unsee them. Or, for that matter, to ignore their pleas for help, even though the trio would really rather focus on the future of their band, The Problem. ""Dead Last"" had a lot of potential, but its initial series run was cut short in the aftermath of September 11th. (The fact that its third episode, ""Death Is in the Air,"" came out two weeks before 9/11 and involved our heroes on a plane that was about to crash, didn't help.) Its fifth episode was preempted by coverage of the terrorist attacks, and from there, WB seemed to cut their losses — it only lasted one more episode.




Physically, Edwin (George Rexstrew) and Charles (Jayden Revri) don't have much in common with the Winchester brothers. After all, they're — as the show's name suggests — dead boys, while Sam and Dean are tall manly men whose voices suspiciously get deeper and deeper as the seasons go by. But at the same time, they serve a similar function as private investigators who specialize in the supernatural. Also, they've all died at least once, and some of them have spent a not insignificant period of time in Hell, through no fault of their own.

Unlike many ghosts, these two are not trapped on Earth because of unfinished business — they're actively trying to avoid the afterlife, instead focusing on sticking around as spectral detectives, solving supernatural crimes and helping other wayward souls. ""Dead Boy Detectives"" only lasted for one season, but even so, it made its mark on Netflix.




Sure, ""The X-Files"" is fairly light on the ground when it comes to ghosties and ghoulies. But within its formative monster-of-the-week template accompanied by a larger seasonal arc, what they lack in the supernatural they make up for in the extraterrestrial. This beloved sci-fi program featured Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, the skeptic who always believes there's a rational explanation for everything, and David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, a true believer who suspects little green men at the drop of the hat. Together, they investigate various mysterious goings-on for the government and, as they say, the truth is out there. 

""The X-Files,"" just like ""Supernatural,"" was surprisingly long running for a genre show, and during its heyday in the late '90s, it was everywhere. It ran for nine seasons from 1993 to 2002, received two standalone feature films, and was given a revival series that ran from 2016 to 2018 and saw its stars — whose chemistry launched an epic will-they-won't-they romantic campaign — famously reunited.




""Hex"" feels a bit like the U.K.'s answer to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" although its intrepid teen heroine (Cassie, played by Christina Cole) is a witch rather than a vampire slayer. Cassie is a student at an English boarding school trying to fit in among her classmates when she begins having visions that, with the help of her friend Thelma (Jemima Rooper), open the door to her supernatural heritage. She's the latest in a long line of witches, and has the burgeoning telekinetic powers to prove it. 

But if that wasn't enough to be dealing with, Cassie also begins seeing a strange man around campus — Azazeal, a fallen angel who has been in a multi-generational relationship with each of her family's witches, and now professes to be in love with her. Azazeal was played by Michael Fassbender, and for most people, ""Hex"" is remembered today as offering up one of his earliest leading roles. Although we only get them in season 1 — the second season focused on a different leading duo — their unconventional chemistry goes a long way in making ""Hex"" an underrated treasure.




Just like Sam and Dean in ""Supernatural,"" Nick (David Giuntoli) in ""Grimm"" has a supernatural birthright: The ability to see all the various monsters and ghouls that populated ""Grimm's Fairy Tales,"" and, for that matter, to maintain the fragile coexistence between them and ordinary humans. Luckily, he's a cop, so in addition to his paranormal gifts, he also has considerable police resources at his disposal. 

Each week, Nick does battle with the monsters that live in the gap between fairy tales and the real world. ""Grimm"" was one of those fantasy series that developed its mythology more thoughtfully over the seasons (an argument to be made against genre shows being cancelled early, before they've had a chance to come into their own), and by the time it ended after its sixth season, it could go toe to toe with some of the best fantasy shows of all time — including its much more beloved big brother, ""Supernatural.""




When George (Ellen Muth) dies in the pilot episode of ""Dead Like Me,"" it's really just the beginning of her story. After being crushed to death by a falling space station toilet (talk about embarrassing), she learns that she's been selected to join the ranks of the grim reapers, who are tasked with removing the souls of people just before they die to ease their way into the afterlife. And although she's initially frustrated by the direction her odd little life has gone in, together with her local team of reapers (including Mandy Patinkin as Rube, Jasmine Guy as Roxy, and Callum Blue as Mason), she eventually finds a place for herself that eluded her during her actual life on Earth. It's a classic coming-of-age story — just one that takes place after its protagonist has, you know, already died.

""Dead Like Me"" ran for two seasons on Showtime, amassing a cult following before its (ironically) untimely death. Although efforts to renew the show for a third season ultimately failed, it did get a standalone film, ""Dead Like Me: Life After Death."" Like many of Bryan Fuller's productions, ""Dead Like Me"" shone with a quirky aesthetic and grimly humorous relationship with death.




Liv (Rose McIver), the star of ""iZombie,"" does not have what you might consider great luck. First, her promising career as a medical resident is interrupted when she is turned into a zombie, forcing her to shift gears professionally. She takes up a job as a medical examiner, which gives her fresh access to all the brains she could ever want (if she doesn't get brains, she turns into one of those classic, glassy-eyed zombies). But these brains come with an unexpected side effect: Consuming them gives Liv access to the memories and even the personality of the deceased, offering her prime insight into how they died.

""iZombie"" was a fixture on The CW for five seasons, and although many have criticized its underwhelming finale, for the most part the series was met with praise. It offered a different take on the well-worn zombie genre, injecting it with fresh blood and a youthfulness that prevented its version from feeling stale. Here are some horror shows to binge if you loved ""iZombie.""




No matter how thoroughly Joss Whedon has determined to tear down his own legacy, brick by brick, there's no denying the fact that when it comes to genre television, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a formative text. The teen drama (first airing on The WB, then its successor network The CW) stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy Summers, a typical high school girl in every way — except for the fact that she alone among her generation possesses the strength to battle all the forces of darkness that seem to pop up in the sleepy Southern Californian town of Sunnydale. 

Over the course of the seven seasons the show was on the air, Buffy and her friends spent each week fighting — well, and occasionally dating — vampires, demons, and humanoid praying mantises, as well as averting the apocalypse every now and then. With a trademark sense of humor, beloved characters, plenty of heartbreaking moments, and a glib approach to the elements of horror that populated the show, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was unlike anything that had been on the air until then, and its influence on shows like ""Supernatural"" is palpable.




Although ""Supernatural"" started off focusing on your bog standard ghosts, demons, and gruesome bug infestations, over the course of the show it grew more epic in scope, dealing with archangels, God, and the Devil. ""The Almighty Johnsons"" centers on a different mythology, revolving around the Norse pantheon of gods, who over the centuries have emigrated to sunny New Zealand (who could blame them?) and their diminished forms live within human vessels. These chosen few have their god revealed to them on their 21st birthday, and are given the strengths (and weaknesses) of their deity. 

Each brother in the Johnson family serves as a vessel for the gods — and when their youngest brother Axl (Emmett Skilton) comes of age, he shocks them all becoming the human incarnation of the most powerful of them all, Odin. Now, Odin, coming back is a big deal — as in, his presence offers the gods the chance to reclaim their full powers if Axl can track down the human incarnation of Odin's wife, Frigga. And as if that wasn't enough, each of the brothers is at the end of their rope coping with the burden of their powers. There are supernatural hijinks afoot, of course, but at the heart of ""The Almighty Johnsons"" is the often contentious but nonetheless powerful bond between the brothers — just like in ""Supernatural.""




""The Haunting of Hill House"" is pretty much all about unresolved trauma, and the same can be said for ""Supernatural,"" whose heroes basically fight demons to avoid going to therapy. The Crane family is forever changed when they take up residence at Hill House, a foreboding manor whose sinister energy impacts each member of the family differently. Now adults, they're each grappling with the lingering effects of their experience in the house, when youngest sister Nell (Victoria Pedretti) returns to Hill House, only to die there. 

As they reunite for her funeral, old wounds resurface, and they're forced to confront the dark legacy of Hill House. Based on the popular novel by Shirley Jackson, ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is a masterclass in atmosphere — a slow sense of dread develops over the course of the entire series, punctuated by a few moments of genuine terror, including the horrifying jump scare of the Bent-Neck Lady.




The writers of ""Supernatural"" made up plenty of spooky storylines over the show's 15 seasons, but they also often found inspiration in real-life ghost stories and urban legends. These stories are at the heart of ""Lore,"" which was based on a supernatural podcast exploring the origins of many of our most enduring horror myths. With each episode focusing on a different classic horror origin story, blending a documentary-style approach with vivid reenactments.

""Lore"" ran for two seasons on Prime Video, giving fans of the genre a new take on the stories they knew and loved, before being cancelled by the streamer. Although there are only 12 episodes of the series available to watch, audiences can take solace in the fact that the award-winning podcast from Aaron Mahnke has an impressive 250 episodes for fans to sink their teeth into, making it a veritable vault of knowledge on all things dark and spooky.




For years, fans of the collaboration between Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman hoped for an on-screen adaptation of ""Good Omens."" Finally, they got what they asked for when Prime Video launched a series based on the novel which would see an angel (Michael Sheen) and a demon (David Tennant) team up to avert the coming apocalypse. Having lived among the humans for millennia, the two had gotten comfortable functioning as earthly representations of good and evil, halfheartedly sticking to the company line. But when the Antichrist is born, their chill Earthly existence is threatened, and neither particularly relishes the thought of returning to heaven or hell full-time. And thus, an alliance is formed.

""Good Omens"" keeps much of the quirky sense of humor of the book intact, relishing the eccentricities of the angel and demon and their undeniable chemistry with one another. Although the first season wrapped up the story of the book, the showrunners were able to successfully expand upon it, creating a second season that did justice to all the characters audiences fell in love with.




When you've got a show as universally beloved as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" the only reasonable thing to do is create a spinoff with one of its most popular characters. In ""Angel,"" the reformed vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) recovers from his recent breakup with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) by moving to Los Angeles (it's the city of angels — get it?) and starting up a supernatural detective agency. Just another example of powerful geriatrics who refuse to retire.

He initially teams up with part-demon Doyle (Glenn Quinn) and Sunnydale alum Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), although the disgraced ex-Watcher Wesley Wyndham-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) replaces Doyle in the second season. Together, they take on the sporadic case, and deal with the supernaturally-tinged drama within their own lives — like Angel's son, who is born to his ex-flame Darla (Julie Benz), kidnapped as an infant, and then unceremoniously returns as an angsty demon-hunting teen (Vincent Kartheiser). ""Angel"" ran for five seasons, and although it rarely reached the heights of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" it grew into a worthy genre series in its own right.




You know how Sam and Dean work together for the good of all humanity, but still spend a lot of every episode of ""Supernatural"" sniping at one another, a lifetime of sibling grievances pouring out on-screen? ""Charmed"" has a very similar vibe, only it revolves around three sisters who are also witches. Piper (Holly Lauren Combs), Prue (Shannen Doherty), and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) — and later Paige (Rose McGowan), their youngest half-sister who joined the show after Doherty left — are the most recent generation of the powerful Halliwell family, which has produced witches for ages. And together, they are thrust into plenty of magical mischief.

""Charmed"" was a supernatural hit, running for eight seasons on The WB. It was rebooted in 2018 with a new trio of witches — the second ""Charmed"" was a modest success, airing on The CW for four seasons before being cancelled. Ultimately, it was a victim of the network's restructuring and intentional step away from the genre programming that had initially made it competitive.




Although ""Supernatural"" began with two brothers who, as hunters, were adjacent to the paranormal community, over the course of the show, angels, demons, and other non-human entities emerged as an essential part of its supporting cast. By contrast, ""Being Human"" is largely uninterested in depicting the human perspective at all. It features a vampire (Aidan Turner), a werewolf (Russell Tovey), and a ghost (Lenora Crichlow) who all live (well, in a manner of speaking) in the same flat. 

But they don't exactly have your typical roommate issues — their trials and tribulations take on an appropriately paranormal leaning, as some of them (and we're not naming any names) can't seem to stop inadvertently killing people. The show ran for five seasons, although the main cast was entirely replaced over the years to make room for a new trio of supernatural beings. It was resurrected, for lack of a better word, on American television, where the new version stayed on the air for an additional three years.","{'href': 'https://www.slashfilm.com', 'title': 'SlashFilm'}","other"

Bold Journey Magazine

May 7, 2025

We caught up with the brilliant and insightful Shawna Allard a few weeks ago and have shared our conversation below.

The process started when I was nine, and I realized that my psychic medium talent was unique. When my psychic abilities became fully activated, I shared my insights with my closest friends and family members, asking for their feedback on the value each person experienced. After a year, it was clear that the information coming through me was accurate and of great help to others. Over three decades later, I am still working as an intuitive psychic with the Divine Guidance that manifests through me and helps others on their journey toward a fulfilling life.



I was born with psychic abilities and wasn't aware that I was gifted with a unique talent until I was nine, when I found that my talent was not something everyone possessed.  
My gift of psychic mediumship fully developed in my mid-thirties., but juggling single motherhood, a full-time job as an accountant, and my calling as a psychic medium was extremely difficult. One day, when I was praying, I experienced a life-changing vision, so I took a massive leap of faith, quitting my job for the unknown of self-employment and relying only on my psychic abilities.
 
Following my calling, I founded the Divine Knowing Institute, where I teach classes to educate as many people as possible about how to develop and use their intuition. I'm the author of three books and offer guidance to others as a psychic medium and intuitive life coach. 



My journey of becoming an accomplished psychic medium, life coach, author, and public speaker involved faith, resilience, and intuition. Also, due to my interest in advancing my knowledge, I have obtained degrees in clinical hypnotherapy, Reiki, Feng Shui, and past life regression. I believe resilience, intuition, or any other skill we have can be developed only with practice.
My advice for those starting their journey is to pursue their dreams by following their intuition, their gut feeling and use their already-developed skills to make those dreams come true.



When I discovered that my intuitive talent was not something everyone possessed, it made me feel uncomfortable. I felt somewhat different, and my mom's wise and compassionate advice helped me through this phase. She told me that my psychic abilities are a natural part of life. Her advice was: “Use your gift, and it will strengthen, just like any muscle in your body. Neglect it and it will atrophy.”

Disinformation circulating online has been sowing confusion as the secretive conclave to elect the next pope kicks off in the Vatican on Wednesday.

The conclave follows the death of Pope Francis, an event which was also marred by a wave of disinformation. Considered one of the most progressive figures to have served as pope, the late pontiff was frequently targeted by false narratives, prompting him to denounce disinformation as “dangerous”, and a “tragedy” that “foments conflict.”

The closed-door conclave that begins on Wednesday will see 133 Cardinal electors isolate themselves within the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, with one round of voting expected to take place on Wednesday followed by four rounds each day before a cardinal receives the two-thirds majority needed to be elected pope.

The process will take as long as it needs to achieve the necessary majority, although the three most recent conclaves have all lasted less than three days.

Cardinals are sworn to secrecy about the voting process.

But the conclave has been tainted by a raft of false claims and conspiracy theories that have been circulating online in recent weeks.

Euroverify identified several unfounded claims that the pope had already been elected before the conclave had taken place.

As early as 21 April, a video emerged on YouTube – purporting to be a news report – claiming  that the Philippines' Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle had been selected.

The false report, first spotted by Filipino digital news media The Rappler, is headlined ""Breaking: Cardinal Tagle Elected As Pope Luis I.""

Cardinal Tagle is being tipped as one of the leading candidates to replace Pope Francis once the conclave has concluded.

The 67-year-old Filipino has decades of cardinal experience and is considered to belong to the ""moderate"" wing of the Catholic Church. He's also been dubbed by some as the ""Asian Francis"" due to his concern for the poor and the marginalised which came to distinguish Pope Francis.

Tagle has however faced criticism for what some consider his timid response to sexual abuse allegations against Catholic Church members and the the brutal crackdown in his native Phillippines at the hands of former president Rodrigo Duterte, now facing trial before the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Similar false claims purporting Cardinal Robert Sarah – considered a favourite among the most conservative of the vote-holding cardinals – has been elected pope have been circulating, mainly on Facebook and TikTok.

A Facebook post published by a bot-like account reads: “Breaking news: The new pope has just been announced.”

It's accompanied by an AI-generated photo showing Cardinal Sarah in the papal dress, against the backdrop of the Vatican. A reverse-image search shows there is no published evidence that Cardinal Sarah has ever worn the attire, and the photo is flagged as AI-manipulated by three AI detection tools consulted by Euroverify.

There is no truth to these claims. The papal seat has been vacant since Pope Francis' death, a period known as Sede Vacante, and will remain so until the conclave has concluded.

Another Cardinal considered a frontrunner to be the next pope, Italy's Pietro Parolin, has been targeted with a raft of false news reports about a decline in his health days before the conclave.

Italian outlets have tried to point the finger at US Catholic news site Catholicvote.org, which published the misleading report on 1 May citing “Italian media sources”.

But the news also featured in Italian sites such as Virgilio and Il Giornale, and were in turn amplified by journalists on social media.

A spokesperson for the Holy See Press Office flatly denied those claims during a press briefing last Friday, and the Press Office later released a statement saying that “during the meeting with journalists, the Director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni, refuted the hypothesis of Cardinal Pietro Parolin falling ill, specifying that no such incident had occurred. He also denied the involvement of medical or nursing staff.”

Analysts have long denounced how false rumours can discredit candidates in the run-up to a new appointment, with Pope Francis facing similar false reports about his health in the run-up to the 2013 conclave.

Cardinal Parolin – formerly Pope Francis' chief advisor – is being touted as one of the strongest papabiles, or candidates to be elected the next pope.

A doctored screenshot mimicking a Guardian op-ed titled ""The next pope must be Muslim or there will be violence on the streets of Europe"" has also been circulating online.

The op-ed is falsely attributed to journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. Both The Guardian and Alibhai-Brown have confirmed that they never published such an article.

A look at The Guardian's author page for Alibhai-Brown also shows that she hasn't written for the publication since 2016.

A closer look at the screenshot shows that the logo says ‘The Grauniad', a well-known colloquial name for the British newspaper, showing how it has been doctored.

The screenshot was first published by an X account named ‘The Grauniad Official', which consistently attributes false headlines to The Guardian.

October 24, 1998. Brooklyn, New York. 28-year old Kristine Kupka, who happens to be five months' pregnant, is seen leaving her residence alongside the father of her child, Darshanand “Rudy” Persaud. Kristine never returns, but even though Rudy claims that he took her to a shopping mall and dropped her off a few blocks from her home, his story cannot be corroborated. It turns out that Rudy was married to another woman and had asked Kristine to get an abortion for fear that the revelation about her pregnancy would ruin his life. Even though a cloud of suspicion surrounds Rudy, there is no evidence to implicate him in Kristine's disappearance and no trace of her is ever found. On this week's episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore a missing persons case involving a pregnant woman which has gone unsolved for over 26 years.

T. rex was previously suspected to have evolved in Asia and migrated to North America, but new research shows that the direct ancestors of this iconic dinosaur may have been the one to make the journey instead.

The famed Tyrannosaurus rex may have evolved in a very different location from its direct ancestors, new research finds.

The new study builds on earlier research, which suggested that T. rex's ancestors arose in Asia and migrated to North America when sea levels fell, providing a land bridge between the continents. The new study, published Wednesday (May 7) in the journal Royal Society Open Science, provides more evidence that T. rex originated in what is now North America — and this fearsome species' as-yet-undiscovered direct ancestors arose in Asia and migrated across the ancient Earth more than 70 million years ago.

T. rex lived between 67 to 66 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous period, and could grow to immense sizes — to 12.5 feet (3.8 meters) tall at the hips and up to 41 feet (12 m) long. Most T. rex fossils have been discovered in the U.S. states of Montana and South Dakota, as well as in Alberta, Canada — an area that was once an island continent known as Laramidia that extended through parts of what is now Alaska to Mexico.

T. rex evolved from smaller members of the tyrannosaurid lineage, and the location of where the species originated has long been a hot topic.

Because T. rex has a closer anatomical relationship with Asian tyrannosaurid dinosaurs than it does with North American tyrannosaurids, a 2016 study suggested that T. rex's ancestors likely emerged in Asia and migrated to North America. The new study supports this finding, and suggests that T. rex subsequently evolved in North America.

""The geographic origin of T. rex is the subject of fierce debate. Palaeontologists have been divided over whether its ancestor came from Asia or North America,"" study lead author Cassius Morrison, a doctoral student at University College London (UCL), said in a statement. ""Our modeling suggests the 'grandparents' of T. rex likely came to North America from Asia, crossing the Bering Strait between what is now Siberia and Alaska.""

The researchers used a model based on where and when various tyrannosaurid species had been discovered, their evolutionary trees, and local climate. They found that T. rex fossils are widely dispersed in Laramidia, and the ancestor of T. rex was present in both Asia and Laramidia, indicating that the T. rex's ancestor likely migrated from Asia to North America between the Late Campanian and the Early Maastrichtian ages, around 72 million years ago.

""This is in line with past research finding that the T. rex was more closely related to Asian cousins such as the Tarbosaurus than to North American relatives such as Daspletosaurus,"" Morrison said. ""Dozens of T. rex fossils have been unearthed in North America but our findings indicate that the fossils of T. rex's direct ancestor may lie undiscovered still in Asia.""

Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh and co-author of the 2016 study on T. rex's roots, called the new study a ""fine scholarly work.""

""T. rex was the quintessential American dinosaur: big, bold, ferocious, the ruler of western North America during the final years of the Cretaceous,"" Brusatte told Live Science in an email. ""But it was actually an immigrant. The most iconic American dinosaur was a migrant from Asia.""

The new study also modeled how tyrannosaurids (the group of dinosaurs that T. rex belongs to) and megaraptors (a cousin lineage to tyrannosaurids) grew to such gargantuan sizes. They found that megaraptors — which could grow to lengths of about 33 feet (10 m) — evolved their large size at around the same time as tyrannosaurids.



The researchers suggest that both groups rapidly evolved much larger body sizes than their ancestors following a global temperature peak 92 million years ago. This warming event, known as the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum (CTM), was caused by a spike in atmospheric CO2 and methane as a result of volcanic and tectonic activity, during which sea surface temperatures in some tropical regions may have reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).

After the CTM, atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and global temperatures fell. The researchers believe tyrannosaurids and megaraptors may have been able to survive and thrive better than other groups of dinosaurs. This is because other large species of dinosaurs went extinct due to the falling temperatures, leaving an open niche for tyrannosaurids and megaraptors to fill and grow to much greater sizes.

—T. rex was a deadly 'power-walker'

—'Bold theory' that Tyrannosaurus rex is 3 species gets stomped to pieces

—T. rex could have been 70% bigger than fossils suggest, new study shows

""Our findings have shined a light on how the largest tyrannosaurs appeared in North and South America during the Cretaceous and how and why they grew so large by the end of the age of dinosaurs,"" study co-author Charlie Scherer, a masters graduate from UCL who is soon to be a doctoral student, said in the statement.

""They likely grew to such gigantic sizes to replace the equally giant carcharodontosaurid theropods that went extinct about 90 million years ago,"" he added. ""This extinction likely removed the ecological barrier that prevented tyrannosaurs from growing to such sizes.""

The new study shows how the climate affected even the largest and most dominant dinosaurs, Brusatte said. ""It seems like tyrannosaurs were able to get big multiple times independently, when cooler climates promoted increases in size,"" Brusatte told Live Science. ""It was easier to be big when temperatures were cool. The kings of the dinosaurs were not predestined to rule, but were helped along by the climate.""

An Irish startup has created the world's first silicon-based quantum computer — it can still integrate seamlessly with classical computing in data centers.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A startup has launched the first quantum device in the world that blends the potential of quantum computing with the convenience and integration of traditional high-performance computing (HPC).

Equal1 representatives unveiled Bell-1 on March 16 — a new six-qubit machine that can fit seamlessly into existing HPC environments like data centers, company representatives said in a statement.

The machine tips the scale at slightly more than 440 pounds (200 kilograms) but it's rack-mountable — meaning it can be mounted onto a physical rack in a data center — and it's roughly the same size as existing graphics processing unit (GPU) servers.

Unlike other quantum computers, the Bell-1 doesn't require specialized infrastructure to deploy, and it doesn't need additional equipment to be cooled to near-absolute zero.

That's because it boasts its own self-contained, closed-cycle cryo cooling unit, which enables the system to operate at a remarkable 0.3 kelvin, or minus 459.13 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 272.85 degrees Celsius).

The machine makes use of the latest semiconductor fabrication techniques as well as purified silicon, which allows for a high level of control and long coherence times (a qubit's ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, which is crucial for quantum algorithms and computations).

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The Bell-1's qubits are silicon-based, meaning they're smaller than conventional qubits, and the chip at the heart of the machine incorporates quantum processor units (QPUs) with Arm CPUs — traditional processors known for their small size and efficiency — and neural processing units (NPUs) — specialized processors for accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).

Incorporating all these elements onto a single chip eliminates the complex orchestration that would otherwise be necessary between classical and quantum computing elements. As long as you've got the space in a rack, all it requires is a standard electrical outlet: plug it in and it's ready to work, Equal1 representatives said.



The company's chip, called the UnityQ 6-Qubit Quantum Processing System, utilizes spin qubits, in contrast to many quantum computing platforms that rely on either trapped-ion or superconducting qubits. Silicon-based spin qubits are compact, leading to potentially higher qubit density, and could leverage existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, meaning more scalability.

The chip fitted into the Bell-1 also incorporates error correction, control and readout, while taking advantage of existing semiconductor infrastructure for reliability and scalability.

—World's 1st modular quantum computer that can operate at room temperature goes online

—Quantum internet breakthrough after 'quantum data' transmitted through standard fiber optic cable for 1st time

—What is quantum computing?

Although this first generation of the chip includes six qubits, the company wants to make more powerful versions with a higher qubit count. The Bell-1 is also future-proof in that early adopters can upgrade existing systems as new models are rolled out, rather than replacing them with new machines, company representatives added.

The Bell-1 builds on advances first published by the company in December 2024, which established new peak performance marks for silicon qubit arrays as well as quantum controller chips.

These included the world's highest recorded single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelity (meaning fewer errors) and gate speed (meaning faster operations). The platform also utilizes a specialized, AI-powered error correction system developed in partnership with Arm.

In this article

Alphabet and Apple shares sank Wednesday after Eddy Cue, Apple's services chief, said he believes that AI search engines will eventually replace standard search engines such as Google, according to Bloomberg.

Cue said he expects to add artificial intelligence services from OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic as search options in Apple's Safari browser in the future, according to the report.

The Apple executive was testifying in a federal court in Washington as part of the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Google had illegally dominated advertising technology markets, and now the judge is looking to determine what penalties or actions should be taken against the search company.

One major focus on the case is Google's practice of paying platform providers such as Apple to become the default search engine on their platform.

The lawsuit and any potential remedies threaten Google's lucrative advertising business, and Alphabet shares sank more than 8% in trading Wednesday.

But the lawsuit also threatens to ensnare Apple. Google pays the iPhone maker billions of dollars per year — as much as $20 billion per year back in 2022, according to testimony in the trial — to be the default search engine on iPhones. It's lucrative for Apple and a valuable way for Google to get more search volume and users. Apple shares fell 2% during trading Wednesday.

Cue's comments cast doubt on the long-term stability of the relationship. Cue said he believes Google should remain the default search option on Safari, saying he has lost sleep over the possibility of losing the revenue share from the two companies' agreement, according to the report.

The Apple executive said searches on Safari declined for the first time in April, which Cue attributed to the rise in people using AI, according to the report.

Two men were injured after being attacked at a subway station in Bunkyo Ward, Tokyo, on Wednesday evening, according to police.

The victims, both apparently in their 20s, were attacked inside a train car at about 7 p.m. by a man wielding a knife at Todaimae Station on Tokyo Metro's Namboku Line. The 43-year-old suspected attacker was apprehended by passengers and arrested by police on suspicion of attempted murder.

Police said that both victims were conscious after the attack.

Services had been suspended between Ichigaya and Komagome stations shortly before 7 p.m. due to inspections of the train cars, according to the operator. Services on the entire line are expected to resume at around 9 p.m.

India has said it carried out strikes in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has vowed retribution over what it describes as an ""act of war."" DW has the latest.

Here are the latest developments from the tensions between India-Pakistan on Wednesday, May 7:

Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia in the Asia-Pacific Programme at Chatham House, told DW the situation between India and Pakistan is ""very precarious.""

""There is a very real risk of an accidental escalation,"" he said. ""The situation has escalated beyond what we saw back in 2016 and 2019, both in terms of India's actions and Pakistan's response.""

Despite this, there has been ""limited external pressure on either country to try and restrain their actions.""

Bajpaee said while the United States has played a significant role in the past to help mediate between the Asian neighbors, other countries, ""like the Gulf Arab states,"" could potentially be more involved this time around.

""The UAE in particular helped to broker a ceasefire along the Line of Control, which demarcates Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in 2021,"" he said.

Asked what influence neighboring China might have, Bajpaee said, ""China's position is far from neutral,"" saying that it is party to the dispute over Kashmir.

""China accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports over the last five years,"" he said. ""China has also resisted or blocked India's efforts to designate Pakistan-based terrorist organizations as global terrorists of the United Nations.""

US President Donald Trump expressed his willingness to help end the India-Pakistan hostilities. 

""I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will be there,"" he told reporters at the White House. 

""My position is, I get along with both. I know both very well and I want to see them work it out,"" he added.

In 2019, during Trump's first term, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo intervened when tensions increased between the neighboring Asian countries.

Pompeo wrote in his memoir, ""Never Give an Inch,"" that the India-Pakistan rivalry came close to turning into a nuclear war.

Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi, told DW that he does not foresee an all-out war between India and Pakistan.

""Both sides have emphasized they seek not to escalate the conflict and both sides are clearly committed to it, because neither side can afford an escalation,"" he said.

Sahni expected that Pakistan would respond to India's airstrikes in a symbolic manner. 

""It is important for them to be able to go back to their constituencies and tell them, 'We've done something great.' Reality will have very little to do with these claims,"" he said. 

As for India, he said its action was likely to show ""that lines have been redrawn, that provocations will not go entirely unpunished.""

Ultimately, Sahni believes both countries will seek to claim minor victories and then return to their usual state of relations.

Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani representative to the UN, spoke to DW about Pakistan's potential response to Indian strikes on Wednesday.

""Pakistan is concerned with re-establishing deterrence so that these attacks every three years or two years don't become the new normal,"" Lodhi said. ""The nature of how Pakistan will retaliate, the scope of its retaliation, we don't know. But certainly Pakistan is readying itself to launch a reprisal against India.""

India has said the sites it targeted were used by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, both of which are Islamist groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United Nations. India also blames Lashkar-e-Taiba for the Kashmir attack last month. Asked if attacks against such groups in Pakistan were understandable, Lodhi replied: ""It's understandable if you apply the law of the jungle, but it's not understandable if you want countries to adhere to and observe international law.

""India produced not a shred of evidence to show who carried out the attack, which of course we all condemned,"" Lodhi added. ""It was a terrible attack in Kashmir … but to act unilaterally, militarily, in a nuclear environment is, I think, extreme irresponsibility."" 

The Indian Embassy in China has dismissed as ""disinformation"" reports that Pakistan had shot down several Indian fighter jets.

The diplomatic mission was responding to a social media post on X by China's state-run Global Times, which said that Pakistan had downed the warplanes in response to Indian missile strikes on Pakistan.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has congratulated Pakistan's armed forces for their reported response to an overnight incursion by Indian fighter jets. 

Sharif said five Indian aircraft had been shot down after they released their payloads.

In a speech to parliament, he said the Pakistan Air Force had been on high alert since India had sought to implicate Pakistan in an April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.

He said that, while he had offered an international probe into the attack, New Delhi had not responded to the proposal.

Sharif also said that, on the night of April 29, Indian Rafale jets took off in a combat formation, but that Pakistan had successfully jammed their communications.

""The enemy couldn't even understand what had happened to them,"" and the jets turned back, Sharif said.

Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh has said New Delhi had exercised its ""right to respond"" in launching strikes in Pakistan to avenge the killings of innocent civilians on Indian soil last month.

""We killed only those who killed our innocents,"" Singh said at a public program.

""Our strike was well-planned and executed with precision and sensitiveness. It was restricted to terror targets and dismantling terror infrastructure,"" Singh added.

Islamabad has said six Pakistani locations had been targeted, and that none of them were Pakistani military sites. The Pakistani military says at least 26 civilians were killed and 46 wounded.

Former Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar says India has been unable to justify its pre-dawn strikes on Pakistani soil and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

Speaking to DW, Khar said the strikes were conducted ""on evidence or shreds of evidence"" that Pakistan had backed the April 22 attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.

The former minister said evidence of that has ""still not even been provided to Pakistan or to the international community.""

""India and Pakistan have obviously had this rivalry, and we do believe — and have very good evidence that has been provided to the United Nations Security Council — that India has its hands all over much of the Baloch insurgency and repeatedly finances terrorism in Pakistan,"" said Khar.

""For India to make a claim against Pakistan — maybe it's right. But for India to act on something without giving any evidence to Pakistan to solve this problem, if it even exists, or to the world to be able to convince — they think they have the impunity to be able to do what they will without any questions asked.""

France and Germany have said they are highly concerned by clashes between India and Pakistan as new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz met French President Emmanuel Macron.

Merz called for reason to prevail on both sides as he visited Paris on his first trip abroadsince taking office Tuesday.

""We are deeply worried by last night's clashes between these two nuclear powers,"" Merz said at a press conference, adding that ""now more than ever... reason and clear-headedness are required.""

The Pakistani government has authorized the military to ""undertake corresponding actions"" after India said it struck infrastructure used by militants in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Despite Pakistan telling its military to respond, Shamil Shams from DW's Asia desk says Islamabad might decide against any further escalation.

Shams said Pakistan may be satisfied with having shot down Indian jets, as its military is claiming, and that India might also seek no further confrontation.

""In my view, Pakistan has responded to the attacks by India in terms of what the Pakistani authorities are claiming — that they have shot down the jets and they have retaliated.""

""I think the Pakistani authorities have achieved this kind of propaganda, this narrative.""

""What India wanted to achieve, Prime Minister Modi's government, it has in a way achieved that.""

""A further escalation — that Pakistan goes out and attacks on Indian soil — would blow it out of proportion. I don't think Pakistani authorities would like to escalate further.""

The European Union has urged India and Pakistan to act immediately to de-escalate after the most serious military confrontation between the neighbors in two decades.

""We do urge both sides to show restraint and take immediate steps towards de-escalation,"" EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni told reporters.

""The EU recalls the need for a negotiated, agreed and lasting, peaceful solution to the conflict.""

Turkey has urged India and Pakistan to act with ""common sense"" amid the military escalation, with the Turkish Foreign Ministry saying India's latest military action created the risk of an ""all-out war.""

""We condemn this provocative initiative as well as the attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.""

Ankara urged both sides to ""refrain from unilateral actions"" and take the necessary steps to reduce tensions, ""including in the field of  counter-terrorism.""

In its statement, the ministry reiterated its support for Pakistan's call for a probe into the Islamist militant attack that killed 26 in the Indian-administered side of the Himalayan region on April 22.

Meanwhile, Iran voiced ""deep concern"" and called on both sides to ""exercise restraint.""

Iran, which borders Pakistan and enjoys good relations with India, had offered to mediate after last month's attack sparked the latest tensions.

The German government has voiced its concern about the escalating situation between South Asia's two nuclear-armed powers.

""Following the horrific terrorist attack in Kashmir and the Indian military response to it, responsible action from both countries is urgently needed,"" a Foreign Office statement said. 

""Escalation must be prevented and civilians protected. We are in contact with India and Pakistan. We continue to monitor the situation very closely.""

The Foreign Office said it would host a meeting of the government's crisis committee on Wednesday.

It also urged Germans in the region to follow government travel and safety advice.

The crisis has made for a dramatic start to the term of office of Germany's new Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, who was only sworn into office on Tuesday.

The Pakistani government has authorized the military to ""undertake corresponding actions"" after India's strikes.

""These unprovoked and unjustified attacks deliberately targeted the civilian areas, on the false pretext of presence of imaginary terrorist camps, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children, and causing damage to the civilian infrastructure, including mosques,"" an Information Ministry statement said.

""In consonance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Pakistan reserves the right to respond, in self-defense, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty.""

""The Armed Forces of Pakistan have duly been authorized to undertake corresponding actions in this regard,"" the ministry said.

Pakistan's National Security Committee said India had ""ignited an inferno in the region,"" and that responsibility for the ensuing consequences lies squarely with New Delhi.

The committee said the world must hold India ""accountable.""

In August 2019, India revoked Article 370 of its constitution, stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status to be ruled directly from New Delhi.

The move triggered a major escalation in tensions with Pakistan, which strongly opposed the decision and downgraded diplomatic ties. India deployed tens of thousands of additional troops, imposed curfews, shut down internet services, and detained local political leaders. The region was placed under a heavy security lockdown for months, drawing criticism from international human rights organizations.

Indian security forces carried out intensified counterinsurgency operations, resulting in the deaths of numerous suspected militants. However, these operations often led to civilian casualties.

India accused Pakistan of continuing to support militant infiltration across the Line of Control, which Pakistan denies.

A 2021 ceasefire brought temporary calm, but skirmishes and unrest resumed. China's border tensions and economic ties with Pakistan have added complexity to the dispute.

The region remained volatile, with delayed elections, restricted freedoms, and ongoing sporadic violence, even before the April 22 Pahalgam Attack sparked the latest crisis.

Families with mixed immigration status are being torn apart as Trump advances his mass deportation agenda.

To mark the first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a press release on April 30 titled “100 Days of Fighting Fake News.” At the top of the list, the Trump administration rails against the media for “FALSELY” — in all caps — reporting that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been deporting U.S. citizen children. “In both cases,” the release claims, “the mother made the determination to take her children with her back to Honduras.”

Over the past few weeks, as news broke that three U.S. citizen children — aged 2, 4 and 7 — were deported alongside their undocumented mothers, the Trump administration has held fast to this rebuttal. Yet attorneys for the two mothers, who were detained during routine immigration check-ins in New Orleans, Louisiana, say that the families were never given an opportunity to determine their own children's fate. The lawyers also report that the mothers were denied any contact with their legal representatives and family members before their deportation. One of the children, a 4-year-old boy undergoing treatment for a rare form of Stage 4 cancer, was sent to Honduras without his medications and now lacks access to the doctors managing his care.

“If it was truly a choice situation, then why forbid them from talking to their family members and attorneys?” Sirine Shebaya, the executive director of the National Immigration Project told PBS on April 28. “If this was a transparent situation … then there would have been no reason for immigration authorities to specifically prevent them, despite many outreaches, from being able to talk to their family members and their lawyer to actually make that choice. And it is a form of family separation.”

Most of us will remember when Trump's first administration came under fire for its so-called “zero tolerance” immigration policy, which mandated the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2017, the government began detaining and criminally charging adults who arrived in the U.S. without authorization, removing more than 5,000 children from their parents without an adequate system to track them. The administration claimed at the time that family separation was an unfortunate consequence of its policy of prosecuting people who cross the border without documentation — but later reporting revealed that the terror it wrought was in fact the goal.

Now, the Trump administration is insisting that its deportation of U.S. citizens is a way to avoid separating families — a rhetorical sleight of hand that casts the continued erosion of immigrants' rights as an act of compassion. In reality, the latest deportations are part of the same corrosive system that tore families apart eight years ago; the Trump administration has simply honed its marketing strategy.

Of course, basic facts of the case contradict the Trump administration's claim that ICE was just following the mothers' wishes. The father of the 2-year-old girl filed an emergency petition to keep her in the U.S., but she was nevertheless placed on a deportation flight before the courts opened. The administration's audacious disregard for due process sparked the federal judge overseeing the case to express a “strong suspicion” that the government had just done something “illegal and unconstitutional.”

The latest deportations are part of the same corrosive system that tore families apart eight years ago; the Trump administration has simply honed its marketing strategy.

“The government contends that this is all OK because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” wrote U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, a conservative Trump appointee. “But the court doesn't know that.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has deported at least one mother to Cuba who requested to take her U.S. citizen child with her. Lawyers told NBC News that Heidy Sánchez's 17-month-old daughter suffers from seizures and is still being breastfed. “They never gave me the option to take my daughter,” Sánchez said.

According to the American Immigration Council, more than 4 million U.S. citizens under the age of 18 have at least one undocumented parent. Numerous studies have found that the deportation and detention of family members can harm children's emotional wellbeing and put their physical health at risk. In the event that a parent is deported, the American Immigration Council notes that “ICE is supposed to ‘accommodate, to the extent practicable,' a detained parent's efforts to make guardianship or travel arrangements for the child prior to deportation” — accommodations that have now been ignored in at least three recent cases.

What's clear is that Trump's attempt to rapidly scale up a mass deportation machine shows little regard for human rights or due process. If the administration were truly interested in keeping families together, for instance, it would not have canceled the Family Case Management Program in 2017, which provided families seeking asylum with community-based support services as an alternative to detention. Rather than tear families apart, the short-lived pilot program allowed immigrants to stay within their communities while navigating immigration proceedings and supported them with crucial transportation, legal education and case management throughout the lengthy process.

And there's one more glaring omission in the Trump administration's “fact-checking” headlines: The deported mothers are not accused of any crime, beyond being undocumented.

What we're seeing is not a good-faith effort to keep families together. It's the continuation of a cruel regime that, just like the family separation policies of Trump's first term, seeks to sow fear among immigrant communities and uphold a white nationalist vision for the United States.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.
