                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Families with mixed immigration status are being torn apart as Trump advances his mass deportation agenda. Over the past few weeks, as news broke that three U.S. citizen children — aged 2, 4 and 7 — were deported alongside their undocumented mothers, the Trump administration has held fast to this rebuttal. Yet attorneys for the two mothers, who were detained during routine immigration check-ins in New Orleans, Louisiana, say that the families were never given an opportunity to determine their own children's fate. One of the children, a 4-year-old boy undergoing treatment for a rare form of Stage 4 cancer, was sent to Honduras without his medications and now lacks access to the doctors managing his care. “If it was truly a choice situation, then why forbid them from talking to their family members and attorneys?” Sirine Shebaya, the executive director of the National Immigration Project told PBS on April 28. Most of us will remember when Trump's first administration came under fire for its so-called “zero tolerance” immigration policy, which mandated the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2017, the government began detaining and criminally charging adults who arrived in the U.S. without authorization, removing more than 5,000 children from their parents without an adequate system to track them. Lawyers told NBC News that Heidy Sánchez's 17-month-old daughter suffers from seizures and is still being breastfed. “They never gave me the option to take my daughter,” Sánchez said. Numerous studies have found that the deportation and detention of family members can harm children's emotional wellbeing and put their physical health at risk. In the event that a parent is deported, the American Immigration Council notes that “ICE is supposed to ‘accommodate, to the extent practicable,' a detained parent's efforts to make guardianship or travel arrangements for the child prior to deportation” — accommodations that have now been ignored in at least three recent cases. What's clear is that Trump's attempt to rapidly scale up a mass deportation machine shows little regard for human rights or due process. If the administration were truly interested in keeping families together, for instance, it would not have canceled the Family Case Management Program in 2017, which provided families seeking asylum with community-based support services as an alternative to detention. Rather than tear families apart, the short-lived pilot program allowed immigrants to stay within their communities while navigating immigration proceedings and supported them with crucial transportation, legal education and case management throughout the lengthy process. And there's one more glaring omission in the Trump administration's “fact-checking” headlines: The deported mothers are not accused of any crime, beyond being undocumented. What we're seeing is not a good-faith effort to keep families together. At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Major escalation: India and Pakistan are on the brink of a wider conflict after India launched strikes on both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. According to a senior Indian defense source, shelling by Pakistan killed at least 12 people on the Indian side of the de facto border that divides Kashmir. • About the Kashmir dispute: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full and have fought three wars over the territory. Video also showed the Masjid-e- Markaz Taiba religious school in Muridke on fire after India's strike early Wednesday. We will contain this international confrontation to military targets only.” There were 57 flights in the air when India launched its attack on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Wednesday local time, Pakistan's military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. Chaudhry said the flights included planes from Middle Eastern and East Asian airlines. CNN corroborated that the images showed three diversions shortly after 1 a.m. local time on Wednesday morning. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the interim national security adviser, spoke to officials from both India and Pakistan yesterday evening. India is urging other countries, including the United States, to tell Pakistan to stop supporting terrorism, an official Indian government source said. The source indicated that what happens next is up to Pakistan and repeatedly emphasized that Indian strikes early Wednesday local time targeted “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and were designed to be measured and non-escalatory. The source described the strikes as a rightful response by India to last month's Kashmir tourist massacre — which New Delhi blamed on its neighbor but Islamabad denied. India had waited two weeks to see if Pakistan took “clear, demonstrable steps” in response to the attack, but no such steps were taken, the source said. Conversation with the US: Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also the interim national security adviser, spoke “at length” on a call, which took place shortly after the strikes began. He added: “It only took a few hours for the enemy to fall on its knees.” Pakistan claimed earlier Wednesday to have shot down five Indian Air Force jets in retaliation for Indian strikes, including three elite French-made Rafales. Since the April 22 terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 people — mostly Indian tourists — Pakistan has stressed its condemnation of terrorism and pushed back on Indian allegations that Pakistan was behind the massacre. The death toll in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir has risen to 31, with 57 injured, military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Wednesday night local time. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif joined other senior government and army officials attending the funeral ceremony of the son of Lt. Col. Zaheer Abbas Turi, who was killed in Dawarandi, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Following funeral prayers in Islamabad, the Pakistani prime minister condemned India's “deliberate targeting of civilians” as a “reprehensible act of cowardice,” the statement from Pakistan's armed forces said. The Indian military said that it targeted “terrorist infrastructure” across nine sites in Pakistan's densely populated Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It claims that no military sites were targeted in its strikes and that there had been no reports of civilian casualties. A high-ranking French intelligence official told CNN today that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan, in what would mark the first time that one of the sophisticated French-made warplanes has been lost in combat. The French official told CNN that French authorities were looking into whether more than one Rafale jets were shot down by Pakistan overnight. Pictures taken of parts of an aircraft that crashed in Indian-administered Kashmir show the label of a French manufacturer, but experts said it was not possible to say whether the part came from a Rafale aircraft. Some background: The Rafale is a 10-ton, twin-engine multirole fighter, equipped with a 30mm cannon for air combat and ground support, along with air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs, and cruise missiles. Before this latest escalation, India had 36 Rafale jets in its Air Force, purchased from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Pakistan's defense minister has warned that India's latest assault marked an “invitation to expand the conflict” between the two neighbors — but cautioned that Islamabad is “trying to avoid” a full-fledged war. New Delhi's deadly barrage on Punjab and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Wednesday was a “clear-cut violation,” according to Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif. “(India) crossed an international boundary,” Asif told CNN's Becky Anderson on Connect the World. “What happens next is we are prepared for an all-out war. “So… we can't be caught with our guards down.” Claims of downed jets: Pakistan's armed forces fired missiles and struck down five Indian fighter jets “in a dogfight,” according to the country's defense chief, who described the military's actions as a “befitting lesson” for New Delhi. When pressed for evidence, Asif cited social media video. “(India has) already admitted that three planes were downed,” Asif told CNN. Contrary to Asif's claims, India has not said that any of its planes have been shot down. This post has been updated with additional comments from Pakistan's defense minister. “Terrorists should know there's no place to hide from their heinous crimes against the innocent,” Reuven Azar wrote, adding “#OperationSindoor,” the Indian military's codename for their strikes on Pakistani targets. Unlike most international statements as India and Pakistan teeter on the edge of a wider conflict, the ambassador's post does not include a call for restraint or de-escalation. Some context: The two countries share deep military ties. India imports more weaponry from Israel than any other country, accounting for over a third of all Israeli arms exports, according to recent figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In India's capital, New Delhi, civilians who spoke with CNN had mixed feelings about the government's decision to carry out a series of overnight strikes on Pakistan. The Indian government said the strikes were carried out in response to an April terror attack in India-administered Kashmir that killed at least 25 Indian citizens. The war has started, but I want it to end soon, because it's important for all of us,” said Muskan Maurya, a 21-year-old graduate student. But some supported the government's actions, with 45-year-old Monika Lakra, an educator, telling CNN she was “very happy” that the government had taken action, giving “kudos to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” Maurya said she doesn't “hate the normal people of Pakistan. “It's a very big word to say hate, but I do hate the Government of Pakistan because they have known that these terrorists can have a very big impact on the normal likes of people in Kashmir, and they still allow them to stay there.” Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded his country's air force following a claim by military sources that it shot down five Indian fighter jets. The prime minister also told lawmakers that India used dozens of warplanes in its attack. Sharif did not elaborate on how Pakistan might respond to India's attack, after he earlier described it as an “act of war.” His office said the country's military had been “authorized to undertake corresponding actions in this regard,” according to an earlier statement. “A few days ago, India was proudly showing off its purchase of Rafale jets. But one shouldn't be too proud,” Sharif told lawmakers. “These jets flew from there in combat form, but our air force was also prepared.” There is no higher respect and honor than this,” he added. Earlier on Wednesday, Pakistani military sources said they brought down five Indian fighter jets and one drone in an act of “self-defense” — including three Rafale aircraft, which are highly sophisticated multi-role jets manufactured in France. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani spoke to top officials from both India and Pakistan today, holding a phone call with the Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and a separate call with Pakistan's Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, the Qatari foreign ministry said in two statements. For context: Doha has successfully acted as a mediator recently. Qatar was one of the actors mediating talks between Israel and Hamas that led to a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, played a role in discussions that led to the return of deported Ukrainian children from Russia, and facilitated the freeing of an American citizen who spent more than two years in detention in Afghanistan. Authorities across India are conducting civil defense security drills on Wednesday, hours after the country launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan. According to official statements posted on X, 244 locations will be included in the drills that will include the sounding of emergency sirens, evacuation procedures and blackouts. Several Gulf carriers have suspended flights to Pakistan, including Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways, with airport closures in northern India also affecting many flight routes. Emirates has canceled flights from Dubai to Sialkot, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar on Wednesday. Etihad said it had canceled flights to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad on Wednesday. “Additionally, some other services may be rerouted to avoid the affected airspace, potentially resulting in extended flight times,” Etihad Airways said in a statement. Qatar Airways said it had “temporarily suspended flights” to Pakistan, citing Pakistani airspace closure. “Due to the ongoing situation, airports in parts of northern India, including Dharamshala (DHM), Leh (IXL), Jammu (IXJ), Srinagar (SXR), and Amritsar (ATQ), are closed until further notice. Passengers are advised to plan their journey accordingly and check flight status,” SpiceJet said Wednesday morning. Access to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, has been restored in Pakistan as conflict breaks out with India. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has tasked his country's military to enact “self-defense” with “corresponding actions,” hours after India launched a barrage of deadly strikes early Wednesday, according to his office. Sharif called on Pakistan's Armed Forces to “avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives,” after an emergency National Security Commitee (NSC) meeting on Wednesday. India's military had struck sites in both Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, killing at least 26 people – including a 3-year-old girl – and wounding at least 46 other people. Militant gunmen killed more than two dozen people, mostly tourists, in the restive region of Jammu and Kashmir. Since then, both parties have leveled warring rhetoric, rupturing already fractious relations between the two neighbors and escalating fears of all-out fighting. A Pakistani militant chief targeted in India's overnight strikes said 10 of his relatives, including five children, had been killed by the attack. “The grief and shock are so much that they cannot be described.” The Indian military said it targeted “terrorist infrastructure” across nine sites in Pakistan's densely populated Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India claimed that no military sites were targeted in its strikes and that there had been no reports of civilian casualties. Pakistan, however, said Wednesday's strikes had harmed civilians and targeted mosques across six locations in its territory. While the US and the UN Security Council listed JeM as a terrorist organization in 2001, an effort to include its leader, Masood Azhar, as an “internationally designated terrorist” was vetoed by China. Videos shared to social media show the moment of impact as Indian airstrikes land inside Pakistan. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout breaks down what we know: India launched early-morning strikes on both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Wednesday, and Islamabad claimed it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets in “self-defense,” a major escalation between the rivaling neighbors. The strikes came more than two weeks after a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor — which Islamabad denied. Syed Asim Munir, a former spy chief who was appointed as Pakistan's army chief in 2022, will play a key role in determining how far conflict may escalate following India's strikes on Wednesday, analysts told CNN. Seen as a hardliner on India by critics, Munir is expected to face pressure at home after India's missile attack, which it said had struck “terrorist infrastructure,” and Islamabad said had killed at least eight people, including children. Munir's appointment came amid intense debate around the military's influence on public life. Pakistan's powerful military is often accused of meddling in the politics of a country that has experienced numerous coups and been ruled by generals for extended periods since it gained independence from Britain in 1947. “I think that for Pakistan not to retaliate somehow would undermine his (Munir's) credibility and his influence,” said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “For domestic political reasons and for… bureaucratic and organizational politics within the Pakistani military, I think that he will probably play a key role in deciding how Pakistan responds.” CNN Military Analyst Cedric Leighton said Munir joined “a long line of military leaders who have basically called the shots in Pakistani politics for a very long time.” He said Munir has viewed Pakistan's conflict with India through the lens of religion and treated the tensions as a national issue. “He is… running against a very strong Indian leadership that is seeing it from the opposite side, very much in the Hindu nationalist, Hindu nationalist point.” Indian shelling hit an intake structure on the Noseri Dam on the Neelum river in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, a Pakistani security source told CNN. CNN has contacted India's foreign and water ministries for comment. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chaired a high-level meeting with senior ministers from his cabinet. In video released by his office, Modi can be seen sitting alongside senior government figures including Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, Minister of Defense Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Modi has not spoken publicly since India launched strikes on neighboring Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday. India claimed that no military sites were targeted in its strikes and that there had been no reports of civilian casualties. Pakistan, however, said Wednesday's strikes had harmed civilians and targeted mosques across six locations in its territory. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has postponed a trip to visit to Croatia, The Netherlands and Norway, a senior government official told CNN. No official reason has been given for the delay, but the announcement comes hours after New Delhi launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Modi has not publicly spoken about the military action on India's neighbor. Residents of Pakistan-administered Kashmir say they were forced to flee their homes and take shelter after India launched missile strikes on its neighbor. I thought a transformer [had] burst, but later came to know that Indian troops started shelling and firing at us,” Raja Shahid Bashir, a resident of Shawai in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, told CNN. Another resident, Shakeel Butt, told CNN she had to flee when shells started falling on the village. India's military said it had struck nine “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan said it retaliated by shooting down five Indian Air Force jets and a drone. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned the Indian chargé d'affaires in Islamabad – the head of India's diplomatic mission in the country – to formally protest India's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. “Pakistan firmly rejected India's baseless justifications for its hostile conduct.” It called the strikes “unprovoked,” saying they had killed several civilians including women and children, and warned that India's military action posed a “serious threat” to peace in the region. India said its military strikes on Pakistan targeted Lashkar-e-Tayyiba “terrorist infrastructure” sites after Pakistan failed to act against the groups based in its territory behind a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. None of the three Indian officials who spoke at the briefing responded to a claim from Pakistan that it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets during India's attack. The officials showed a map marking locations of what they said were several Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed training camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and inside Pakistan's Punjab province. Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri again blamed Pakistan for the April attack on civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir and accused Islamabad of supporting “terrorism” in the disputed region. “Despite a fortnight having passed since the attacks, there has been no demonstrable step from Pakistan to take action against the terrorist infrastructure on its territory or on territory under its control.” The targets were selected based on “intelligence,” Misri said. Qureshi said no military installation was targeted in the operation and there had been no reports of civilian casualties in Pakistan. Heavily nationalist rhetoric has colored the coverage from many Indian news channels since New Delhi's strikes against Pakistan. “How India crushed the enemy,” flashed a headline on one news channel. One news organization carried an image depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding a Captain America-esque shield with the colors of the Indian national flag. On some channels, animations of military jets and explosions could be seen across screens as anchors covered “Operation Sindoor,” the official name of India's military attack on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Such jingoism is not uncommon for India's often loud and boisterous media, which has been accused of toeing the government line. Following the tourist massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir, many media outlets immediately called for blood. Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have ordered the evacuation of citizens from areas they deemed dangerous, as the conflict between New Delhi and Islamabad escalates. Accommodation, food and medicines will be provided for evacuated citizens, the Lieutenant Governor's office said on X. Pakistan said the attack killed at least eight people, including children. A key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is “proud of our armed forces” following the country's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. “#OperationSindoor is Bharat's response to the brutal killing of our innocent brothers in Pahalgam,” Home Minister Amit Shah wrote on X, using the Hindi name for India. Shah has been beside Modi's side for decades and is often referred to as the second most powerful person in India. Wednesday's strikes come more than two weeks after militants killed 26 civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir. New Delhi pinned the massacre on Pakistan, though Islamabad denied involvement. Bharat remains firmly committed to eradicating terrorism from its roots,” Shah added in his X post. China has expressed regret over India's military action against Pakistan and said it's concerned about the current developments. “India and Pakistan are neighbors that cannot be moved, and both are also China's neighbors,” a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said. As the conflict between Pakistan and India escalates, China has found itself in a diplomatic tight spot. For weeks, Beijing has been closely watching the tit-for-tat responses between its longtime “ironclad friend,” Islamabad, and New Delhi, a regional rival with which it has a long-running border dispute. The flare-up comes as China has been trying to improve relations with India as part of a broader diplomatic push to shore up ties with neighbors and trade partners alike to counter pressure from the Trump administration. China is Pakistan's main arms supplier, with Chinese arms making up 81 per cent of Pakistan's weapons imports in the past five years, according to data from Swedish think tank the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. On April 27 in a phone call with his counterpart, China's foreign minister Wang Yi expressed support for Pakistan and said China is closely following developments between the countries. The attack comes more than two weeks after militants massacred tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi blamed on its neighbor — and Islamabad denied. Pakistan said eight people were killed by India's attack in what the country's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described as “an act of war.” Pakistan also said it shot down five Indian Air Force jets and a drone. The label shows an aircraft part from French filtration company Le Bozec et Gautier. Le Bozec is a French-based subsidiary of Minnesota's Donaldson Company. A press release from Donaldson in 2005, when it acquired Le Bozec, says the French company “designs, manufactures and sells filtration equipment for the management of air, fuel, hydraulic fluid and air pressure on aircraft and helicopters.” Pakistan claims to have shot down three of India's top-of-the-line French-made Rafale fighter jets, but experts said it was not possible to say whether the part came from that aircraft, nor Pakistan's claims of shooting down the aircraft. Peter Layton, a senior fellow at Griffith Asia Institute and former Australian air force officer, said the part looked like it could be from a fuel tank, possibly an external drop tank. The Pakistan Air force also has French-made Mirage III and V jets, Layton added. Residents of Indian-administered Kashmir woke to the sounds of explosions and shelling after India launched cross-border strikes against its neighbor, with some hiding in fear and others cheering the strikes as long-overdue revenge. “We have been tense and anxious and glued to the television channels,” a 30-year-old civilian who lives near the city of Kupwara told CNN. This went on until 5:30 a.m.,” said the resident, who requested not to be named. India's strikes – on what it called “terrorist infrastructure” – come more than two weeks after militants killed 26 civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir. New Delhi pinned the massacre on Pakistan, though Islamabad denied those claims. Pakistan said it shot down five Indian Air Force jets in response. “There were cries of children, women and it was a desperate situation,” said the resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A 21-year-old student living in the village of Uroosa told CNN that “shelling was happening all night. Elsewhere in India-administered Kashmir, residents cheered news of India's attack, according to video footage by ANI. We rushed out of our homes in panic and saw it was on fire. Luckily no one was injured,” local resident Abdul Rashid told CNN. Photos published by AFP news agency showed aircraft wreckage lying in a field next to a red brick building in Wuyan, which CNN has also geolocated. Locals in Srinagar heard a loud explosion earlier on Wednesday around the time when India said it was conducting airstrikes against Pakistan. The name India chose for its military operation against Pakistan appears laden with religious symbolism. “Operation Sindoor” is a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage. April's massacre on civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir left several women widowed. “The world must show zero tolerance for terrorism,” India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar wrote on X. “Victory to India,” Defense Minister Rajnath Singh wrote in Hindi. Following India's strikes on what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said “the world must show zero tolerance for terrorism” in a post on X. The strikes Wednesday came more than two weeks after a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor. It's now morning in India and Pakistan and the region is on edge after New Delhi launched a military attack on its neighbor in the early hours of Wednesday. Commercial airlines are keeping almost entirely clear of Pakistani airspace, Flightradar24.com shows, after India launched strikes inside Pakistan in a major escalation between the two neighbors. Pakistani security sources claim three of the five Indian planes it downed were Rafale fighter jets — prized assets of the Indian Air Force that were only acquired several years ago as New Delhi looked to beef up its military. Before this latest escalation, India had 36 Rafale jets in its Air Force, purchased from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation. What to know about these jets: The jets come in one-seat or two-seat versions and can be armed with air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as a 30mm cannon, according to the manufacturer. Dassault Aviation also touts the Rafale's Flight Control System, which includes the ability for it to fly on autopilot in a terrain-following mode in all weather conditions. Flown by French forces, the Rafale has been used in operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria, according to Dassault Aviation's website. India and Pakistan, two neighbors with a long history of conflict, are in dangerous territory, analysts warn, with Islamabad vowing to retaliate against New Delhi's strikes and the risk of tit-for-tat responses spiraling into an all out war. The situation is now “obviously serious and fluid,” according to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University. “Retaliation to India's actions will likely now be inevitable.” India's decision to strike comes more than two weeks after 26 people, mostly Indian civilians, were massacred in an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the assault, a claim Pakistan denies. Pakistan said eight people were killed during India's Wednesday strikes, including children, in what the country's prime minister described as “an act of war.” Islamabad also claimed it shot down five Indian Air Force planes and a drone during the attack. While India's decision to strike Pakistan isn't unsurprising – analysts had been saying it was a matter of when, and not if – analysts fear we could see further escalations between the two nuclear-armed nations in the coming hours and days. India's strikes against Pakistan come more than two weeks of mounting pressure on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to forcefully retaliate against its neighbor after a tourist massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir. Last month militants stormed the mountainous and picturesque district of Pahalgam and killed 25 Indian tourists in the worst assault on Indian civilians in recent years. He governs a proud, nationalistic nation that believes in its ability to handle difficult situations. Following the massacre, India's loud and often jingoistic media immediately called for blood. “We want revenge” read a headline on one channel. “Bharat is battle ready,” read another, referring to India by its Sanskrit title. Analysts say it was only a matter of time before Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) responded with force. “Modi and his government believe it is imperative to respond to Pahalgam,” said Derek J. Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank. “Indians are very likely to support New Delhi's response – regardless of what it is, perhaps except for a nuclear response – because they believe Pakistan must be deterred in the future.” The chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab province has asked hospitals in the region to remain on alert and ordered schools to remain closed on Wednesday. She also said educational institutions in the province will remain closed on Wednesday. Sharif said Pakistan wanted peace but would become “a legion” if war was imposed. Three civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir were killed in shelling by Pakistani troops from across the border, according to the Indian Army. “Indian Army are responding in proportionate manner,” the statement said. Schools, colleges and educational institutions will be closed today across Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Rajouri and Poonch “in view of the prevailing situation,” according to Divisional Commissioner Jammu. Five Indian Air Force jets and one drone were shot down by Pakistan during India's attack, according to Pakistani security sources. In a statement released to reporters, the security sources said three French-made Rafale jets, one MiG-29 and one SU-30 fighter jets were downed “in self-defense.” An Indian Heron drone was also shot down, they added. A second senior Pakistani government official confirmed the same list of downed aircraft. Pakistani officials had earlier briefed that they shot down three aircraft and a drone. The United Arab Emirates is asking for India and Pakistan “to exercise restraint, de-escalate tensions, and avoid further escalation that could threaten regional and international peace,” according to a statement from UAE Deputy Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Eight people were killed, including children, and 35 injured, Pakistan's military spokesperson said after India launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan early Wednesday. India targeted six locations with 24 strikes in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said in a news conference early Wednesday. India has said nine sites in total were targeted. “No Pakistani civilian, economic or military targets have been hit. According to Pakistani sources, at least eight people were killed in Wednesday's operations, “including women and children.” Pakistani sources also said three Indian Air Force planes and a drone were shot down in locations “within Indian territory.” CNN cannot independently confirm the claims and has reached out to the Indian Ministry of Defence. The embassy statement said it was clear that “Pakistani-based terrorists” were responsible for last month's attack in Kashmir. The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India — Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India — both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory. After militants from Pakistan invade, he signs a letter acceding to India. Pakistan does not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control. 1965: India and Pakistan go to war again over Kashmir. 1999: India and Pakistan fight a limited border conflict in Kashmir, after armed invaders from Pakistan cross the Line of Control in the town of Kargil. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the April attack in Kashmir, and urged India and Pakistan to “avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control.” “Make no mistake: A military solution is no solution,” Guterres wrote in a post on X, noting that tensions between the two neighbors are “at their highest in years.” At least eight people were killed in India's strikes, Pakistan said. CNN's Elise Hammond, Aditi Sangal, Sophia Saifi, Rhea Mogul, Max Saltman, Avery Schmitz and Thomas Bordeaux and reporter Vedika Sud contributed reporting to this post. A third Indian aircraft has been shot down by Pakistan, Pakistani security and government sources have told CNN. A senior Pakistani intelligence source said three Indian jets were shot down in locations “within Indian territory,” as well as a drone. Pakistan on Wednesday said five locations were struck by India, three of them in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and two in Pakistan's Punjab province. The locations in Punjab are Ahmadpur East and Muridke. The last time India struck inside Pakistan's undisputed borders was in 2019, when Indian jets conducted airstrikes on several targets after it blamed Islamabad for a suicide car bomb attack that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in the region. Wednesday's strikes by India are the most significant military actions since 2019, when Indian jets conducted airstrikes on several targets inside Pakistan. India's Minister of Defense has publicly responded to the military operation launched against Pakistan. Senior India officials have spoken to their counterparts in a number of countries to brief them on the steps taken by New Delhi, a senior Indian government official told CNN. Pakistan's military claims it has shot down two Indian Air Force aircraft. “There are two confirmed aircraft of the Indian Air Force have already been shot down,” Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, spokesperson for the Pakistani military, told CNN's Jim Sciutto. “There are other reports of multiple damages that the Pakistani forces, both on ground and air, have inflicted. But I can confirm you at least two aircraft of Indian Air Force that have been downed,” he added. CNN cannot independently confirm Chaudhry's claims that Indian planes were shot down. We are reaching out to the Indian Ministry of Defence for comment. Bhatinda is a small town in the Indian state of Punjab that borders Pakistan and Akhnoor is located in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan issued a notice Tuesday night closing airspace around Lahore, in the country's north, and the coastal city of Karachi amid airstrikes from India. Citing the “changing airspace conditions in the region,” major Indian airline IndiGo reported impacted flights in and out of Jammu, Srinagar, Amritsar, Leh, Chandigarh, Dharamshala and Bikaner. SpiceJet, another airline, said some airports in northern India are closed “until further notice.” As tensions between India and Pakistan increased in recent weeks after an April mass shooting in the disputed Kashmir territory, numerous airlines have avoided flying over Pakistan, including Air France and Lufthansa. Relations between India and Pakistan have cratered in recent weeks following a deadly rampage by gunmen who murdered 26 people, the majority Indian tourists, at a scenic spot in Kashmir. Targets: India said nine sites in total were targeted. Casualties: At least three people were killed, Pakistan said. What India has said since: “Justice is Served,” the Indian Army wrote on X in a short statement, its first since the operation's launch. Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said the country “has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war imposed by India and a befitting reply is being given.” A military spokesperson said the country “will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing.” Flashpoint: Kashmir is one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints and is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety. Pakistan has called India's strikes an “unprovoked and blatant act of war” in a statement early Wednesday. “The Indian Air Force, while remaining within Indian airspace, has violated Pakistan's sovereignty using standoff weapons, targeting civilian population across international border in Muridke and Bahawalpur, and across Line of Control in Kotli and Muzaffarabad,” a statement from Pakistan's foreign ministry said. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.” India early Wednesday said it launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in a major escalation between the two neighbors. The attacks come more than two weeks after a massacre on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor — a claim Islamabad denies. Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said the country “has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war imposed by India and a befitting reply is being given.” “The enemy will never be allowed to succeed in his nefarious objectives.” Pakistani military sources told CNN that India's strikes hit five locations inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The locations are Kotli, Ahmadpur East, Muzaffarabad, Bagh, and Muridke. Wednesday's attacks are the first time since 2019 that India has conducted strikes inside Pakistan's territory, when Indian jets targeted multiple locations after it blamed Islamabad for a suicide car bomb attack that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in the region. That retaliation itself was particularly fraught because it was the first time India had struck inside Pakistan's undisputed borders since the two sides fought a war in 1971. United States President Donald Trump called India's confirmed military operation against Pakistan “a shame” and that he just learned of the news ahead of his Oval Office event Tuesday evening. I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past, they've been fighting for a long time, you know, they've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries,” the president said after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff. “I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said. The US State Department also said it is “closely monitoring developments,” according to a spokesperson Tuesday. “This remains an evolving situation, and we are closely monitoring developments.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with top officials from both countries last week as tensions rapidly escalated after a massacre in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told Geo News that “civilians were killed, including women and children” in India's military operation. “India is claiming it attacked terrorist camps; this is not true, international media can visit the places civilians were targeted,” Asif said in a statement. The Indian Army on Wednesday released its first public comments since India launched a military operation inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. “Justice is Served,” the Indian Army wrote on X in a short statement. But attacks on tourists in the picturesque Himalayan region are rare. Tensions between India Pakistan over Kashmir have surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked its constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. Here's what you need to know about the attack: At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national were killed in the massacre, which unfolded in a valley only accessible by foot or on horseback. Eyewitnesses described scenes of horror as the gunmen approached, opening fire on people from close range. Who claimed responsibility: Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media but it has reportedly since walked back that claim, according to multiple local media reports. India has not publicly blamed any group for the attack but has justified its retaliatory moves as a response to Pakistan's alleged “support for cross-border terrorism.” Some background: India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers. Three people, including a child, have been killed by Indian strikes in Pakistan, the country's military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Pakistani outlet Geo TV. Chaudhry also told Geo TV that mosques were targeted. “The attacks on mosques indicate [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and RSS's Hindutva mentality,” Chaudhry said referring to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates Hindu supremacy within India. Kashmir, one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints, is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety. India has accused Pakistan of being involved in the Pahalgam attack — a claim Islamabad denies. Pakistan has offered a neutral investigation into the incident. The massacre sparked immediate widespread anger in India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been under tremendous pressure to retaliate with force. In the days after the Pahalgam attack, both countries swiftly downgraded ties with each other and have been since been engaging in escalating tit-for-tat hostilities. India ordered its citizens to return from Pakistan, shut a major border crossing and suspended its involvement in a crucial water sharing treaty that has been in force since 1960. Pakistan suspended trade with India and expelled Indian diplomats. It said that that any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan would be considered an “act of war.” Both countries have also shut their airspace to each other. New Delhi and Islamabad had also been flexing their military might as tensions simmered along the LOC with small exchanges of fire across the demarcation in recent days. Both sides have also closed their air spaces to each other's airlines. Pakistan's military said India struck early Wednesday with missiles. “Pakistan will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing,” Pakistani military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Geo TV. Pakistani military sources told CNN five locations were struck at Kotli, Ahmadpur East, Muzaffarabad, Bagh, and Muridke. Three of those locations – Kotli, Muzaffarabad and Bagh – are in Pakistan-administred Kashmir. Ahmadpur East and Muridke are both in Pakistan's Punjab province. Multiple loud explosions have been heard in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, according to a CNN journalist. “Pakistan will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing,” Pakistani military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Geo TV. Prior to Wednesday's military operation, multiple major airlines were avoiding flying over Pakistan as relations with neighboring India crater. Air France told CNN it has suspended flying over the South Asian country until further notice because of the “recent evolution of tensions between India and Pakistan.” Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa also confirmed to Reuters that it was “avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice.” Both sides had already closed their airspaces to each other's aircraft since the attack, but the increased tensions are now impacting other international airlines and will likely cost them as they burn extra fuel taking longer routes. Flight-tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates traveling over the Arabian Sea and then turning north toward Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, Reuters reported. By the numbers, India's military would be seen as superior to Pakistan's in any conventional conflict. That budget supports an active-duty Indian force of almost 1.5 million personnel, compared to 660,000 for Pakistan. On the ground, India's 1.2 million-strong army has 3,750 main battle tanks and more than 10,000 artillery pieces, while Pakistan's tank force is only two-thirds of India's and Islamabad has fewer than half of the artillery pieces in New Delhi's arsenal. It also has only half the number of subs that India fields. Pakistan has added Chinese J-10 multirole jets, with more than 20 now in its fleet. Russian-made aircraft play a significant role in India's air fleet, with more than 100 MiG-29 fighters in service with the air force and navy combined, plus over 260 Su-30 ground attack jets. The rivals are closer in capabilities when it comes to nuclear forces, with around five dozen surface-to-surface launchers each, though Indian has longer-range ballistic missiles than Pakistan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Does Joe Biden blame his vice-president for losing the 2024 election to Donald Trump? Biden sat down with the BBC's Nick Robinson for his first full interview since leaving office. The 82-year-old ex-president was still able to speak pointedly about America's foreign policy, warning of the dangers of appeasing Russia and abandoning Nato. But when Robinson asked Biden about dropping out of his re-election bid in mid-2024, he got tongue-tied. Under fire now for starting a re-election campaign he couldn't complete, Biden contended that “I meant what I said when I started” in 2020 about heading a “transition government” where he would “hand this to the next generation”. Asked if he “regrets” not dropping out sooner to give someone else a bigger chance to beat Trump, he insisted that abandoning ship in mid-July was the right decision. Never mind that this happened only after Biden imploded in historic fashion on the debate stage, or that his party's elders then had to spend three weeks dragging him offstage against his will as his standing in the polls sagged. “Fully funded” is not very high praise for your hand-picked vice-president's attributes as a candidate. This is the point in the answer where a normal person would say one of three things: blame Harris and her campaign for blowing it, take some responsibility for leaving her a mess to clean up, or argue that events beyond either of their control took over. He just dropped the subject of Harris without even saying her name, abandoned any effort to explain what happened in the election, and lurched into a ramble about how it was hard to quit because he was just so successful: “What we had set out to do, no one thought we could do and become so successful in our agenda it was hard to say, ‘Now I'm gonna stop now. If he can't reflect at all on any of his failures, who does that leave to blame? He clearly knows that he can't point the finger openly at Harris without accusing himself of bad judgment for hiring her. But for a guy who had pledged to be a transitional figure, his stubborn insistence on clinging to the top of the ticket sent a loud enough message at the time that he didn't trust Harris with his legacy. Now, his insistence that things were just fine when she took over, coupled with his refusal to say anything more substantial in her favour than “she was fully funded,” speaks volumes in what is unsaid. When the Bidens have appeared in public with Harris, as they did at Jimmy Carter's funeral, commentators have noted the apparent venom between Jill Biden and Harris. For Joe, it seems easier to retreat into an imaginary world where he was undone by the magnitude of his own success. But even Joe Biden's fantasies aren't extravagant enough to pretend that Kamala Harris did a good job running for president. Dan McLaughlin is a senior writer at National Review.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused certain EU countries of resorting to "uncivilized" tactics to hinder international guests from traveling to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations. "In line with the campaign of intimidation of European leaders that has been unleashed by Brussels to please the Kiev regime and prevent them from traveling to Moscow, the most zealous EU members are using uncivilized methods, seeking to close transport routes leading to Russia," she said in a statement. "EU countries continue the practice of restricting the sovereign right of nations to carry out their own foreign policy, using all means at their disposal," Zakharova went on to say. She said the refusal of Lithuania and Latvia to allow the plane carrying Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to fly through their airspace represents "another egregious case" of that practice. "The behavior of the Lithuanian and Latvian authorities is unfortunately not surprising," she continued. "Vilnius and Riga have long reserved for themselves the role of a Russophobic outpost, ready for any wild antics just to spite Russia and anyone who refuses to follow the lead of EU bureaucrats acting as supervisors." "Malicious intrigues will remain fruitless in this case as well," the spokeswoman said. "No one can ruin our strategic partnership with Belgrade, the centuries-old friendship with the brotherly Serbian people." "Russia will celebrate the anniversary of the Great Victory with dignity, together with an impressive number of foreign guests who believe it is important to mark this sacred holiday among friends in no other place but Moscow." Russia views that not just as symbolic, but also as evidence of the "inviolability of historical truth."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney meets with U.S. President Donald Trump  in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, on May 6.Evan Vucci/The Canadian Press Dumping all your toys on the floor? Parents are instructed to intervene when actions could cause real harm, but to mostly let the other stuff go. So your toddler wants to make a mess of their dinner? Otherwise, every meal turns into a tantrum. I have no insight as to whether Prime Minister Mark Carney follows “@biglittlefeelings” or similar influencer parenting accounts on Instagram. But his conduct during his first public-facing meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday followed precisely what is prescribed by such accounts for dealing with highly irrational, emotionally volatile individuals who frequently test limits and insist on doing everything themselves: two-year-olds, in other words, or on rare occasions, American presidents. Mr. Carney spoke up when the President mused about Canada becoming the 51st state; you cannot let the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth talk openly about absorbing a sovereign nation any more than you can let a toddler try to cut her doll's hair with nail clippers. “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” Mr. Carney said to Mr. Trump. This is the geopolitical equivalent of saying, “Yes, it's fun to play hair-salon, but those clippers might give you or your doll a boo-boo.” Mr. Carney continued: “Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign, over the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale – ever.” And before Mr. Trump's face could turn red, Mr. Carney redirected the conversation; he noted Canada's investment in strengthening its border security, its commitment to its partnership with the U.S., and he ended with a little flattery: “And I'll say this as well, that the President has revitalized international security, revitalized NATO and us playing our full weight in NATO.” You made your doll look so pretty with all that marker on her face. Mr. Carney didn't correct Mr. Trump when he said that Canadians are “paying a tariff on cars and steel and aluminum,” though the economist in him was surely suffering a slow death behind his pursed lips. Mr. Carney looked at his lap when Mr. Trump referred to former finance minister Chrystia Freeland – whom he didn't directly name – as a “terrible person,” and offered only the slightest side nod when Mr. Trump turned to him and said, “You know who I'm talking about.” When Mr. Trump claimed that, “We don't do much business with Canada....They do a lot of business with us,” the Prime Minister waited about eight minutes to deliver a gentle fact check, noting that Canada is “the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods.” And though Mr. Carney's body language suggested he wanted to speak up when Mr. Trump claimed that the U.S. is “subsidizing Canada to the tune of maybe $200-billion a year,” the President shut down the event before he had a chance to chime in. Some might view Mr. Carney's restraint as a sign of weakness, but challenging Mr. Trump's every statement would have been a foolish, counterproductive thing to do. Indeed, it was much better for everyone that the Prime Minister picked his battles – interjecting when Mr. Trump said something harmful or dangerous, but letting the annoying stuff go. Otherwise, Canada might be dealing with an awful tantrum right about now. Though expectations for this meeting were low, Mr. Carney performed just about as well as Canada could've hoped for its new Prime Minister. He did exactly what he was elected to do, which is to act as the adult in what is really a very silly – but high-stakes – situation. We just might make it through to the next dinnertime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CIA, NSA and Defense Intelligence Agency all included in ‘collection emphasis message', report says The Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said on Wednesday that he was concerned about the report in the Wall Street Journal, telling the Ritzau news agency: “It worries me a lot, because we don't spy between friends.” Speaking on his way to a meeting in Warsaw, he added: “I can't know if it's true because it's in a newspaper. But it doesn't seem to be strongly rejected by those who speak out. Seasoned intelligence operatives say the Arctic island of about 56,000 inhabitants has not historically been a target of US espionage activity. The move will further alarm Denmark, a US ally and Nato member, which has repeatedly vowed that the island is not available for sale or annexation. Trump, who has mused since his first presidency about the possibility of possessing Greenland, refused to rule out seizing the 836,000 sq mile territory by force in an interview with NBC that was broadcast last weekend. But we need that for international security.” The comments renewed a vow the president made in an address to a joint session of Congress in March, when he said: “One way or the other, we're going to get it.” Gabbard issued a statement saying the newspaper “should be ashamed of aiding deep state actors who seek to undermine the president by politicizing and leaking classified information”. Denmark's embassy in Washington has not commented. The intelligence messages follows a visit to Greenland in March by Vice-President JD Vance, the then national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Chris Wright, the energy secretary, that was fiercely condemned by Danish leaders and local Greenland politicians. Mette Frederiksen, Denmark's prime minister, said the visit put “completely unacceptable pressure completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine suggested creating a demilitarized zone jointly controlled by Kyiv and Moscow, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg said in a Fox News interview on May 6. Kellogg described the proposal as a buffer zone with both sides pulling back 15 kilometers, creating a 30-kilometer area monitored by observers from third countries. He said the arrangement could accompany a ceasefire "in place," meaning both sides would maintain control of the territory they currently occupy. The proposal contrasts with Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands, which require Ukrainian forces to withdraw from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Russia claimed to annex the four regions during its full-scale invasion in 2022, but it does not fully control any of them. The one man who can deliver it, I believe, is President (Donald) Trump, as long as Putin agrees. And that's one of our, probably our, impediments to progress — the president of Russia right now not agreeing to it," Kellogg said. Responding to Kellogg's statement, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow has not received any proposals from Kyiv regarding the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the front line, Russian state news agency TASS reported. And I don't think they will," Kellogg added. Since taking office in January 2025, Trump has not approved any new U.S. military aid for Ukraine. His campaign pledge to end the war within 24 hours has failed to yield results after more than 100 days in office. Despite frustration with Moscow's refusal to de-escalate, the Trump administration has not imposed new sanctions or taken other steps to pressure the Kremlin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump previously warned that the U.S. would withdraw from mediation efforts if talks stalled.</p>

In an interview with Beata Lubecka on Radio ZET, Wałęsa expressed his belief that Trzaskowski is the best option for Poland, suited for the current political climate.

Wałęsa praised the candidate's strong understanding of foreign policy and commitment to fostering cooperation. He believes Trzaskowski possesses all the necessary qualities for a head of state to effectively represent Poland on the international stage.

The former president also expressed concerns about the potential for Trzaskowski's rivals to resort to dishonest tactics and urged caution as the campaign heads into its final days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By Air Marshal Anil Chopra (Retired), an Indian Air Force veteran fighter test pilot and is the former Director-General of the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi. By Air Marshal Anil Chopra (Retired), an Indian Air Force veteran fighter test pilot and is the former Director-General of the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi. New Delhi stated that it hit at least nine targets. “Our actions have been focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in the selection of targets and method of execution,” the Indian government said in a statement. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif descried the strikes as a “cowardly” attack and said Islamabad "has every right to respond forcefully to this act of war imposed by India, and a forceful response is being given." Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated to military actions following the killing of 26 innocent vacationers in Pahalgam, Kashmir by Pakistan-backed terrorists in a Hamas-style terror attack. Pakistan Army and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) links were established by India's National Investigation Agency days after the mass killing. The public was angry, and sought appropriate revenge. A wide range of diplomatic and economic measures were announced by both nations following the attack. Rejecting India's move to suspend the IWT, Pakistan warned that any diversion of water will be treated as an ‘Act of War.' Islamabad also said that it would hold “in abeyance” its participation in all bilateral agreements with India, including the landmark 1972 Simla Agreement. Pakistan pledged a full-spectrum national power response to any threat against its sovereignty, put its armed forces on high alert, and began selective mobilisation. But by suspending the Shimla Agreement, Pakistan unwittingly handed over  big advantage to India. The Shimla agreement between India and Pakistan was signed on July 2, 1972 at Barnes Court (Raj Bhavan) in the town of Shimla in the Indian state of  Himachal Pradesh, between then-Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her Pakistani counterpart Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. It was ratified on July 15, 1972 (by Pakistan), and August 3, 1972 (by India), and became effective the next day. It was decided that the two countries are resolved “to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed upon between them.” New Delhi succeeded in persuading Islamabad to change the name of the ceasefire line to the Line of Control (LoC), thus delinking it from the UN-imposed 1949 ceasefire line and highlighting that Kashmir was now a purely bilateral matter between India and Pakistan. Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations. India returned around 13,000 square kilometers of land taken in battle on the western border but retained some strategic areas, including Turtuk, Dhothang, Tyakshi, and Chalunka in Chorbat Valley, covering more than 883 square kilometers, so as to facilitate lasting peace. The fact that there has only been one limited war since the agreement was signed reflects its effectiveness. Some Indian bureaucrats later argued that a tacit agreement to convert this LoC into a international border, was reached during a one-on-one meeting between the two heads of government. Pakistani bureaucrats have denied any such thing. Nor was that acceptable to Indian public. The Shimla agreement called on both sides to resolve all issues bilaterally. But Pakistan never respected this part of the treaty, and has taken matters to an international level, especially by doing chest-beating over Kashmir at the UN. One critical clause was that “both shall prevent the organisation, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious relations.” Pakistan has been engaging in cross-border terrorism as a foreign policy tool to bleed India and to foster separatism in Kashmir, as well as to keep the Indian Armed Forces pinned down. Islamabad believes that by suspending the treaty it can once again take all issues to the UN or other bodies and invite third parties to intervene in the India-Pakistan disputes. It will be possible for either side to unilaterally take advantage and try violate it to gain ground. Pakistan tried to breach the LoC in 1999, resulting in the Kargil War, where Pakistanis were not only thrown out but also faced a humiliating defeat and very high casualties. Earlier, in 1984, Pakistan attempted to take control of the Siachen Glacier, an Indian territory demarcated by the Karachi agreement. With the suspension of the Simla Agreement, New Delhi is free to use military options without violating any treaty. India could regain territory in critical sectors, especially gains like the Haji Peer Pass, that it had earlier frittered under international pressure. There are other sectors where India can create greater buffer zones to reduce threats to the Srinagar-Leh highway. India can now use the leverage it has over major powers to isolate Pakistan. The prerequisites for reconciliation, good neighborliness and durable peace between the two, has been breached repeatedly by Pakistan sponsored terrorism. They were expected to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of each other, this too has been violated. Pakistan's army has repeatedly vowed to avenge the humiliating defeat and surrender of 93,000 able-bodied soldiers, “throwing peace into the wind.” It may not have immediate tactical consequences, but could open the door to greater diplomatic and military brinkmanship. Revival of hostilities or border instability could derail developmental and democratic consolidation efforts in J&K's post-Article 370 abrogation. The escalation conflict between two nuclear-armed states have already raised alarms in the international community, prompting calls for restraint and dialogue. The suspension of the Simla Agreement has provided India with an opportunity to recalibrate its security and diplomatic strategies. By disregarding the Simla Agreement, Pakistan has done a great favour to India and Prime Minister Modi to reclaim Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, something that the entire political class of India would support. The extent of armed conflict will be graded. It is time to wait and watch as things unfold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A legal watchdog group founded by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has filed a lawsuit against Supreme Court Justice John Roberts and former District Judge Robert Conrad over their alleged refusal to honor Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Chief Justice Roberts heads the Judicial Conference, and Judge Conrad is director of the Administrative Office. Both are being sued in their official capacity as leaders of these organizations. The Judicial Conference is a group of committees that meets twice a year to make policy for the federal court system; it is always headed by the sitting Chief Justice. America First said in court documents that Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) consulted with these two groups in an attempt to implicate Justices Thomas and Alito of ethics violations. In July 2024, Whitehouse asked then-Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate Justice Thomas for a string of other violations going back to 1991, including tax fraud and failing to disclose gifts like sports tickets and air travel. Previous inquiries had already cleared Thomas of any willful wrongdoing. America First asserts that since the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office cooperated in these Congressional oversight maneuvers, which “are the province of the executive branch,” they are executive agencies, and subject to FOIA transparency. America First submitted FOIA requests to the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office in July 2024, asking for all records relating to Justices Thomas and Alito, and any communications with Sen. Sheldon, Rep. Johnson, or their staff since April 2023. Even if the Administrative Office were subject to FOIA, the requested records “would not be releasable,” as those specific documents are exempt from FOIA requests, the Supreme Court's attorney said.</p>
