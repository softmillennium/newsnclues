                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new drama will feature Luke Grimes reprising his role as Kayce Dutton, who joins an elite unit of U.S. The official logline has Kayce “combining his skills as a cowboy and Navy SEAL to bring range justice to Montana, where he and his teammates must balance family, duty and the high psychological cost that comes with serving as the last line of defense in the region's war on violence.” CBS 2025-26 Schedule: 'FBI' Block On Monday, 'NCIS' Tuesday, Donnie Wahlberg Back In 'Blue Bloods' Slot As Part Of Bruckheimer Friday As 'After Midnight' Comes To End, CBS Boss George Cheeks Admits Late-Night Is A "Challenge" Deadline first wrote in March that Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone universe was eying further expansion beyond Paramount Network and Paramount+, and that the potential offshoot would air on sibling CBS. Sources said showrunner Spencer Hudnut had been working on ideas for over a year for the spinoff while it went through the approval process with Sheridan and getting a commitment from Grimes. Y: Marshals joins another Yellowstone spinoff series, headlined by Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser, which was announced last December. Y: Marshals will be produced by MTV Entertainment Studios with Sheridan along with David C. Glasser executive producing for 101 Studios as well as John Linson, Art Linson, Hudnut, Luke Grimes, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin and Bob Yari. The series will be distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.When asked whether the Yellowstone sequel will look and feel as expensive as the mother ship on Paramount Network, CBS President Amy Reisenbach said “we don't do cheap.” “Spencer Hudnut had run a broadcast show before,” Reisenbach said of the former SEAL Team showrunner. As for Sheridan's involvement, Reisenbach said, “we're still early in the process. The sale is conditional: the sprawling land can never be developed, and Kayce, wife Monica (Kelsey Asbille) and son Tate (Brecken Merrill) will stay on a small parcel where they've built a house and would remain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first time Reba McEntire heard “Trailblazer,” she cried. So did Lainey Wilson and Miranda Lambert as they wrote it. The star trio are debuting the emotional, mid-tempo ballad about thanking those who came before them — and lifting up those who come after — at the ACM Awards tomorrow (May 8). The song will be available on all streaming services at 8 p.m. E.T. Wilson and Lambert wrote the song with Brandy Clark on Lambert's back porch, specifically as a song that the pair and McEntire could sing together. “We were like, ‘OK, we're going to do a song with Reba — what kind of song do we write?” recalls Lambert on Wednesday after rehearsals at The Star in Frisco, Texas, in the only interview the three artists are doing together. “We were calling her on the set [of sitcom Happy's Place] and trying to figure out, ‘What's the right message for this trio? What do we really want to say in three minutes? “We were just having a conversation about how both [Lambert and McEntire] have influenced me and [about] passing the torch and blazing trails for each other,” says Wilson, who came up with the title. “Generation after generation, it's going to continue, but we got to keep blazing those trails for the next one.” It was also important to drop some Easter eggs into the song that tied back to each artist. For example, the lyrics include “Kerosene,” the title of one of Lambert's biggest hits, and also talk about being from Louisiana, Wilson's home state, and Oklahoma, where McEntire grew up. But they still needed to keep the song's appeal universal and beyond music. “And not just about the history of country music… If we're not thinking about the people that we're singing to then they're not going to be able to relate.” The song came together quickly and felt, Wilson says, divinely inspired. “When you're writing a song and you get that like feeling, it's like the Holy Spirit feeling. And you just feel it all over your body. “I remember listening to it in the dressing room. I was very emotional when I heard it.” The three recorded it together in Nashville with McEntire and her longtime producer Tony Brown co-producing. “We can't tell you what's in it,” Lambert says. Their relationship exists in a way that McEntire says couldn't have when she was coming up, in part because of technology. “There's something different totally in these generations than the earlier generations, mainly because of the social aspect,” McEntire says. And I like it that things are more approachable. When I was getting started, I wouldn't have even thought about talking to Dolly when she walked by me in 1977. And I don't know if it's confidence that's totally different, but I had [my musical heroes] all up on this pedestal where you can't touch, you can't talk. Now, we're more friends and it's a family. If somebody needs something, the others come in to help. A lot of people think it's backstabbing and so competitive. There's enough room in this business — and all businesses — for everybody to be successful. We've just got to help each other and share what we've gone through and say what didn't work. There's a line in the song about paying tribute to those who “gave me a seat at the table.” “One of the very first people to give me a seat at the table was that one right over there,” Wilson says, looking at Lambert. I think a lot of times people like to pit women against each other, and I think we're just proving otherwise.” That group text isn't all about jokes: It provides a tremendous support system. “I remember at the end of one of my long Vegas runs, I texted you,” Lambert says also looking at McEntire. When they sing “Trailblazer” tomorrow on the ACM Awards, they will be singing it for more than themselves. “It's about what the song means to little girls out there watching, or anyone out there watching that really has a dream or needs to be surrounded by people they love, and needs a little nudge to know they're not alone.” When asked if “Trailblazer” is their last collaboration, McEntire says “No, ma'am” before the question is even finished.

One of IndieWire's Best Queer Films of the 21st Century was Lucio Castro‘s “End of the Century” from 2019, a slightly surreal will-they, did-they, won't-they gay romance set in Barcelona. His follow-up film “After His Death,” about a woman (Mia Maestro) in freefall after an affair with an enigmatic musician (Lee Pace) who appears to quite literally have a cult following, premiered at the Berlinale and took Argentine writer/director Castro briefly out of the queer cinematic space. But he's back with another gay quasi-romance, this time in New York City, with “Drunken Noodles,” which feels like Apichatpong Weerasethakul directing an early '80s New Queer Cinema indie. It has a lo-fi, shot-on-film aesthetic mixed with mystical elements, and it's premiering in the Cannes Film Festival ACID parallel section later this month. (Standing for Association du Cinéma Indépendant pour sa Diffusion, ACID is dedicated to elevating indie filmmakers.) Here, the mind-bending elements of “End of the Century” take on fuller force (and in a film that is not to mention quite sexy). Related Stories ‘Fight or Flight' Review: A Pajama-Clad Josh Hartnett Fends Off a Plane Full of Assassins Film Independent's Sloan Film Summit Returns for 2025 with ‘Magma' and ‘Love Me' “Drunken Noodles” takes place over two summers, in both the city streets and the forest paths of upstate New York, as art student Adnan (Laith Khalifeh) has a series of unexpected, intimate, and even otherworldly, time-and-space-warping encounters. Here's the official synopsis: “Adnan, a young art student, arrives in New York City to flat-sit for the summer. As moments from his past and present begin to intertwine, a series of encounters – both artistic and erotic – open cracks in his everyday reality.” “In the summer of 2021, a friend introduced me to the work of Sal Salandra, an artist in his late 70s who had recently begun creating explicit sexual tableaux in needlepoint — a craft typically reserved for gentler themes, like kittens playing with balls of yarn,” Castro said as to the film's origins in a press statement. “I was instantly captivated and went to interview Sal at his Long Island home, thinking I might make a documentary. However, I left feeling that what drew me to his work remained out of reach. I realized that what I wanted to explore couldn't be articulated in a documentary, it had to be done through fiction.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Ferris Bueller's Day Off stars Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are negotiating to reunite in The Best Is Yet To Come, a comedy that Allan Loeb scripted and Jon Turteltaub will direct. Amy Baer is producing through her Gidden Media banner, and the executive producer is Dimitri Rassam, who produced the 2019 original through his company Chapter 2. Last time Broderick and Ruck held the screen together, the latter played a disillusioned son of a wealthy man, a dad who seemed to prize his 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder more than his son. That lead the kid to launch the classic car out a glass window, a dilemma even his best pal Ferris is hard pressed to fix. Here, they will take another road trip. Matthew Broderick, Sally Hawkins & Martin Freeman Set For Simon Bird Comedy 'Pretend I'm Not Here' They play best friends who, through a colossal misunderstanding that creates a ticking clock, hop in a car to find the estranged son of one of them and also try to do all the things that life has prevented them from doing. The original was directed by Alexandre de La Patelliere and Matthieu Delaporte. Broderick and Ruck (Succession) have stayed friends since first starring in the John Hughes 1986 touchstone comedy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early in the pandemic, at-home fitness companies like Peloton led a music licensing boom. But after people returned to normal life, licensing went in a different direction. Peloton's founder, John Foley, had created an online version of music-driven, brick-and-mortar studios such as SoulCycle. Other startups took notice, with competitors like Tonal and Hydrow vying for market share. “There were fitness companies who saw what Peloton was doing, which was really putting music at the center of their workouts,” says Vickie Nauman, a licensing expert and founder/CEO of CrossBorderWorks. Instructors, some of whom would become small-time celebrities, used music to create identities and build communities. Flush with investment capital, fitness companies followed Peloton into expensive licensing agreements with rights holders to infuse music into their at-home products. Royalties from connected fitness companies, as well as social media and other new revenue streams, went from about 3% of the average catalog's revenue in 2021 to “something like 7%” in 2023, according to Jake Devries, a director in Citrin Cooperman's music and entertainment valuation services practice. The financial impact of the post-pandemic fitness bubble was seen in Universal Music Group's results for the fourth quarter of 2024: A decline in its fitness business accounted for a nearly one percentage-point decline in its subscription growth rate, equal to approximately $12.5 million. As a result, according to numerous people who spoke with Billboard, connected fitness companies had less cash to put into music licensing and, realizing they didn't need massive catalogs and didn't have the expertise to properly manage the rights and issue royalty payments, looked for more affordable, less arduous options. Its studio-quality bikes, which currently cost between $1,445 and $2,495, are outfitted with touchscreens that stream live and on-demand content for an additional $44 per month. Music is a focal point for the online classes, just as brick-and-mortar studios like SoulCycle incorporate popular songs into their workouts. But building cycle workouts around setlists of specific songs isn't straightforward. Unlike brick-and-mortar locations that require only blanket licenses from performance rights organizations such as ASCAP and BMI, Peloton required more expensive direct licenses to incorporate music into its streaming content. Such a license had never been done for a fitness company, so major labels and publishers modeled custom licenses for Peloton based on their deals with Spotify and other on-demand music platforms, according to a licensing executive familiar with the negotiations. The agreements called for Peloton to pay rights holders based on a monthly per-subscriber fee, and the pool of royalties would then be proportionally divided based on usage, according to this person. As people stayed away from public places such as gyms and fitness studios, Peloton's revenue jumped from $384 million in fiscal 2019 to $1.45 billion two years later, and its share price climbed from $27 following its September 2019 initial public offering to $171 in January 2021. The enthusiasm for at-home fitness also benefited Peloton's competitors. Tonal, a connected strength training platform, had raised a total of $90 million by 2019, before the pandemic piqued interest, then raised $110 million in September 2020 and $380 million in two funding rounds in 2021 and 2023 — the latter at a lower valuation. As other connected fitness companies quickly sought music licenses to replicate Peloton's success, rights holders offered them a version of the Peloton license, which provided them rights to large catalogs. (Peloton, the lone publicly traded company of the bunch, revealed in its 2021 annual report that it had a catalog of 2.6 million tracks.) But these fitness startups, desperate to corner share in a fast-growing market, initially made some missteps. “Because it was such a race, I think that many online fitness companies saw this as an existential opportunity, and they did not take the time to investigate what they were getting into,” says Nauman. “And so, they licensed all of this music, and that sent a signal to rights holders all over the world that fitness was going to be an enormous new line of business.” An app-based product would likely pay 30% of revenue to music rights holders, according to this person, while hardware-based products with higher overhead and costs would pay approximately 16% of revenue. The Peloton-style sync licenses also came with more complexity than fitness companies could handle. Managing a music catalog requires technology and know-how that fitness companies don't have. They needed help matching compositions to sound recordings to ensure licenses were acquired from all rights holders, and the reporting required for PROs and making direct payments to record labels and publishers were outside of the fitness companies' expertise. As fitness companies dealt with stagnant growth, they laid off staff and tightened their budgets. From February 2022 to May 2024, founder/CEOs at Peloton, Tonal and Hydrow were forced out. When Peloton replaced Foley with former Spotify CFO Barry McCarthy in February 2022 and announced plans to lay off 20% of its corporate staff, its share price was trading under $30, down more than 82% from its high mark just 13 months earlier. Sync licenses are crucial to Peloton because classes are often built around playlists, and music is crucial to the indoor cycling experience. For many other companies, a non-interactive, DMCA-compliant radio service with pre-cleared music is more than adequate. Constrained by tighter budgets, some connected fitness companies started looking for alternatives to their original licenses. Being able to use popular music in their apps isn't a priority. Feed.fm assures clients that the rights are compatible with various laws in different countries. It provides pre-cleared catalogs from Warner Music Group, Insomniac Music Group and A Train Entertainment, and it works with record labels to create thematic stations, including one curated by CYRIL, a recording artist for Warner-owned Spinnin' Records, and a Brat-inspired station featuring Charlie xcx, Dua Lipa, Chappell Roan and other artists that represent the brat summer of 2024. A rights holder itself, Feed.fm has signed 40 to 50 artists, which its vp of music affairs, Bryn Boughton, says gives it greater flexibility in licensing. Outsourcing the licensing ultimately saves fitness companies money, says Con Raso, co-founder/managing director of Australia-based Tuned Global. Raso estimates that Tuned Global can remove 70% of clients' costs versus licensing music and managing rights themselves. In the last six months, Raso has seen an uptick in demand for licensed music from companies more broadly associated with health and medical care. Consumers have a wide choice of apps for yoga, meditation, mindfulness and sleeping that incorporate music. Led by companies such as Calm, the market for spiritual wellness apps hit $2.16 billion in 2024, according to Researchandmarkets.com, and will grow nearly 15% annually to $4.84 billion by 2030. Universal Music Group, for example, formed a partnership in 2021 with MedRhythms, which uses software and music to restore functions lost to neurological disease or injury. “I don't think it's anybody's fault,” she says. “I think it was such a lightning-in-a-bottle time that they were in a race to get to market as fast as they possibly could.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, as Donald Trump attacks allies, tears down democratic institutions and cozies up to dictators, U.S. exceptionalism is a hard sell onscreen. From postwar liberation to Cold War supremacy, U.S. soft power has never been more potent than when projected onto a movie screen. “The Trump administration has initiated a shock and awe campaign — only this time, against our allies. “Allies are stunned, confused and much more wary of us today — and that is likely to translate into how their euros or yen are spent in their downtime. In its most recent quarterly survey, published March 4, research firm YouGov found that opinion of the U.S. in Europe since Trump's election had plummeted to its lowest level on record — and this was before the president's “Liberation Day” tariffs escalated aggression toward the bloc's economies. “Historically, Hollywood has played a double role in U.S. soft power: It gave the country global relevance as a source of popular culture that was attractive in its own right, and it also presented an attractive ethical system and way of life that was distinct from that experienced elsewhere,” says Nicholas Cull, a professor of public diplomacy at USC's Annenberg School. Notes a veteran European producer, “Most Europeans grew up on these images of the heroic cowboy or American soldier coming to the rescue, but that looks quite a bit different with a Trump government that is cuddling up with Russia.” As with the full impact of Trump's tariffs in other sectors, it will take some time to assess the damage his administration's hostile actions and rhetoric have wrought on American content's appeal across borders. The studios' slow start to 2025 offers limited benchmarks so far. Disney and Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World had problems more urgent than the geopolitical context of its release (as indicated by its B- CinemaScore), but its namesake certainly didn't help it in territories around the world, industry insiders say. Since its Feb. 14 release, Brave New World has earned 51.7 percent of its $415 million worldwide box office total overseas, compared to an average of 60.7 percent from offshore sales for the first three films in the franchise. “There's going to be some discounting, which is not good for a business that's already very challenged,” says Noah Segal, co-president of Elevation Pictures, a leading Canadian indie distributor. “I certainly don't think we'll see a heroic U.S. war film right now — and if we do, it's probably going to be divisive,” he adds. “International buyers might begin to become wary of the Yellowstone-style, all-American series and films,” notes an exec at a leading European film sales company, adding: “Buyers in a number of countries are more critical of America and American culture than I've ever seen.” Somewhat paradoxically, though, such works simultaneously enhanced international admiration for the American way of life. Explains UCLA's Raustiala: “When Hollywood began to more directly criticize U.S. foreign policy — films like Apocalypse Now or Coming Home, which both tackled Vietnam — they bolstered American soft power by showing that open dissent and critique were possible. Our relatively free society was on display for all to see in these films.” The film premiered to rave reviews and an eight-minute standing ovation in Cannes on its way to becoming an awards-season breakout, scoring two Oscar nominations — for Sebastian Stan, playing Trump, and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. But no major studio or streamer stepped up to distribute the movie. In truth, the U.S. studios' aversion to political nerve or principle is nothing new. But the subtle kowtowing nonetheless proved insufficient when geopolitical tensions intensified. After Trump launched his first trade war with China in 2017 — just as Chinese commercial filmmaking was rapidly improving — local audiences began turning away from U.S. blockbusters. Today, Marvel tentpoles earn about one-tenth of what they once did in the country. Ironically, from one point of view, the studios' internalized institutional practice of keeping their escapist product ideologically neutral at all costs could serve them well in the current, fraught moment. As long as it doesn't have “America” in the title, the superhero film will likely remain relatively easy for global viewers to disassociate from Trump's America First movement. Even Tom Cruise's final outing as American spy Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible— The Final Reckoning is expected to trade more on global nostalgia than on any reflection of today's geopolitical reality — or so many industry insiders seem to hope and believe. But as Hollywood largely avoids the visceral emotions elicited by Trumpism, international industries are leaning into it. Elevation Pictures is doubling down on homegrown Canadian storytelling, looking to harness the rising “elbows up” sentiment provoked by Trump's tariffs and his insulting “51st state” remarks. “There's definitely going to be a lift in Canadian content — and I assume something similar will happen across other international markets,” says Segal, noting that the company is even considering adding a “Made in Canada” label to all of its local film marketing. Adds Sabine de Mardt, president of the German division of French studio Gaumont, in a recent interview with THR: “A certain narrative — the great American dream narrative, the one that we in Western Europe used to so closely identify with — is being questioned and reconsidered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In case you had any doubts, André 3000 is living his — or anyone's — best life. Instead of doing what people want or expect, he's out here following his muse wherever it takes him. In 7 Piano Sketches, he goes for almost literally the last thing you'd predict from one of the greatest rappers ever: 16 minutes of improvised doodles, mostly recorded at home in 2013, with his iPhone sitting on the piano. “I'd rather go amateur interesting than master boring,” André told Rolling Stone last year, and he lives up to that motto on 7 Piano Sketches. Like spaceships, pianos don't come equipped with rear-view mirrors, and that's the whole point here. Like his surprise 2023 flute album New Blue Sun, it's a playfully enjoyable exercise in spiritual renewal by heading into the unknown, lost in music. André dropped 7 Piano Sketches as a total shocker on Monday night, at the same time he was attending the Met Gala fashion event in New York, wearing a piano strapped to his back. “I simply like the sound and mechanics of piano playing. Some of my favorite piano music composers and players that inspire me are Thelonious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Philip Glass, Stephen Sondheim, Joni Mitchell and Vince Guaraldi.” He knocked it out in a Texas house where he and his son were living with no furniture — “only a piano, our beds and tv screens.” But there was no thought of making an album. I would sometimes text them to my family and friends.” But Three Stacks' melodic sensibility comes through loud and clear, giving the whole thing a bittersweet low-key flow, even when he's just winging it. “And then one day you'll…” is a gorgeously jazzy meditation that sounds like the music you hear in your head driving alone in the rain — you can really hear his obsession with Monk. Same with the first minute of “hotel lobby pianos,” before it takes off on the riff from Dave Brubeck's “Take Five.” (Or Pavement's “5 – 4 = Unity”?) The high points come at the end, in “off rhythm laughter,” with its eerie echo and overdubbed human chuckles, dissolving into a reverberant drone. “I spend all day waiting for the night” has a welcome hip-hop beat, which gives him something to play against. People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Nicole Kidman, Sandra Bullock Cast New Spell in ‘Practical Magic 2' Teaser for Release Date Trump Brags About Gold-Plated Office While Telling Americans to Cut Expenses Nothing too complex here, obviously — André is attracted to throwaways the way driven artists often are, as an exercise to keep their artistic muscles loose and limber. His original title: The Best Worst Rap Album In History. 7 Piano Sketches is a tribute to enthusiasm for its own sake. He sat down at the piano and played around, with no thought of living up to his history — just jumping into a moment of freedom and riding it all the way through.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria is over the moon for her beau of more than a year, filmmaker Brandt Andersen. On May 6, 2025, the “Windy City Rehab” star revealed on Instagram that Andersen's critically acclaimed documentary, “The Stranger's Case,” has been picked up by film distributor Angel Studios and will be released in theaters on Christmas Day. Now it's all coming true and I can't wait for the world to see your big beating heart… on the big screen! But according to EuroNews, after Andersen worked with humanitarian agencies, he felt drawn to document life in European refugee camps. He first wrote and directed 2020's critically-acclaimed short film “Refugee,” according to the outlet. The movie will have a limited theatrical release on December 25, followed by a wide release in theaters January 2026, according to a press release from Angel Studios, which bills itself as a “values-based distribution company for stories that amplify light to mainstream audiences.” Its biggest box office hit was 2023's “Sounds of Freedom.” “I am honored and grateful to partner with Angel to share ‘The Stranger's Case' with a global audience,” Andersen said in the statement. “I cannot wait for everyone to see the hard work of this amazing cast and crew on the big screen. Victoria went Instagram official with Andersen in June 2024, sharing multiple photos of them together at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. Victoria was stunned and thrilled by how much media attention her first Instagram post with Andersen generated in June, telling Us Weekly a week later, “We did not think it was that big of a deal. “I love that everybody already knew how amazing he was. In November, she told Entertainment Tonight, “I've never felt, like, more safe. And that just is something I never have felt in my life. And it's like I don't have to wear that armor with him. And I get to just be, like, my authentic, vulnerable, scared-little-girl self with him and he takes care of me.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two days after Kolbi Jordan was eliminated from season 23 of “American Idol,” the 26-year-old powerhouse singer broke her silence with a touching Instagram post on May 6, 2025. Jordan, who made it to the top 10 before being cut, was showered with love by her fellow contestants and fans she's made along the way. “After an unforgettable journey on American Idol, I'm bidding farewell to the show that helped launch a transformative chapter in my artistic journey is nothing but God's timing,” Jordan wrote. When Jordan, who hails from Atlanta, auditioned for “American Idol,” she blew away judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie with her vocals and spunky personality as she performed “Epiphany (I'm Leaving),” a 2009 Gospel song by Chrisette Michele. “Auditioning for American Idol changed my life,” Jordan wrote in her May 6 post. I'm excited for what's next… to keep growing, creating, and stepping into everything that's ahead.” Expressing gratitude for all who supported her journey on the show, Jordan concluded, “Thank you from the bottom of my heart for every comment, vote, and word of support. Many of Jordan's new friends from the show flooded her post with love, including top 7 contestant Gabby Samone, who wrote, “My babyyy!!! Another top 7 finalist, 17-year-old Slater Nalley, simply wrote to Jordan, “I love you” Fellow platinum ticket winner Filo, who was cut after making the top 12, wrote, “Love you Kolbi!!! Just wait and see what God has in store for you. It's likely Jordan will be back for the May 19 season finale, given that the top 10 typically returns for group performances and, potentially, collaborations with celebrity guests. A perfect pairing for Jordan would be R&B icon Patti LaBelle, whom Richie called during Jordan's audition, announcing that he'd love to see them perform together.</p>

We'll be waiting for the person who goes viral when that prompt inevitably tells you to watch “Adolescence” or “Baby Reindeer.” But the TV homepage will also now have TikTok-style reels that offer short-form clips if you're browsing on mobile, vertical video shorts that you can swipe through or add something directly to your My List if you like what you see or share it with a friend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peacock is staging a Parks and Recreation reunion of sorts — though it will be set far from Pawnee. Parks and Rec star Amy Poehler and co-creator Mike Schur are reteaming for the first time since their NBC show ended in 2015 on a comedy called Dig, which Peacock has ordered to series. Poehler is set to star and executive produce alongside Schur and J.J. Philbin (Only Murders in the Building, Single Parents); all three will serve as writers on the show. Dig, from Universal Television (where both Schur and Poehler have overall deals), is based on the novel Excavations by Kate Myers. The show will also mark Poehler's first ongoing role in a live-action series since Parks and Rec. The Emmy winner voiced Joy in last year's Inside Out 2 from Pixar; her other recent credits include Fox's animated series Duncanville (which she also co-created), Chelsea Peretti's First Time Female Director and Netflix's movie Wine Country. They previously worked together at Saturday Night Live in the late 1990s. Poehler is repped by WME, 3 Arts, Ocean Avenue and Sloane Offer. Myers is repped by CAA and Claire Friedman at Inkwell Management.
