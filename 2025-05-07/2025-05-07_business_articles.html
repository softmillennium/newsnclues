                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia shares rose on Wednesday on a report that the Trump administration plans to revise a set of chip trade restrictions called the "AI diffusion" rule. The rule, which was proposed in the last days of the Biden administration, organizes countries into three different tiers, all of which have different restrictions on whether advanced AI chips like those made by Nvidia, AMD, and Intel can be shipped to the country without a license. The chip restrictions were scheduled to take effect on May 15. Chipmakers including Nvidia and AMD have been against the rule. AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC on Wednesday that the U.S. should strike a balance between restricting access to chips for national security and providing access, which will boost the American chip industry. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this week that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would be a "tremendous loss."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The central bank is walking a fine line: It's facing uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariffs and economy that shows some signs of resilience – take April's payrolls – as well as weakness – like the latest gross domestic product report. Fed Chair Jerome Powell knocked down any notion of taking preemptive rate cuts as inflation is still running above target. "It's not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don't know what the right responses to the data will be until we see more data," Powell said. The Fed has been on hold since its last cut in December as it waits to evaluate the tariff impact. Powell said U.S. negotiations with key trade partners could have a material impact on the economic outlook, after Trump imposed higher than expected tariffs that surprised even the Fed. "It seems to be we're entering a new phase where the administration is beginning talks with a number of our important trading partners and that has the potential to change the picture materially — or not," Powell said. "It's going to be very important how that shakes out." Powell said the tariffs Trump implemented on April 2nd were "substantially larger than anticipated in the forecasts that I had see and in our forecasts." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland this weekend. The two largest economies in the world have slapped tariffs on each other that effectively amount to an embargo, Bessent said Tuesday. Despite a bevy of criticisms launched from the White House to Powell, the Fed chief said he has not asked to meet with Donald Trump or any other U.S. president. "I don't think it's up to a Fed chair to seek a meeting with the president," he added. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the U.S. federal debt level "is on an unsustainable path," he refrained from offering any advice for Congress on the budget. "I think they don't need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal policy, any more than we need their advice," Powell said during a press conference on Wednesday. President Donald Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates has no effect "at all" on the Federal Open Market Committee's job or the way they do it, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. "We are always going to do the same thing, which is we are going to use our tools to foster maximum employment and price stability for the benefit of the American people," he said. "There's just so much that we don't know, I think, and we're in a good position to wait and see, is the thing. We don't have to be in a hurry. The costs of waiting to see further are fairly low," Powell said. Powell said that if Trump's tariffs ultimately stay at their current levels, this could delay the U.S. central bank from achieving its mandated goals. And if that's what we do see — if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we don't know — then we won't see further progress toward our goals," he said. "In our thinking, we would never do anything but keep achieving those goals. "The thing is, we don't know that. A delay in the Fed achieving its goals could mean that the U.S. central bank might hold rates at higher levels for longer than it had previously anticipated. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said central bank is not looking to cut rates preemptively due to the fact that inflation is still running above target, with forecasts for another potential rise in inflation in the near term. "It's not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don't know what the right responses to the data will be until we see more data," Powell said. Powell said it's "too early" to know which side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of high employment and stable prices is more important. "It's too early to know that," he said. Powell added that the policy rate is in a good spot while the central bank awaits clarity on what President Donald Trump's tariff policy looks like. He called the Fed's current monetary policy is only "moderately restrictive" and said that the central bank will continue to monitor economic data. This "leaves us in a good place to wait and see," Powell said of current borrowing levels amid uncertainty around tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the current announced levels of tariffs could lead to a slowdown in economic growth and a potential rise in long-term inflation. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent," Powell said. Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees the Fed policy as appropriate despite the rising threat from President Donald Trump's tariffs. "The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to have risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic development," the central bank leader said during his post-meeting news conference. The Federal Reserve's key benchmark rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending, but also has a domino effect on almost all of the borrowing and savings rates Americans see every day. With a rate cut likely postponed until July, the average credit card annual percentage rate has stayed just over 20% — not far from last year′s all-time high. And since mortgage rates don't directly track the Fed, but are largely tied to Treasury yields and the economy, those rates are down slightly. The Federal Reserve's statement "sending a shot across the bow to the administration, saying essentially if you read between the lines, 'Your policies are leading to higher inflation, higher unemployment," David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch." "It says, 'We are not going to be in any hurry to cut rates because honestly there are risks to both sides of our mandate here and we are not sure which way we should be playing this,'" he added. The recent better-than-feared jobs report supports the Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady — and the central bank will likely continue to stay in a holding pattern at its next meeting, said Ashish Shah, chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "The onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle," Shah said. "Any weakening in the labor market, however, could take a number of months to become apparent and we see the odds skewed towards another 'hold' at next month's meeting." In this meeting's Fed statement, the committee notably added that it "judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen."

The Dow Industrials was well off its highs, up just 45 points, or 0.1%. Central bank policymakers kept a steady hand on interest rates, maintaining them at the target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This time, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that it is "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen." Click here for more details from CNBC's Jeff Cox on the Fed's rate decision. The three major averages were in positive territory – albeit with the Dow Industrials and S&P 500 getting a boost from Disney – just before 1:30 p.m. As the Federal Reserve prepares to announce its policy decision, consumer rates that are closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield remain high. Rates on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage were around 6.9% as of the week of May 2, up from 4.29% in March 2022, according to data from MND. Credit card rates also remain high, hovering at 20.12% as of last week, compared to 16.34% in March 2022, per Bankrate data. For consumers who are saving, the five-year annual percentage yield was at 1.69% last week, according to data from Haver. That's up from the 0.5% APY institutions were paying on these CDs in March 2022, but down notably from the 2.87% they offered last September. Central bank policymakers are widely expected to keep interest rates at their current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at the conclusion of their May meeting. Fed funds futures call for a nearly 98% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will stand pat on rate policy. Plenty of uncertainty lingers over how these levies will shape up, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that the duties could put the central bank in a crunch between reining in inflation and lifting economic growth. Because of this shakiness, traders will be listening closely to Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m., seeking clues on what could be next for rates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held its key interest rate unchanged as it waits for the Trump administration's trade policy to take shape and sees its impact on a sputtering economy. In a move that carried little suspense given the wave of uncertainty sweeping the political and economic landscape, the Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December. "The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen." "The May FOMC statement in effect warns that a large trade shock is still set to hit the economy in spite of efforts by the Trump administration to deescalate, with the Fed seeing the risks ahead as two-sided and not providing any early dovish lean in favor of a June rate cut," wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. "The net implications for risk assets are negative." Finding the balance between the two elements of the Fed's so-called dual mandate of full employment and stable prices has been made more difficult lately amid President Donald Trump's tariff push. Policymakers have largely been in agreement that the central bank is in a good position, with the economy generally holding up for now, to be patient as it calibrates monetary policy. Powell emphasized this during the press conference. "The economy itself is still in solid shape," he said. The Fed's deliberations come as the White House is locked on negotiations with top U.S. trading partners during a 90-day negotiating period that began in early April. Trump slapped 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports and threatened other individual "reciprocal" duties pending ongoing talks. As near-daily headline changes gauge the trade war, the economy has been flashing conflicting signals on growth, inflation, and consumer and business sentiment. The FOMC statement noted that "swings in net exports have affected the data," and held to its recent characterization that the economy "has continued to expand at a solid pace." Indeed, job growth has held up despite Trump's efforts to pare down the federal workforce. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April and the unemployment rate held at 4.2%, giving the Fed room to breathe if it expects a further economic slowdown. Inflation has been ticking lower and approaching the Fed's 2% target, but tariffs are expected to result in at least a one-time rise in prices. The central bank's preferred gauge showed headline inflation at 2.3%, or 2.6% on core that excludes food and energy. However, as with all aspects of the economy, it all depends on what happens with tariffs. Recent indications of progress in negotiations along with some softening from the administration have helped reverse a huge stock market sell-off after the April 2 "liberation day" announcement from Trump. However, business surveys show a high degree of anxiety, with most managers reporting concerns about supplies and pricing from the tariffs. Market pricing regarding Fed action has been volatile as well. Heading into the meeting, pricing indicated virtually no chance of a cut this week and less than 30% probability of a move in June, with the next reduction expected in July. Traders are pricing in a total of three cuts this year, though that could change following Wednesday's decision. The fed funds rate is used by banks for overnight lending but also feeds into other consumer debt such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Apple Inc. is “actively looking at” revamping the Safari web browser on its devices to focus on AI-powered search engines, a seismic shift for the industry hastened by the potential end of a longtime partnership with Google. 

Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, made the disclosure Wednesday during his testimony in the US Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. The heart of the dispute is the two companies' estimated $20 billion-a-year deal that makes Google the default offering for queries in Apple's browser. The case could force the tech giants to unwind the pact, upending how the iPhone and other devices have long operated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alphabet and Apple shares sank Wednesday after Eddy Cue, Apple's services chief, said he believes that AI search engines will eventually replace standard search engines such as Google, according to Bloomberg. Cue said he expects to add artificial intelligence services from OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic as search options in Apple's Safari browser in the future, according to the report. The Apple executive was testifying in a federal court in Washington as part of the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Google had illegally dominated advertising technology markets, and now the judge is looking to determine what penalties or actions should be taken against the search company. One major focus on the case is Google's practice of paying platform providers such as Apple to become the default search engine on their platform. The lawsuit and any potential remedies threaten Google's lucrative advertising business, and Alphabet shares sank more than 8% in trading Wednesday. But the lawsuit also threatens to ensnare Apple. Google pays the iPhone maker billions of dollars per year — as much as $20 billion per year back in 2022, according to testimony in the trial — to be the default search engine on iPhones. It's lucrative for Apple and a valuable way for Google to get more search volume and users. Apple shares fell 2% during trading Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Champions League fixtures don't come much more intriguing than this. Watch the PSG vs. Arsenal semifinal second leg on Wednesday to see which of these superpowers of European football will head to Munich for the final on May 31. We have all the details you need to live stream this Champions League game — and where it's available for free — in this article. Between Ousmane Dembélé's early strike and Gianluigi Donnarumma's heroics in the gloves, the French side gave themselves a fantastic opportunity for a second final in five years and to finally get their hands on the trophy that has so painfully eluded them. Mikel Arteta and the Gunners will be desperate to show that their destruction of Real Madrid in the quarterfinal was no fluke. They were strangely lackluster at the Emirates and didn't show the same killer instinct that they found against Los Blancos. Arteta will be delighted to have influential midfielder Thomas Partey available for this return leg, and he'll hope that Declan Rice can show the sparks of brilliance that have helped Arsenal reach the final four. To see what happens next, we explain here how to watch PSG vs. Arsenal live streams from all corners of the Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets. European markets closed lower on Wednesday, with traders monitoring regional corporate earnings releases and awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy announcement. Europe's pharmaceuticals industry is still reeling from U.S. President Donald Trump's Monday announcement that tariffs for the sector would be announced within the next two weeks. Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk bucked the sectoral trend to gain 1.3%, after the company's first-quarter earnings came in above expectations. Investors also monitored earnings releases from Ørsted, Pandora, Veolia, Legrand, BMW, Siemens Healthineers, Fresenius, Skanska B, JD Wetherspoon, Vonovia, Delhaize and Telecom Italia on Wednesday. Fed funds futures trading suggests just a 3.1% chance of the central bank cutting interest rates this meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool. U.S. stocks opened higher after government spokespeople said U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top trade official Jamieson Greer would meet with their Chinese counterparts this week in Switzerland. The news was taken as a positive sign for developments on trade negotiations after turbulent market action following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement last month. Meanwhile, Hong Kong markets jumped over 2% to lead gains in Asia-Pacific after China's central bank and financial regulators announced sweeping plans to cut key interest rates in an effort to shore up growth in the face of trade worries. — CNBC's Lee Ying Shan and Alex Harring contributed reporting to this summary Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen weighs in on the impact of compounded drugs on first-quarter Wegovy sales while forecasting a rebound later this year. U.S. stocks advanced in morning deals as investors looked toward the Federal Reserve interest rate announcement expected later in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 225 points higher, or 0.5%. Alexander Lacik, CEO of Pandora, discusses first-quarter results, revised 2025 guidance and explains how U.S. tariffs might impact the business. Retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in both the euro zone and the European Union in March, preliminary data from statistics office Eurostat showed on Wednesday. British construction activity continued to slide in April, S&P Global said in its latest UK Construction PMI on Wednesday, marking the industry's fourth consecutive month of output declines amid rising business uncertainty. Commercial projects had fallen at their fastest rate since mid-2020, researchers said, while cost pressures had led to a ramping up of job cuts in the sector. However, S&P Global noted that April saw the slowest decline in total activity in three months, with house building showing resilience. Shares of Swedish carmaker Volvo were 0.1% higher at 10:54 a.m. London time, paring gains from earlier in the session. Volvo reportedly said the cuts were separate from the hundreds of U.S. layoffs announced in its first-quarter earnings report last week. A spokesperson for Volvo was not immediately available to respond when contacted by CNBC. Wind farm operator Orsted announced on Wednesday that it would discontinue its Hornsea 4 project, a move expected to incur costs of up to 4.5 billion Danish krone this year ($680 million). The company cited multiple "adverse developments" that had influenced its decision to withdraw funding for the project, including rising supply chain costs, higher interest rates, and greater risks involved with completing construction within the current timeline. Wednesday also saw Orsted confirm its full-year guidance for 2025 and post an 18% year-on-year jump in operating profit. Quarterly operating profit came in at 8.87 billion Danish krone, above the 8.16 billion krone expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Shares of Orsted were down 1.3% by 10:39 a.m. in London. Regional health-care stocks led losses in Europe on Wednesday, with the Stoxx Healthcare index shedding 1.2% during early morning trade. Medical device manufacturer Ambu was the biggest loser in the sector, with its stock falling 11.9% despite the company confirming its full-year guidance and assuring investors that it is "prepared and well-positioned to navigate" new U.S. tariffs. Ambu posted organic revenue growth of 11.7% in its fiscal second quarter, with revenue for the three months to March coming in at a worse-than-expected 1.55 billion Danish krone ($240 million). Ambu is expecting organic revenue growth in the range of 11% to 14% this year. At the other end of the sector index, Novo Nordisk shares were up 5% after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter profit and cut its 2025 outlook on weaker demand for its weight loss drug Wegovy. Regional investors are also reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that sector-specific tariffs on pharmaceuticals would be announced within two weeks. German carmaker BMW confirmed its full-year guidance on Wednesday, despite acknowledging "volatile developments" in relation to U.S. trade policy. As it posted first-quarter revenues of 33.8 billion euros ($38.5 billion) — slightly below analyst expectations, according to LSEG data — BMW said it still expects 2025 earnings before tax to be flat from the previous year. Currency-adjusted revenues were down 8.7% from the previous year. The company said that although vehicle deliveries fell by 1.4% year on year, its fully electric vehicles saw "significant sales growth" of 32.4% to account for a quarter of all sales. Meanwhile, BMW's automotive EBIT margin, a key profit indicator, came in at 6.9% in the first quarter — putting it at the upper end of its 2025 target range of 5% to 7%. However, BMW said it had already priced some of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime into its outlook. "The guidance published … in March 2025 includes all tariff increases that had taken effect by 12 March 2025," it said in a news release on Wednesday. The company added that it expects some U.S. tariff increases to be temporary, with reductions being rolled out from July. Novo Nordisk on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected rise in first-quarter net profit but lowered its full-year sales growth forecast on weaker demand for its blockbuster Wegovy weight loss drugs amid increased competition from copycat compounders. Sales of the company's popular Wegovy obesity drug rose 83% annually at constant exchange rates to 17.36 billion Danish kroner, slightly below the 18.51 billion Danish kroner anticipated by analysts in a Factset poll Tuesday. "There will be a lot of uncertainty," she said in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen from the sidelines of Milken Institute Global Conference Tuesday. "This is a process and it's going to take time. "We've got a lot of dry powder and we're excited for the opportunity to lean in when that happens," she added. The path of the economy can range anywhere from a soft landing to a recession to stagflation, Koch said. Still, longer term, Koch still believes in the artificial intelligence revolution and the shortage of energy to support it. "Do I think there is massive wealth creation opportunities in equity markets by allocating capital to AI and energy? Stock futures rallied after U.S. government spokespeople said that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top trade official Jamieson Greer would meet with their Chinese counterparts this week in Switzerland. Investors can take this as an indicator of forthcoming developments on trade negotiations after President Donald Trump's tariff announcement last month ratcheted up volatility in the market. European markets are expected to open in mixed territory Wednesday. There's another busy day of earnings ahead with Novo Nordisk, Ørsted, Pandora, Veolia, Legrand, BMW, Siemens Healthineers, Fresenius, Skanska B, JD Wetherspoon, Vonovia, Delhaize and Telecom Italia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT — A closely watched barometer for used vehicle pricing jumped last month to its highest level since October 2023 as consumers rushed purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index — which tracks prices of used vehicles sold at its U.S. wholesale auctions — increased 4.9% last month compared with a year earlier to a level of 208.2. It also marked a 2.7% increase from March. That's a significant increase compared with a historically typical month-to-month index move of 0.2%, according to the auto data and logistics firm. "The 'spring bounce' normally ends the second week of April, but this year, wholesale appreciation trends continued for the entire month and were much stronger than we typically observe," said Jeremy Robb, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights. "We expected to see strong price appreciation in response to the tariffs, and that's exactly what came." While the tariffs of 25% on new imported vehicles and many parts do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market, which is how the majority of Americans purchase a vehicle. Retail prices for consumers traditionally follow changes in wholesale prices, but they have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years. Cox reports retail used-vehicle sales in April were down 1.7% compared with March but higher year over year by 13%. Over the last four weeks, the average retail listing price for a used vehicle increased by 2% to more than $25,000, Cox said. That compares to a new vehicle at nearly $48,000. Cox previously said it was seeing used vehicle prices continue to stabilize after swinging wildly for several years before starting to calm down in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carter McIntosh, an associate with the bank's technology, media, and telecommunications coverage team in Dallas, was found dead in his apartment in January, leading Jefferies CEO Richard Handler to issue a memo defending the bank from "unfounded" speculation about the banker's cause of death. The police initially ruled it an "unexplained death." An autopsy report by the medical examiner's office now says McIntosh's death was an accident caused by the "combined toxic effects" of fentanyl and cocaine, according to a copy of the report obtained by Business Insider. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin, has proved a rising threat in the US, fueling an alarming surge in overdoses. Carter is missed by many at Jefferies and beyond," Handler told BI in a statement on Wednesday. In the wake of McIntosh's death, Handler and the firm's president, Brian Friedman, released a memo to staff expressing their "tremendous sadness" and offering support to employees. Handler also criticized what he called "unfounded, vitriolic attacks" against Jefferies' work culture. "At this point, nobody knows exactly what happened and engaging in speculation with cynical assumptions serves no useful purpose and only adds to the grief that the McIntosh family is suffering," the memo said. McIntosh worked at other financial services firms before joining Jefferies, including stints in equity research at Goldman Sachs and as an investment banking analyst at Moelis & Co., his LinkedIn page said. Before that, he attended Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.</p>

Walt Disney Co. announced plans for its first theme park in the Middle East, a sprawling resort property in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.

The company's 13th park will be built, owned and operated by the Miral Group, according to the announcement Wednesday. Disneyland Abu Dhabi will be constructed on Yas Island, a major tourism hub in the United Arab Emirates that includes the Miral-built Ferrari World, Warner Bros. World and SeaWorld parks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rivian and Tesla are two of the most popular EV makers in the US, but after visiting their New York City showrooms, it became clear to me that the brands are taking very different approaches to their in-store experience. After seeing a recent TikTok trend about Tesla owners ditching their cars for Rivians amid political backlash toward Elon Musk, I expected to observe more interchangeable aspects between the two brands. After visiting their showrooms, though, it feels like their brand identities have little in common aside from selling EVs. Neither showroom offered a traditional car dealership experience. The sales staff took a low-pressure approach, and the spaces seemed to be designed to immerse customers in the brand experience rather than being geared exclusively around closing deals. Rivian's space seemed to target environmentally friendly and outdoorsy family buyers, with employees highlighting products like camping tools, flashlights, and speakers. The space also seemed to be actively embedded in the community through partnerships with local organizations and artisan shops. Meanwhile, Tesla's showroom, located in Manhattan's upscale Meatpacking District, sold a vision of what the future could look like with displays of its Full Self-Driving tech and humanoid robots. The space had more of a sci-fi museum feel and encouraged customers to experience the company's innovations firsthand. Both brands have famously loyal fan bases, sell top-of-the-line EVs, and are making moves to launch more affordable models. Rivian and Tesla have some of the highest customer satisfaction ratings, according to Consumer Reports' 2025 Automotive Report Card, despite the vehicle brands being rated as among the least reliable. Scroll on to see photos from my showroom visits that highlight how differently the two brands approach connecting with potential customers. Rivian is renovating its Meatpacking District space, so I toured the showroom on 366 Wythe Ave in Brooklyn. The showroom didn't have a traditional office space for employees, just casual seating and some longer desks. There were white shade lamps hanging down from the ceiling, large leafy plants placed throughout the store, and lots of funky patterns, like stripes and checkers in different colors. There seemed to be no shortage of lounge seating. Next to it was a neon green circle cushion and two padded chairs with wooden side tables. The spokesperson said that people generally come in wanting to buy a Rivian or to learn more about EVs. They often have questions about charging, she said. A Rivian spokesperson said that the company makes an effort to be a part of the local community. In March, it hosted an event with Roseate and the Billion Oyster Project that included a panel conversation, networking, and test drives of its vehicles. This Sunday, it's hosting a Mother's Day flower crown-making event. According to its website, the brand repurposes single-use plastic bags and handcrafts them in Manhattan by New Yorkers. I had the option of driving or being driven. The experience was very tech-forward and smooth. I spent about an hour at the store, and there weren't too many visitors. On a Thursday afternoon, Tesla had a handful of visitors come in and out of the showroom. A sales employee at the store told me that on the weekends, they do about 200 test rides in a day, and most of them are with the Cybertruck. The store mostly featured a monochromatic palette of Black, white, silver, and gray. There were some seating options at Tesla's showroom, but the layout mainly provided standing space. There doesn't seem to be a shortage of children excited about the Cybertruck. Similar to Rivian, Tesla displayed an EV charger on the wall. The Tesla wall art was more minimalistic than Rivian, and seemed to be more aesthetically driven than educational. Tesla had key pieces of its autonomous driving tech on display. The Full Self-Driving computer and Autopilot Cameras were featured in a clear glass box next to the window, making it feel like a museum. While the employees were friendly, they gave me space to walk around on my own and didn't ask me any questions about my plans for purchasing a vehicle. I declined a beverage, but it made the experience feel more luxurious. He started the drive off by showing off Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, which costs extra and is currently in beta. Still, it was the fastest I've ever accelerated in a vehicle. While Rivian sold outdoorsy clothing and reusable bags from local vendors, Tesla's merchandise section was about the Tesla brand. He said protesters usually take their pictures and leave, and it's not as crazy as it might seem online. Looking back at both of my experiences, Rivian seemed to target a more down-to-earth, environmentally friendly crowd. The brand emphasized outdoor adventures and informed customers about EV ownership. Tesla, on the other hand, came across as a brand that didn't need much introduction or explaining. Its showroom felt more like a space for people who know the name and wanted to experience the tech in person, perhaps to get a closer look at the Cybertruck's angular design. While I don't feel like I need all the cutting-edge tech that Tesla offers — and I'm not in the market for a new car — it was cool to see in person and try out. I liked the design elements of both showrooms. I didn't walk away with a favorite, but I can see how EV shoppers might identify with one brand more than the other. After all, they're each taking very different approaches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"We keep creating and purchasing these exquisite machines that very cheap drones can take out," Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll said during an episode of the "War on the Rocks" podcast that aired Tuesday. "We are the wealthiest nation, perhaps in the history of the world, but even we can't sustain a couple-million-dollar piece of equipment that can be taken out with an $800 drone and munition," he said. The US military has been watching the war in Ukraine, where cheap drones packed with explosives are damaging or destroying expensive combat equipment like tanks, other armored vehicles, air defenses, and even warships, highlighting the vulnerability of larger and more prized weapons that are insufficiently defended. The proliferation of cheap drones — some of which cost as little as a few hundred dollars — has become a growing concern for the US military as it readies for the possibility of a large-scale confrontation between NATO and Russia in Europe or a fight with China in the Pacific. Ukraine has outfitted its Abrams tanks and other systems, including European-made tanks and American-made armored fighting vehicles, with additional armor to help protect the expensive equipment from drones, but it's not a perfect solution. Armored vehicle losses in this war have been high. Ukraine, for example, has lost more than 4,400 armored vehicles, while Russia has lost more than 12,600, according to Oryx, an open-source intelligence site that tracks military equipment losses on both sides. And drones aren't just a threat to land assets. Ukrainian naval drones packed with explosives have wreaked havoc on Russia's Black Sea Fleet. These drones have even been upgraded to launch missiles. Ukraine said one managed to take down two of Russia's $50 million Su-30 fighter jets over the weekend.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jared Fisher, the CEO and cofounder of Escape Adventures, an adventure tourism agency, and owner of several bike shops in Nevada and Utah. Fisher also ran for governor of Nevada as a Republican in 2018. This story has been edited for length and clarity. We operate multiday motor tours and road bike tours with hiking, mostly in the Southwest, and a hut-to-hut mountain biking route in Utah. We also own retail bike shops in Las Vegas and Utah. Recently, I made the decision to start adding a tariff tax line item directly to the price tags on certain products in our stores, especially electric bikes. There's no difference except when we purchased them, so one has a line item because it was purchased when that price increase was implemented due to the tariff. It really puts us in an uncomfortable situation with our customers. Whether we like it or not, we're paying those taxes, which is how I view tariffs, as a brick-and-mortar shop. If I don't have a bike in a bike shop, I'm going out of business. The bicycle industry runs on pretty tight margins. If you cut the 10% into that, you might as well get ready to have your exit strategy for your business, because you're not going to be able to operate. There's no way — that's just how it goes. I ran for governor of Nevada in 2018 as a Republican. I didn't vote for Donald Trump. He was the reason I ran for office. I feel like he doesn't understand how much of an impact his decisions have. I believe that people need to be responsible for their actions. I have no problem labeling where this tax is coming from on my products. People need to know that so I have a fighting chance on my end. This tariff policy has created chaos across the board. We're having to redo items that are time-consuming during a season when we should be focusing on our customers' experience. As a business owner, I don't have time for this baloney. We're also seeing the effects on our tourism business. We have lots of Canadian customers, and when all this tariff talk started, they began canceling tours. One group told us, "We love you guys, but we can't put our money into America because of what they're doing and what they're saying about our country." It's like a lot of little cuts, and eventually you bleed out. The one word I could say for this whole problem that we're facing is unnecessary. Do you have a story to share about the impact of tariffs?</p>
