                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Recently, Cambridge University scientists discovered the best candidate so far for extraterrestrial life on an ocean world, 120 light years away. We have these compounds on Earth too, because our bacteria and marine phytoplankton both produce them. Seeing these signs of life on K2-18b, a Neptune-like world that orbits the red dwarf star K2-18, is a solid indication that we may not be alone. K2-18b is a bit unusual as a planet in the “habitable zone,” where the temperature is just right for water to exist and support life as we know it. However, it likely has a warm ocean that could be full of simple, algae-like life, Cambridge astrophysics and exoplanetary science professor Nikku Madhusudhan, Ph.D., told The New York Times. According to astronomers' estimates, K2-18b is still only one of potentially 300 million worlds in the Milky Way that could exist in a habitable zone. Life on a planet other than Earth still needs to be confirmed. But scientists are now studying nearly 6,000 known exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, that could support life. The most intriguing of these, and the ones researchers are focusing on, are worlds that have warmer climates than Earth, because any extraterrestrials there may have a leg up in their development. Researchers have observed that warmer conditions on Earth are often the key to rapid evolution. In fact, evolution could occur several times faster on planets that are warmer than our own, potentially producing advanced civilizations faster than our own planet did, according to some scientists. On Earth, warm climates may put more genetic pressure on life forms to adapt, giving rise to greater variation, says a 2024 Nature Communications study of E. coli bacteria. So, warmer planets are great contenders for finding more complex life, because heat tends to encourage accelerated mutation rates and other biological processes. Emily Mitchell, Ph.D., an evolutionary zoologist at Cambridge who wrote a recent paper with Madhusudhan about ocean worlds with hydrogen-rich atmospheres, believes the discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth is plausible. “But that's not necessarily life you can say hello to—they're two very different things.” However, it took a long time to reach that turning point. While life on this planet is 3.7 billion years old based on fossil evidence, the earliest human ancestors emerged between 5 and 7 million years ago, and the first modern humans, Homo sapiens, only started appearing in the fossil record about 300,000 years ago in Africa. According to Mitchell and Madhusudhan's paper, it's conceivable that advanced beings on other planets could develop much faster after life emerges—if the conditions are right. If life is confirmed on just one of these distant worlds, studying it could significantly increase scientists' estimates for the number of advanced aliens in our galaxy—and the chances of encountering intelligence life in the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Architecture firm Rogers Partners and two other tenants signed deals at JEMB Realty's 150 Broadway, Commercial Observer has learned. In the largest lease, Rogers Partners will be relocating from 100 Reade Street after signing a seven-year, 6,286-square-foot lease on the sixth floor of the property, according to landlord brokers JLL. Asking rent in the building is $55 per square foot. “There has been a tremendous amount of movement in Lower Manhattan as tenants readjust their footprints and, in some cases, relocate from properties that are being converted to apartments,” JLL's Andrew Coe, who worked on deals with Margaux Kelleher, Jakob Cohn and Joseph Sipala, said in a statement. Ken Fishel of Legacy negotiated on behalf of the Rogers and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the second lease, modeling agency Muse Management signed a seven-year deal to move from its current 3,626 square feet on the 11th floor of the building to 5,432 square feet on the third floor. Marcus Rayner and Sam Einhorn of Colliers handled the deal for Muse Management, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lastly, art and design studio UAP signed a seven-year, 4,468-square-foot deal to relocate from 33 Bond Street to the third floor of the JEMB-owned building with Coe, Kelleher and Cohn representing them in the deal. Other tenants in the building include manufacturer of modular wall systems ALUR, which signed a deal for 4,015 square feet in September 2023, and Chinese retailer Miniso — which sells cosmetics, stationery, toys and other home goods — which took 5,000 square feet of retail space in June 2024.

The new Kinetica Freezeguard range, developed in its in-house research and development hub, has now been made commercially available.

It is certified according to the newest PAS24:2022+A1:2024 security test standard and accredited by Secured by Design.

These updated standards ensure locks can withstand extreme tampering, protecting against increasingly sophisticated break-in techniques including freezing, gluing, snapping, drilling, picking, and bumping.

While the industry continues to adjust to new requirements, UAP has already delivered fully compliant products that fabricators and installers can rely on.

Adam Dixon, senior technical manager at UAP Ltd, said: “Our status as the first in the industry to achieve the new BSI Kitemark is testament to our team, who work tirelessly to develop products that meet and exceed security standards.

“The new Kinetica Freezeguard range shows our commitment to leading the way with proactive security innovation, giving our clients a competitive edge.”

Considered one of the most progressive figures to have served as pope, the late pontiff was frequently targeted by false narratives, prompting him to denounce disinformation as “dangerous”, and a “tragedy” that “foments conflict.” The closed-door conclave that begins on Wednesday will see 133 Cardinal electors isolate themselves within the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, with one round of voting expected to take place on Wednesday followed by four rounds each day before a cardinal receives the two-thirds majority needed to be elected pope. Cardinals are sworn to secrecy about the voting process. But the conclave has been tainted by a raft of false claims and conspiracy theories that have been circulating online in recent weeks. As early as 21 April, a video emerged on YouTube – purporting to be a news report – claiming  that the Philippines' Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle had been selected. The false report, first spotted by Filipino digital news media The Rappler, is headlined "Breaking: Cardinal Tagle Elected As Pope Luis I." Similar false claims purporting Cardinal Robert Sarah – considered a favourite among the most conservative of the vote-holding cardinals – has been elected pope have been circulating, mainly on Facebook and TikTok. A reverse-image search shows there is no published evidence that Cardinal Sarah has ever worn the attire, and the photo is flagged as AI-manipulated by three AI detection tools consulted by Euroverify. The papal seat has been vacant since Pope Francis' death, a period known as Sede Vacante, and will remain so until the conclave has concluded. Another Cardinal considered a frontrunner to be the next pope, Italy's Pietro Parolin, has been targeted with a raft of false news reports about a decline in his health days before the conclave. Italian outlets have tried to point the finger at US Catholic news site Catholicvote.org, which published the misleading report on 1 May citing “Italian media sources”. But the news also featured in Italian sites such as Virgilio and Il Giornale, and were in turn amplified by journalists on social media. He also denied the involvement of medical or nursing staff.” Analysts have long denounced how false rumours can discredit candidates in the run-up to a new appointment, with Pope Francis facing similar false reports about his health in the run-up to the 2013 conclave. Cardinal Parolin – formerly Pope Francis' chief advisor – is being touted as one of the strongest papabiles, or candidates to be elected the next pope. A doctored screenshot mimicking a Guardian op-ed titled "The next pope must be Muslim or there will be violence on the streets of Europe" has also been circulating online. The op-ed is falsely attributed to journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. Both The Guardian and Alibhai-Brown have confirmed that they never published such an article. A look at The Guardian's author page for Alibhai-Brown also shows that she hasn't written for the publication since 2016.</p>
