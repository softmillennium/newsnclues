Alpine share more information over Oakes' departure as team boss after ‘personal decision' Having previously served as a reserve driver for the Enstone-based team, it was announced last summer that Doohan was set to be promoted to the main race squad for 2025. After starting his first full-time campaign this year, Doohan has struggled to match team mate Gasly, and his troubles continued last time out in Miami, where he retired from the race following a Lap 1 collision with Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson.

Colapinto, meanwhile, returns to the grid following his eye-catching showing in the second half of 2024, where he bagged points for Williams in Azerbaijan and Austin after replacing Logan Sargeant. However, his Williams stint also included heavy crashes in Sao Paulo and Las Vegas. 2025 Miami Grand Prix: Doohan out of the race after Lap 1 clash with Lawson READ MORE: 5 Winners and 5 Losers from Miami – Who excelled in the Sunshine State? “We continue to support Jack at the team, as he has acted in a very professional manner in his role as a race driver so far this season.
