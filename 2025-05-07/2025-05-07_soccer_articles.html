                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carli Lloyd's 16 year international career saw her reach legendary status for the U.S. Women's National Team, lifting the FIFA Women's World Cup three times and winning two Olympic gold medals as she established herself as an all time great. However, Lloyd's relentless pursuit of success didn't come without sacrifices, something she has reflected on since retiring in 2021, and even more so since becoming a mom in 2024. A first-ballot member of the 2025 U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame class, the 42-year-old took to the stage in Frisco, Texas, where she used her platform to apologize to her former teammates for being “an emotionless machine” throughout her trophy-laden career. “I was intense and I truly believe that the only way for me to survive in such a cut-throat environment was to be that way.” Lloyd's intense approach to sports may come at a cost, forcing her to not only adopt a somewhat robotic persona around her teammates but to also miss various personal events, as she noted in her speech, but it ultimately paid off on the field. With 316 appearances for the USWNT, she retired as the second-most capped player in team history, behind Kristine Lilly. Meanwhile, her 134 goals are the third all time behind Mia Hamm and Abby Wambach. Along with her aforementioned World Cup and Olympic Games victories, Lloyd, twice named the FIFA Player of the Year, also helped guide the USWNT to six Algarve Cups, four SheBelieves Cups, and two CONCACAF Women's Championships. However, with her playing days now firmly in the rear view mirror and a six-month-old now keeping her occupied, it seems motherhood has changed Lloyd's perspective on life, and how she approaches emotional vulnerability. “Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional, and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.” “As lonely and difficult as the journey was at times, I would do it all over again,” Lloyd admitted. “There was nothing I loved more than winning, but winning comes at a cost, and I paid that price.” Someone Lloyd is very familiar with, having worked together with the Chicago Red Stars, the former NWSL star recently gave Hayes her full backing ahead of a push for the 2027 World Cup. “She seems like she just, kind of brings this energy and they are playing with joy and I do think that there is a balance with that of grinding and playing hard and having those high expectations, but also not really taking the game as seriously.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top officials offered a message that stuck to the Trump administration's focus on minimizing legal immigration and removing those who overstay their visas. The Trump administration says foreign soccer fans considering attending next year's FIFA World Cup are welcome to visit for a good time, but not a long time. “Everyone is welcome to come and see this incredible event,” Vice President JD Vance said. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Ms. Noem, speaking next, did not pick up Mr. Vance's refrain. But Sean Duffy, the Transportation Secretary, soon echoed his sentiments. See America,” he said to potential visitors. But in the next breath, he added: “Don't overstay your visa. The blunt warnings to tourists not to overstay their visas is in keeping with the Trump administration's approach to foreigners over the last few months, which has included not only deporting immigrants illegally present in the United States, but also efforts to expel or turn away some authorized to be in the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sergio Busquets did not hold back when speaking about Inter Miami's chances at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Fast forward five months later and Inter Miami are somewhat unrecognizable under Javier Mascherano. The club sits fourth in the Eastern Conference standings and just suffered two poor defeats in their Concacaf Champions Cup semifinal tie. Vancouver Whitecaps eliminated the Herons 5–1 on aggregate, leaving Inter Miami with a lot of questions moving forward. In fact, the lopsided tie prompted Busquets to look ahead to Inter Miami's FIFA Club World Cup campaign, and the former Barcelona star is questioning his side's ability to make a deep run in the tournament. "It's clear that we are not at the level to compete at the Club World Cup, but we will try to compete in our group," Busquets said. On paper, a team with Busquets, Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Jordi Alaba should be able to make it out of its group, but much tougher competition is on the horizon. With European giants like Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City all participating in the tournament, the Herons are fighting an uphill battle, especially if they do not improve their recent form. After all, Inter Miami still must play six MLS matches before the tournament begins. "We now have to keep focusing on MLS," Mascherano said after the Herons crashed out of the Concacaf Champions Cup. Mascherano will hope Inter Miami's 4–1 victory over New York Red Bulls at the weekend will get the Herons back on track. The team has already suffered four defeats across all competitions in the last two months and will be eager to string together some important victories to climb back up the Eastern Conference standings. All eyes will be on Messi and Inter Miami, though, when the Herons kick off the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup against Al Ahly on June 14.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Premier League manager has reportedly informally agreed to take the reins at Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal. The manager in question is none other than Fulham's Marco Silva. Mail Sport reported in 2023 that Silva had turned down a mega £40million offer to manage Al-Ahli for two years. TalkSPORT have also reported that Silva is stalling on signing a new contract due to the interest from Saudi. They claim that Al-Hilal are after Inter Milan manager Simone Inzaghi, who has qualified the Italian giants for a second Champions League final in three years. He took over at Fulham in 2021, leading them to the Championship title in his first season and since stabilising them at Premier League level. The Cottagers could yet qualify for Europe as they sit 11th in the Premier League, a position which could be enough to earn them a place in continental football. Should Silva join Al-Hilal, he would be teaming up with former Fulham striker Alexsandar Mitrovic as well as ex-Premier League stars Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, and Joao Cancelo. The side, majority owned by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund, have also made a lucrative offer to Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes. Mail Sport exclusively revealed that they can afford to pay the Portuguese around £65million per season.</p>

The United States has been waiting for men's soccer to take off; it has been close, but next summer could be the big ascend. With one good showing, former USMNT star Clint Dempsey thinks the sport could be the next big thing in America. “When I think back to the 1994 World Cup and going to my first game in Dallas, because of how well the U.S. team did and how much the game grew because of having the World Cup here, I'm curious to see what will happen from a good showing next year, if the U.S. can perform well, what could come of that,” Dempsey told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. “It's too many times it seems like every four years, everybody that's mainstream American taking notice instead of mainstream American taking notice every year. Well, not advancing out of the group stage in the Copa América last year, a tournament that only includes countries in North and South America, on their own home soil will do that. I think [head coach Mauricio Pochettino] needs a little more time with them. Hopefully Gold Cup, strong showing, get back on track, and try to do something special.” However, Dempsey has always felt a “responsibility” to do it himself. So, that is why he has partnered with Abbott, the Official Health and Nutrition Sciences Partner of Real Madrid Football Club, to make the Abbott Dream Team. Abbott and Real Madrid are hosting soccer tryouts for 18- and 19-year-olds in Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Dallas this summer, when the 11 top players will travel abroad on an all-expenses-paid trip to Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas, Madrid this fall. It comes full circle for me, as that's where I played my club ball growing up in the classic league. So look forward to being a part of that,” Dempsey said. I'm happy to get people be a part of something that gives people the chance to chase their dreams, because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. “I just kind of always felt like I've been trying to grow the game in terms of trailblazing, but at the same time, if you have opportunities like this to give back and give people that platform to have those experiences, it's special, because that's what life's about,” he added. You wanna give people the chance to to do something special in their life so you can be at peace and look back be happy with everything. So that's just kind of I'm at in life. I wanna help people out, and this was a perfect platform for that.” Dempsey, like all of us, is hoping the word “failure” is not brought up next summer during the World Cup. The USMNT can avoid that, Dempsey said, as long as they can continue what they have done in recent Cups. If you don't the group, it's a failure,” Dempsey said. It starts with getting out of the group, get people believing, and anything can happen when you get into the knockout rounds.” To be the electronic media of choice for information, entertainment, and meeting community needs</p>

The United States has been waiting for men's soccer to take off; it has been close, but next summer could be the big ascend. With one good showing, former USMNT star Clint Dempsey thinks the sport could be the next big thing in America. U.S. Men's National Team star Clint Dempsey, #8, dribbles upfield against Jamaica during the first half of their CONCACAF World Cup qualifying game at Crew Stadium on Sept. 11, 2012. "When I think back to the 1994 World Cup and going to my first game in Dallas, because of how well the U.S. team did and how much the game grew because of having the World Cup here, I'm curious to see what will happen from a good showing next year, if the U.S. can perform well, what could come of that," Dempsey told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. "It's too many times it seems like every four years, everybody that's mainstream American taking notice instead of mainstream American taking notice every year. I am a little bit nervous, though, right now, but I'm looking forward to a strong showing at the Gold Cup to get a dance for the big dance in 2026." Well, not advancing out of the group stage in the Copa América last year, a tournament that only includes countries in North and South America, on their own home soil will do that. You're the only host country to not get out of the group stage in COPA America," Dempsey said bluntly. I think [head coach Mauricio Pochettino] needs a little more time with them. Hopefully Gold Cup, strong showing, get back on track, and try to do something special." U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino gives a press conference ahead of an international friendly soccer match against Mexico at Akron Stadium in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Oct. 14, 2024. However, Dempsey has always felt a "responsibility" to do it himself. So, that is why he has partnered with Abbott, the Official Health and Nutrition Sciences Partner of Real Madrid Football Club, to make the Abbott Dream Team. Abbott and Real Madrid are hosting soccer tryouts for 18- and 19-year-olds in Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Dallas this summer, when the 11 top players will travel abroad on an all-expenses-paid trip to Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas, Madrid this fall. One of those cities to try out happens to be Dallas where I kind of started it all. It comes full circle for me, as that's where I played my club ball growing up in the classic league. So look forward to being a part of that," Dempsey said. I'm happy to get people be a part of something that gives people the chance to chase their dreams, because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. "I just kind of always felt like I've been trying to grow the game in terms of trailblazing, but at the same time, if you have opportunities like this to give back and give people that platform to have those experiences, it's special, because that's what life's about," he added. "I have six kids, and it's pretty busy chasing them around, and sometimes it feels like you're an Uber driver, but's it's me watching them try to chase their dreams. You wanna give people the chance to to do something special in their life so you can be at peace and look back be happy with everything. So that's just kind of I'm at in life. I wanna help people out, and this was a perfect platform for that." United States forward Clint Dempsey, #8, against Belgium during the round of sixteen match in the 2014 World Cup at Arena Fonte Nova. Dempsey, like all of us, is hoping the word "failure" is not brought up next summer during the World Cup. The USMNT can avoid that, Dempsey said, as long as they can continue what they have done in recent Cups. If you don't the group, it's a failure," Dempsey said.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected the appeal by Leon who had qualified by winning the CONCACAF Champions Cup in 2023.

"This is the greatest damage done to a team that has always competed with humility and honesty," Leon said in a statement.

"The only thing left for us is to win again to regain the place on the field that was taken from us. Have no doubt, as long as no one prevents us from doing so again, we will do it."

The expanded 32-team Club World Cup runs from June 14 to July 13 in the United States with $1 billion in prize money at stake.

Apart from the winners of each confederation's premier club competitions, teams also qualified based on their ranking based on their performances over a four-year period.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has said the ruling body will look to organise a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Club America to decide which team will replace Leon in the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of foreigners from around the world are expected to visit the United States for soccer's most anticipated international tournament, yet Trump and some of his Cabinet members chilled the usually celebratory mood with ominous warnings to travelers planning to attend next year's World Cup. When asked if people who have taken part in pro-Palestinian protests should be concerned about visiting the U.S., Trump replied, “I think people are allowed to protest.” He continued: “You have to do it in a reasonable manner, not necessarily friendly, but reasonable.” “Pam will come after you, and you're going to have a big problem,” he then warned, referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who attended Tuesday's task force meeting. Trump's administration has sought to revoke the visas of hundreds of foreign students for participating in pro-Palestine activism, detaining some and seeking their deportation. “Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event,” Vice President J.D. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has led the administration's crackdown on immigration. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy also chimed in, and said, “If you're coming to see some soccer … go on a road trip. See America,” before saying: “Don't overstay your visa. Canada issued a travel advisory warning that officials could demand to search citizens' electronic devices at the border without any reason. Several European countries have warned citizens about Trump's trans crackdown and how it may affect travelers to the U.S. Nicole Kidman, Sandra Bullock Cast New Spell in ‘Practical Magic 2' Teaser for Release Date Trump Brags About Gold-Plated Office While Telling Americans to Cut Expenses</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid have approached Liverpool in an attempt to bring forward the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold so that he is available to play in the Club World Cup, which starts on 14 June in the United States. The right-back is set to join the Spanish side when his contract expires at the end of June, but Real are eager to take him earlier. Any agreement would lead to Liverpool receiving a fee. Fifa has implemented a two-window summer to benefit those playing at the Club World Cup, with the first lasting from 1 to 10 June and the second opening on 16 June. Real's first fixture is on 18 June against Al-Hilal at the Hard Rock Cafe Stadium in Miami. Alexander-Arnold, who helped Liverpool win the Club World Cup in 2019, announced on Monday that he would not be renewing his contract after two decades with Liverpool, having started in the academy aged six. “After 20 years at Liverpool Football Club, now is the time for me to confirm that I will be leaving at the end of the season,” said Alexander-Arnold. “This is easily the hardest decision I've ever made in my life. I know many of you have wondered why or been frustrated that I haven't spoken about this yet, but it was always my intention to keep my full focus on the team's best interests, which was securing number 20,” referring to the club's 20th league title. The veteran defender Dani Carvajal is out injured with cruciate ligament damage and the forward Lucas Vázquez has been filling in for his Spain teammate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) handed down their verdict on Tuesday in the case of Club León against FIFA, and unfortunately for the Liga MX outfit, they have sided with FIFA. León were appealing their expulsion from this summer's Club World Cup due to their shared ownership structure with another participant, Club Pachuca. So, with FIFA's own decision upheld about their own tournament, León are now officially out, and will be replaced by either Los Angeles FC (LAFC) or another Liga MX side, Club América. These two are set to play a one-off playoff (play-in?) at the end of the month, at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles on May 31. The winner of that game will face Chelsea a couple weeks later, in Atlanta on Friday Monday, June 16, in the first group stage game. Chelsea's other two games in the group stage of the tournament will be in Philadelphia, against Flamengo on Friday, June 20, and ES Tunis the following Tuesday, June 24. A one-match playoff is set to be played by LAFC and Club América to determine the final spot in the 2025 Club World Cup, per @tombogert and @JacobsBen The match will be played at BMO Stadium on May 31st and the winner will replace Club Leon in this summer's Club WC.
