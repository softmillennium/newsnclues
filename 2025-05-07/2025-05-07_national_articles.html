Illinois father Jim Walden slams liberal immigration policies after his son was killed by an illegal immigrant in a motorcycle incident. Families who lost loved ones to crimes committed by those in the country illegally took aim at sanctuary policies in Illinois and across the country at a press conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Wednesday. Among the speakers was Jim Walden, an Illinois resident who lost his son, Jimmy, several years ago in a motorcycle incident while Jimmy was stationed in Maryland. He worked for the National Security Agency. Illinois father Jim Walden took aim at Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker over the state's immigration policies May 7, 2025. (Department of Homeland Security; Christopher Polk/Variety via Getty Images) "He was hit and killed by his motorcycle by an illegal that the state of Maryland admitted they knew was illegal five years before he killed my son. He was convicted of domestic violence and put on probation, and he was illegal. He would have been 30 years old yesterday. "For our governor to get on national television and say that he's gonna stand up and protect these people is a gut punch to anybody that's lost one," Walden said of Gov. Pritzker to be a true governor and stand by the federal laws and deport every one of them, every one. Noem said she did the press conference there at the "direction of President Trump today to draw attention to the dangerous policies of Illinois and the Illinois governor and what he has perpetuated as far as violence and criminality against his citizens here in this state." President Donald Trump recently issued an executive order asking DHS and the Department of Justice to treat "sanctuary jurisdictions" as states and localities that could lose federal funding. "Springfield needs attention specifically because of the victims that have been here, but also because of the laws that come out of this city that impact the entire state that is protecting illegal criminals and not prioritizing American citizens and the citizens of this great state," the secretary added. "But we're standing here on this block today because this is the block where a young woman was killed just a couple of houses away from here. Emma Shafer was brutally stabbed and murdered by an illegal alien who was released into the United States by the Biden administration," Noem explained.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) "Unlike Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, Illinois follows the law," Pritzker said in a statement about Noem's visit. "The Trump administration is violating the United States Constitution, denying people due process and disappearing law-abiding neighbors, including children who are U.S. citizens. Yet, they are taking no real action to promote public safety and deport violent criminals within the clear and defined legal process. Illinois doesn't need to abuse power or ignore the Constitution to keep our people safe. Like the millions of Americans asking for sensible, humane immigration reform, I encourage the secretary to spend less time performing for Fox News and more time protecting the homeland."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans supportive of Medicaid have expressed concerns that the proposed $1.5 trillion in spending cuts would run right through the beneficiary program, particularly as fiscal hawks claim that significant reforms to Medicaid are needed to earn their vote on the bill. But emerging from the Tuesday meeting, several key centrist GOP lawmakers said they are leaning closer to a “yes.” Now, the proposed plan includes additional work requirements for able-bodied beneficiaries, cracking down on benefits for noncitizens, and increasing the frequency of eligibility checks. Johnson told reporters “no” when asked if Republicans were pursuing changes to FMAP. Changes to Medicaid that enjoy broad GOP support include implementing work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and ensuring illegal immigrants do not have access to the healthcare benefits designed for lower-income citizens. The speaker's decision to side with centrist Republicans on their Medicaid red lines, for now, could spell disaster for leadership, as its reconciliation passage deadline of Memorial Day is only 19 days away. But, surprisingly, it puts Johnson in a position to hand a win to strong Trump loyalists such as Laura Loomer and Steve Bannon, who have been making the “MAGA” case for Medicaid. … You can't just take a meat axe to it,” he said. The speaker can only afford to lose three votes to still pass the legislation along party lines, with that number fluctuating depending on Democratic absences. Though Johnson may be able to get centrists from New York and California on board, he now must wrestle with fiscal hawks who have already expressed their displeasure over Tuesday's results. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), policy chairman of the Freedom Caucus and one of the most vocal hard-line conservatives involved in reconciliation, said he has not ruled FMAP out. But GOP leaders are signaling to centrist members that some committees may go above their designated savings instructions, giving the Energy and Commerce Committee some breathing room as they try to reach $880 billion in savings. Fiscal hawks, particularly in the Freedom Caucus, have warned leadership that their votes are contingent on strong reform to programs such as Medicaid and Social Security. “Not tackling substantive reforms to save Medicaid doesn't just mean defending Obamacare policies discriminating against the vulnerable in favor of able-bodied adults with no children and no jobs. “Reconciliation has to help solve the budget deficit and debt, not make it worse. Placing Medicaid on the chopping block is a surefire way to lose centrists such as Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE) and Mike Lawler (R-NY), both of whom have said they would not support cuts to the program. But Bacon told the Wall Street Journal that some GOP leaders have encouraged him and other centrist members to get on board with reconciliation by promising that any steep cuts made by the House will not make it past the Senate. “And now we're getting ready to take our third vote on this. Things may be getting more difficult for centrist lawmakers to avoid a politically damaging vote. The Congressional Budget Office released a new analysis, requested by Democrats, on Wednesday, advising that several policies the GOP is considering for Medicaid reform could lead to health insurance coverage losses for millions of people. In a letter to Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-OR) and House Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-NJ), CBO personnel said the per capita caps would save $225 billion in federal spending and may result in 1.5 million more uninsured people by 2034. This will put more fire behind Democrats' narrative that Republicans are looking to gut Medicaid and Medicare, a worry that has inflamed constituents in blue and red districts, leading to fiery town halls over the last few months. “It's clear as day: House Republicans are ripping health care away from millions of Americans to hand tax breaks to billionaires—and in the process, they're writing the playbook for Democrats to take back the House in 2026,” HMP spokeswoman Katarina Flicker said.</p>

XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women. FIRST ON FOX: Republican lawmakers are re-introducing legislation to make sure parents seeking to only raise a child of their biological sex do not face extra roadblocks in the adoption and fostering process. The "SAFE Home Act" would prevent agencies that receive federal funding from rejecting those parents or placing additional hurdles or oversight on them. Jim Banks of Indiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, as well as House Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois, would ensure that adoptive parents would not be obligated to do any "medical, surgical, or psychological treatments" that would try to make changes to a child's gender identity. "Kids deserve safe, loving homes and parents shouldn't be blocked from adopting or fostering just because they oppose irreversible sex-change procedures on children. This bill makes sure families aren't punished for using common sense," Banks told Fox News Digital in a statement. Sen. Cotton said the legislation helps tackle "radical gender policies." Part of the bill's inspiration comes from a Biden-era Department of Health and Human Services rule that makes sure children are put into homes that affirm their sexual orientation or gender identity in 2023. When that rule came out, Banks first introduced the legislation when he was in the House of Representatives, but it did not move forward. President Donald Trump has taken multiple executive actions related to transgender policies, including seeking to limit "medical interventions" for people under 19 years old and ensuring federally funded institutions only allow biological women in women's sports programs. The actions have faced legal opposition, including a transgender military ban that the Supreme Court ruled could go for now on as lawsuits are ongoing. "We must defend the rights of parents to raise their children in a way that reflects reality and safeguards their future. The SAFE Home Act ensures that parents are not excluded from adopting simply for having common sense and standing against dangerous gender ideologies that threaten the well-being of children," Miller stated. Rep. Mary Miller speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on June 15, 2021. As of fiscal year 2022, there were over 368,000 children in the foster care system, and nearly 109,000 children were "waiting to be adopted" nationwide, according to the most recent Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System report from 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ad features Lander crushing two cars, one tagged with the word “Corruption” and another that says “Trump & Musk,” after carrying them over to a front-loader. Lander was considered the progressive front-runner until March, when state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani picked up polling momentum. “New York City needs a mayor who can focus on our problems, not their own,” the ad begins. Andrew Cuomo spent $60 million of your money to defend himself in court. But Brad Lander fights corruption to make New York safer and more affordable. Lander stood up to Trump and Musk when they stole $80 million from us, and he's fought for New York, building thousands of affordable housing units.” Brad Lander will crush it,” the ad concludes. Politico reported that Lander's campaign bought $700,000 worth of ads with $4.6 million cash on hand. His past sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied, have polarized Democrats. But he remains favored in the race. Many Teslas have been damaged or defaced as a result of CEO Elon Musk's association with the Trump administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Tesla desecrations as “nothing short of domestic terrorism.” She promised to “impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.” The Washington Examiner reached out to Tesla and Lander's campaign for comment but did not receive a response. Early voting begins June 14 in the New York City mayoral Democratic Primary, with the election on June 24. The general election will take place in November.</p>

Ben Cline, R-Va., on Speaker Mike Johnson's struggle to get enough Republican votes to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running and the FBI complying with congressional record requests. The FBI is investigating a sophisticated criminal network targeting kids and teens online known as "764." The predators are known for targeting minors on social media and using coercion to get them to film themselves committing violent or sexual acts, and then using those videos to extort minors for increasing violent or sexual videos that are then shared with "764" followers online. "The FBI is investigating at least 250 subjects who are tied to violent online networks commonly referred to as '764' but includes many offshoot networks and names," the FBI told Fox News in a statement on Tuesday evening. "All 55 FBI field offices across the country are involved in these investigations." The agency added that it is "growing increasingly concerned about a loose network of violent predators who befriend minors and other vulnerable individuals through popular online platforms and then coerce them into escalating sexual and violent behavior — pushing victims to create graphic content, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), harm family pets, cut themselves with sharp objects, or attempt suicide." The "764" predators are known for targeting minors on social media and using coercion to get them to film themselves committing violent or sexual acts, and then using those videos to extort minors for increasing violent or sexual videos that are then shared with "764" followers online. "Some of these predators even watch live-streamed self-harm and other violent content," the FBI said. In a May 6 post on X, FBI Director Kash Patel called the group "deeply disturbing," adding that it is "critically important to understand what's out there and be aware of the threats American kids and families are facing every day." FBI Director Kash Patel, joined at right by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, answers questions as the Senate Intelligence Committee holds its worldwide threats hearing on Tuesday, March 25. "The criminals in these networks use online platforms to target vulnerable kids, coerce victims, and recruit others — often resulting in horrible cases of abuse. It is absolutely tragic — and I want people to know we're cracking down hard," he wrote. "Remember, last week we announced our agents and partners arrested two alleged leaders within 764. We've opened hundreds of cases around the country and our field offices are fully engaged. This is a priority for myself, [FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino], and our leadership team." Last week, the Justice Department announced the arrests of two suspected "764" leaders, including 21-year-old Leonidas Varagiannis, also known as War, and 20-year-old Prasan Nepal, also known as Trippy, of High Point, North Carolina, for their "crimes operating an international child exploitation enterprise in connection with a nihilistic violent extremist (NVE) network known as 764." All 55 FBI field offices across the country are involved in investigations into an online predator network known as "764." The two defendants allegedly operated a subgroup of 764, called 764 Inferno, through encrypted messaging platforms. They also allegedly ordered victims to self-harm, such as cutting "blood signs" into their skin, and engaged them in psychological torment and extreme violence using threat and manipulation tactics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney “was like watching a grand master in chess.” In recent weeks, Trump unveiled 10% tariffs against Canada that will take effect on July 9 and a 25% tariff on foreign automobiles. Carney and Trump met for the first time Tuesday since taking their respective offices. “What I witnessed was like watching a grand master in chess perform. President Trump has opened up a completely new relationship with Canada,” Miller said. “The prime minister of Canada talked about finally contributing their fair share to NATO's defense. Canada acknowledged the need to strike a fair trade deal with the United States, as President Trump has long asked for. Trump has floated a requirement that NATO countries spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense to remain in the alliance. Miller is facing a possible new job offer to replace former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who will now serve as the U.N. Trump has teased Miller as a possible replacement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday unveiled a pilot program for the National Institutes of Health to tap into Medicare and Medicaid data in its search for the root causes of autism. The database — which HHS said will draw from insurance claims, medical records and data from wearable technology such as smartwatches — is one of the first steps in HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid to find the causes of autism “by September.” Early signals from health officials that they would build a database to track autism were met with swift rebuke from advocacy organizations and doctors. NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya's initial description last month of a “new autism registry” with “broad coverage” of the US population raised red flags and questions about privacy, the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement shortly after the news. It said the NIH and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will start with a data use agreement focused on Medicare and Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and then establish a “secure tech-enabled mechanism” that will share data with “timely, privacy and security compliant data exchange.” The agencies will eventually build out the pilot database to share data on chronic illnesses and their economic burden, HHS said. “Ever since the registry was first announced, there was an enormous sense of fear in the autism community, and they have concerns: Who's going to have access to data? “If you're talking about Medicare and Medicaid, that only focuses on certain portions of the population.” Medicare is a federal program primarily for Americans 65 and older, although younger people with disabilities are also enrolled. There are permissible uses of CMS data for medical research but very stringent privacy laws, Jeff Wurzburg, former HHS general counsel and a health care regulatory attorney at Norton Rose Fulbright, said before Wednesday's announcement. An HHS spokesperson said Wednesday, “Data with personal identifiers are subject to federal privacy laws and regulations. This data platform would be fully compliant with these laws and regulations to protect Americans' sensitive health information.” Autism advocates and scientists have also questioned Kennedy's claim that health agencies would find the causes of autism by September, a timeline that Bhattacharya has already appeared to walk back. We're accelerating and cutting the red tape that normally comes with putting together a scientific program like this,” Bhattacharya said April 22. The lack of clarity around how this autism data would be used, who would have access to it and patients' consent to its use has spread fear throughout the community. The Autism Science Foundation was “flooded” with calls, emails and texts after Bhattacharya's initial comments about a registry, co-founder and President Alison Singer said. “The one that concerns me the most is people with autism who are saying that they're afraid to go to the doctor; families who have said they have concerns about their toddlers, but they're afraid to take them for diagnosis,” Singer said. Many in the autism community say RFK Jr. is pushing harmful and regressive rhetoric about who they are Singer said the foundation is supportive of registries, which can be valuable for tracking care and outcomes over time. “We've tried to allay the fear around a registry in general, but we can't really do that until there's more information shared from the administration about how it's going to be put together.” The HHS spokesperson said, “Let's be clear: this initiative is about advancing science, improving care, and supporting families. Kennedy later said he was speaking about people with “severe” autism. What are we looking to do here?” asked Clark, who also has two young children with autism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi said she is aware of reports that pizzas are being anonymously sent to judges' homes but withheld comment on the deliveries, which Democrats said are meant to be threatening. He described them as “threats intended to show that those seeking to intimidate the targeted judge know the judge's address or their family members' addresses.” “Some of these deliveries were made using the name of Judge Esther Salas's son, Daniel Anderl, who was murdered at the family's home by a former litigant who posed as a deliveryman.” During a brief Q&A session with reporters outside the West Wing of the White House, Bondi said she would speak with Ed Martin, President Donald Trump‘s nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, later Wednesday. “I'll be talking to Ed today and find out what's going on with that,” she said. Bondi was also asked about House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer‘s (R-KY) comment that files regarding Jeffrey Epstein are “missing.” “There are hundreds of victims, and no one victim will ever get released. It's just the volume, and that's what they're going through right now. “They found out, some of them, on Christmas Eve,” she said. Bondi will hold another press conference on Wednesday afternoon with FBI Director Kash Patel about Operation Restore Justice, a coordinated operation across 55 FBI field offices to “identify, track, and arrest child sex predators.” “It's a huge case that we've been working on, the FBI, all of my prosecutors.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deadline to get a REAL ID is almost here, after nearly two decades of postponements and delays. Matthew Nason of Vassalboro, Maine, who needed to file forms for his motorcycle, waits at the end of a long line at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles where many residents are applying for Real ID, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Augusta, Maine. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most airports around the United States operated smoothly Wednesday as new REAL ID requirements took effect because travelers without the updated document were still allowed to move through security easily. Those without the IDs were given flyers informing them that going forward they would need to present REAL ID or other federally accepted ID for air travel within the U.S. “You will need a REAL ID or other acceptable form of identification for your next flight or you may expect delays.” At Philadelphia International Airport, a TSA agent was pre-checking travelers' IDs as they entered the security check line. Agents had flyers ready for those who didn't have compliant IDs, according to Philadelphia Department of Aviation spokesperson Heather Redfern. Many airports reported wait times of a few minutes at security checkpoints on their websites on Wednesday morning, although some had longer waits. LaGuardia Airport reported no wait at one TSA PreCheck checkpoint and wait times ranging from 2 to 11 minutes in the general lines. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website showed wait times at its security checkpoints ranging from 5 to 16 minutes. Nashville International Airport reported a wait time of less than 20 minutes on Wednesday morning. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports most travelers must have a REAL ID now to fly in the U.S., or face extra screening. In Chicago, officials established a Real ID Supercenter for walk-in appointments, while officials in California and elsewhere planned to continue offering extended hours for the crush of appointments. “I'm here today so I won't be right on the deadline, which is tomorrow,” said Marion Henderson, who applied for her REAL ID on Tuesday in Jackson, Mississippi. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday assured people who don't yet have a REAL ID but need to take a domestic flight Wednesday that they will be able to fly after clearing additional identity checks. The Transportation Security Administration warned people who don't have identification that complies with REAL ID requirements to arrive early at the airport and be prepared for advanced screening to avoid causing delays. TSA posted on X that people may get additional screening but it wasn't clear how many passengers, if any, were pulled aside for extra screening. The new requirements have been the subject of many Reddit threads and Facebook group discussions in recent weeks, with numerous people expressing confusion about whether they can travel without a REAL ID, sharing details about wait times and seeking advice on how to meet the requirements. Noem told a congressional panel that 81% of travelers already have REAL IDs. She said security checkpoints will also be accepting passports and tribal identification, like they have already been doing. Those who still lack an identification that complies with the REAL ID law “may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step,” Noem said. “But people will be allowed to fly,” she said. REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that Homeland Security says is a more secure form of identification. It was a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission and signed into law in 2005. It was supposed to be rolled out in 2008 but the implementation had been repeatedly delayed. ¨The whole idea here is to better validate those individuals that were encountering a checkpoint to ensure they are who exactly they say they are,” said Thomas Carter, TSA's Federal Security Director in New Jersey. Carter said those without a REAL ID should give themselves extra time to clear security. Besides serving as a valid form of identification to fly domestically, people will also need a REAL ID to access certain federal buildings and facilities. State government offices that issue driver's licenses and state IDs have seen a significant increase in demand for REAL ID and some have extended their office hours to meet the demand. Some officials have recommended people wait for a while to get REAL ID compliant licenses and cards if they don't have flights planned in the next few months. “We are encouraging people who have passports or other REAL ID-compliant documents and people who don't have travel plans in the next few months to wait until after the current rush to apply for a REAL ID,” said Erin Johnson, a spokesperson with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Between rising sea levels from the climate crisis, a history of nuclear testing causing radioactive pollution and population displacement, the Marshall Islands face numerous threats. Now, the country – made up of 29 atolls and five main islands in the North Pacific – is shining a light on the struggles it faces by turning to an unlikely source: Soccer. To that end, the three British men behind the initiative – Matt Webb, Lloyd Owers and Justin Walley – have also created a new team kit. A quote from Marshallese poet Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner is also etched onto the shirt: “We deserve to thrive.” But it got even more attention when, with each photo post on social media of the new kit, parts of the shirt had disappeared; first a bit of a sleeve, next some from the midriff and then from the collar. According to analysis by NASA, sea levels in the Marshall Islands have risen by 10 centimeters (almost 3.94 inches) over the last 30 years and could rise by 19 centimeters (roughly 7.48 inches) over the next 30 years, leading to an increase in flooding with “worsening severity.” If no measures are taken, the islands are likely to face more than 100 days of flooding yearly by the end of the century. “There is an obligation to talk about aspects such as climate change, nuclear legacy. “It's a celebration of a rich culture of the Marshall Islands and, potentially, what could be lost if action isn't taken. We appreciate that climate change can be polarizing to some people and it's maybe not something they want to focus on in sport. But for us, it would be amiss if we didn't kind of reference it at all. And using sport as well, we've got such a huge platform where other outlets might not necessarily be able to touch upon that.” The Marshall Islands Soccer Federation was founded in 2020 by President Shem Livai because his son was an avid soccer fan, but there was no structure for kids to play. Webb and Owers both have experience in the Beautiful Game prior to this endeavor. Webb's day job is in marketing but he has previously been involved in soccer administration and founding clubs, while Owers has previously worked as a coach and helped in forming coaching programs for teams in the UK and abroad. Webb recalls finding Livai on social media and eventually his email before “peppering” him with messages offering his services as a volunteer until Livai, as the Brit recounts, “relented.” Owers was introduced by a mutual connection after which he was appointed technical director and the pair set about revamping the federation. Webb admits that they faced some skepticism from locals in the early months – “‘What are you doing? You're saying you're Marshall Islands Soccer Federation, but you're doing this from the UK,'” he remembers being asked – but have since developed relationships and connections to establish their credibility as keen volunteers. While many of the youngsters on the island may be fans of soccer, Webb explains, the lack of accessibility to adequate facilities and coaching means few play it regularly. Webb and Owers set about using futsal – a scaled-down version of regular soccer played with five players on each team and on smaller pitches – to increase playing time, using the abundance of basketball courts as venues. But, due to the geographic make-up of the islands, space is at a premium when it comes to full-size 11-a-side pitches, which FIFA recommends have the dimensions of 105 meters (almost 344.5 feet) x 68 meters (almost 223.1 feet). “You've got oceans on one side, and it's basically a circular lagoon on the inside as well. So there's points on your island where it's just one road separating the ocean to the lagoon. The country did build a stadium for the Micronesian Games last summer, which gives the islands a useable pitch, but it still has no goals even now. They have focused on acquiring equipment, creating opportunities to play and providing coaches for the Marshallese people to get a taste of what the Beautiful Game can bring. While they are hoping that this next generation of soccer-mad youngsters will provide the bedrock for a blossoming Marshall Islands national team, their current crop of players is made up of young adults and expatriates from surrounding islands, such as Solomon Islands, Fiji and Kiribati. Webb explains: “We can take it for granted, the ability to move freely between places, but for some of these lads, it's the first time off island or traveling by plane and seeing new things and meeting new people. So there's that kind of personal impact you're having on people's lives.” Both Webb and Owers are unequivocal in their aim of having the Marshall Islands being involved in the qualification process for a FIFA World Cup. The first step on that journey is the four-team tournament in August in Arkansas, their first 11-a-side matches against other international teams. They have started a fundraiser for the tournament, which they see as an opportunity to bring Marshallese people together. “We want to be in a position to allow every Marshallese person the opportunity to be a part of our project regardless of where they are in the world,” Owers said. “Uniting everyone in a different place is another opportunity for us to do that. “I think, as a byproduct of it, hopefully this then propels the project into something where we're in front of those confederations that we've applied for. They've got more awareness of what we're doing, and seeing the journey and the development of where we were, where we've gone, and then where we want to be, and hopefully using this as a bit of a platform to push on from that.” He talks about how much the islanders value community, which too is under threat, as more families emigrate to the US to avoid the impacts of climate change. But Webb believes soccer can help bring the Marshallese together. “We want to unite people through a medium of sport, and hopefully raise awareness to those issues that people face on daily basis.</p>

ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt says that federal action against antisemitism on college campuses is 'long overdue' but warned the Trump administration risks overreach. Dave Portnoy has weighed in, at times furiously, and offered one of the men a trip to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust as penance for the antisemitic incident. However, that offer has since been revoked. Barstool founder and CEO Dave Portnoy is seen before the Florida Atlantic Owls and Loyola (Il) Ramblers game in the Barstool Invitational at Wintrust Arena on Nov. 8, 2023 in Chicago. Mo Khan, who Portnoy identified as one of the men involved in the incident, released a statement about the antisemitic incident and accused Portnoy of sensationalizing it to his millions of social media followers. He implored those who watched his video to donate to his GiveSendGo fundraiser and blamed Portnoy for the attacks he has received. "Although I had nothing to do with the sign coming out, nor do I know who did it, I know that the sign was provocative because it reminded people of the unjust things Israel is doing around the world, thus leading me to report on it," Khan said, reupping his claim that he was a "citizen journalist" in the matter. "Dave Portnoy and his friends can choose to be triggered over the sentiments of that sign and even kick me out of the establishment forever. However, they have no right to destroy my life over free speech and ultimately something that was an edgy joke. Frankly, they're more worried about destroying and uprooting me than the thousands of people getting destroyed and uprooted in genocide." Khan said he was suspended from his university, lost an internship and received death threats over the incident. Khan said when he agreed to Portnoy's offer of an Auschwitz trip, he was making those statements "under duress" because he does not have the means or connections that Portnoy has. He said Portnoy is "hypocritically lynching me" and trying to cancel him while building a business based on an anti-cancel culture. Dave Portnoy visits "The Megyn Kelly Show" at SiriusXM Studios on May 1, 2025 in New York City. "Dave Portnoy owes me restitutions and an apology for everything he has done and caused for me in these past few days," Khan said. "In an attempt to expose me, he exposed himself as almost a total fraud, going back on anything he stands for." Portnoy responded to Khan's statement later Tuesday. "I talked to him on the phone with his buddy and they both owned up to it and cried about it. He then lawyered up after speaking with his family," Portnoy wrote. "His name got out because he's a moron and uploaded ‘f--- the Jews' sign to his Instagram before I even knew about it. He spreads hate and uses the conflict in Middle East as his excuse. I'm sure he'll make money because there is lots of antisemitism in the world. Regardless this is the least surprising thing ever. Dave Portnoy believes "credibility with the audience" is a key to success. Portnoy said in a separate video he felt "dumb" trying to "show grace" and make things right.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo's eldest son has earned his first call-up for the Portugal Under-15 national squad, the team announced on Tuesday. Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., 14, has been selected for the Portugal team which will take part in the Vlatko Marković International Tournament – a youth soccer tournament – later in May. Ronaldo Sr., who is the record goalscorer in men's international soccer with 136 goals for Portugal, congratulated his son on his Instagram Stories by posting a picture of his name on the squad list, saying: “Proud of you, son!” Ronaldo Jr. will be part of the Portugal team which will face Japan, Greece and England, as well as another game in Croatia. Ronaldo Jr. plays in the youth system at Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, the same club where his father plies his trade having joined in December 2022. He has followed in his dad's footsteps over his nascent soccer career, playing in the youth systems at Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United while his dad played for the first team. Clips of Ronaldo Jr. mimicking his dad's famous “Siu” goal celebration have gone viral on social media and, according to reports, he scored 58 goals while he was with Juventus' youth set-up. Following the announcement of Ronaldo Jr.'s call-up, the official Portugal team Instagram account posted a picture of father and son together with the caption: “Portugal's DNA” which Ronaldo reposted on his IG Stories. Ronaldo, 40, has four other children. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? On Tuesday, May 13, a three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade will hear a lawsuit asking it to strike down President Donald Trump's recently imposed tariffs. The trade court, a New York-based federal court that hears lawsuits related to US trade laws, will not be the last word on this high-stakes dispute, which is likely to wind up before the Supreme Court. Selections, small businesses that import goods and thus must pay the tariffs, have two significant advantages. One is that their legal arguments are quite strong. Under the Supreme Court's “major questions doctrine,” courts are supposed to cast a skeptical eye on, and typically reject, executive actions “of vast ‘economic and political significance. If that's not a matter of vast economic and political significance, it's hard to imagine what is. Two, about a dozen former Republican officials and other GOP luminaries filed an amicus brief calling on the trade court to rule that the tariffs are illegal. Among them is former Sen. John Danforth, a mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas who gave Thomas his first job out of law school. The Supreme Court's Republican majority is often responsive to conservative legal elites and prominent members of their party. The IEEPA permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” This power, however, “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.” The strongest statutory argument against the tariffs is that Trump has not identified an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that can justify these tariffs. In his executive order laying out the rationale for most of his tariffs, Trump claims they are necessary due to “large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits,” meaning that the fact that there are many countries that buy more US goods than they sell to Americans constitutes a “national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve.” But, as the amicus brief argues, this trade deficit is hardly unusual or extraordinary — rather, it is the result of “economic trends spanning more than two decades.” Emergency powers, the brief argues, cannot be used to address “longstanding policy grievances” that have existed for many years — those are the sort of grievances that can be addressed through legislative debate and congressional action. It even cites a federal district court decision claiming that “no court has ever reviewed the merits of such a declaration.” It uses much stronger language, saying that these powers “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.” Thus, even if courts cannot review Trump's decision to declare an emergency, opponents of the tariffs have a strong argument that judges can inquire into whether decades-old trade deficits actually constitute an “unusual or extraordinary threat.” '” That is, if a law doesn't explicitly grant the executive branch a power, it doesn't have that power. In response, Trump's lawyers make two closely related arguments. Again, the major questions doctrine is brand new and has never been used to strike down the policies of any president not named “Joe Biden.” All of the Biden-era cases invoking this doctrine involved domestic policies that technically were promulgated by agency leaders under Biden's supervision (or, in one case, a holdover policy from the Obama administration) rather than by a direct order from Biden himself. The major questions doctrine was made up by the Supreme Court and appears nowhere in the Constitution or in any federal statute, so lower court judges have very little to go upon when they are asked to apply it to new situations. To my knowledge, only one federal judge — Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee — has addressed the question of whether this doctrine applies to presidential actions. It is also unclear how the courts will respond to Trump's suggestion that the major questions doctrine applies with less force on matters of foreign policy. It is true that the courts are often deferential to the elected branches on questions of foreign affairs, but Trump's tariffs aren't just a foreign policy matter. They are one of the largest tax hikes in recent American history and one of the most consequential domestic policies enacted in many years. Trump justifies the tariffs in large part because he believes they will increase the number of Americans employed in domestic manufacturing jobs. Don't blame Joe Rogan too much — one theory says that the roots of this gender gap go back decades. Prices are rising due to Trump's tariffs — but not universally just yet. The president's economic policy has put unions in an awkward position. It's time to take a hard look at your own finances — and theirs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Being able to predict the future seems nice. I would've liked to know that my S&P 500 index funds would peak in mid-February and then fall off a cliff in April. The art of systematically making these kinds of predictions is called forecasting, and we've known for a long time that some people — so-called superforecasters — are better at it than others. But even they aren't Nostradamuses; major events still surprise them sometimes. It's also hard for us mortals to emulate what makes them so effective. I wrote a whole profile of one of the world's best superforecaster teams, called the Samotsvety group, and despite their tips and tricks, I didn't leave the experience as a superforecaster myself. But you know what's sometimes better at learning than I am? More specialized fields have, of course, been doing this in various forms for a while; algorithmic trading in financial markets, for instance, where computer programs using various prediction tools trade assets without human intervention, has been around for decades. The best evidence for this comes from tournaments run quarterly by Metaculus, a leading prediction website, where participants compete to forecast the future most accurately. Originally for humans only, Metaculus recently began bot tournaments, where contestants enter custom-made AI-driven bots whose track record can then be compared to the best human predictors. (If you want to try, there's a $30,000 prize for each quarter's winner.) But the gap, Metaculus CEO Deger Turan tells me, is narrowing with each quarter. o1 is no longer the cutting-edge OpenAI model; as of this writing, it's o3. All of which is to say: While humans basically stay the same, the AIs are only getting better, and that could mean that the predictions they make will only get better as well. Almost every arena of human life relies on good prediction. Lawyers predict whether or not their opponent will agree to a settlement. Construction supervisors predict when a building project will finish. Movie producers predict what script will be a hit. Singles predict whether the person they're chatting up would prefer a first date over coffee or beer. In theory, an “AI forecaster” is just a program that relies upon machine learning models of one form or another to predict future events. Prediction is at the heart of what machine learning models do: They analyze vast reams of data and then come up with models that can predict outside that data. For more generalized predictions about world events, forecasters these days tend to rely heavily on general-purpose models from firms like xAI, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, or Anthropic. These are trained with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of GPUs over several months, which is one reason why it's much more promising for the relatively small teams working on using AI for forecasting to piggyback on all that training than to start from scratch. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. One of Anthropic's early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect.) Forecasting is a world unto itself, with plenty of forecasting-specific jargon and references. Here's a brief guide to some common terms you'll hear in the forecasting world. Establishing your base rate is often the first step in forecasting. Brier score: A common measure of how accurate forecasts turn out to be. Metaculus: A popular website where forecasters can make predictions and compare accuracy. Prediction market: A stock-type market, usually online, where participants can bet real currency, cryptocurrency, or play money on specific events happening or not. One team based at the Center for AI Safety released a paper in October 2024 claiming “superhuman” forecasting ability by simply prompting a large language model (in this case, OpenAI's 4o model) and scraping recent news articles. That claim crumbled under scrutiny: Other researchers could not replicate the finding, and it appeared that the model could predict well in training partly because it had more recent data than it should've, a problem called “data contamination.” Imagine if you are, in late 2024, trying to train a model to predict who the Democratic nominee that year will be; you know it will be Kamala Harris, but to train the model, you try to only give it data from before that became obvious. If that data, though, isn't purely from early 2024, and includes references to Harris's eventual nomination, your forecast could perform very well, but only because it has access to data it'd never have in a real-world context. A more promising approach comes from UC Berkeley computer scientists Danny Halawi, Fred Zhang, Chen Yueh-Han, and Jacob Steinhardt. Their forecaster also relied on language models, but did extensive amounts of “scaffolding”: instead of simply letting the bot run free, they asked the language model to do a series of very specific things, in a very specific order, to get the final result: Just asking the language models directly, they found, led to terrible predictions: “Most models' scores are around or worse than random guessing,” the team wrote in their paper. But once they were able to fine-tune models by showing what thousands of successful predictions (and their underlying reasoning) looked like, the results were much better. The resulting forecasting bot got 71.5 percent of questions correct. That's impressive, but progress since has been fairly slow. “Arguably, from an academic perspective, nothing has surpassed [UC Berkeley's] Steinhardt's paper, which is now a full year old,” Dan Schwarz, CEO of the startup FutureSearch, which builds AI-based forecasting tools, told me. A full year may not sound like much, but that's because you're thinking in human terms. In the world of AI, a year is an eternity. ​That fact underlines something Schwarz and other entrepreneurs working on AI for forecasting told me: this stuff is harder than it looks. One limitation is, ironically, that language models are not great quantitative thinkers or logical reasoners. But language models don't think logically and systematically enough to know that. Turan, the CEO of forecasting platform Metaculus, notes that a few bots that entered into the platform's contests have tried to impose this kind of consistency on them and were designed so as to force forecasts to be internally consistent. “They end up having way better results,” Turan says. Phil Godzin, a software engineer who won the fourth-quarter 2024 contest, has explained that the first step in his model is “asking an LLM to group related questions together and predict them in batches to maintain internal consistency.” This limitation may become less important due to the dawn of “reasoning models,” like OpenAI's o3/o4-mini and DeepSeek's R1. These models differ from previous language models in that they undergo extensive late-stage training to ensure they give correct answers to logical and mathematical questions that can be easily checked (like “how many ‘r's are in ‘strawberry'”). They are also typically designed to use more computing power when queried, to ensure these kinds of questions are answered accurately. Schwarz of FutureSearch cites poor web research skills as a crucial bottleneck. Despite rollouts of flashy features like ChatGPT's “Deep Research” mode, collation of basic facts about a given situation is still a major challenge for AI models. FutureSearch this week revealed Deep Research Bench, an attempt to provide a benchmark for web-based research done by leading LLMs. It finds that, as of May 2025, even the best models struggle mightily with routine research tasks. The “Find Number” task, for instance, asked models to find a specific data point (e.g., how many FDA medical device recalls there have been in history). The models did even worse at more complex tasks, like locating whole data sets. FutureSearch estimates that a competent, smart, but fallible human should be able to get 0.8. “We can conclude that frontier agents under low elicitation substantially underperform smart generalist researchers who are given ample time,” the authors conclude. Sure, AIs have limitations, but ChatGPT was introduced just two and a half years ago, and they're already nipping at humans' heels. Good forecasting requires you to be honest about your mistakes and to learn from them; to change your views all the time, by little increments, rather than suddenly and all at once; and to not be distracted by what's prominently in the news and being discussed around you, but give proper weight to all the information you're receiving. Humans aren't especially good at any of that. We tend to base our beliefs on many topics on a single piece of information, often information that isn't even relevant. It stands to reason that AIs could be better at all of this. The psychologist who coauthored it, the University of Pennsylvania's Philip Tetlock, based it on research that had been ongoing for decades before that. Yet it's fair to say that, friendly coverage from folks like me aside, the idea that there are clear strategies that enable you to better predict the future hasn't set the world on fire. When the New York Times reports on border tensions in India and Pakistan, it does not cite superforecasters' view on likely outcomes. The White House does not ask superforecasters for a prediction on how China might respond to higher tariffs. This raises an important corollary question: If the world doesn't have a ton of demand for human superforecasting, would that change at all if it's done by machines? This worry might account for the relatively small scale of most AI forecasting efforts. Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other leading labs aren't prioritizing it. That said, there are good reasons to think superhuman AI forecasting that is forecasting better than the best humans today would be a big deal. Human forecasters require time, energy, and resources to make good forecasts; they can't spit out an accurate probability estimate in a matter of minutes. Compare how useful a research librarian who takes a few weeks to send you a stack of useful books would have been before the dawn of the internet, to the ability to search Google today. A good librarian's output might even be more useful. But getting results instantly is incredibly important, and massively increases demand for the service. Ben Turtel, a cofounder of Lightning Rod AI, imagines his forecasting AI being especially useful in cases where someone has a lot of unstructured data that the forecaster can evaluate quickly. Take, for instance, a nurse or doctor trying to anticipate a patient's trajectory based on scattered notes in their medical records, plus evidence from studies correlating outcomes with patient attributes like whether they smoke or their age. Similarly, companies that operate abroad often pay for political risk consultants that purport to tell them, say, “how dangerous is it to be working in Jordan right now,” or “what are the odds that a coup happens in Myanmar while we're working there.” Demonstrably superhuman AI forecasting might change that work considerably, and could threaten a lot of those consultancies — if those AI forecasts were trusted. An AI superforecaster would be, if nothing else, a deeply strange entity. Imagine going up to America's octogenarian president and saying, “We made an oracle out of silicon, and it is now better at predicting wars than the CIA. Even if you can prove a model is better than human experts on some class of problems, there'll be a long way to go before relevant decision-makers would truly believe and internalize that fact. The black-box nature of modern LLMs is part of the problem: If you ask one for a prediction, we don't ultimately know what computation it's doing to come to that answer. We might see a hybrid period first, where LLMs are asked for explanations of their predictions and decision makers only act on their judgment if the explanations make sense. Even still, acting on AI advice in some contexts, like medicine, could open risk-averse providers and administrators to lawsuits or worse. But we can get accustomed to what feels strange. In the 2000s, the website was popular and gradually improving in quality, but there were strong norms against citing it or relying upon it. But over time, those norms eroded as it became clear that on many topics, Wikipedia was equally or more accurate than more traditional sources. Then they're a guilty pleasure that many secretly count on.

The seal of the National Transportation Safety Board is seen before a news conference at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Jan. 31, 2025, in Arlington, Va. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) The vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board has been abruptly removed from his position, the White House confirmed Tuesday, a rare move that comes as the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters juggles more than 1,000 cases. The White House didn't say why he was removed and Brown has not publicly commented. The decision comes as NTSB investigates nearly 1,250 active cases across the U.S., while supporting more than 160 foreign investigations, according to March testimony by NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. The investigations include the deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people in January and the medical transport plane that plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood that same month, killing eight people. It's also investigating the catastrophic collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge in March 2024, which killed six construction workers. Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said he has never seen an administration remove a member of the board. Board members have been known to stay on after their term is over if the administration hasn't appointed anyone yet and then they leave once the next administration selects someone else, he said. “That happens a lot over the years, but that's normal and expected because you served your term and now it's time for someone else to serve in there,” he said. This was just more abrupt and directly from the administration, and I don't know what the impetus is.” By Tuesday evening, Brown's photo and biography had already been removed from NTSB's website. The chairman and vice chairman are both designated by the president and serve for three years. Brown was sworn in as a member of the board in April 2024 after being nominated by then-President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to fill one of two vacancies. The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators. It typically works on about 2,200 domestic and 450 foreign cases each year, according to Homendy. She said she expects “the number of cases annually to remain high and continue to increase in complexity.” Homendy often presents NTSB as a lean agency “that plays a vital role in ensuring public safety and protection of life and property,” although she did ask for modest budget increases last year and this year. Associated Press writer Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.</p>

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A security guard was charged Tuesday with murder in the shooting death of the dean of a small technical college near Los Angeles, officials said. The dean of student affairs, Cameisha Denise Clark, died at the hospital Monday after being shot Friday afternoon at the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology campus in Inglewood, according to family. Another female employee was wounded in the shooting. Jesse Figueroa, 40, was charged with murder, attempted murder and several counts for possessing a firearm as a felon. He also faces gun sentencing enhancements, which can lead to additional penalties when a gun is used during a crime. Figueroa will appear in court May 29 and faces a maximum sentence of life in state prison if convicted as charged. His public defender did not respond to request for comment. The technical college's campus president, Chris Becker, said Figueroa worked for a company that provides security to the school. Inglewood Mayor James Butts said last week it appeared to be an incident of workplace violence, but charging documents did not lay out a possible motive. Clark's family said she had been recently promoted to dean at the school.</p>
