                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has ruled that the men's professional tennis tour cannot retaliate against players who join an ongoing lawsuit against it, nor against players who consider joining the lawsuit. After the filing of that lawsuit, the ATP Tour circulated a letter to be signed by its players. Garnett ruled that the circulation of that letter, and a specific instance in which an ATP board member pressured two players to sign it, amounted to ‚Äúcoercive, deceptive, or potentially abusive‚Äù behavior. She also ordered the ATP to within seven days circulate and post a letter to players, making it clear that they cannot be punished or threatened with punishment for joining litigation against the organization. The letter, known as a corrective action, informs players that ‚ÄúATP Tour Inc. is legally prohibited from retaliating in any way or threatening retaliation, directly or indirectly, against you for considering participating in or ultimately deciding to participate in this lawsuit.‚Äù The PTPA, co-founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, has spent much of the past year convincing players that they would not experience retaliation for being a named plaintiff on the lawsuit, or for supporting it. Twelve players elected to be named plaintiffs. Of the six ATP players, three have retired from tennis. None of the other three are ranked inside the top 90, though Nick Kyrgios has been ranked as high as world No. A number of top players declined to join the lawsuit, fearing retribution or a loss of potential prize money, playing opportunities and benefits. He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He claimed his biggest title at the Indian Wells Masters and the Brit has reached a career-high ranking of number five. Jack Draper is looking to build on these results ahead of what he hopes to have a strong French Open campaign. He aimed to become the first British man since Andy Murray to triumph in the Spanish capital, but Casper Ruud had other ideas as he completed a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 win to lift his first Masters 1000 title. Draper's performances on clay are a work in progress and after a solid run in Madrid, he identified three things that he wants to improve on the surface with the French Open on the horizon. I'm a lot more comfortable moving on the hard courts and that sort of thing,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúI think on the clay, my movement can be better. Jack Draper, what a tournament that was üß°@jackdraper0 finishes runner up in the Madrid Open final, with Casper Ruud taking the win 7-5, 3-6, 6-4#BackTheBrits üá¨üáß | @MutuaMadridOpen pic.twitter.com/ESxthexoeS ‚ÄúI think my defense and my attack, the mix of that has got really a lot better, but I think there's so many chances I'm getting to come forward to the net. I think I need to keep on coming forward more to finish off the points and put more pressure on my opponents. ‚ÄúYeah, I think mentally as well, like more exposure to these big matches and key moments I'm going to get better. I've definitely been someone who has struggled in the past with injuries and, you know, not lasting as long as I wanted to, but that's improving all the time as well. ‚ÄúBut again, nowhere near where I want to be, so I think, yeah, there's plenty of things that are going to keep on improving, and I'm going to keep on getting better and better. This year Draper will start his campaign in the second round and will take on either home favourite Luciano Darderi or Yunchaokete Bu. The pair will play one another on Wednesday to determine who Draper's first opponent of the Italian Open will be.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis champion Laura Robson has experienced some incredible moments during her career, from winning Junior Wimbledon at the age of 14 to scooping a silver medal with her mixed doubles partner, Andy Murray, at the London Olympics. But off court, one of her greatest memories is of spending time with the Princess of Wales when they spectated together at Wimbledon, describing the special day as "a really cool experience". "We went out to watch [British female No. 1] Katie Boulter, and then she was going for lunch with Roger Federer afterwards because they were all in the royal box that day. "I think it's just great to see someone like that support tennis and to have such a passion for it, and the rest of her family are always at Wimbledon as well, so the more support the better." After being forced to end her playing career in 2022 due to injury, Laura, 31, is now behind one of the most hotly anticipated dates on the British tennis calendar: she is tournament director for the new Women's WTA 500 event at London's historic The Queen's Club. "I would love to see her at the women's event here." Her enthusiasm for the new event ‚Äì running from 9-15 June ‚Äì is infectious. British tennis stars Katie ‚Äì a good friend of Laura's ‚Äì and Emma Raducanu are hoping to play, as are Australian Open champion Madison Keys, four-time major winner Naomi Osaka and last year's Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova. "The women have known about the club for so long but have never been able to play here." Many will wonder why women's tournament tennis stopped more than 50 years ago at the ¬£15,000-a-year members' club. Laura explains: "Because of the site being what it is, the tournament couldn't grow as a combined event, which is what it was then. That's where tournaments like Nottingham [where Laura was tournament director from 2022 until 2024] and Eastbourne came about, and they were women-specific for a while." Now, though, it makes sense that the four biggest UK tournaments are all male and female events, Laura says. "Hopefully people will see it [Queen's] as a two-week tennis festival and come to both." She's already implemented a crucial change in her new role: this year will see the introduction of a children's creche for players' and coaches' families. "A lot of players rent houses rather than stay at hotels across these weeks and they want to bring their kids," she explains. "It really feels like a club experience, whereas Wimbledon is huge and you're so far away from the players. Queen's is so intimate, you're going to see the best players in the world from a really close standpoint." "I'm hesitant to say one person, but I think as a director of a British tournament, you always want the Brits to do well," she says with a smile. to get the magazine delivered free to your door every week or purchase the digital edition online via our Apple or Google apps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu is working with coach Mark Petchey to disguise her service motion, adding more shoulder turn and power in time for Wimbledon this summer; watch Raducanu in the first round of the Italian Open from approximately 4pm on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports Tennis Emma Raducanu's promising performances at the Madrid Open have not gone unnoticed with coach Mark Petchey working on elevating her serve in time for Wimbledon. The 22-year-old posted her first win on outdoor clay courts since 2022 with a straight-sets victory over Suzan Lamens in the Spanish capital but her hopes of another strong WTA 1000 run ended with a second-round loss to Marta Kostyuk. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Colin Fleming felt clay novice Raducanu could take a lot from her defeat against world No 36 Kostyuk, who is seen as a specialist on the red dirt. I think she can still have some great results in this clay-court season and I think it will serve her well for beyond that into the grass and the hard. Fleming also said Raducanu gave a clear indication of what she has been working on alongside coach Petchey since he came on board for their ad-hoc partnership after mentoring her at the Miami Open. Petchey has previously coached former world No 1 Andy Murray into the world's top 50, splitting in 2006 after less than 12 months together, and briefly worked with Greek ace Maria Sakkari. "She's gone back to her more natural service motion since working with Mark Petchey recently," revealed Fleming. "She has done a bit of work with Nick Cavaday [former coach] on adjusting the motion. Trying to get the serve bigger, more impactful during matches. Former four-time Grand Slam champion turned tennis analyst, Jim Courier, hopes Raducanu will give his colleague Petchey the opportunity to work through the grass season, where he believes she can thrive. "Relying on someone that she knew before it happened is really important so I don't know how long it can last, but frankly the fact that they're spending time together right now is really important. What I do hope is that it's able to last at least through the grass-court season. Courier also indicated the young Brit has been working on masking her service motion and adding more potency in preparation for Wimbledon which begins on June 30. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Courier added: "What I do know already is he's changed her service motion by adding more shoulder turn which the idea is to try and give her a little bit more disguise and a little more power. But I think overall this is a net positive for her on so many levels, we'll see where it goes." Raducanu has been without a permanent coach since parting ways with Nick Cavaday in January. Before adding Petchey to her team, the British tennis star had a two-week trial period with Vladimir Platenik.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Up-and-coming Canadian tennis player Victoria Mboko, shown in this handout photo. ROME - Canadians Bianca Andreescu and Victoria Mboko cruised to wins over local favourites Wednesday in opening-round action at the Italian Open WTA 1000 tennis tournament. Andreescu, from Mississauga, Ont., faced few problems from Italy's Federica Urgesi in a 6-0, 6-3 victory, winning 97.1 per cent of first service points without facing a break point in a dominant first set. Andreescu put the game away with her six break-point conversion on 10 chances. Andreescu will face 20th-seed Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round. Vekic won the only other match between the two at last year's Paris Olympics, which was also played on clay. Earlier, Toronto's Mboko posted a comfortable 6-2, 6-3 victory over Italy's Arianna Zucchini Mboko, who advanced to her second career 1000-series event through qualifying, converted six break points, including three in a sequence that saw the 18-year-old Canadian and Zucchini trade breaks over the final five games of the second set. Mboko, ranked 158th in the world, has compiled a 33-3 record this season while racking up five titles on the lower-tier ITF circuit. Felix Auger-Aliassime and Gabriel Diallo, both from Montreal, and Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., are entered on the men's side. Diallo faces American Marcos Giron in first-round action Thursday while Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov have byes. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 7, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Azarenka weighed in on the Jannik Sinner saga and outlined just how she'd fix her sport.ByDavid KanePublished May 07, 2025 copy_link ROME, Italy‚Äî Victoria Azarenka shook her head as she walked out of a press conference at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.‚ÄúI'm surprised I didn't have any non-match related questions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI really like Jannik, personally,‚Äù she opened on Wednesday after a first-round victory over Camila Osorio. I don't know him too well, but it's hard for me to be too critical in a personal sense.‚ÄúIn terms of professional, I think there are discrepancies, where I don't believe all players are treated the same. I think there are a lot of different questions in terms of how things were conducted.‚ÄùA player committee member of the International Tennis Integrity Association (ITIA), Azarenka is up to date on all current anti-doping cases, including the recent decision regarding Australian doubles champion Max Purcell, and feels the current system is too reliant on the structure set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to adapt as she feels is necessary to fit a tennis-specific landscape. I think there are a lot of different questions in terms of how things were conducted.‚ÄùA player committee member of the International Tennis Integrity Association (ITIA), Azarenka is up to date on all current anti-doping cases, including the recent decision regarding Australian doubles champion Max Purcell, and feels the current system is too reliant on the structure set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to adapt as she feels is necessary to fit a tennis-specific landscape. There's a lot of sports coming up and giving us competition. We need to keep making those strides forward too. ‚ÄúOtherwise, we'd have to take ourselves out of the Olympic pool, which I don't necessarily think a bad idea.‚ÄúWe're often asked, ‚ÄòHow do you feel about [the system]?' How I feel about it doesn't really matter. Is there a modification that needs to be made? ‚ÄúWell, there's a legal aspect to it; I understand that. But, you know, it's a little bit on the edge.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe're often asked, ‚ÄòHow do you feel about [the system]?' How I feel about it doesn't really matter. Is there a modification that needs to be made? ‚ÄúWell, there's a legal aspect to it; I understand that. But, you know, it's a little bit on the edge.‚Äù The two-time Australian Open champion, who has been struggling with injuries since last season, conceded that the legal element of anti-doping cases further complicate‚Äîand sometimes obscure‚Äîthe issue, citing the secrecy surrounding Sinner's positive tests for the banned substance Clostebol.‚ÄúIf you talk about Jannik Sinner's case, people will ask why nobody knew,‚Äù said Azarenka. ‚ÄúWell, there's a legal aspect to it; I understand that. But, you know, it's a little bit on the edge.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you talk about Jannik Sinner's case, people will ask why nobody knew,‚Äù said Azarenka. ‚ÄúWell, there's a legal aspect to it; I understand that. But, you know, it's a little bit on the edge.‚Äù It's a big problem is that we're under WADA and WADA only has specific windows when they look to make changes to their rules.‚ÄúI don't think I have all the answers, but there are valid questions that could be asked and see if it makes sense.‚Äù Though she praised the ITIA's efforts to educate players‚Äîthe organization offers in-person workshops at tournaments‚Äîshe argued for transparency over bureaucracy.‚ÄúI think overall, there has to be better integrity from the organization, personally. It's a big problem is that we're under WADA and WADA only has specific windows when they look to make changes to their rules.‚ÄúI don't think I have all the answers, but there are valid questions that could be asked and see if it makes sense.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think overall, there has to be better integrity from the organization, personally.

A meditation on anti-doping and corruption gave way to Azarenka's broader wishlist of what she'd change in the sport.

She was a runner-up to Iga Swiatek in Rome last year. ‚ÄúWell, honestly, that's a good problem to have,‚Äù Sabalenka said in her pre-tournament press conference. ‚ÄúWhat I'm actually proud of [is] that I was able to come back in those finals and I was able to change things and see if the lesson was learned, try to bring better tennis in the next final.‚Äù READ NEXT: WTA Rankings: Points being dropped by Sabalenka, Swiatek, Gauff, Pegula at the Italian Open Aryna Sabalenka can emulate three former world No 1s with a stellar feat if she wins in Rome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian ATP star Nick Kyrgios took a harsh jab at Jannik Sinner ahead of his return at the 2025 Italian Open. This came amid the 3-time Grand Slam champion's return from serving a 3-month-long ban after testing positive for a banned substance. Sinner was imposed with a three-month ban after testing positive for the banned drug Clostebol. He started the feud by posting on social media, saying that players with better resources get easier treatment. The controversy began after a tennis insider named Scott Barclay showcased firm belief in Jannik Sinner's potential. Nick Kyrgios couldn't stop himself from being a part of the conversation and snubbed Sinner's chances to secure a top position in the upcoming event, using brutal satire. Kyrgios made a comeback in 2025 after keeping out of competition for more than 2 years. However, the Aussie couldn't handle the pressure, facing opening round exits in Brisbane, Melbourne and Indian Wells. Jannik Sinner expressed mixed emotions during the doping ban. The Italian player mentioned how he never really wanted to accept the ban, but his conscience asked him to move past the controversy as soon as possible. Although he had to miss four crucial Masters 1000 events in the last months, the 23-year-old expressed relief over not missing out on any Grand Slams. Although Sinner admitted to not setting his expectations high for the upcoming event, he is preparing to compete against the top-ranked rivals, including Alexander Zverev, Carlos Alcaraz and others. The Italian will look to chase his 20th tour-level title, with his comeback showdown scheduled for May 9.</p>

She will face either Elina Avanesyan or Elisabetta Cocciaretto in Round-2. A familiar foe in Danielle Collins could potentially await the defending Roland Garros champion in the Round of 32. Provided Swiatek makes it through to the Round of 16, fans could be treated to a blockbuster clash against No. As per the seeding, either Jessica Pegula or Jasmine Paolini will be Swiatek's possible semifinal opponents before a potential rematch against World No. Can Iga Swiatek retain her coveted crowns in Rome and Paris this year? Rest assured, she will gather some much-needed confidence and momentum before heading to Wimbledon if she can.

An odd stage of his professional career is what Daniil Medvedev is going through at the moment, with his title drought becoming alarming. The former world number 1 and Grand Slam winner hasn't lifted a trophy since his victory at the Foro It√°lico two years ago. In the press conference before the 2025 Rome ATP Masters 1000, he expressed his feelings on that and other topics. Many believe his best days are behind him and that Daniil Medvedev needs to embrace a change in his career trajectory. However, a born winner like the Russian is not going to give up easily. He has gone two years without a single title, dropped out of the top 10, and his game seems to have lost that genuine spark that characterized him during his major successes. He discussed this in the lead-up to the 2025 Rome ATP Masters 1000, an event that could be crucial for him. "I feel that winning here two years ago gave me a lot of serenity and helped me better understand this surface. Obviously, I prefer to play on hard courts, but since I became champion at the Foro It√°lico, I haven't lost my temper on a clay court again; I am a more optimistic person and believe much more in my chances of achieving good results. When asked about the importance of factors like confidence and what his main motivations are now that it seems his prime has passed, Daniil Medvedev is firm. "My motivation is to be better every day. What I'm clear on is that when I retire from tennis, I want to do it knowing that I gave my best and have nothing to regret," affirmed a man who will strive to return to the top 10 at this 2025 Rome ATP Masters 1000. You can read the original news, Medvedev: "Quiero retirarme del tenis y sentir que di todo lo que ten√≠a"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday afternoon, 133 Cardinals representing some 70 countries will gather in the Sistine Chapel to begin the age-old process of selecting the successor to Pope Francis. At the same time, a mere four kilometers away, another global selection process will be underway at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Forty-nine of the Top 50 players in the PIF WTA Rankings are scheduled to begin play on Tuesday -- only Barbora Krejcikova (back injury) is missing. All eyes will be on World No. 2 Iga Swiatek, who has won the Rome title three of the past four years. Here's a look at some of the leading storylines: 1 Aryna Sabalenka (31-5 in 2025): After winning the Madrid title for a third time, confidently eyeing a first title in Rome. 2 Iga Swiatek (26-8): The defending champion is looking for some inspiration after as 6-1, 6-1 semifinal loss to Coco Gauff in Madrid. 3 Coco Gauff: (19-7) Starting to click on clay after reaching the Madrid final, beating Swiatek, Mirra Andreeva and Belinda Bencic along the way. 5 Jasmine Paolini: (16-8) Italy's greatest hope in her sixth main appearance has struggled (2-5) on home turf. Best Rome result: Round of 32 in 2020 6 Madison Keys: (23-5) Making her 11th main-draw appearance. Best Rome result: Finalist 2016, losing to Serena Williams. 7 Mirra Andreeva: (24-6) Semifinalist last year at Roland Garros, looking for a similar breakthrough in Rome. Best Rome result: Round of 128 in 2024. 8 Zheng Qinwen: (9-7) Only 2-2 on clay so far this year, hoping for a renaissance in Rome. 9 Emma Navarro: (15-10) Lost second match in Madrid to Donna Vekic. Best Rome result: Round of 64 in 2024. 10 Paula Badosa: (12-7) Withdrew from Madrid with chronic back injury, will again be a game-time decision in Rome. Naomi Osaka vs. wild card Sara Errani Naomi Osaka comes into Rome with some serious momentum after capturing the L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo title in France. It was the first career clay-court title for Osaka, a wild card who defeated Kaja Juvan of Slovenia 6-1, 7-5 in the final. Osaka's ranking rose six spots this past week to No. She went 5-0 for the week, her first clay matches since last summer Olympic Games in Paris, when she lost in the first round to Angelique Kerber. It was her first title at any level since collecting her fourth Grand Slam singles crown five years ago at the Australian Open. Kinda ironic to win my first trophy back on the surface that I thought was my worst. That's one of my favorite things about life though, there's always room to grow and evolve. Thanks to everyone accompanying me on this journey, I know it's turbulent but it's also really fun and‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/oR5OY5pTJN Three players are using their personal ranking to join the main draw: Petra Kvitova, Bianca Andreescu and Anastasija Sevastova. Kvitova plays Irina-Camelia Begu, always dangerous on clay. Andreescu gets 20-year-old Italian wildcard Federica Urgesi, while Sevastova meets another Italian, Lucia Bronzetti. Sevastova wasn't sure she'd walk unaided again. Conchita Martinez, Gabriela Sabatini and Serena Williams are the next with four each. Martinez is the only player male or female to win on four consecutive occasions, between 1993 and 1996. Victoria Azarenka's 28 are the most of any active player. She won the title three times after turning 30. Only three women have won the titles in Madrid and Rome in the same season -- Dinara Safina (2009), Serena Williams (2013) and Iga Swiatek (2024), and all did it as World No. Aryna Sabalenka has the opportunity to match them. Only a few weeks ago, 17-year-old Tyra Caterina Grant -- one of the most promising young players in the world -- was playing under the United States colors, but here in Rome she's representing Italy. She received a wild card and many will be watching her first-round match against a qualifier to be named later. Grant was born in Rome to an American father and Italian mother and grew up near Milan and trained at the Piatti Academy where Jannik Sinner learned his craft. Grant spent time in Florida at the USTA national campus as well. Grant has won three junior Grand Slam doubles titles and reached the singles semifinals at last year's French Open. The move has been anticipated for several weeks. Play is Monday and Tuesday and will deliver a dozen players to the main draw. She announced her retirement last year at Roland Garros but returns to action, opposite No.</p>

On the men's side, you don't have Roger, Rafa, and Novak [Djokovic] every single week either.‚Äù The margin for error is so much smaller,‚Äù Keys said. ‚ÄúIf both players are playing well, the match could come down to just two points.‚Äù Novak Djokovic has struggled during the 2025 season (Getty Images) ‚ÄúPlayers are getting fitter and staying healthy longer,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThat's why we're seeing so many close, competitive matches.‚Äù It marked a return to the sport's biggest stage nearly eight years after her first major final appearance at the 2017 US Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tseng played really good tennis to make it through qualifying but Passaro's home court advantage might well be the difference maker in such a close matchup. Altmaier won a long five setter when the pair faced at the Australian Open this year, but both of these players play their best stuff on clay so this should be a considerably higher quality match. Comesana has been playing at a really good level on clay this year and could well get revenge on Altmaier for the loss in Australia. Virtanen played some good tennis to make it through qualifying and he definitely has the ability to cause problems to Medjedovic here, but the latter is the better and more talented player overall and should have the edge here, even if it should be quite a close encounter. Norrie is very far from the level that saw him reach the Top 10, win a Masters 1000, and reach a Slam semifinal, but he's still a tough player to beat and on clay he should have the edge in this particular matchup, as O'Connell's best results have all come on faster surfaces. While Norrie likely isn't a threat to go far, he should pull through here. The WTA Italian Open rolls on, and while several of yesterday's picks have paid out, there are still matches to play. WTA Rome continues first-round action on Day 2 as former World No. 1 Naomi Osaka gets her campaign underway against Italian Sara Errani. Day 2 of WTA action in Rome will see  Victoria Azarenka, hoping to better her 2013 runner-up finish, but first she has to get past</p>
