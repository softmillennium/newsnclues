The retail investor says he's got a new target in ETHZilla Corporation, a digital asset treasury that was previously doing business as biotech firm 180 Life Sciences. The stock was up 24% on Monday, adding to gains after a big rally in Friday's session. Many companies have pivoted to digital asset treasuries in 2025, seeing it as a quick way to boost share price growth in a booming crypto market. For some investors, the trend has been concerning, and recent research estimates that retail investors have lost $17 billion chasing the bitcoin treasury trend this year. Semenikhin sees ETHZilla as the best play among crypto treasury stocks right now. Like Beyond Meat, it caught his eye because of what he saw as a misunderstood event that negatively impacted share prices. Semenikhin had based his bullish thesis on Beyond Meat stock around the fact that he thought investors had misunderstood the company's attempt to reduce its debt through a convertible note exchange. He said in his post that he purchased 2% of the company's shares at a 50% discount from their net asset value, unpacking his case for the stock on X. This adds up to roughly $62 per share in liquid assets on its balance sheet. [The] business earns 10-12m in net profit per quarter from these." He said that when investors look at ETHZilla's balance sheet, they are seeing its profits from its time as a biotech company, not a crypto treasury. However, he expects the next earnings report, scheduled for November 13, to be a significant catalyst, as it could reveal that the pivot to ethereum has been profitable.</p>

The big stories in media right now are all about technology and capital — algorithms and balance sheets: What will AI do to the industry? But on Monday, we have a reminder that human beings who make things are still at the core of media. And that some of them still have enough power to reshape the industry on their own. It's pretty hard to overstate how big a deal Sheridan is: He's a one-man hit factory for both Red and Blue America, whose shows mix melodrama, violence, and sex alongside lectures about society losing its way. "Yellowstone" alone has generated a reported $2.9 billion in revenue. Sheridan's importance wasn't lost on new Paramount owner David Ellison, who signaled internally and publicly that keeping Sheridan was a priority. And given that Ellison has been making a point of spending freely to keep and recruit other franchises — $1.5 billion to stay in business with the "South Park" creators; $7.7 billion to land the UFC; a fortune for The Duffer Brothers, the guys who make "Stranger Things" for Netflix — you'd assume Ellison would do whatever it took to keep Sheridan working for him. Puck's Matt Belloni, who broke the news, says Sheridan will get a big pay bump from Comcast. But he would have gotten one from Paramount, too. And while Belloni reports that "money wasn't the big factor here," there isn't a lot of detail about what Comcast was offering — and what Paramount refused to do — in order to make the deal. Ellison knows better than most that Hollywood fortunes rise and fall based on who you're in business with. Ask Warner Bros., which lost director Christopher Nolan after Jason Kilar's 2020 HBO Max experiment — the "everything streams" pivot that enraged some talent and drove Nolan to Comcast, where he made "Oppenheimer." That one generated a ton of Oscars, nearly $1 billion in ticket sales, and cemented Nolan as one of the very few directors who can bring audiences to theaters. The studio's on a surprising hot streak, powered by filmmakers who aren't Nolan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. has formed a $1 billion partnership with Advanced Micro Devices to construct two supercomputers that will tackle large scientific problems ranging from nuclear power to cancer treatments to national security, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and AMD CEO Lisa Su told Reuters. The U.S. is building the two machines to ensure the country has enough supercomputers to run increasingly complex experiments that require harnessing enormous amounts of data-crunching capability. Energy Secretary Wright said the systems would "supercharge" advances in nuclear power and fusion energy, technologies for defense and national security, and the development of drugs. Scientists and companies are trying to replicate fusion, the reaction that fuels the sun, by jamming light atoms in a plasma gas under intense heat and pressure to release massive amounts of energy. "We've made great progress, but plasmas are unstable, and we need to recreate the center of the sun on Earth," Wright told Reuters. "We're going to get just massively faster progress using the computation from these AI systems that I believe will have practical pathways to harness fusion energy in the next two or three years." Wright said the supercomputers would also help manage the U.S. arsenal of nuclear weapons and accelerate drug discovery by simulating ways to treat cancer down to the molecular level. "My hope is in the next five or eight years, we will turn most cancers, many of which today are ultimate death sentences, into manageable conditions," Wright said. It will be based around AMD's MI355X artificial intelligence chips, and the design will also include central processors (CPUs) and networking chips made by AMD. The system is co-developed by AMD, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). AMD's Su said the Lux deployment was the fastest deployment of this size of computer that she has seen. "This is the speed and agility that we wanted to [do] this for the U.S. AI efforts," Su said. ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer said the Lux supercomputer will deliver about three times the AI capacity of current supercomputers. The second, more advanced computer called Discovery will be based around AMD's MI430 series of AI chips that are tuned for high-performance computing. This system will be designed by ORNL, HPE and AMD. Streiffer said he expected enormous gains but couldn't predict how much greater computational capability it would have. The MI430 is a special variant of its MI400 series that combines important features of traditional supercomputing chips along with the features to run AI applications, Su said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this year, the department had stopped cancelling the debt of borrowers in those two plans, citing a court order. Loan cancellation opportunities have become rarer under the Trump administration. While President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. Department of Education made regular announcements that it was wiping away hundreds of thousands of borrowers' debts. More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Some 2.5 million borrowers are enrolled in either ICR or PAYE, according to an estimate by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The agreement may allow more of those borrowers to qualify for forgiveness. President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" will phase out ICR and PAYE as of July 1, 2028. The Education Department has agreed to resume the relief only while ICR and PAYE remain in effect. Here's what borrowers need to know about the resumed loan forgiveness under ICR and PAYE. Both ICR and PAYE are income-driven repayment plans, meaning they cap a borrower's bills at a share of their discretionary income and lead to loan forgiveness after a certain period; ICR after 25 years and PAYE after 20 years. Student loan borrowers also have access to forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. When the Education Department curtailed forgiveness under ICR and PAYE earlier this year, officials said they were responding to a February court order that blocked a Biden administration-era repayment plan, known as the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, or SAVE. The officials said that the ruling had implications for other repayment plans, although ICR and PAYE have both been available for over a decade. In its March lawsuit, the AFT accused Trump officials of blocking borrowers from the relief programs mandated in their loan terms. Before the AFT and Education Department reached their agreement, student loan borrowers who had accumulated enough credit to get forgiveness under ICR or PAYE would have needed to transfer to IBR to get their loans discharged, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. "They can remain in these plans and realize forgiveness." Borrowers who want to cancel a submitted request to switch into IBR can try calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID, Kantrowitz said. Once PAYE and ICR are phased out, borrowers in those plans who haven't yet become eligible for debt erasure will need to switch to a repayment plan that still offers loan cancellation. Borrowers should keep records of the payments they have made, to make sure they don't lose any qualifying months. Loans taken out after that date will void eligibility for IBR. Due to recent legislation, borrowers after that date will be able to enroll in only a new income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan," or RAP, or a revised Standard Plan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors. The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers. Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models. Qualcomm's data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm's smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs. "We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level," Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week. Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate. The industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services. Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data. The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks. Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm's data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU. "What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, 'I'm going to mix and match,'" Malladi said. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm's customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power. Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

In a letter to shareholders sent on Monday, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said that Tesla was at a "critical inflection point," adding that failing to pass the compensation package could lead to Musk stepping away and Tesla losing "significant value." The proposed pay package, which is set to be put to a shareholder vote at Tesla's annual meeting next week, was unveiled last month after Musk's previous compensation plan was struck down by a Delaware judge. Proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis both recently issued guidance advising shareholders to vote against the package, prompting Musk to criticize them as "corporate terrorists" during Tesla's earnings call last week. "I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis," Musk said. In the letter to shareholders, Denholm said that Musk may "give up his executive position" if Tesla fails to adequately compensate him, adding that this could cause Tesla to lose value as a "transformative force" in the fields of AI and robotics. "While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential," Denholm wrote. The compensation plan would also see Musk's stake in Tesla rise from 13% to nearly 29%. Musk has frequently said he wants more control over Tesla as the company expands its Optimus humanoid robotics program, and Denholm told CNBC in a Monday interview that growing his stake was the Tesla CEO's primary concern.</p>

Some of them are spending big in an effort to stop him from becoming mayor of New York City. After failing to defeat the Democratic socialist state assemblyman's campaign during the June primary, several big-name billionaires have continued to pour money into outside groups aimed at stopping Mamdani and boosting his main rival, former Gov. Those groups include Fix the City, a pro-Cuomo group that's raised $7.3 million since the primary, along with Defend NYC, an anti-Mamdani group that's raised almost $2.5 million. Polling has shown Mamdani leading Cuomo, along with the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, dropped his third-party bid in September and endorsed Cuomo on Thursday. Despite Mamdani's outreach to the business community, many of the city's business titans have remained supportive of Cuomo and spoken out against many of Mamdani's progressive policies. Joe Gebbia, a cofounder of Airbnb, has spent a total of $2 million on the race, including $1 million apiece to Fix the City and Defend NYC. He has repeatedly signaled his opposition to Mamdani on X, writing in one recent post that Sliwa could be a "hero" by dropping out of the race and giving Cuomo an easier shot at beating Mamdani. Gebbia is worth $7.9 billion, according to Forbes. Ackman has been a vocal opponent of Mamdani, and like Gebbia, has publicly encouraged Sliwa to drop out of the race. Mamdani has singled out Ackman on the stump, naming him as among the billionaires who are opposed to his candidacy. He has also mocked the hedge fund manager for his "1000-word tweets." Mamdani has publicly named Lauder, along with Ackman, when decrying the influence of billionaires. "Billionaires like Bill Ackman and Ronald Lauder have poured millions of dollars into this race because they say that we pose an existential threat," Mamdani said at a rally last week. We are an existential threat to billionaires who think their money can buy our democracy." Lauder is worth $4.9 billion, according to Forbes. Lauder is worth $1.7 billion, according to Forbes. Steve Wynn, a casino mogul and real estate developer, gave $500,000 to Fix the City in October. He is worth $3.9 billion, according to Forbes. Daniel Loeb, the founder and CEO of New York-based firm Third Point, has given a total of $350,000 since the primary — $100,000 to Defend NYC and $250,000 to Fix the City. He is worth $3.8 billion, according to Forbes. Alice Walton, a billionaire philanthropist and a member of the family that founded Walmart, gave $100,000 to Fix the City in August. She previously gave $100,000 to that same group in April, before the primary. Laurie Tisch, a billionaire philanthropist, gave $100,000 to Fix the City in October. Laurie Tisch is worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. The family as a whole is worth an estimated $10.1 billion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's automakers UAZ and AvtoVAZ are stepping up plans to enter Africa's fast-growing car market, pursuing local assembly initiatives aimed at competing with dominant Asian manufacturers and tapping into the continent's push to build domestic vehicle production capacity. Following the successful shipment of tractors to Ethiopia, Russian automakers UAZ and AvtoVAZ are now exploring local assembly opportunities as part of a broader effort to deepen Russia-Ethiopia economic ties and tap into Africa's emerging shift toward homegrown vehicle production. He noted that both sides aim to deepen cooperation across multiple sectors through a more active Intergovernmental Commission. Meanwhile, Ambassador Evgeny Terekhin told TASS that Russian automakers UAZ and AvtoVAZ are advancing discussions to enter Ethiopia's automotive market. He described the sector as a key area for future bilateral economic collaboration. In a statement posted on social media, Ambassador Evgeny Terekhin said: The move by Russian automakers comes as multiple African countries push to expand domestic vehicle manufacturing instead of depending heavily on imported cars, particularly used vehicles, which still dominate the market due to affordability challenges. Indian giants like Tata Motors and Mahindra have also strengthened operations, moving toward more advanced local production. This shift aligns with Africa's broader ambition to retain more value in supply chains while preparing for the future of mobility. Russia's interest through UAZ and AvtoVAZ adds a new competitive layer. Their potential entry into local assembly could diversify the market further and pressure policymakers to sustain reforms that favor new-vehicle production over continued reliance on used-car imports.

Russia's policymakers are so fixated on inflation that they are missing the bigger picture, one of the country's most powerful bankers said last week. We won't be able to solve social problems or anything else," German Gref, the CEO of Sberbank, told Russia's State Council on Demographic and Family Policy on Thursday. "All economic growth depends on two factors: labor productivity and the number of people employed," said Gref, who was Russia's economy minister from 2000 to 2007. Gref's comments came before Russia's central bank cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 16.5% on Friday. Business leaders have been pushing back against the central bank's tight monetary policy, arguing that sky-high borrowing costs are choking lending and investment. Gref projected that Russia's GDP growth rate over the next two years would hover between 1% and 1.5%, and that this year's growth could slump to just 0.8% — sharply lower than Russia's 4.3% GDP expansion recorded last year. Earlier this month, a top Russian business leader warned that the country's economy has slowed to a pace that could jeopardize its ability to cover surging defense, security, and social costs. Russia is facing a deepening demographic crisis, with a looming labor shortage that could reach nearly 11 million workers by 2030, Anton Kotyakov, Russia's labor minister, said in July. Russia has leaned on foreign workers, mainly from Central Asia, to fill labor gaps, but Gref said the country is "engaging in negative selection." "We mostly attract very low-skilled labor, while we ourselves are losing highly qualified specialists," he said, urging Moscow to actively attract skilled professionals from abroad and offer incentives for foreign graduates to stay in Russia. Russia's demographic squeeze is already distorting its economy, keeping unemployment low at around 2.1% and fueling inflationary pressure through rapid wage growth. Employers are increasingly hiring retirees and teenagers to plug staffing gaps in an economy distorted by wartime spending. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made population growth a national priority, calling it a matter of "ethnic survival" and urging women to have as many as eight children.</p>

China's EV market is saturated with way too many car company founders who are deadlocked in a brutal battle for market share, says China analyst Dan Wang. Wang published his first book, "Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future," in August. "Brutal competition has produced many of China's successes, for example, in solar and electric vehicles. It is also a reason for many of these industries to have low profits," he added. Wang wrote in "Breakneck" that government support was a key reason Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi ventured into the automotive business. "This sort of expansion is driven both by the fiercely competitive market environments and by government subsidies that make it easier for companies to try their hand at making new products," he wrote. "They allow companies to unleash a flood of undifferentiated products, ruthlessly underbid each other, and pray their competitors run out of money before they do," he added. BYD said in its earnings report that "short-term profitability" had been pulled down by "excessive marketing" and discounting. In May, BYD said it was slashing prices on 22 electric and hybrid models until the end of June. "Competition in China is cutthroat, and it's hard for that situation to change," Wang told Business Insider. Last year, the US's Center for Strategic & International Studies said in a report that China's government had spent at least $230 billion since 2009 supporting local EV champions such as BYD. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told the "Everything Electric" podcast in an episode that aired in September that China's EVs are cheaper because of the country's generous subsidies and lower labor costs. "There's not something magical when you take it apart that's allowing these really impressive cost structures," Scaringe said. "There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.' But not everybody has said that China's EV market will remain as hotly contested in the years to come. In December, Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng told his staff that the auto industry would experience an "elimination round" from 2025 to 2027, per an internal letter obtained by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
