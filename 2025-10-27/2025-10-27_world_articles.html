The Biden administration dismissed and publicly contradicted an internal finding by a longtime military policeman that Israeli soldiers intentionally shot at and killed prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in 2022, the former official has said in his first public interview. Gabavics concluded that it would have been “the most absurd thing in the world” for the shooting to have been accidental, and that “we had everything there” to show that it was intentional. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. Which wouldn't have happened,” he told the Times. This conclusion was based on numerous factors, he said, including Israeli military communications showing that soldiers were aware that journalists were in the region that day; the fact that a sniper in an Israeli military vehicle had a clear line of sight to Abu Akleh that morning; and that the team did a simulation of where Abu Akleh and the soldier were at the time of the shooting, and a blue “Press” vest was clearly visible to where the shooter was positioned. It said the office found “no reason to believe” it was anything other than “the result of tragic circumstances.” This echoed Israel's own findings that Abu Akleh was accidentally hit by Israeli gunfire. Gabavics said the State Department's statement “flabbergasted” him and his colleagues. Very little of that goes to the Palestinians,” he said. Gabavics had previously spoken out about the probe's conclusions in a documentary, “Who Killed Shireen?”, by Zeteo, but had remained anonymous at the time. Abu Akleh was a well known journalist who was reporting on an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank when Israeli forces shot and killed her. Facing pressure, the Biden administration opened an FBI probe into her killing in 2022, but it was never released.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Javier Milei's surprise triumph in Argentina's midterm elections – after Trump bailed him out with 40bn of them – suggests there may be some truth to that assertion. “If he doesn't win, we're gone,” Trump declared when Argentina's shaggy-haired president visited him in Washington earlier this month to plead for economic help. Trump stepped in after that humiliating result, offering a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap deal and a further $20bn in support for an economy he claimed was “dying” – although the US president indicated such “generosity” would evaporate if Milei failed to win big on Sunday. Milei's opponents accused Trump of flagrantly meddling in Argentina's electoral process with his explicit message to voters. But on Sunday night there was scant sign of voter reprisals over Trump's intervention. If anything, some suspected the gambit might have paid off by swaying voters' minds. Diego Guelar, an Argentinian politician and former ambassador to China and the US, voiced unease at how Trump had warned voters “they had to vote for his friend [Milei] or he would abandon them”. He threw a lifeline to somebody who was drowning at just the right moment.” Milei's libertarian party, La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances), captured nearly 41% of the vote – considerably higher than expected after a miserable spell of corruption scandals and growing economic crisis – compared with his Peronist rivals' 32%. Argentina's bonds, stocks and currency, the peso, surged on Monday as Milei celebrated what he called a vindication of his two-year-old “shock therapy” crusade. “But the way politics works, Trump will get credit for this,” Winter predicted. Trump's unexpectedly intense focus on Latin America – which also includes the highly controversial naval buildup off Venezuela's coast, accusing Mexico's leaders of narco ties, threatening to forcibly “take back” the Panama canal, and slapping 50% tariffs on Brazil – may not, beyond Milei's movement, be winning him many friends in the region. But Winter believed it was, for better or worse, influencing people: “He has helped cajole the Mexicans into a more active approach on security and migration. He appears to have backtracked on a failing strategy in Brazil – and now both sides are talking about a significant deal on rare earths, critical minerals and potentially other areas.” Above all for Milei, now Trump's best regional friend, who used X to thank his North American underwriter as the scale of Sunday's victory became clear.</p>

One entry detailed the “Bill Clinton Scandal,” explaining the former president's extramarital affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. “During Biden's administration, a U.S. Secret Service agent discovered a small, zippered plastic bag containing cocaine in the West Wing entrance lobby,” the entry read. “Speculation has pointed to Hunter Biden, an admitted drug user.” Hunter Biden has reportedly been sober since 2019, and there is no evidence to suggest the drugs were his. The page also made Islamophobic claims regarding former President Barack Obama, alleging he had met members of the Muslim Brotherhood at the White House, a group that some Republicans have pushed to designate a foreign terrorist organization. In fact, Obama had met with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, for diplomatic reasons, at the United Nations General Assembly in 2012, not at the White House. Morsi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and several Republican lawmakers, including allies of Trump, met with him and other members of the organization around the same time Obama did. That entry also included a photograph of Obama wearing a turban, with the White House falsely labeling the image as a “Muslim Brotherhood Visit.” It was actually an image of Obama visiting Kenya in 2006, and had nothing to do with the Muslim Brotherhood. Among the donors are digital behemoths like Google and Meta, weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin, tobacco company Altria Group, and media companies like Comcast. “Now, they're writing checks to Trump for his $300 million ballroom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US.. President Donald Trump meets with Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office on Oct. 7. It looks like the Canadian side was caught flat-footed with U.S. President Donald Trump's blow-ups last week – terminating the trade talks and then suddenly adding new 10-per-cent duties. Then on Monday Mr. Trump said he did not even want to see Prime Minister Mark Carney. “I'm not going to be meeting with him for a long time,” Mr. Trump said. So, where should the Carney team go from here? For starters, it is now pretty clear, if it has not been already, that free trade with the United States is dead. Mr. Trump will not remove Section 232 tariffs on Canadian vehicles, steel and aluminum. He will also show no mercy on energy, potash, lumber products and other sectors currently being investigated under Section 232. The situation looks dire for Canada, even with possible carve-outs for some exports compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Canada can never decouple from the U.S. as its largest export market. The policy hoped to change that overdependence – while also lessening American political influence – by developing new economic and trade arrangements with other countries. It is opportune to renew Third Option thinking. At the end of the day, of course, trade agreements are government-to-government frameworks to set stable and predictable rules for cross-border business. Regrettably, Canadian companies have failed to fully utilize the business advantages of these market opening deals. Relatively speaking, our trade deal has not resulted in Canada selling heavily into South Korea, but rather the other way around. Same with the Indo-Pacific region, where Canada ran a trade imbalance of $78-billion in 2023 with its trade agreement partners under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Likewise with the European Union, where Canada had a 2024 trade deficit of some $33-billion in spite of the Canada-EU free trade deal. Why conclude these deals if business doesn't follow through? Carney tries to reassure Canadians after Trump threatens 10% tariff hike We need to consider how other countries do things. Take Germany, which has institutional structures for permanent business-government co-ordination on international trade through semi-public institutions such as the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Japan, another trading giant, likewise has a system of tight co-operation through powerful business federations with permanent structures. Canada, by contrast, only has loose, unstructured arrangements that are entirely ad hoc, reflecting domestic politics and the predilections of the trade or industry ministers at any given time. While Canada's industry associations do a commendable job within this impermanent system, there is a total absence of anything like systematic co-ordination. Even if adopting formalized structures might be a leap too far, Canada still needs a much more sophisticated, strategically focused system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House. “I'd be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a trade war truce with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute. Some have suggested that one way around this prohibition would be for Trump to stand as vice-president, while another candidate stood for president but then resigned, letting Trump as the No 2 step up and again assume the presidency. Opponents have disputed whether this would be legal. When pressed by a reporter whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said: “Am I not ruling it out? He added: “All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they [the Democrats] don't.” Referring to JD Vance and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, Trump also said they were great people who could run for the office. “I think if they ever formed a group, it'd be unstoppable,” he said. In the interview at the weekend, the former US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump last November, said she was not done with politics and strongly suggested that she was considering another run for president and did not rule out running in 2028. Meanwhile, Trump is making his longest journey abroad since taking office in January and is scheduled to attend the Apec and Asean trade summits. He announced a flurry of deals on trade and critical minerals with four south-east Asian countries during the first stop in Malaysia and is set to meet Xi in South Korea on Thursday. “I've got a lot of respect for President Xi and I think we're going to come away with a deal,” Trump said before landing in Tokyo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There has been no progress on the next round of talks between Moscow and Kiev, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told reporters. "I can refer to what [Kremlin Spokesman] Dmitry Peskov said on the subject: Ukraine is not responding to our initiatives, avoiding dialogue. Nothing has changed," the senior diplomat pointed out in response to a TASS question. On July 23, the Turkish city of Istanbul hosted the third round of Russia-Ukraine talks on resolving the conflict. Prior to an expanded meeting, the heads of the two countries' delegations, Vladimir Medinsky and Rustem Umerov, held a bilateral meeting. The expanded talks lasted about 40 minutes, with the parties discussing the positions they had set out in draft memorandums. At the meeting, the parties agreed to exchange civilians along with service members. Russia invited Ukraine to set up three online working groups to address political, military and humanitarian issues. In addition, Moscow offered to transfer the bodies of another 3,000 Ukrainian troops to Kiev and resume short humanitarian pauses on the frontline in order to collect the wounded and the dead. A decision on the fourth round of talks will be made after the new agreements are implemented, Medinsky said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ten people went on trial in Paris Monday accused of the online harassment of French first lady Brigitte Macron, after they spread what prosecutors called “malicious comments” about the gender and sexuality of President Emmanuel Macron's wife. The trial comes three months after Macron and his wife filed a 22-count defamation lawsuit in the US state of Delaware against right-wing podcaster Candace Owens over the claim that Brigitte Macron could be a man. The French case relates to a legal complaint filed by the first lady's lawyer in August 2024 alleging cyberbullying, which led to two waves of arrests in February and March of 2025. Initial investigations identified several claims about Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality, as well as describing the age difference between her and the president as “pedophilia,” the prosecutor said. The trial is expected to last two days, and a verdict is likely to be issued later. CNN affiliate BFMTV provided details on one of the defendants: 41-year-old advertising executive Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, who uses the pseudonym “Zoé Sagan” on social media. His X account, which has since been suspended, has been the subject of several complaints and is often linked to conspiracy theorists. In March, the conservative commentator revived a conspiracy theory in a YouTube video entitled “Is France's First Lady a Man?” according to the complaint. Promoted widely on X, Owens said the conspiracy theory was “likely the biggest scandal in political history.” Since then, Owens has produced numerous videos about Brigitte Macron for her nearly 4.5 million YouTube subscribers, including a multi-part series called “Becoming Brigitte.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,342 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. An operation by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) has killed the son of a Russian general in Zaporizhia Oblast, the agency said on Oct. 27. Lieutenant Vasily Marzoev was killed by a glide bomb after drone operators in his unit were spotted in the village of Plavni, HUR said in a post on Telegram, adding he was also at the position at the time of the strike. Russia has killed 661 Ukrainian children and injured 2,203 others during the full-scale invasion, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Ruslan Kravchenko said on Oct. 27. Moscow's forces have also destroyed or damaged more than 4500 schools, kindergartens and 1294 hospitals, he added, as well as kidnapping and deporting more than 19,000, and committing sexual violence in at least 23 different cases. 1261 defines the six most serious crimes against children during war. And all six,  Russia does them every day, here, in front of the world," Kravchenko said in a post on social media. The numbers do not include the full totals committed in Ukrainian territories still occupied by Russia and the real numbers are almost certainly far higher. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law formally withdrawing from the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement with the U.S., according to a decree published on Oct. 27. The 2000 agreement obligated both countries to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium — enough for thousands of nuclear warheads — no longer required for defense purposes. Following the end of the Cold War, both Russia and the U.S. dismantled thousands of warheads, leaving costly stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium and raising proliferation risks. Under the deal, the plutonium was to be processed into fuel for civilian nuclear power plants. "It is not so easy during a war, but it would be great to set up a capacity for at least final assembly and tests and maybe part production in Ukraine," Saab Chief Executive Micael Johansson said. Sweden and Ukraine on Oct. 22 signed a letter of intent for a future contract on the purchase of up to 150 modern Gripen E fighter jets to bolster the Ukrainian Air Force. The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is a light 4.5-generation fighter jet that can be used for both defensive and offensive tasks. Kyiv and Stockholm have repeatedly discussed the possibility of supplying the aircraft to Ukraine's Air Force, which already operates Western planes, including the Mirage 2000 and F-16. A state order for domestic Flamingo cruise missiles will be fully fulfilled by the end of 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 26 in an interview with TSN.Zelensky said Ukraine faced technological challenges in missile production and delays in partner financing, adding that these issues are now being resolved. Ukraine has secured its own funding to pay for production and will soon receive "a certain number of them," according to the president. A Ukrainian strike on a dam near Belgorod, Russia, has caused water to begin flowing uncontrollably, reportedly cutting off Russian units that had crossed the Siverskyi Donets River near the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine's 16th Army Corps said on Oct. 26. So the units that managed to cross the Siverskyi Donets have effectively been cut off from their main forces," it said. "So we're expecting the (POW) exchange pool to be replenished," it added, referring to the potential for capturing Russian troops. A large-scale overnight drone attack on Oct. 27 targeted multiple regions of western Russia, including the Moscow metropolitan area, according to Russian officials. Photos published by eyewitnesses and geolocated by the Russian Telegram channel Astra show smoke rising in the Kommunarka area, part of Moscow's Novomoskovsky Administrative Okrug. The Russian Defense Ministry later said that a total of 193 drones were intercepted overnight, including 40 over Moscow Oblast. In Kursk Oblast, a fire broke out near a power substation in the city of Rylsk after what local authorities claimed was a Ukrainian drone strike. At least six people have been killed and 66 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 27. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 66 out of the 100 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Twenty-six drone strikes were recorded at nine locations. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, killing two people and injuring 44 others, including two boys, aged 13 and 15, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Other Russian drone attacks injured a 44-year-old woman in the Sumy community and a 36-year-old man in the Bilopillia community. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed, and another was injured in the town of Druzhkivka. Russian strikes also killed a person in the city of Kostiantynivka and injured two people in the Lyman community, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A Russian attack against the Huliaipole community killed a person, while another one suffered injuries. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 24-year-old man was injured in an attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks injured one person over the past day, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Russia has lost around 1,136,890 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 27. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,293 tanks, 23,480 armored fighting vehicles, 65,655 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,036 artillery systems, 1,527 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,230 air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 74,946 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Africa's electric vehicle (EV) market is accelerating rapidly — projected to reach $4.2 billion by 2030, more than double its current value, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence. Yet most EVs still depend on grid electricity, which often comes from a mix of renewable and fossil fuel sources. Bako Motors, a Tunisian startup, is looking to jump on the EV trend, while tapping into one of Africa's greatest natural resources — sunshine. Its compact cars and cargo vans have solar panels on their roofs. So far, the company has made just 100 vehicles but it plans to scale up and increase exports over the coming year. The company, founded in 2021, began making three-wheeled cargo vehicles, but has since moved to four-wheeled models. The B-Van, which can carry 400 kilograms (882 pounds) of cargo and has a 100 to 300-kilometer (62 to 186 mile) range, is designed for logistics and last-mile delivery, with prices starting at 24,990 Tunisian dinar ($8,500). It's tailored toward daily, in-city trips and starts at 18,264 Tunisian dinar ($6,200). Khaled Habaieb, COO of Bako Motors, tells CNN it is also designing a third model, the X-Van, which will fit two passengers and have a larger cargo area. This helps to provide much-needed local jobs, Habaieb adds. Globally, startups like US-based Aptera Motors are developing cars with solar panels. Bako Motors is looking to fill a gap in the African market, while maintaining affordability. “It's a really good concept because it helps to extend the range of your EV,” says Bob Wesonga, operations and research associate for Africa E-Mobility Alliance, a think tank. “Among the biggest inhibitors of EV adoption has been range anxiety. If you can tell a person that while the battery itself will give you 250 kilometers (155 miles) of full charge, solar can extend that by another 50 (31 miles), it gives them the confidence to choose EV.” Solar and batteries could help Egypt beat its blackouts “Different African countries have different modes of transport,” he says, citing how in South Africa, four-wheel passenger vehicles lead, whereas in Kenya, motorbikes are king. This means that there is room in the market for many players, especially if local manufacturing allows companies to tackle local infrastructure problems such as road quality with their designs. Currently Bako Motors is small, but it recently started building a second, larger factory in Tunisia, expected to open toward the end of 2026, and aims to manufacture up to 8,000 vehicles per year for Africa, the Middle East and Europe. “The addressable market in Africa is about 1 million vehicles per year,” says Siala.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics say Timothy Mellon's donation is illegal and would only cover salaries of 1.3 service members for less than a day Timothy Mellon, a banking heir who spent tens of millions on Donald Trump's election campaign last year, was responsible for the sizeable donation, which is designed to help keep the army afloat. Mr Trump has turned to unorthodox means to keep paying troops, immigration and others amid the government shutdown, which is now on its third week amid gridlock in Congress between Republicans and Democrats. Although he has pledged to maintain the salaries of troops, on Sunday a senior member of government warned funds would run out within weeks. On Friday, the Pentagon said it had accepted $130m under its “general gift acceptance authority” to “offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits”. Mr Trump has publicly refused to reveal the donor's identity, instead praising him as a patriot and “great American citizen”. Speaking shortly before leaving the White House for a tour of Asia, Mr Trump lauded the anonymous donor as a “great gentleman”. “In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned. However, critics believe Mr Mellon's reported donation was illegal, violating a 19th-century law, and note the sum would have covered the salaries of America's 1.3 million active service members for less than a day. The 83-year-old last year gave $50m to a campaign group supporting Mr Trump's White House bid, one of the largest single donations ever recorded. “I don't have to say why,” he told The New York Times. Federal employees who break the law can face suspension or removal from office, in addition to fines or imprisonment. Republicans and Democrats have been at loggerheads since failing to pass a funding bill in September, prompting the government to shutdown, shut non-essential agencies and furlough most of federal employees. On Sunday, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, admitted that funding for soldiers' pay would run out in under four weeks if the shutdown continues. So far, Mr Trump has been relying on some $8bn in the Pentagon's unspent research and development funds to maintain salaries. On Friday, Senate Democrats blocked a bill which would have guaranteed pay for those who are still on duty, including soldiers, air traffic controllers, immigration agents and park rangers. “We will not give Donald Trump a license to play politics with people's livelihoods.</p>

Ukraine's Commander of Unmanned Systems Forces, Colonel Robert Brovdi, call sign "Madyar"), confirmed on Oct. 26 that the strike on the dam was carried out by Ukrainian forces. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov acknowledged that the risk of further flooding and damage remains due to potential repeat strikes. If that happens, there will be a threat of flooding along the floodplain on the Kharkiv side, as well as in several streets of our local settlements, home to around 1,000 people," he said on Oct. 25.

While Ukraine also lacks Western-supplied weapons, soldiers and commanders say shortages of basics — cars, drones and people — make holding back Russia extremely difficult. Even as Kyiv seeks U.S. approval for Tomahawks, they say critical, rudimentary gear is the more pressing need.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are climbing toward more records on Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 258 points, or 0.5%, as of 11:45 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.6% higher. All are adding to their latest all-time highs set on Friday. Stocks also rallied in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the heads of the United States and China. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's “a framework” for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, “We feel good” about working things out with China. That's just one of many things that will need to go right this week in order for the U.S. stock market's tremendous, record-breaking rally to continue. The S&P 500 has shot up a stunning 37.6% since hitting a low in April, when worries about Trump's tariffs on China and other countries were at their peak. Besides hopes for easing trade tensions, the rally has also been built on expectations for several more things to happen. One is that the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates in order to give the slowing job market a boost. The Fed's next announcement on interest rates is due on Wednesday, and the nearly unanimous expectation among traders is that it will cut the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point at a second straight meeting. It's not a certainty though, because the Fed has also warned it may have to change course if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level. That's because low interest rates can make inflation worse. Besides low interest rates, another expectation that's propped up stock prices is the forecast that U.S. companies will continue to deliver solid growth in profits. Keurig Dr Pepper climbed 7.1% Monday after reporting profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts' expectations. The company behind the Canada Dry and Green Mountain coffee brands said it benefited from higher prices for K-Cup products, among other things Worries have been climbing that AI may be in the midst of a bubble, similar to the dot-com bonanza that ended up bursting in 2000. Announcements of mergers and buyouts also helped move stocks on Monday. Cadence Bank rose 3.6% after Huntington Banchsares said it would buy the bank with locations across Texas and the South for $7.4 billion in stock. Avidity Biosciences leaped 42.5% after Novartis agreed to buy the biopharmaceutical company based in San Diego for $12 billion, after Avidity spins off its early-stage precision cardiology programs. Takaichi favors raising spending on defense, and that has boosted prices of stocks in major defense contractors, such as Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which jumped 9% Monday. The metal's price has stalled after it nearly touched $4,400 per ounce last week, when it set its latest record. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. RICHARD FONTAINE is CEO of the Center for a New American Security. Washington Is Driving the BRICS to Become an Anti-American Bloc That might make the BRICS seem like an inherently anti-Western group. It was, after all, founded in part by Beijing and Moscow. But for most of its 16-year history, the BRICS has not positioned itself in opposition to the United States and its allies. Washington has built a strong trade relationship with Brazil, for instance, and cooperates with India and Indonesia on matters of defense. But much of that picture now appears to be changing. Over the past decade, China and Russia have ramped up their efforts to steer their fellow BRICS members toward a worldview contrary to Washington's interests. Russia has been selling massive amounts of oil to India. And both China and Russia have courted South Africa as a partner in resisting what Russian President Vladimir Putin has described as the “colonialism” of the U.S.-led order. Meanwhile, the United States has strained its relations with friendly BRICS members. In September, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said that the U.S.-Brazilian relationship was at its “darkest point in two centuries.” And ties with South Africa are the most tenuous they've been since the end of apartheid in 1994. But in each instance, the Trump administration has made relations significantly worse than they should be, and for reasons hard to square with U.S. national interests. Democrats and Republicans had, until this year, agreed that a better U.S.-Indian relationship was worth building. The benefits were obvious to policymakers regardless of their party affiliation. India, they realized, could help balance Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific. With the fastest-growing major economy, India also offered substantial economic dividends to American investors. Bipartisan efforts to improve relations resulted in a series of major, concrete achievements. During his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump became close with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Biden administration built on this cooperation by launching a technology partnership that expanded defense industrial ties between the United States and India. He antagonized New Delhi by repeatedly insisting that he had ended the May 2025 clash between India and Pakistan in Kashmir—a claim New Delhi rejects—and by hosting the Pakistani army chief of staff at the White House in June. He also slapped 50 percent tariffs on India, including a 25 percent hike as punishment for buying Russian oil, and threatened to tack on an extra ten percent tariff to any countries that align with the “anti-American policies” of the BRICS. In August, New Delhi and Moscow agreed to expand bilateral trade ties. In September, Modi made his first visit to China in seven years to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where he held hands with both Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But successive U.S. administrations also saw value in cooperation with Brasília. The two countries have worked with each other on security and counternarcotics for decades and have struck multiple agreements that link their defense technology companies. During his first administration, Trump forged close personal ties with then President Jair Bolsonaro, and Washington designated Brazil a major non-NATO ally. Then, as with India, Trump's return to power set relations on a downward trajectory. In July of this year, the Trump administration raised tariffs on Brazil to 50 percent, citing a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. He also used the Global Magnitsky Act, a law meant to punish foreign functionaries for human rights violations, to sanction Brazilian officials involved in Bolsonaro's trial—including a supreme court justice and his spouse. Pretoria purports to be a champion of human rights but tends to condemn the injustices of the United States and its allies while ignoring those committed by China or Russia. But when Russia invaded Ukraine, South Africa repeatedly abstained from United Nations votes on the war—rankling officials in Washington. And in 2023, the U.S. ambassador in Pretoria charged South Africa with letting a Russian ship subject to U.S. sanctions, the Lady R, pick up weapons at a South African naval base. In 2024, a bill was even introduced in the U.S. Congress to review the United States's relationship with South Africa, signaling broad frustration with Pretoria among American policymakers. Yet the U.S.–South African relationship has deteriorated further since Trump again became president. He accused South Africa of waging genocide against white farmers, a claim rejected by most observers, and created a priority refugee track for Afrikaners, even as he suspended the resettlement of refugees from elsewhere. In March, his administration expelled South Africa's ambassador from the United States for claiming that Trump's political movement is driven by a “white supremacist instinct.” In May, Trump played a video for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that alleged violence against white farmers and handed him a stack of articles that he said described the “death, death, horrible death” of white South Africans. In August, Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on the country. The United States does have legitimate grievances with Brazil, India, and South Africa. New Delhi has historically maintained a protectionist trade policy, with an average tariff rate of 12 percent, and it started buying Russian oil in large quantities after the invasion of Ukraine to take advantage of the discounted price caused by sanctions. Brazil maintains that both Russia and Ukraine share equal responsibility for the war, has made efforts to reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar, criticizes Washington for sanctioning Venezuela, and openly seeks “a new geopolitics” that is less dominated by the United States. South African policymakers speak of liberation from an unjust, Western-imposed global order while maintaining close ties with Beijing, Moscow, and even Hamas. But it is profoundly unwise for Washington to push these swing states away. But if Washington continues to antagonize these countries, it could drive them away. But if the former faction takes hold, American power will suffer. If the BRICS collectively invests more in alternative institutions, including its New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement, existing U.S.- and European-led financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, might lose their influence. China and Russia will also gain more opportunities to expand their spheres of influence in the global South, putting U.S. interests in these regions at greater risk. It could team up with Brazil, for instance, to diversify its semiconductor supply chains and offset Chinese influence in Latin America. And if Washington signed a trade deal with Pretoria, American officials might entice South Africa to work with the United States on its diplomatic efforts across the African continent. All three countries have access to critical minerals that could help the United States diversify away from adversary suppliers. Ironically, the Trump administration is, in some ways, unusually well positioned to rebuild these relationships. No American president in memory has been less constrained by existing policy or more willing to change tack. For instance, his administration went from warmly embracing India to denouncing it nearly overnight. And in the past few months, Trump cannot seem to decide whether Russia or Ukraine will prevail in their conflict, alternating where he applies pressure. But even if the United States makes strides with Brazil, India, and South Africa, some damage will remain. India is a case in point: it took decades for Washington and New Delhi to overcome their mutual distrust from the Cold War, when India was close with the Soviet Union, and the United States had a partnership with Pakistan. If Washington fails to even mildly improve relations with Brazil, India, and South Africa, Beijing and Moscow will toast their good luck.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's former Prime Minister and current Chairman of the Association of Lawyers of Russia, Sergey Stepashin, has expressed confidence that adversaries are unlikely to risk deploying American Tomahawk cruise missiles for deep strikes into Russia. "I am certain that Tomahawks will not penetrate deep into Russian territory," Stepashin stated, citing the strategic posture of Russia's leadership. "Listen to what our president, Vladimir Putin, has emphasized. We also possess the Burevestnik missile." While he acknowledged that further work remains before the missile is ready for combat deployment, he affirmed that the primary objectives have been achieved. In March 2018, President Putin revealed during his address to the Federal Assembly that Russia had developed a compact nuclear power unit designed for use in cruise missiles, granting them an unprecedented range. He described the missile as low-flying, stealthy, with an unpredictable flight path, and armed with a nuclear warhead. The missile was named Burevestnik through a nationwide vote on the Russian Defense Ministry's website - marking the first time in Russian history that a weapon's name was chosen by popular vote, previously determined solely by military authorities. The Russian Ministry of Defense emphasizes that the creation of such advanced strategic weapons aims to bolster Russia's defense capabilities and deter any potential aggression against the nation and its allies. The Pentagon has acknowledged that the Burevestnik missile possesses the capacity to deliver strikes from virtually any direction, thanks to its extensive range and autonomous operation.</p>
