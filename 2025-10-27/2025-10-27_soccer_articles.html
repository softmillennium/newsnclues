                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USWNT midfielder scored a brace in a 3-1 over Portugal on Sunday (26 October) to add to her growing reputation in football. Earlier this month, Olivia Moultrie scored her first-ever professional football brace. Exactly 20 days later, she repeated the feat for her nation. ‚ÄúI think the U.S. has been known for a long time for starting fast and I think we definitely want to continue that,‚Äù she told U.S. Soccer at full-time. I really felt connected with my teammates tonight in all ways, and I feel like that is what allowed us to finish strong.‚Äù Such drive and determination come from one thing‚Äîthe desire to be considered one of, if not the, best player in the world. The Olympic Winter Games are just a TICKET away! üèÇ‚ùÑÔ∏èüéø Sign-up for reminders of ticket releases and all the latest news of your favourite national Olympic teams and athletes trying to qualify! Born into a sporting family, becoming an athlete felt more like a rite of passage than anything else for Moultrie. Encouraged by those around her, turning pro was a matter of when rather than if, despite being so young. The California native has always desired to be better than all those before. ‚ÄúI want to be considered the best player in the world, that is what I'm striving for,‚Äù she explained in an interview with SoccerBible. Does that mean winning with my club and country? A self-proclaimed ‚Äòtype-A personality', Moultrie will not rest until the goals laid out have been checked off her list. ‚ÄúI wasn't planning on being a role model‚Ä¶ for me, I just want kids to chase their dreams,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúMy one piece of advice is to set goals. Decide on the things that you want to be better at and create a plan for how to get there. It's a motto Moultrie lives by, which makes sense given that the midfielder's footballing hero is Lionel Messi. There is one aspect of his game in particular that Moultrie is modelling her own technique around: free kicks. ‚ÄúI wanted to add another thing that made me dangerous.‚Äù With her sights firmly set on similar greatness and a blueprint built on discipline, it may not be a question of whether or not Olivia Moultrie becomes the best in the world, but how soon she can cross it off her checklist.</p>

Boston's host committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup believes that its ability to ‚Äústage a successful month-long event next summer is in ‚Äòjeopardy'‚Äù if state legislators ‚Äúcannot meet the committee's request‚Äù for $20M in funding, according to Michael Silverman of the BOSTON GLOBE. The committee ‚Äúwants state funds for backup transportation plans, fan celebration events, and its own operations,‚Äù but negotiations over the state supplemental spending bill to date have resulted in $10M from the House and ‚Äúnothing from the Senate.‚Äù Without the state funding, the committee ‚Äúenvisions scenarios that would cast a sizable pall over the course of the seven games‚Äù next June and July at Gillette Stadium. A lack of funding would mean a ‚Äúbackup bus system could not be implemented‚Äù if one or more of the 11 commuter rail trains running on game days between South Station and Foxborough ‚Äúbreak down.‚Äù Extensive fan fest celebrations planned in the area ‚Äúcould be either drastically scaled back or eliminated.‚Äù Even if the state were to ultimately meet the committee's request for $20M, that amount still ‚Äútrails support in other host cities.‚Äù The committee ‚Äúestimates it will need‚Äù $20M from corporate sponsors for ‚Äúoperational costs and to meet FIFA-mandated stadium accommodations‚Äù (BOSTON GLOBE, 10/27).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney, right, is presented with a novelty World Cup ticket by FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries ‚Äî the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation. The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live. ‚ÄúThis second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say ‚Äòthank you' to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.‚Äù Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens. Residents of the three host countries ‚Äî the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order ‚Äî purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10. Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said. FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year's World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina ‚Äî featuring Lionel Messi ‚Äî and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month. Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer's biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AC Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri said he's hopeful to have Christian Pulisic available for a Nov. 8 match against Parma. Pulisic has been sidelined since he suffered a hamstring injury on Oct. 14 while on international duty with the U.S. men's national team. Pulisic has been a vital part of Milan's early-season success, with the club in third place and just one point back of the top of the table. The USMNT star has six goals and two assists in just eight matches this season, earning Serie A Player of the Month honors for September. Speaking ahead of Milan's match against Atalanta on Tuesday, Allegri offered a potential return date for the American attacker. We hope to have him on the bench against Parma," Allegri said. That has led to another potential conflict between the USMNT and AC Milan, which was reportedly unhappy with Pulisic's usage during the October window. According to MilanNews, Milan CEO Giorgio Furlani is in talks with U.S. Soccer, with the Rossoneri chief hoping to convince the American federation to not call Pulisic in for a pair of November friendlies. It's not clear how U.S. Soccer would take such a request if Pulisic demonstrates he is healthy before games against Paraguay on Nov. 15 and Uruguay three days later. The matches are the penultimate chance Mauricio Pochettino will have to see his side in action before he names his 2026 World Cup roster.</p>

U.S. head coach Emma Hayes sent out a very young lineup with eight changes from the first meeting with Portugal three days ago with only defenders Avery Patterson, Emily Sonnett and forward Alyssa Thompson starting both matches. Portugal had just one shot on target, and scored, making for five shots on goal over the two games and three goals, which were the first goals Portugal has ever scored on the USA. The starting XI for Hayes averaged 19.2 caps entering Sunday and featured the three youngest players in camp, all teenagers: 18-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes, 19-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton and 19-year-old defender Jordyn Bugg. They were joined by two 20-year-olds, Moultrie and Jaedyn Shaw, who are the current and former highest-scoring teenagers in NWSL history. On Thursday, it was Rose Lavelle who got things started with a goal 33 seconds into the match. This time, it was the youngster Moultrie, knocking in her third international goal 44 seconds from the opening whistle. After the lightning-fast start, Portugal answered just a few minutes later. J√©ssica Silva flicked a header into the far side netting off a Beatriz Fonseca cross from the right wing. It was the first goal conceded by Dickey in three matches after she recorded shutouts in her first two USWNT starts. Thompson nearly extended the lead for the United States in the 27th minute after some nifty footwork in a congested area, and her shot on goal caught a deflection to roll out of bounds for one of two U.S. corner kicks in the first half. Yohannes, who played effective short and long passes all night, delivered a service from the U.S. defensive half to Thompson on the left. The speedy midfielder took her defender 1v1 then crossed a low ball into the box that Portugal nearly knocked into their own goal except for goalkeeper Patr√≠cia Morais's dive to collect. In the 63rd minute, Hutton had a good look at goal from just outside the 18-yard box, but she drove her shot wide. In the 69th minute, Hayes made her first changes of the day, sending Emily Fox to replace Patterson and Emma Sears for Thompson. Coffey's first-time shot off a single bounce brought her international scoring total to five and extended the lead to 3-1. The match marked a celebratory occasion for one of Connecticut's own, USWNT legend Alyssa Naeher. One of the greatest goalkeepers in U.S. and world history was honored for her remarkable career, which includes two FIFA Women's World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal and the third-most goalkeeper caps (113), starts (110), wins (88) and shutouts in program history. Those in attendance for Naeher's pre-match retirement ceremony included her family, friends and current Chicago Stars FC teammates who flew in for the day to support their laudable goalkeeper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a weekend of very contrasting fortunes for American players in Europe, featuring giddy highs at Bournemouth and steep learning curves in the Bundesliga. It has rarely been better for Tyler Adams in England. Despite selling some of their best talent again in the summer, the south-coast club have relied on ever-smart recruitment to recalibrate and go again in their indefatigable style under manager Andoni Iraola. Now Adams, who missed the U.S.'s October international window as he and his wife expected their second child, can take double satisfaction from Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Not only did it push them up to second in the top flight, remarkably just four points behind leaders Arsenal, but he played a pivotal part in his team's second goal. Iraola will at least be pleased that Adams' quality is staying somewhat under the radar, because chances are richer clubs could start to sniff around him if he continues this form in USMNT colours this summer. For now, though, Bournemouth and Mauricio Pochettino will be glad they have a model of consistency to call upon who, at 26 years old, can keep improving. It's not been quite so upbeat for Josh Sargent at Norwich City lately. Manager Liam Manning is under pressure and the club's American majority shareholder Mark Attanasio is due to fly over to meet with the board this week. For Sargent, who created Norwich's goal in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea City, and worked unselfishly to get his side back level, it might lead to a period of introspection. Of course, with much of the season to go, anything is still possible, but he could not have predicted such a difficult start. Despite injury problems that required a groin operation, causing him to miss 14 league games, he scored 15 goals last season. He started the current campaign in rich form, with five goals in four games, but since then Norwich's results have gone downhill and the 25-year-old's form has suffered. Sargent was left out of the most recent USMNT roster and is struggling badly for goals for his country, with his last in 2019. It hasn't been a barrel of laughs for Weston McKennie in Turin either. After performing his annual trick of convincing another Juventus manager of his worth and getting back into the team, Igor Tudor was sacked on Monday after seven months in charge, with Massimo Brambilla ‚Äî who coaches the club's reserve team Juventus Next Gen in Serie C ‚Äî taking interim charge. Juventus haven't won in five Serie A games, seven in all competitions, and while McKennie was getting the chance to settle into a midfield role (he was deployed often as a wing-back last term) it remains to be seen who will replace Tudor on a permanent basis and how that will affect the 27-year-old after Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lazio. Aidan Morris' form remains strong and Middlesbrough are second in the Championship. Morris had a strong game in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Wrexham at the Riverside Stadium. But things don't always go smoothly for young players thrust into the senior set-up in one of Europe's big leagues. The 18-year-old has started his team's last three games, but Saturday was a tough lesson. ‚ÄúDefensively, we didn't do well,‚Äù manager Sandro Wagner told the club's website. ‚ÄúAgainst a team with such individual quality as Leipzig, you get punished ruthlessly for that. Today we got a real slap in the face, but that's part of our development.‚Äù Banks can only learn from what team-mate Robin Fellhauer described as a ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù game and will hopefully have the chance to bounce back when Augsburg play Bochum in the DFB-Pokal tomorrow. In the Netherlands, it was a cheerier game for Sergino Dest at PSV. He was dropped from the squad after turning up late for a pre-game meeting ahead of their Champions League win over Napoli last week. But manager Peter Bosz was willing to forgive him and restored the full-back to the team for their game at Feyenoord on Sunday. See whether McKennie and Juventus can get back to winning ways in Serie A against Udinese on Wednesday (1:30pm ET, Paramount+). Then on Saturday, Adams and Bournemouth's strong start will be tested by a trip to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. Chris Richards and Crystal Palace have been flying this term but came unstuck against table-topping Arsenal on Saturday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RANCAGUA, CHILE - SEPTEMBER 29: Detail of the match ball prior to the FIFA U-20 World Cup Chile 2025 Group E match between France and South Africa at Estadio El Teniente on September 29, 2025 in Rancagua, Chile. DALLAS - The second chance to secure single-match tickets for the World Cup begins Monday, Oct. 27, when FIFA opens its Early Ticket Draw entry period. Fans can enter the lottery to purchase single-game tickets via FIFA's ticketing portal from 11 a.m. Monday, Oct. 27, through Friday, Oct. 31, at 11 a.m. According to a FIFA release, the governing body will randomly select applicants and notify them with a "dedicated time slot" to purchase tickets. During this phase, fans can also apply to buy tickets based on a qualifying nation or for matches at a specific venue. FIFA first released hospitality packages in August, followed last month by a single-game presale exclusively for Visa cardholders. That presale drew one million applications, according to the organization. One final presale is scheduled after the FIFA World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5. Despite many calling the initial ticket prices and fees exorbitant, FIFA's use of dynamic ticket pricing in these early stages does not appear to have deterred many hopeful buyers. For instance, the least expensive ticket for the World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., starts at $2,030, with premium seats reaching as high as $6,730. FIFA added that 90% of its budget investments from 2023 through next summer's World Cup are directed back into the game to "significantly boost global football development." FIFA officials also met with Dallas Area Rapid Transit leadership during the Red River Rivalry game to see how the DART system handles special events with a surge in riders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The October international break is over, with the U.S. men's national team overcoming early deficits in a 1-1 draw with Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia. With eight months to go before we co-host the World Cup, some players (Diego Luna!) are clearly in the good graces of Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino. Rather, we're assessing which players are having trouble earning themselves playing time for Team USA under the distinguished manager and what they might be able to do about it between now and next summer. He has an FA Cup winners' medal from last season with Crystal Palace, but Poch seems to prefer Matt Freese in Team USA's net. This is despite Turner getting regular playing time once again at his old stomping grounds at the New England Revolution. While that's undeniably better than being rooted to the bench at Lyon, if he doesn't see the pitch during this winter's friendlies, he'll have to be lights-out in MLS in the spring to play his way back into contention. Or he'll have to hope that Freese and New York City FC get considerably worse. He played for Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur, which is why neutral observers felt like he'd be a mainstay when the coach got the top job with Team USA. They love him at Celtic, too, and yet Pochettino has given him sparing playing time for the Stars and Stripes. The stellar play of Chris Richards is undoubtedly a factor, yet even with Sergi√±o Dest's problems with injuries, discipline and defensive duties, CCV hasn't been able to see time on the right side of defense. He has experience playing as a right-back, too, but instead, Pochettino has been playing Tim Weah as the right wingback in his 3-4-3 formation. Now it turns out he has hurt his Achilles and will be racing just to be match-fit for the World Cup. Carter-Vickers' Celtic teammate is also hurting for playing time. It's still weird that he hasn't seen more action on the left side of Team USA's defense. Club teams are always looking to shore up their left flank, so maybe some English Premier League side (Brighton?) AC Milan has loaned the midfielder out to Atalanta, which at this point is actually a move up. The question is where he fits in Team USA's setup. The coach seems intrigued by Cristian Roldan in Team USA's engine room, too. Does he go back to playing as a forward? Maybe he plays there if Christian Pulisic can't go for the November friendlies? Fortunately, Pochettino is smarter about the X's and O's stuff than we are. We'll see what happens when Team USA faces Paraguay and Uruguay next month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boston's World Cup host committee believes its ability to stage a successful month-long event next summer is in ‚Äújeopardy‚Äù if state legislators cannot meet the committee's request for $20 million in funding. ‚ÄúWe will have to go back to the drawing board and review our plans so that transportation, volunteer plans, fan communications for international travelers, and honestly, simple things like our website that promotes not only the event but our city will be in jeopardy.‚Äù If one or more of the 11 commuter rail trains that will run game days between South Station and Foxborough break down, a lack of funding would mean a backup bus system could not be implemented. Extensive FanFest celebrations planned in Boston and around the Commonwealth could be drastically scaled back or eliminated. The committee itself could be stripped down to a baseline level of service. In talks with Governor Maura Healey's office over the past year, the host committee came down from its initial $37.5 million request before the governor and committee settled on $20 million as the lowest it could go and still be viable with its own work, plus the transportation and fan celebration components. ‚ÄúThe $10 million is something that we can potentially build upon going into 2026 later in the fiscal year, when we can revisit and see where we are from a fiscal stability standpoint ‚Äî knowing full well that we want to put on a good show for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and for the city of Boston. Senate Ways and Means chair Michael Rodrigues said the State House did deliver $5 million in World Cup funds to the Department of Transportation earlier this summer. ‚ÄúAs a longtime fan of European football, and the Portuguese national team in particular, I am very excited to see Massachusetts host the 2026 World Cup, right here in our backyard,‚Äù said Rodrigues in a statement. ‚ÄúEarlier this year, the Senate proposed and secured $5 million to help support public transit associated with World Cup travel to Foxborough. I welcome future discussions about how the Commonwealth can continue to help the event be successful and look forward to having those conversations.‚Äù Governor Healey appreciates the Legislature's consideration of her proposal.‚Äù Even if the state were to ultimately meet the committee's request for $20 million, that amount still trails support in other host cities. With Boston organizers projecting 2 million visitors who will create more than $1 billion in economic impact, 9,000 jobs created, and $100 million in revenue, O'Hanley said in a statement to the Globe that in ‚Äúgetting it right,‚Äù a fully funded committee can pull off an event that will more than pay for itself next summer and beyond. Like the other 15 North American host city committees, Boston's is nonprofit and receives no funding from FIFA, the governing body of soccer. The Boston 26 committee derives funds from three sources: federal, corporate, and state. Boston received $46.6 million from the federal government that is earmarked only for security. The committee estimates it will need $20 million from corporate sponsors for operational costs and to meet FIFA-mandated stadium accommodations that include a new underground irrigation system for a new grass field, removal of seats to meet field size requirements, and replacing (or obscuring) every piece of stadium advertising with FIFA's corporate partners. To date, besides O'Hanley, top executives from four other state-based entities ‚Äï Chris Davis of New Balance; Miceal Chamberlain, Bank of America Massachusetts; Martha Sheridan, Meet Boston; and Marcel Vernon Sr., Massachusetts Convention Center Authority ‚Äï have joined the honorary board as corporate partners. ‚ÄúWe're living day to day as we wait for these funds to come in, and it's going to be really difficult for us if the state doesn't help,‚Äù said Loynd, who is well aware the World Cup is not atop the list of concerns for the legislators. The event is expected to bring indirect revenue benefits far greater than the taxpayers' cost ‚Äï and boost the state's ability to stage future major sports events ‚Äï which Loynd believes make their fiscal calculations easier. ‚ÄúI just don't believe that this one is really so much of a difficult choice as it is a win that won't take away from really important funding requirements,‚Äù said Loynd.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>La Colombe will provide craft coffee to the U.S. Soccer community on game days. Alex Morgan, the retiring U.S. Women's National Team player and two-time World Cup champion, filmed a video during her retirement ceremony to mark the partnership launch. Chobani Ball Kids will provide on-field opportunities for young players at U.S. Soccer events. The company will also support coach development pathways and the Soccer Forward Foundation, which provides scholarship grants to youth soccer clubs nationwide. Chobani food scientists and U.S. Soccer growth experts will co-create a nutrition education tool for coaches. The resource will teach coaches how to incorporate nutrition values and lessons into their programs, and will be accessible through Soccer Forward's Resource Hub. ‚ÄúThis partnership with Chobani helps us take that impact even further by creating opportunities and investing in the next generation,‚Äù said JT Batson, CEO and General Secretary of U.S. Soccer. The partnership arrives as U.S. Soccer continues its long-term growth strategy ahead of hosting two major international competitions. For Chobani, the deal represents its largest professional sports partnership. Founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya described the collaboration as an extension of the company's mission to make nutritious food accessible while building stronger communities. ‚ÄúThis partnership with U.S. Soccer is more than just a match or drills on the pitch, it's about nourishing potential, strengthening communities, and creating a future where everyone can move, grow, and dream,‚Äù Ulukaya said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. avenged Thursday's loss behind a brace from Olivia Moultrie. It was a tale of tens on Sunday afternoon in East Hartford, Conn., with all four goals scored in the U.S. women's national team's 3-1 victory over Portugal coming in the first and last ten minutes of the match. Setting the pace was 20-year-old Olivia Moultrie, who sandwiched a brace around an equalizer from Portugal's Jessica Silva in a packed first ten minutes of play. The start was eerily reminiscent of Thursday's match: a goal from Moultrie within the first minute of play on Sunday mirrored midfielder Rose Lavelle's opener 33-seconds into the first meeting between the two teams just days prior. The U.S. avenged Thursday's loss behind a brace from Olivia Moultrie. Ryan Gareis' patience pays off for the Houston Dash.
