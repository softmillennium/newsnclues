                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Virtually nothing was known about the government payload, aside from it being a test of new technology. On Monday, High Earth Orbit Robotics (HEO) released a rare glimpse of the Xinjishu Yanzheng-7 (XJY-7) satellite, characterizing its large dish antenna and two fixed solar panels. Using a network of satellites in space, HEO was able to capture the Chinese spacecraft from different angles and create a 3D rendering of XJY-7. XJY-7 launched in December 2020 on board the inaugural flight of China's Long March 8 rocket. It was described as a new technology verification satellite developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CAST), but its exact purpose remained unknown. “Sonic booms were heard and registered by several seismic stations on Tenerife. The event clearly was a reentry of artificial space debris.” Google Earth Captures Trippy Image of Satellite Appearing 4 Times Over Texas Prior to its reentry, HEO used its network of imaging satellites to identify XJY-7 in orbit and sneak up on it for a close-up. “HEO analysed XJY-7 with high-frequency Non-Earth Imaging, building a 3D model from multiple angles and orbits,” the company wrote on X. HEO analysed XJY-7 with high-frequency Non-Earth Imaging, building a 3D model from multiple angles and orbits. China is known to keep its space technology under wraps, launching several satellites with undisclosed purposes. At the same time, satellite-on-satellite imaging technology has shown significant progress with companies like HEO and Maxar, revealing hidden details about those sneaky spacecraft. Astronomers and wildlife experts are up in arms over an unprecedented approach to maximizing solar energy generation. ESA's Swarm constellation shows the magnetic field's weak spot has expanded dramatically. America is turning a corner on EVs at the worst time. “They just really didn't think anyone would look up.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, a growing number of people have ended up hospitalized, divorced, or dead after having long, intense conversations with ChatGPT. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have expressed alarm about the phenomenon, which is sometimes referred to as AI psychosis, but until now there's been no robust data available on how widespread it might be. In a given week, OpenAI estimated that around 0.07 percent of active ChatGPT users show “possible signs of mental health emergencies related to psychosis or mania” and 0.15 percent “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” OpenAI also looked at the share of ChatGPT users who appear to be overly emotionally reliant on the chatbot “at the expense of real-world relationships, their well-being, or obligations.” It found that about 0.15 percent of active users exhibit behavior that indicates potential “heightened levels” of emotional attachment to ChatGPT weekly. The company cautions that these messages can be difficult to detect and measure given how relatively rare they are, and there could be some overlap between the three categories. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users. The company's estimates therefore suggest that every seven days, around 560,000 people may be exchanging messages with ChatGPT that indicate they are experiencing mania or psychosis. OpenAI says it worked with over 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in dozens of countries to help improve how ChatGPT responds in conversations involving serious mental health risks. If someone appears to be having delusional thoughts, the latest version of GPT-5 is designed to express empathy while avoiding affirming beliefs that don't have basis in reality. “Now, hopefully a lot more people who are struggling with these conditions or who are experiencing these very intense mental health emergencies might be able to be directed to professional help and be more likely to get this kind of help or get it earlier than they would have otherwise," Johannes Heidecke, OpenAI's safety systems lead, tells WIRED. While OpenAI appears to have succeeded in making ChatGPT safer, the data it shared has significant limitations. The company designed its own benchmarks, and it's unclear how these metrics translate into real-world outcomes. Even if the model produced better answers in the doctor evaluations, there is no way to know whether users experiencing psychosis, suicidal thoughts, or unhealthy emotional attachment will actually seek help faster or change their behavior. Many people who say ChatGPT reinforced their delusional thoughts describe spending hours at a time talking to the chatbot, often late at night. That posed a challenge for OpenAI because large language models generally have been shown to degrade in performance as conversations get longer. “We [now] see much less of this gradual decline in reliability as conversations go on longer," says Heidecke.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christopher Nolan's upcoming film, The Odyssey, is generating such buzz that major movie theaters are taking notice and getting ready. Earlier this year, Regal Cinemas announced plans to build or upgrade new IMAX theaters equipped to play the 2026 blockbuster, and today, Cinemark joined the party, announcing even further upgrades. According to Variety, “Cinemark will build three new 70mm film projection systems and four new IMAX with Laser systems in the United States. Cinemark will also upgrade its remaining 12 IMAX screens to IMAX with Laser, a 4K laser projection system developed to deliver the clearest images and best audio through proprietary technology.” Those 70mm locations will be at Cinemark Seven Bridges in Woodridge, IL; Cinemark Carefree Circle in Colorado Springs, CO; and Cinemark Tinseltown in Rochester, NY. But, by the time its July 2026 release rolls around, the number is now likely to be closer to 40. Which doesn't seem like a huge deal overall, but for film fans in those extra cities, it sure is. Plus, there are also the theaters that won't have 70mm IMAX but are upgrading their IMAX projectors, increasing the picture quality extensively. You'd think theaters would always be doing things like this. That's why this news feels more significant than usual. Theaters are looking at an upcoming movie and saying, “We need to be better for this.” It's a move that's been a long time coming, especially since, in recent years, IMAX releases of major blockbusters have pretty regularly had higher attendance numbers than normal screenings. Fans know they can wait a few weeks or months to see Sinners at home, but they'll never ever be able to see it at home on a screen the size of a building. So, people pay a premium and turn out for that. But, for Nolan, IMAX developed whole new cameras that are smaller and quieter and are now going to allow filmmakers to make even more of their films in the large-scale format. IMAX sold out several key 70mm IMAX screenings of The Odyssey back in July in an unprecedented promotional stunt. The Odyssey, which stars Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, and Robert Pattinson, opens July 17, 2026. A teaser has been playing exclusively in theaters for a few months, but expect to see one released online in December, around the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. IMAX sold select showtimes for the upcoming Christopher Nolan film starring Matt Damon and Tom Holland. The Matt Damon and Tom Holland film opens in almost exactly one year, and you might be able to get tickets soon. Playing Telemachus and working with Nolan and other A-listers sounds like one of the best things to ever happen to Holland. But, unlike Christopher Nolan's 'The Odyssey,' it won't be the entire film. Plus, Legendary's 'Street Fighter' movie has found a similarly surprising villain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pioneer Square Labs has launched more than 40 tech startups and vetted 500-plus ideas since creating its studio a decade ago in Seattle. Now it's testing whether its company-building expertise and data on successful startup formulas can be codified into software — with help from the latest AI models. PSL just unveiled Lev, a new project that aims to be an “AI co-founder” for early stage entrepreneurs. The studio decided to turn it into a product after outside founders who tested early versions wanted access for themselves. “We're mapping a lot of the PSL process into it,” said T.A. Lev's structured workflow sets it apart from generic chatbots, said Shilpa Kannan, principal at PSL. Lev joins a growing number of startups leveraging AI to act as an idea validation tool for early-stage founders, though its precise approach makes it stand out. Upcoming features will add team-building and fundraising modules and let users trigger actions — such as sending emails or buying domains — directly from within the platform. McCann envisions Lev eventually connecting to tools like Notion and HubSpot to serve as a “command center” for running a company — integrating tools, drafting investor updates, tracking competitors, and suggesting priorities. “In some ways, this is ‘Innovators Dilemma,' and you have to cannibalize yourself before someone else does it,” McCann said, referencing Clayton Christensen's concept of technology disruption. PSL also sees Lev as a potential funnel for entrepreneurs it could work with in the future. “It's scaling our knowledge in a way that we wouldn't be able to do otherwise,” McCann said. Kannan and Kevin Leneway, principal at PSL, wrote a blog post describing how PSL designed the backbone of Lev and how the firm used it to generate its own high quality startup ideas at higher volumes with lower cost. “As we see more and more individuals become founders with the support of AI, we are incredibly excited for the potential increase in velocity and successful outcomes from methodologies like ours that focus on upfront ideation and validation,” they wrote. For now, PSL is targeting venture-scale founders — people in tech companies or accelerators with ambitions to build fast-growing startups. But McCann believes Lev could eventually empower solo operators running multiple micro-businesses. Lev also offers a couple fun tools to help boost its own marketing, including a founder “personality test” and an “idea matcher” that produces startup concepts based on your interests and experience.

But first: Your subscription price is increasing and now includes 5 Agents. Are Microsoft just in to deep at this point? They killed one off their flagship brands (Office) in favour of Microsoft 365 Copilot, shouldn't someone be fired for that decision at this point?I'm looking forward to the books and articles in 10 - 20 years time, attempting to explain what happened internally at Microsoft these past years.

Even though it is still a relatively good deal for a Family Plan (compared to say Google Drive or Dropbox) for OneDrive, I finally dropped my Microsoft 365 Family plan.The final straw was that the Copilot was completely unhelpful and hallucinated features Office portal does not have. I got Microsoft's emails, did not want Microsoft's forced imposition of Copilot in my Office subscription (regardless of price), found the classic option mentioned in online forums, and managed to switch to it just before my renewal.My 89 year old aunt on the other hand got stung for the unwanted forced upgrade. I had to call Microsoft, complained about them unfairly exploiting vulnerable customers, and eventually got a downgrade and the difference refunded.What really annoys me about this - quite apart from the initial deception/misrepresentation - is I now expect Microsoft to pull similar tricks in future. A real disincentive to sign up to any other 'value-added' services.Why make subscriptions so full of traps that consumers end up hating you? (Yes, I know, so some GM can hit this quarter's bonus)That reminds me, having just cancelled Spotify (due to their price rise), Disney+ is next on the list.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Researchers at the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany, have developed a new form of an organic LED that is many times smaller than existing options - measuring just 300 x 300 nanometers, according to SciTechDaily. In the quest for lighter, more detailed, and brighter displays for augmented reality headsets and smart glasses, the most compact individual light-emitting diodes available as of 2025 are micro OLEDs. These measure just under five by five micrometers each, which is absolutely tiny compared to even the mini-LEDs that power many modern high-end TVs. But the new nanometer-scale OLEDs out of this German university and more than 10 times smaller. “With the help of a metallic contact that allows current injection into an organic light-emitting diode while simultaneously amplifying and emitting the generated light, we have created a pixel for orange light on an area measuring just 300 by 300 nanometers. This pixel is just as bright as a conventional OLED pixel with normal dimensions of 5 by 5 micrometers,” says Bert Hecht, in the study published in Science Advances. As this technology matures, it has the potential to develop ultra-compact displays for portable devices, saving on weight and power enormously, as well as new, highly-detailed displays (all the better for gaming with). At this scale, enormous pixel densities could be achieved, unlocking lifelike visuals - if you could get the processing power to render it. The researchers achieved this new feat by modifying existing OLED structures. Still, this "long" length of time only accounted for two weeks of testing, so building this proof-of-concept technology into something that is viable for real-world products and economies is a whole other ball game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're always looking for outlier founders with ideas to build generational businesses,” said Bogomil Balkansky, a partner on Sequoia's early-stage investment team. These funds were introduced after what has been a tumultuous period for the legendary firm. In 2021, Sequoia overhauled its structure into an evergreen main fund supported by strategy-specific “sub-funds,” primarily to enable the firm to retain stock in portfolio companies long after their IPO. The firm took a significant financial hit in late 2022, losing over $200 million when its investment in cryptocurrency exchange FTX blew up, followed by the 2023 separation from its India and China divisions. The storied firm, which famously backed Airbnb, Google, Nvidia, and Stripe in their infancy, is putting recent challenges behind it and returning to its core purpose: investing in promising founders at the earliest stages of creation. Even with its renowned Series A history, Balkansky made it clear that Sequoia aims to defend its legacy by investing even earlier: “We have an amazing track record and tradition to partner with companies at the very earliest stage, which today will be classified as a pre-seed.” He highlighted the firm's early conviction: Sequoia recently wrote the first check into security tester Xbow, AI reliability engineer Traversal, and DeepSeek alternative Reflection AI — all companies that have since raised significant capital at much higher valuations. Even with these recent successes, Sequoia is relentlessly focused on upholding its five-decade legacy as Silicon Valley's top investor. To ensure this mindset persists, the firm's newly renovated office features a wall where every investor handwrote this reminder: “We are only as good as our next investment.” Prior to joining TechCrunch, she wrote about VC for PitchBook and Venture Capital Journal.

We get around 140 x 180mm of build volume, but the printing platform is interchangeable, and leveling is all automatic. Precise and fast movement across the axis is made possible using linear rails, and the printer is made from off-the-shelf components. This is more for the PLA and PETG makers out there. No exotic carbon fibre or specialist engineering filaments, yet. Generative Machine CEO, Ric Real, talks about bringing advanced printing capabilities, usually found in robotics and Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM). Instead of the traditional three-axis used in almost all FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printers, such as the Bambu Labs A1, Elegoo Centauri Carbon, etc. Strength that is much weaker than the other axis. It means that prints can be re-oriented to print stronger and "allows for complex geometries to be printed without support structures and conformally, enabling improved surface finishes and part properties that can be tailored to specific use cases," according to the press release. With this, we should get improved interlayer strength through better adhesion. Controlling all of this is industry-grade software, enhanced by Aibuild to slice and fully utilize all of the axes. The software provides parametric slicing strategies, automated toolpath generation, and of course multi-axis printing optimization tailored for 5-axis printing. Details on price and availability are scarce, but a limited batch of the printers will be at the Formnext Expo and Convention from November 18 in Frankfurt, Germany.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Developers hate (bad) marketing, but they still need a way to find useful tools and services. The company monitors public forums to learn what tools devs are discussing, and then uses AI to identify which companies those commenters work with and who the decision makers there are. Onfire is now coming out of stealth with $20 million in funding, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. The startup estimates it has driven “more than $50 million in closed deals” for its clients since its beta launch 12 months ago, and says its early users include ActiveFence, Aiven, Cyera, Port, and Spectro Cloud, as well as other companies selling data, cybersecurity, FinOps, and observability solutions to technical buyers. But Grove Ventures managing partner Lotan Levkowitz frames the startup's outcomes as a win-win. The company hopes its vertical, data-centric focus will give it an edge over competitors. “What set us apart is we started as a data-first company, and then we added the AI engine on top of that,” he said. According to Levkowitz, Onfire is filling a gap that the venture firm had identified before it met the founders: software infrastructure companies aren't leveraging AI in their go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Onfire comes at a time when companies are facing challenges leveraging only product-led growth for enterprise sales. Some in the industry think a new data layer is now necessary to support GTM teams, and Grove had already come to that conclusion when it connected with Onfire, Levkowitz said. He helped Onfire connect with companies his team had met while developing that thesis. They learned that buyers could benefit from using AI-based contextual tools to “do more with less.” But CISOs, CTOs, and engineering teams, traditionally considered “tough buyers,” now have to filter out more noise than ever thanks to AI tools that enable mass outreach, and context could help salespeople here. That compounding data layer is what Onfire considers its moat to defend against CRM incumbents like Salesforce and HubSpot. “This verticalized approach enables them to have a very unique value proposition for these go-to-market teams of software infrastructure companies,” Levkowitz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sensitive personal details of more than 450 people holding “top secret” US government security clearances were left exposed online, new research seen by WIRED shows. While scanning for unsecured databases at the end of September, an ethical security researcher stumbled upon the exposed cache of data and discovered that it was part of a site called DomeWatch. It also includes a job board and résumé bank. Résumés were not included, they say, but the database contained details typical of a job application process. This is what made the finding so concerning, the researcher says, because they fear that if the data had fallen into the wrong hands—perhaps those of a hostile state or malicious hackers—it could have been used to compromise government or military staffers who have access to potentially sensitive information. “From the perspective of a foreign adversary, that is a gold mine of who you want to target,” the security researcher says. Some staff members WIRED contacted were unavailable because they have been furloughed as a result of the ongoing US government shutdown. “Today, our office was informed that an outside vendor potentially exposed information stored in an internal site,” Joy Lee, spokesperson for House Democratic whip Katherine Clark, told WIRED in a statement on October 22. DomeWatch is under the purview of Clark's office. There are many unsecured and publicly accessible databases across the internet, and the researcher says that they might not have paused to investigate the DomeWatch data had they not noticed key words involving top-secret security clearances. One entry, for example, listed a person who had “intelligence” and “US-China relations” experience. “Exposed databases are a widespread, non-partisan cybersecurity problem. Left unchecked, they enable targeted espionage, fraud, and identity abuse,” says Alexander Leslie, senior advisor for government affairs at the threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, who was not involved in the research. Among the estimated 7,000 entries, there were around 4,200 people who appeared to have experience working in Congress. The researcher says there were also some links to files or documents housed in other cloud storage systems. Recorded Future's Leslie also points out that known breaches of data related to US government employment—most notably the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack—create what he calls “long-term US national security and personnel risks.” In your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories Big Interview: We spoke to Zohran Mamdani, New York's mayoral front-runner Watch: Following your stolen data through the dark web WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI rolled out a new web browser last week called Atlas. It comes with ChatGPT built in, along with an agent, so that you can browse, get direct answers, and have automated tasks performed on your behalf all at the same time. I've spent the past several days tinkering with Atlas. I've used it to do all my normal web browsing, and also tried to take advantage of the ChatGPT functions—plus I threw some weird agentic tasks its way to see how it did with those. And my impression is that Atlas is…  fine? But my big takeaway is that it's pretty pointless for anyone not employed by OpenAI, and that Atlas is little more than cynicism masquerading as software. If you want to know why, let's start by looking at its agentic capabilities—which is really where it differentiates. When I was browsing Amazon, I asked the Atlas agent to do some shopping for me, using a pre-set prompt of its own suggestion. (“Start a cart with items I'm likely to want based on my browsing here and highlight any active promo codes. Let me review before checkout.”) It picked out a notebook that I'd recently purchased and no longer needed, some deodorant I'd recently purchased and no longer needed, and a vacuum cleaner that I'd considered but decided was too expensive and no longer needed because I bought a cheaper one. I cleaned out my cart and considered myself lucky that it didn't buy anything. When I logged onto Facebook, which is already lousy with all sorts of AI slop, I asked it to create a status update for me. So it dug through my browser history and came back with an incredibly long status I won't bore you with all of it (and there was a lot) but here are the highlights from what it suggested:  “I dipped into Smartsheet and TeamSnap (because editors juggle rosters too! you decide), and kept tabs on the news … . Somewhere in there I even remembered to log into Slack, schedule Zoom meetings, and read a few NYTimes and Technology Review pieces. Who says an editor's life isn't glamorous? There were some other equally unillustrious examples as well, but you get the picture. Notice I said “unique,” not “useful.” I struggled with finding any obvious utility by having this right there, versus just going to chatgpt dot com. In some cases, the built-in chatbot was worse and dumber. For example, I asked the built-in ChatGPT to summarize a MIT Technology Review article I was reading for me. Which is to say it spit back some useless nonsense. OpenAI is marketing Atlas pretty aggressively when you come to ChatGPT now, suggesting people download it. But without giving people more of a reason to actually switch from more entrenched browsers, like Chrome or Safari, this feels like a real empty salvo in the new browser wars. It's been hard for me to understand why Atlas exists. This review first appeared in The Debrief, Mat Honan's weekly subscriber-only newsletter. Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— Deb Hall Lefevre, the longtime tech exec who was most recently CTO at Starbucks, announced her retirement on Sunday in a LinkedIn post. Hall Lefevre resigned from Starbucks last month, according to a Sept. 26 report from Reuters, which cited a memo sent to staff about her departure. “After an incredible journey leading technology and digital transformation across some of the world's most iconic brands, including Starbucks, Circle K/Couche Tard and McDonald's, it's time to step into retirement,” Hall Lefevre said in her LinkedIn post. Hall Lefevre, who was also an executive vice president, joined Starbucks in 2022. She previously spent more than 16 years at McDonald's, where she was a corporate vice president and CIO, leading the fast food giant's technology and digital commerce strategy. She was also EVP and CTO at Circle K Stores. The business unit, based in Silicon Valley, launched in 2004 and helped develop Amazon devices such as the Kindle Fire, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and other hardware. — Nancy Mounir joined Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a vice president leading security programs and platforms. Mounir previously spent more than 12 years at Microsoft, most recently as a senior director and chief of staff overseeing the company's Secure Future Initiative. In a LinkedIn post, Mounir said she is “looking forward to a great journey of learning, innovation and growth with the Security Platform team!” She added: “Extremely grateful for my time at Microsoft and could not be more proud of what we accomplished together over the years!” Mounir initially worked at Microsoft from 2012 to 2015 in supply chain, and left to spend a year at Amazon working on advertising and accounting teams. Vaidyanathan returned to Microsoft in 2020 after two previous stints and was most recently a group product manager. “This next chapter is about helping people everywhere gain the skills and confidence to grow with AI, creating opportunity, resilience, and impact at every level,” she wrote on LinkedIn. — Jim Chi was named executive director of Oregon Startup Center, which is going through a relaunch, according to Portland Business Journal.
