Despite the Red Bull driver's charge – which was slightly interrupted amid a Virtual Safety Car phase during the closing stages – Leclerc was able to hold onto P2, marking another visit to the rostrum after his P3 result one week ago in Austin. “United States was very positive for us but we didn't know what to expect for this weekend, and to end up again on the podium is a great surprise. Very happy to be on this amazing podium once again.” My tyres were completely gone and I could see Max was coming back on the softer tyre, so it was tough. “I hated every metre of that first corner!” the eight-time race winner laughed. “There was the start, which wasn't a great one – strangely that kind of helped me because I don't think Lando would have come back to the right if I had a good start, so luckily I could have a slipstream. “But then after that I was just a passenger trying to defend my place. I think Lewis [Hamilton] didn't especially know that there was Max on the outside of me and that created… everything was super, super tight. Pushed on whether his back-to-back podiums give some extra confidence entering into those final events, Leclerc answered: “Yeah, I think we are doing a really good job at extracting every single bit out of this car.</p>

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix

Max Verstappen came home in third in Mexico, as McLaren's Lando Norris sealed a dominant victory while also taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship.

Red Bull's recent flurry of form, which has brought Max Verstappen roaring back into championship contention, came up short in Mexico.

The RB21 had nothing like the pace of Lando Norris' dominant McLaren, in sharp contrast to recent races, and Verstappen had a tough battle on his hands just to finish third, around half-a-minute behind Norris. What was it about the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit which brought the Red Bull up short?
