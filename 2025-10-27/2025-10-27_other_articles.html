                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dakota Fanning is single, but not for long according to a psychic. "My sister spoke to a psychic who said, 'Your sister is not going to meet the person she is going to marry until she's 32,'” the actress said. "She told me that a few years ago and I was, like, 32? I don't have time for that." The currently 31-year-old did reveal her dream future with a fella includes settling down on a farm and having three kids. "Oh my God, ask your single girlfriends! Every man is like: 'Must love mountain biking, and want to go on a hike, and want to be really adventurous and outdoorsy, must love dogs and want to go to the summit of Everest,'” she joked. She added, "You're like, dude, save it please." Unfortunately blind dates set up by friends haven't been successful yet either. Then you question the friendship with that person ... I'm super-happy to wait for that,” she said. Her big dream is to start a family. “Being a mother is the pinnacle to me. For whatever reason it is something in me."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In fact, if anything, we know that nothing ever goes quite right for Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles). These two lost more family members, friends, and flames than we could count, with Alona Tal's Jo Harville being one of the biggest losses of them all. But what was already a major loss for the show could have been much worse if Dean and Jo had become more of an item than they appeared to be. Yes, contrary to what some fans were hoping for, it was probably a good thing that these two never got together. For some, the idea that Dean would settle down with anyone was kind of preposterous, but for others, there wasn't a more perfect young woman for the elder Winchester to attach himself to. Even after going on a hunt with the brothers, which nearly killed her, Jo didn't back down. Ultimately, the show thought it would be best to keep these two apart, instead introducing other love interests for Dean as early as the next season. Jo and her mother Ellen (Samantha Ferris) were written off Supernatural as quickly as they arrived, but (anticipating its end after the fifth season's Apocalypse arc), eventually this mother-daughter pair returned. But when they did, the show was careful not to push Dean and Jo together, even though it had no trouble teasing us with it. While it was definitely a bummer at the time, knowing how much worse it would have been for Dean in the long run makes us grateful that Supernatural never forced the pair into becoming an official item. Considering that Dean had lost nearly everyone he ever cared about, the death of Jo could've been so much worse had they actually committed to each other in the end. Admittedly, not every character on Supernatural has that sort of self-awareness, but at that moment, the two knew it was now or never; this was it. Had Jo survived and started something more official with Dean, it would've changed the whole landscape of the show — and sullied that perfect ending for the character set up in Season 5's "Swan Song." For Jo, being a hunter was always more important than settling down. But eventually, Ellen got over it, and the pair ended up hunting together for several years before their untimely death, taking out a few hellhounds to give Sam and Dean an edge on the Devil (Mark Pellegrino). As for Dean, well, he never had any luck with love — to the point where he mostly gives up altogether by the show's end. But arguably the biggest reason that Supernatural was wise to pivot from a true-blue Dean and Jo romance was that it would have too drastically changed the show itself. What made Supernatural great in the beginning was that Sam and Dean were somewhat akin to classical Western heroes. The hunt came first, and while they were always risking life and limb for one another, adding a romantic component would've made it all the messier. Tamara is so shaken, she never returns to the show. Jo's death is already hard enough to watch with her and Dean not being together, especially since Season 7's "Defending Your Life" reveals how the elder Winchester blames himself for it. How much more so would this have affected Dean had they been an item? This isn't to say that Dean cared about Jo any less when she undertook the big sleep, just that if he had allowed himself to picture a life with her, it would have weighed as heavily on him as Jessica Moore's (Adrianne Palicki) did on Sam throughout the series. Dean had already carried enough pain, grief, and guilt throughout the show; there was no need to add anymore — especially since Supernatural would've never committed to Jo full-time. After her death, Dean moved on to his aforementioned old flame Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson), who likewise was written out before long. And that's not to mention his Season 1 love interest, Cassie Robinson (Megalyn Echikunwoke), who was the only one of these ladies to make it out unscathed — only for the show to ignore her completely for the rest of its run. But not letting Jo cave in to Dean's pursuits and clever one-liners was the best thing for him in the long run. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

Malayalam megastar Mammootty's upcoming film, Kalamkaval, is all set to hit the big screen soon.

Get JioHotstar, Zee5, Sonyliv, Fancode and 25+ OTTs for only Rs 149 per month The movie revolves around a police investigation in the quiet community of Kottayikonam that takes an unexpected turn as a series of seemingly trivial clues turns into a horrific spate of crimes. Some mysteries that remain unclear are soon uncovered by the investigation officers. The primary focus of Kalamkaval is how an odd tale is revealed through this inquiry while facing some clever tactics of barring their way quest for truth. The makers had not earlier revealed the thriller's release date, although it was anticipated to happen in October. Nevertheless, despite a teaser, there has been no update on this. Mammootty's comeback to the big screen after his health-related absence makes this film exciting for both his fans and moviegoers. It was recently revealed that the main cast of this thriller includes some well-known actors. According to reports, in this highly anticipated film, which was directed by debutante Jithin K Jose, Dulquer Salmaan is portraying a younger version of the protagonist, Cynaide Mohan, also known as Mohankumar, who is being played by his father. Mammootty and Dulquer Salmaan will both have significant roles in the upcoming Lokah franchise as well. Although it was earlier said that Mammootty is playing a negative character with Vinayakan, other members of the Kalamkaval cast include Meera Jasmine, Gibin Gopinath, Gayathri Arun, Rajisha Vijayan, and RJ Sooraj. Who is the villain in Vinayakan film, Kalamkaval? Some reports claim he is suffering from cancer, though his team has dismissed this as rumours. Industry colleagues have confirmed that he has recovered and will return to his acting commitments soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vladimir Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing, while FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich says he warned the former world champion about his actions Many chess players, led by world number one Magnus Carlsen, have linked the sudden death of U.S. grandmaster and commentator Daniel Naroditsky last Monday at age 29 to the attacks from Russian former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, who had been accusing Naroditsky of cheating since 2024. Kramnik, however, has denied the allegations he was in any way responsible for Naroditsky's death. The statement comes after Carlsen strongly criticized Kramnik's treatment of Naroditsky. The way he was going after Naroditsky was horrible," said Carlsen, who has yet to publicly apologize for his 2022 cheating accusations against another U.S. player, Hans Niemann, which ended in an out-of-court settlement. Following Naroditsky's death, Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE, which has 201 member countries), said he had warned Kramnik about his actions. Last Wednesday, Dvorkovich also released an official statement on the case: “Human life and dignity are fundamental values shared by all of us. In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people's reputation but their very well-being." Dvorkovich concluded: “Therefore, I, along with the FIDE Management Board, will formally refer all relevant public statements made by GM Vladimir Kramnik — both before and after the tragic death of GM Daniel Naroditsky — to the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for independent consideration.” Far from admitting any responsibility, Kramnik argued he had “never made any personal attack or insult towards Daniel Naroditsky.” In his statement, the Russian player said: “Despite the tensions in our relationship, I was the only person in the chess community who, noticing on video Daniel's obvious health issues a day before his death, publicly called for him to receive help.” “The subsequent attempts, immediately following his passing, to directly link this tragic event to my name-especially in light of this fact-cross all boundaries of basic human morality, in my view,” he added. Last week, Kramnik also denied any wrongdoing on X, and suggested a conspiracy may be behind Naroditsky's death. “Without a doubt, this recent tradegy should be investigated by police, there are too many huge financial interests involved to be sure about it being just an incident. I am ready to provide all information required,” he posted last Wednesday. That same day, he also shared: “Once I started to reveal in public information about the ‘dark side' of modern chess, I became a subject of the dirtiest possible orchestrated PR campaign, including several documented murder threats, in addition to continues defamation. For over a year, Naroditsky engaged with Kramnik's claims and provided any evidence he could think of — for example, scanning every detail of the room where he played online games to show that he was not cheating — in an attempt to prove his innocence. On Saturday, October 18, in his final Twitch video (now deleted), he repeatedly spoke about Kramnik while clearly showing over two and a half hours that he was not feeling well. Among the many signs that Naroditsky was deeply affected by Kramnik's accusations is a YouTube interview on October 27, 2024 (C-Squared channel), conducted by grandmasters Fabiano Caruana and Cristian Chirila, in which Naroditsky said: This is one of the most wicked people that I've ever dealt with.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition Cada uno accederá con su propia cuenta de email, lo que os permitirá personalizar vuestra experiencia en EL PAÍS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While most Americans were glued to NFL action on Sunday afternoon, Victor Wembanyama was putting together one of the best and downright ridiculous performances we could see this NBA season. Wembanyama, who doesn't turn 22 until January, is oftentimes called an "alien" given his freakishly long build and playing style that doesn't exactly mirror any of us humans. Those extraterrestrial abilities were on full display Sunday as his San Antonio Spurs played host to the Brooklyn Nets. Unstoppable, unguardable, not human, and league MVP if he stays healthy are things that come to mind after seeing that sequence. It's still incredibly early into the new NBA season, with the Spurs having only played three games, but what we're seeing out of Wemby thus far is utterly insane. The Frenchman is averaging 33 points, 13 rebounds, and six blocks per game. He scored 40 points in the Spurs' season-opening win against the Dallas Mavericks in just 30 minutes of action and followed that up with a nine-block performance against the New Orleans Pelicans two nights later. It's mindboggling to think that Wembanyama is doing these things while still very much developing and filling out his frame as a 21-year-old. Expectations were sky-high for him heading into year three in the NBA, and based on what we've seen through three games this season, it's easy to see why.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It all started with a farmhouse in Rhode Island. Demonologists and paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren — who also investigated the allegedly possessed Annabelle doll and the home from The Amityville Horror — were asked by Carolyn Perron to come help her family, which she said was besieged by spirits in their home. Set in Romania in 1952, the film centers on Father Burke (Demián Bichir) and Sister Irene (Taissa), who have been sent to a convent to investigate the deaths of two nuns, aided by a local man nicknamed “Frenchie.” One of the nuns was allegedly killed by a demon appearing as a nun, and the other died by suicide to avoid being possessed by the evil force. That nefarious entity is Valak, the same demon that appeared to Ed and Lorraine in The Conjuring 2, which takes place in 1977. Among the most famous of all paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine investigated the real-life cases of alleged hauntings and possessions that inspired The Conjuring, The Amityville Horror and Annabelle, among other films and books based on their case files. Ed was a so-called demonologist who studied hauntings and possessions, and Lorraine claimed to be a clairvoyant who used her visions to aid their investigations. "Our job is to go in, evaluate what's going on, document it, and then turn it over to church authorities," Lorraine told the Springfield Union-News in 1995. When work began on The Conjuring, Lorraine coached the cast on how to handle sensitive paranormal experiences. "One of the first things Lorraine said to me is that, from her perspective and her knowledge of the diabolical, all of that negative stuff feeds on fear. Wilson also shared a piece of Lorraine's advice on being in allegedly haunted locations. "One thing Lorraine did say to me, when I was talking about a supernatural occurrence — long story, but — about these kids and hearing kids' voices, she just very nonchalantly said, 'It's probably a child's spirit who just wants to play,' ” he told PEOPLE. “It was so off the cuff, and it actually did resonate with me: if there is something otherworldly or supernatural or unexplained, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad." In that movie, Lorraine sees visions of a demon dressed as a nun, which can block her clairvoyance. They don't know it at the time, but that demon is Valak. In reality, there's nothing to suggest that the events of the Enfield case were connected to Valak, whose depiction in The Nun is heavily fictionalized from historical depictions. However, there are two elements to The Nun that do have ties to real occurrences in the Warrens' work. In the 1970s, Ed and Lorraine investigated the Borley Rectory, a notoriously haunted place in England that had been a religious residence for centuries. When they visited, Lorraine allegedly said, "I feel the presence of a nun in this church.” They also captured a photograph that they believed depicted a spectral nun praying in the rectory's church. While talking to Esquire in 2018, the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, speculated that that case could have inspired The Nun. "Is The Nun based on that experience?" The character “Frenchie” in The Nun starts out as a good guy trying to help Father Burke and Sister Irene, but he's eventually possessed by Valak who uses him to commit murders in The Nun II. During the exorcism his head split open and we have that on film," Ed told the Springfield Union-News in 1995. Theriault killed his wife and died by suicide in 1992, and his claims of possession have been heavily scrutinized, including by his sister, who believed he was putting on the symptoms. "If it was mental illness or a fake, why did tables rise off the floor?,” Ed said in the same interview. “We put him in a hospital for six weeks and the doctors couldn't explain it." Valak appears in The Lesser Key of Solomon, a collection of centuries-old writings about demons, although he's depicted as a winged child sitting on a two-headed dragon creature. He is sometimes described as the “grand president of hell,” but there is no association in historic texts of Valak appearing as a nun. In a 2022 Instagram post, The Conjuring 2 director and The Nun producer James Wan explained the creative choice to portray Valak as a demonic nun, rather than in a form more faithful to his mythological depictions. A beautifully/hideously sculpted animatronic puppet head and practical body-suit,” he explained. “As cool as it was, it felt out of place within the Conjuring world we had built,” he continued. “And so during post production, I reconceived the villain — feeling it needed to be something more grounded, more personal, and creepier. Neither Father Burke or Sister Irene realize it at the end of the movie, but Valak evades banishment by possessing Frenchie. Valak returns for another showdown with Sister Irene in The Nun 2, set in 1956 France, where a series of murders are being attributed to a demonic entity. Lorraine suggests that the demon appears in a religious form to test her faith. At the end of The Nun II, a post-credits scene reveals that Sister Irene and Lorraine are both descended from St. Lucy, patron saint of the blind, and their second sight is an inherited trait.</p>

The Butte County Sheriff's Office reported that McKinnon, who was 39 at the time, contacted his mother from a bar on Park Avenue. Despite extensive searches, neither McKinnon nor his remains have been found, and foul play is suspected. McKinnon was reported missing on April 28, 1989, by Puccinelli, who grew concerned after not hearing from him for several months. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and a tan T-shirt. He stood 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighed 150 pounds, and had grey hair, blue eyes, and a scar from his right chest to his left hip.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A surprising spike in underwater anomalies along U.S. coastlines has sparked alarm among defence officials after a popular tracking app, Enigma, recorded thousands of sightings of so-called Unidentified Submersible Objects, or USOs. The app, which describes itself as the world's largest searchable database of UFO and UAP sightings, claims to have logged more than 30,000 unexplained events since its launch in late 2022. But while unidentified flying objects have long dominated public imagination, Enigma's latest data suggests something far stranger may be happening below the surface. The revelations have left both enthusiasts and experts speculating about what lies beneath — from advanced military technology to phenomena science has yet to explain. More than 150 of these describe objects hovering just above or plunging into the water. While UFO sightings are often dismissed as optical illusions or misidentifications, some experts say underwater versions could be far more serious. Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who previously served as acting head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, warned that these anomalies could have major implications for national security. 'The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering U.S. water space and the Department of Defense is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows,' Gallaudet said in a 2024 report. They are the aquatic counterparts of UFOs or UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena). Witnesses, from medieval sailors to modern Navy sonar operators, have described similar encounters - objects that move at extraordinary speeds, change direction instantly, or cross between sea and sky with 'transmedium' capabilities that defy the laws of physics. In 1825, naturalist Andrew Bloxam reported seeing a red, luminous orb rise from the ocean while sailing aboard HMS Blonde. Veteran Navy sonar operator Aaron Amick has said that 'fast mover' contacts occasionally appear on sonar, describing them as 'so quick that you can't measure the speed.' Gallaudet, testifying before the U.S. House Oversight Committee in late 2024, reiterated that such incidents cannot be easily dismissed. 'Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,' he said in his 29-page report for the Sol Foundation. What makes USOs so confounding is that they blur the line between natural and artificial phenomena. Some experts speculate that secret military drones or advanced underwater vehicles could account for a portion of sightings. Others insist the speeds and maneuvers reported go far beyond current human technology. As for Enigma's data, it paints a picture of persistent, widespread sightings along U.S. coasts, particularly near naval training zones and busy shipping routes. Whether coincidence or clue, it has renewed calls for deeper investigation. As Gallaudet put it, 'We know more about the surface of Mars than our own deep sea.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A popular UFO-reporting app has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways — phenomena which high-ranking US Navy officials warn could pose a threat to national security. Enigma, which touts itself as the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” claims it has received reports on over 30,000 Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena since launching in late 2022. As of August, Enigma has also logged more than 9,000 mysterious sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines or major bodies of water — 500 of them within 5 miles — with more than 150 of the reports describing objects hovering above or descending into waterways, according to Marine Technology News. The app has released maps plotting out the reported sightings, represented as clusters of orange dots running up and down the east and west coasts. UFO sightings are nothing new, and are often dismissed as crackpottery by much of the scientific community or relegated to the stuff of science fiction, but retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet warns UFOs with the ability to go from air to sea without crashing or even creating a splash could have “world-changing” ramifications. “The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” Gallaudet wrote in a March 2024 report. Alarm bells were raised in July 2019, when the USS Omaha recorded a UFO/UAP that vanished into the ocean without a trace after buzzing a Navy fleet off the coast of San Diego. Video of the incident was verified by the Pentagon, displaying capabilities Gallaudet said “jeopardizes U.S. maritime security, which is already weakened by our relative ignorance about the global ocean.” In his 29-page report for UFO-focused think tank the Sol Foundation, Gallaudet said there's a documented pattern of similar phenomena being reported. “Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,” he wrote.</p>

Conspiracy theories have become more than a harmless hobby for certain folks. They go down online rabbit holes and choose their own truths versus what's actually reality. "Bugonia" is a reflection of the times we live in. — follows Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons), a paranoid beekeeper and a package scanner for the pharmaceutical giant Auxolith, who plots to kidnap the company's CEO Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), someone who he thinks is an alien hellbent on destroying Earth. Jesse Plemons stars as Teddy in director Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia, a Focus Features release. Fuller is an Elizabeth Holmes-type boss — robotic-sounding to her staff, always wearing the same white blouse and black jacket as seen in several magazine covers and framed photos, obsessed with wellness. Teddy is a leader in his own right, too. He's a one-man "human resistance" as he calls himself, two if you count his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), serving as a loyal henchman of sorts. Don expresses his concerns about getting caught, to which Teddy assures him, "No one on Earth gives a single f--- about us." Disguising in comical Jennifer Aniston paper masks they find at a store, Teddy and Don carry out the mission and abduct Fuller (who puts up a good fight, briefly) outside her home and take her back to his house in the middle of nowhere. Teddy orders Don to shave an unconscious Fuller's hair. Emma Stone stars as Michelle Fuller in director Yorgos Lanthimos' "Bugonia," a Focus Features release. As Fuller is chained in the basement, the normally unkempt Teddy and Don dress up in suits as they are in the presence of a high-ranking alien official. Teddy demands Fuller take them to her mothership, accusing her of killing his family, co-workers and the bees. Fuller humorously maintains her business-like composure, telling Teddy, "I hear where you're coming from, but I respectfully disagree." The high-powered honcho also warns him that the police will track them down, saying her abduction is like that of a governor, "but worse." Aidan Delbis as Don and Jesse Plemons as Teddy in director Yorgos Lanthimos' "Bugonia," a Focus Features release. The dynamic between Teddy and Don is a compelling one. He promises Don people will think he's a hero if they carry out their plan, yet Don is the voice of reason as he expresses quiet skepticism towards Teddy's warped reality. "Bugonia" marks Stone's fourth collaboration with Lanthimos — she won her second Oscar for 2023's "Poor Things." Per usual, she is superb in the role of Michelle Fuller, the out-of-touch executive who subtly modifies her strategy in hopes of escaping captivity. Emma Stone stars as Michelle Fuller in director Yorgos Lanthimos' "Bugonia," a Focus Features release. However, the film really belongs to her co-star. An Oscar nominee himself, Plemons has appeared in more than half a dozen Best Picture nominated-films in the past decade, but audiences may recognize him best from his stint on "Breaking Bad." Here, Plemons gives his greatest performance as a deeply disturbed man in pursuit of what he thinks is a noble mission. Lanthimos has become one of my favorite contemporary filmmakers. His films are a breath of fresh air, carving out his own lane that very few can. English composer Jerskin Fendrix delivers a score that hits you like a tidal wave when you least expect it. "Bugonia" is a twisted satire that captures the delusional grip of conspiracy culture in today's discourse. Gritty, thrilling, and darkly funny, Lanthimos' latest may not be his crowning achievement, but it's another strong entry in his filmography — and proof he's one of the most visionary directors working today. "Bugonia" is rated R for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Joseph A. Wulfsohn is a media reporter for Fox News Digital.
